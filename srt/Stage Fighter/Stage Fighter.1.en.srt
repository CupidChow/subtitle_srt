1
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,820
(Stage Fighter)

2
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,329
One movement. One facial expression.

3
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,899
One breath. And one finger gesture.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,699
Dancers express with their bodies.

5
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,109
Dance is a visual art,

6
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,478
so I believe that you must be born...

7
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,479
with the right length of your neck, size of your face,

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,350
length of your limbs, and height.

9
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,108
If your body looks beautiful,

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,678
just a stretch of your arm can get you the win.

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,689
I believe that physique is absolute in dance.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,759
It's such an unfair type of art.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,658
People tend to look away...

14
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,359
when the dancer is chubby or short.

15
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,398
I think he's chubbier than others.

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,329
If only he had lost about 3kg...

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,100
You don't even get an opportunity if you're not qualified.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,969
It's unfair.

19
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,370
I realized that my existence itself deducted points.

20
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,810
I was devastated.

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,818
(The world of dancers is cruel and harsh, and one despairs...)

22
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,319
(over the limitations of their natural physique.)

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,189
That was all I had in my mind.

24
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,719
"You think I can't make it?"

25
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,328
A dancer is supposed to...

26
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,700
overcome the limits of their body with their body.

27
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,628
Being the crazy one is my last resort.

28
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,938
Being crazy about dance.

29
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,738
Even when I'm out of my breath,

30
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,609
I must keep trying since it can't kill me.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,810
He has flat feet.

32
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,810
He should be bad at dancing, but he's good.

33
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,079
He must have overcome it with his hard work.

34
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,180
It's not so easy to overcome that.

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,849
Isn't this a miracle?

36
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,819
He surprised me today.

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,059
Maybe, it's unfair in the beginning,

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,358
but I believe it's the dancer's job...

39
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,290
to level the playing field.

40
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,730
You must fiercely complete your dance...

41
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,400
to survive in this battle.

42
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,068
A brutal dance battle unfolds,

43
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,139
where male dancers fight with nothing but their bare bodies.

44
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,939
This is Stage Fighter.

45
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,080
There are strict classes in Stage Fighter,

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,449
and all these dancers must fight...

47
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,990
to be recognized for their skills.

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,319
Under.

49
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,059
No class is lower than Under.

50
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,129
This is a nightmare.

51
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,689
I didn't know I deserved this class.

52
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,159
It feels like a nail on my chest.

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,930
I felt small.

54
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,430
I feel like a total loser.

55
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,800
I had hit rock bottom.

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,210
I'm definitely going up from Under.

57
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,210
I'm going to go up with my grit.

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,310
Second.

59
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,478
They're coming up from below,

60
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,080
and they're blocking us from above.

61
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,979
The Second class is the fiercest.

62
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,050
Who cares about who's senior here?

63
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,620
That wasn't an irreplaceable dance.

64
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,060
I'm better than him.

65
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,090
How dare he talk about dance?

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,629
Who cares?

67
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,859
It's too horrible to imagine being degraded.

68
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,060
I should take his First Class.

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,770
I'm going to beat them all.

70
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,968
Only the dancer...

71
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:18,800
who wins against himself and everyone else...

72
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,270
may stand at the top.

73
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,469
First.

74
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,050
This is the grace of First.

75
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,879
We're top-tier within this program.

76
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm sure that you won't be so offended...

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,490
by the fact that I'm above you.

78
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,259
I'm in the First Class.

79
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,990
So that means I can either keep my place...

80
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,659
or go down.

81
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,659
But I don't think I'll let them take away my First spot.

82
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,099
Never.

83
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:52,000
The three genres participating in this class war are...

84
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,400
contemporary dance,

85
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,539
ballet,

86
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,139
and Korean dance.

87
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,349
A dance that pursues freedom, performed barefoot onstage.

88
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,349
A dance that embraces gravity and flows with the ground.

89
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:11,319
Contemporary dance.

90
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,859
There's no correct answer in contemporary dance.

91
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,258
It's a genre...

92
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,060
where individual uniqueness stands out even more.

93
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,800
It's a language that's infinitely free.

94
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,410
Ballet.

95
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,970
A dance that defies gravity,

96
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,480
pushing off the ground...

97
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,139
to soar even higher into the sky.

98
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,550
I reckon that ballet is an art of beauty.

99
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,850
There is a correct answer to it.

100
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:44,519
Your jumps must be high,

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,459
and you must meet the physical conditions.

102
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:49,360
It's one of the cruellest genres.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,629
A dance of graceful lines and breath, full of elegant curves.

104
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,740
Korean dance.

105
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,739
In Korean dance, each dancer has...

106
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,769
their own distinct rhythm and breath.

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,410
The atmosphere and aura that emerge from their rhythm.

108
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,009
It's a genre that can show a variety of colours...

109
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,349
while being rooted in the essence of the Korean sentiment.

110
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,789
(An elegant dance filled with the spirit and rhythm of Korea,)

111
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,420
(Korean dance)

112
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,629
The best dancer to survive in this class war...

113
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,129
will be given a chance to join a global dance company.

114
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,199
Once you join, you will go on a world tour...

115
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,000
and become a star dancer.

116
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,209
I present you the Dance Company of Stage Fighter.

117
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,239
This is a place that will help...

118
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,939
the dancers get into their peak conditions...

119
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,750
by building the best physique.

120
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,249
Okay. Keep going.

121
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,220
- Up. - One, two...

122
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,490
This dance studio will be filled with their passion and sweat...

123
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,758
- for the perfect dance performance. - Five,

124
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,628
six, seven, eight, and one, two...

125
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:02,870
Whose sweat will be remembered as the best one?

126
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,638
The dancers of three different genres...

127
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,740
must prove themselves and soar higher...

128
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,110
only with their bodies.

129
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,379
That's why our first audition...

130
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,480
will begin with a story about bodies.

131
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,680
Physical and Technique Audition.

132
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,019
How well they manage their physique,

133
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,920
and how technically they use that physique,

134
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,560
are fundamental virtues for all dancers.

135
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,258
The audition will proceed in groups,

136
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,100
chosen by the dancers themselves.

137
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:38,399
In the end, only one person who survives to the very last...

138
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,240
will claim the title of the First Class.

139
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,839
We need to see whose physique is better.

140
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,778
He has a good physique,

141
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,879
- but he can't seem to use it well. - Not yet.

142
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,119
Physique, technique,

143
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,648
energy, and basic skills are the most important.

144
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,550
(You must have all the abilities as a dancer to survive.)

145
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,560
He's got an excellent physique.

146
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,560
Jump. There's a trick.

147
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,588
- They're wild. - Yes.

148
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,000
They've got great technique.

149
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,600
(The first act of a class war to aim for a higher class)

150
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,870
Gosh.

151
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,500
- Isn't it suffocating? - So suffocating.

152
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,778
A class war of dance among male dancers,

153
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,779
Stage Fighter.

154
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,379
The first class war, Physical and Technique Audition,

155
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,079
begins now.

156
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,250
First position.

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,449
Music, start.

158
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,109
(Stage Fighter)

159
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,579
(STF Dance Company in Gangnam)

160
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,620
(Which genres are entering STF Dance Company?)

161
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,319
(A room of red lockers for ballet dancers)

162
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,259
(There are makeup products for men as well.)

163
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,129
(Who's the first dancer to enter the Ballet Locker Room?)

164
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,029
- I think this is it. - I guess so.

165
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,230
Yes.

166
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,429
(Two ballet dancers who seem acquainted enter.)

167
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,269
- What's this? - No way.

168
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,338
It's like a locker room for basketball players.

169
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,040
I guess it's only for ballet dancers.

170
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,469
(Their profiles are displayed.)

171
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,540
What's this?

172
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,138
"The face of Korea National University of Arts."

173
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,208
"Ballerino Prince."

174
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,779
Do you think I'm the face of my school?

175
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,009
Everyone agrees that you're the best-looking one at school.

176
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,278
Hello. I currently go to Korea National University of Arts.

177
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,649
I'm a 25-year-old ballet dancer, Shin Min Kwon.

178
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,320
It's been about nine years since I started dancing.

179
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,589
I won the Gold Prize at a competition,

180
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,329
held by the Korea Ballet Association two years in a row.

181
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,558
I won the grand award at Sejong Dance Competition...

182
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,559
two years in a row.

183
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,029
I think that Min Kwon is...

184
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,829
a visually beautiful dancer.

185
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,669
His legs are a work of art.

186
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,139
And he's handsome.

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,139
His arms and legs are long.

188
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,980
He's got the appearance of a prince.

189
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,449
- We're the first ones here. - Yes.

190
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,648
Gyeong Ho and I go to the same college,

191
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,649
so we're pretty close.

192
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,250
I'm a 23-year-old ballet dancer, Kang Gyeong Ho.

193
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,418
I won second place in the senior division...

194
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,158
of the Valentina Kozlova International Ballet Competition.

195
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,158
And I won second place in the senior division...

196
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,758
of the Seoul International Dance Competition.

197
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,258
I've been doing ballet for about ten years now.

198
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,859
- "Incredible immersion." - "The leading role hunter."

199
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,399
I get into character as soon as I step on that stage.

200
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,500
When I'm immersed in the performance and pour my heart out...

201
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,340
I mostly get the parts that I want.

202
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,710
What? "Physical check?"

203
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,740
- We're tied in first place. - I thought you'd get a full score.

204
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,610
I wanted to get a full score.

205
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,449
You could have gotten a higher score for your technique.

206
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,649
I have pretty good technique.

207
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,889
Ballet is insanely technical.

208
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,389
You need to stretch, turn, and jump.

209
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,460
It's a movement where you split your legs and cross them mid-air.

210
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,159
I'm confident doing the ciseaux.

211
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,429
Maybe, I should have chosen B.

212
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,940
Physical and Technique Audition, the judging groups.

213
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,210
To determine their class in Stage Fighter,

214
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:04,580
the contemporary dancers,

215
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,210
Korean dancers...

216
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
And ballerinos...

217
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,950
Will go through their first audition.

218
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,850
The Physical and Technique Audition begins now.

219
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,788
The auditions will be held in groups...

220
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,990
that you have chosen.

221
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,819
Only the last survivor will be...

222
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,689
a First Class.

223
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,830
Physical and Technique Audition.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,830
Four groups of four.

225
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:26,929
So, there are 16 people.

226
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,129
I want to compete with him.

227
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,768
- I prefer getting the whip first. - I have to watch this.

228
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,339
Okay. This should be fun!

229
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
(Which ballerino will be a First Class?)

230
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,610
- We've arrived. - Okay. Let's head in.

231
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,840
All right.

232
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,309
It's fancy.

233
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,750
(New members' profiles are displayed in the locker room.)

234
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,379
What?

235
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,820
See? It's him.

236
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,279
From the Korean National Ballet.

237
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,648
(A professional ballerino is here.)

238
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,549
There aren't too many people yet.

239
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,589
Hello, I'm a 34-year-old...

240
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,730
ballet dancer, Kim Tae Seok.

241
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,589
I've been in the Korean National Ballet for eight years now.

242
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,259
I used to be a demi-soloist.

243
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,230
All ballerinos have skills that they're confident in.

244
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,700
Mine is called double saut de basque.

245
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,200
You spin twice in the air while your body is tilted and land.

246
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,610
It's not such an easy movement.

247
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,038
I can't do the double saut de basque.

248
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,610
(It's tough for me too.)

249
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,109
(Another profile is displayed.)

250
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,209
Gosh. He's currently a member of the Universal Ballet.

251
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,549
- Is that what it says? - Yes.

252
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,419
I'm a 33-year-old ballet dancer, Kim Kyung Won.

253
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,089
I was in the Korean National Ballet for a year...

254
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,629
and in the Universal Ballet for about five years.

255
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,959
The Korean National Ballet and the Universal Ballet...

256
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,059
are the two best ballet companies...

257
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,029
in Korea.

258
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,099
He has so many techniques that he's confident in.

259
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,139
My favourite is the ciseaux.

260
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,440
Maybe it's because I'm flexible,

261
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,039
but I find it easier to do a split after I jump.

262
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,710
I am worried.

263
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,450
Yes. We should be.

264
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,219
You can't overlook one's experience.

265
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,990
You get better at techniques as the years go by.

266
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,289
Those parts got me worried.

267
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,360
- Let's cheer up. - Okay.

268
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,059
I think someone's here.

269
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,029
- Hello. - Hello.

270
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,459
(Standing up)

271
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,898
(Hello.)

272
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,129
I jumped up before I even knew it.

273
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,768
(Scanning and closing the door)

274
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:12,939
You guys are ballet dancers.

275
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,000
- Yes. - Yes.

276
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,639
(He doesn't know where to look.)

277
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,440
What's this?

278
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
(He flinches at every word.)

279
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,610
This is my favourite brand.

280
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,309
It was a lot of pressure.

281
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,320
They're big seniors, so...

282
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,750
It's a survival, and they're my competitors.

283
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,519
But I was intimidated.

284
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,589
- Can I ask you how old you are? - I'm 24.

285
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,658
- You're 24? - Yes.

286
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,389
- I'm 25. - Oh, you're 25.

287
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,629
How old are you?

288
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,230
Shush.

289
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,870
I feel like their uncle.

290
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,699
(Holding his laughter)

291
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,740
Shouldn't we call him our senior?

292
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,939
(From an uncle to a senior)

293
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,469
- Or "brother?" - That sounds better.

294
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,279
"Senior" sounds a bit...

295
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,678
- Let's call each other brothers. - Brothers.

296
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,879
(I like that.)

297
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,480
You both look like good jumpers.

298
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,950
- I'm not. - I'm not.

299
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,148
I've been in peak condition these days.

300
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,219
(Flustered)

301
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,089
(He makes a declaration, and the air gets tense.)

302
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,629
I hate losing. I'm very competitive.

303
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,230
I think the younger ones should be worried.

304
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,200
I was wondering which group he chose.

305
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,870
I want to compete with him.

306
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,399
- You want to go with him? - Yes.

307
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,239
I like Group A.

308
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,268
Please don't put it next to mine.

309
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,070
(Gyeong Ho chose Group A.)

310
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,139
Oh, my name's up there.

311
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,279
(The name tags are in 1 line.)

312
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,008
(Gyeong Ho, Tae Seok, Min Kwon, Kyung Won)

313
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,980
- We're all in different groups. - We are.

314
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,548
I was glad that we were in different groups.

315
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,019
(The next dancers will be competitors in the same group.)

316
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,219
(The next ballerino's profile, is revealed.)

317
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,360
Who is it?

318
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,259
He has 2.5 years of experience?

319
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,129
He is a joint winner for the physical score.

320
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,399
He is a joint winner with you.

321
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,799
He is.

322
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,229
He must be a genius.

323
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,268
(The genius arrives at the Judging Groups Register.)

324
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,398
Who is it?

325
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,409
I am Ballerino Moon Jun On.

326
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,239
When I was in my first year in high school,

327
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,709
I learned ballet for the first time.

328
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,808
I had the honour of getting a certificate...

329
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,079
from Russia's Bolshoi Ballet Academy and Vaganova Ballet Academy.

330
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,048
I believe technique is my strength.

331
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,018
Instead of focusing on showing my body,

332
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,019
I am specialized in techniques, and I dance powerfully.

333
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,089
I have a good physique and am good at ballet.

334
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,500
People occasionally said I was a genius.

335
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,929
(Surprised)

336
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,929
(His group is revealed.)

337
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,139
They're all in Min Kwon's group.

338
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,869
Since he hasn't done ballet for that long,

339
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,138
I don't think he'll be that good.

340
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,239
(Exclaiming)

341
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,278
Okay.

342
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,308
(He enters.)

343
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,509
Nice to meet you.

344
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:35,908
(Turning his head)

345
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:36,979
(Eyes fixed on him)

346
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,679
(Taking a seat far away)

347
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,379
"What is this?"

348
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:42,149
(Staring)

349
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,690
He kept staring at me.

350
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
It felt unnerving.

351
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,230
Why did you choose Group C?

352
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,499
Kang Gyeong Ho in Group A.

353
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,798
(Suddenly Kang Gyeong Ho?)

354
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,830
(Me?)

355
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,798
- Kang Gyeong Ho. - Yes.

356
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,239
I saw him dance, and he was incredible.

357
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,570
I didn't expect to see him here.

358
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:04,009
He is a rising star on a roll.

359
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,879
So I wanted to avoid Group A.

360
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,209
Hold on.

361
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,210
(Sucking in his breath)

362
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,980
(Glancing)

363
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,179
I was a bit annoyed.

364
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:12,950
He came to my group because of that?

365
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,820
Does he want to have a go at it with me?

366
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:19,289
I didn't really know who Shin Min Kwon was.

367
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,929
I didn't really give it much thought.

368
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,730
(Two ballerinos enter STF Dance Company, smiling brightly.)

369
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,069
Hello.

370
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,129
(The next dancer arrives at the Judging Groups Register.)

371
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,798
He is very tall.

372
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,070
Isn't it hard to do a revoltade with that height?

373
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,408
It'll look amazing if you can do a revoltade with that height.

374
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,610
It'll look very cool.

375
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,940
"Kang Daniel."

376
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,809
- They look alike. - He's handsome.

377
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,649
He does look a bit like Kang Daniel.

378
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,849
Hello. I'm a 22-year-old ballerino, Kim Sang Young,

379
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,389
studying at Hanyang University.

380
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,859
I have long arms and legs, and I have a neat dancing style.

381
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,288
There's a move called revoltade.

382
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,788
I practised it really hard,

383
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,000
so I'm most confident in it.

384
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:59,929
He is "Wink Boy."

385
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:02,200
Will he wink at us too?

386
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,538
(Singing)

387
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:05,899
And I wink.

388
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,500
Bang.

389
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,939
(He suddenly feels embarrassed.)

390
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,579
Join Group B with me.

391
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,808
Shall we join together?

392
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,579
We can compete with each other.

393
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,209
(This ballerino looks young and confident.)

394
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,879
He's the youngest, 19 years old.

395
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,549
Gosh, 19?

396
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,689
He'll jump in his sleep.

397
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,048
Hello. I am Ballerino Jeon Tae Hu,

398
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,119
nineteen years old.

399
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,289
I come from Taebaek, Gangwon Province.

400
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,460
It has fresh, clean air.

401
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,899
It is quiet and nice.

402
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,230
(But...)

403
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:36,168
To focus solely on dance, I quit middle school.

404
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,999
I came to Seoul and only thought about dancing.

405
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,799
I loved dancing so much.

406
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,408
He is most confident in grand jete.

407
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,039
He must be very flexible.

408
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,538
When I jump,

409
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,508
I tend to stay longer in the air.

410
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,449
So I'm most confident in grand jete.

411
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,619
(Grand jete: Stretching one's leg wide mid-air)

412
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,249
I hope he doesn't join Group B.

413
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,819
(I hope the young boy doesn't join Group B!)

414
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,460
- I'm thinking either Group A or B. - Really?

415
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,058
(He is 19, so he has no worries.)

416
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,658
(This is how you're going to choose?)

417
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:07,659
(Come at me, fate.)

418
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,699
I'll join Group B.

419
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,338
(He chooses without hesitation!)

420
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,868
Actually, I don't know the other dancers' names.

421
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,209
I just have a feeling I can win.

422
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,539
(Innocent)

423
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,839
I'll join Group D.

424
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,639
(Ballet Physical and Technique Audition Judging Groups)

425
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,879
He joined Group B.

426
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,009
I can't lose to him.

427
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:24,619
(Gulping)

428
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,579
- Hello. - Hello.

429
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,849
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Tae Seok.

430
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,588
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

431
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:31,788
- I am... - I'm Kim Tae Seok.

432
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,528
Ballerino Jeon Tae Hu is 15 years younger than me.

433
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,758
(The age difference between Tae Hu and Tae Seok is 15 years.)

434
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,129
The younger you are, the bolder and more fearless...

435
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,528
you become when trying out techniques.

436
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,999
I might be stuck on the ground...

437
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,839
while he jumps lightly.

438
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,410
It made me a bit worried.

439
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,569
I want to see the others too.

440
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,278
That startled me.

441
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,339
(Surprised)

442
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,609
(The next ballerino's profile is revealed.)

443
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,509
He is an elite who studied overseas.

444
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,679
He graduated with first class honours from Kirov Academy.

445
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,990
Isn't he another young and famous ballerino?

446
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,219
He was in the Joffrey Ballet.

447
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,959
A lot of legendary dancers are here.

448
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,758
(What?)

449
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,729
I knew who Kim Yu Chan was.

450
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,298
I first met him in a competition.

451
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,660
I lost to him badly.

452
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,768
That was my first meeting with Kim Yu Chan,

453
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,400
so I am worried about him even now.

454
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
(Kim Yu Chan who studied overseas...)

455
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
(and beat the rising star Kang Gyeong Ho enters.)

456
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:24,539
Hello. I'm a 23-year-old ballerino, Kim Yu Chan.

457
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,949
In the Youth America Grand Prix final in 2021,

458
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,508
I placed first in the senior group.

459
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,419
The Joffrey Ballet I was in...

460
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,989
is a famous ballet company that ranks in the top ten...

461
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,349
in the US.

462
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,659
I have very good mobility,

463
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,359
flexibility, and core strength.

464
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,730
I always dance thinking, "I am the best."

465
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,129
The quality of my dance is top-notch.

466
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,700
I am very confident in my dance.

467
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,400
If he joins Group A,

468
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,670
Group A will be on fire.

469
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,639
I don't want to be in the same group as him.

470
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,769
- Why not? - Why not?

471
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,508
- I... - He's the opposite of me...

472
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,838
in various ways.

473
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,879
In what way?

474
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,410
Yu Chan dances with attention to detail...

475
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,519
and is very flexible.

476
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,950
But my dance is powerful and masculine.

477
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:13,618
Our dancing styles are the completely opposite.

478
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,930
I need to keep him in check in that regard.

479
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,799
I'm thinking of joining Group A.

480
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,029
I saw the name "Kang Gyeong Ho."

481
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,529
It looks fun.

482
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,170
Okay. I'll go head-first into it.

483
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,868
I beat him once,

484
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,039
so I can beat him again.

485
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,880
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

486
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,440
- Hello. - Hello.

487
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,079
(Glancing)

488
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,548
(Kim Yu Chan smiles as he sees Kang Gyeong Ho.)

489
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:38,579
Hello.

490
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,519
I had all sorts of thoughts, and I was very nervous.

491
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,990
(Ta-da)

492
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,160
Group D.

493
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:48,829
He went to Group D.

494
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,499
This is the Physical and Technique Audition,

495
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,798
and I think Kang Gyeong Ho...

496
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,669
is better suited for masculine techniques than me.

497
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,269
So I decided to change my group.

498
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,039
I'll go to Group D, then.

499
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,308
I don't start fights that I know I'm going to lose.

500
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,179
I was glad to find out.

501
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,409
(Relieved)

502
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,019
(Now, the only slot left for the judging groups is Group A.)

503
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,789
I can't wait to find out who will fill up the remaining slot.

504
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,150
It might be a really famous dancer.

505
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:18,759
But everyone is already so competent.

506
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,789
It looks modern and nice.

507
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,960
(Who is the final ballerino that everyone is curious about?)

508
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,230
(The 16th and final ballerino's profile is revealed.)

509
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:29,899
(Staring intensely)

510
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,039
- He got a full score for technique. - He is in the Georgia Ballet.

511
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:35,409
That's crazy.

512
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,268
Has anyone met him?

513
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,778
- Yes, we know him. - Really?

514
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,278
(He is acquainted with the Korea National University of Arts duo.)

515
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,848
We know each other.

516
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,278
He was in his senior year when I was a freshman.

517
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,549
I respected him so much, of course.

518
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,179
He was famous.

519
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,190
He is a really skilled ballerino that everyone in our age knows.

520
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,890
Hello. I'm a 25-year-old ballerino, Jung Sung Wook.

521
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,429
I took part in the Valentina Kozlova International Ballet Competition...

522
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,699
in the US...

523
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,098
and was offered a place, so I went to the Georgia Ballet.

524
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:06,140
Generally, you can divide ballet techniques into two categories.

525
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,139
There are jumps and turns.

526
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,869
I'm confident in both jumps and turns.

527
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,239
He jumps well...

528
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,538
and performs his techniques neatly from what I can remember.

529
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,808
(Everyone acknowledges his skills.)

530
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,749
I think he is an ideal dancer.

531
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,778
First, he has the perfect body for ballet.

532
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,018
You know, the "prince" they always talk about in ballet?

533
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:26,490
Ballerino Jung Sung Wook is a typical prince.

534
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,529
There's only one slot left, but...

535
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,788
(Ballet Prince Jung Sung Wook chooses his group.)

536
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,529
If I need to compete to survive,

537
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,700
I should trample on them on the stage.

538
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:38,039
(The 16 people's Physical and Technique Audition judging groups)

539
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,369
(The prince enters.)

540
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,338
(30 eyeballs turn to look at him.)

541
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,409
(The room suddenly becomes silent.)

542
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,480
(Covering his mouth)

543
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,009
He's the prince.

544
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,380
He is so charismatic.

545
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,018
His posture, his facial expression, and the aura he emits...

546
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,690
scream that he is a true ballerino.

547
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,019
Group A looks like fun.

548
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,528
(Jung Min Chan, a ballerino in Group A)

549
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,328
I'm seriously...

550
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,699
(Park Min Woo, a ballerino in Group A)

551
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,730
in trouble.

552
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,700
To beat someone like him, you must become crazy yourself.

553
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,200
If you had the choice, which group would you have chosen?

554
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,308
I would've joined whichever group had a slot left.

555
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:16,939
(He is so confident.)

556
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,639
Group A looks the toughest.

557
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,750
Group A looked really intense.

558
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:23,609
Group A is the group of death.

559
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,018
I thought, "If I had joined that group,"

560
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:29,519
"I wouldn't have been able to become First Class immediately."

561
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,689
(Who is the only First Class in the intense Group A?)

562
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,359
(Physical and Technique Audition will start now.)

563
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,859
Everyone, take off your shirts.

564
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,659
(The ballerinos get changed for the Physical and Technique Audition.)

565
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,130
He is amazing.

566
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,970
He had such a beautiful body shape.

567
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,400
A hidden ace with a firm body.

568
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:49,440
(They wear their name tags as if preparing for a war.)

569
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,239
It looks like a preliminary round of a competition.

570
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,639
(Nervous)

571
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,939
(A typical ballet competition waiting room)

572
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,809
(Stretching)

573
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,449
(Glancing)

574
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,279
(A silent competition in the disguise of warming up)

575
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,950
(Pasting)

576
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,289
Let's do this.

577
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,130
(Physical and Technique Audition Room for ballet)

578
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,329
(The princes enter.)

579
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:19,440
(The ballerinos enter the audition room.)

580
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,210
(Surprised)

581
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,808
(Ballet barres for the audition)

582
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:25,809
I saw the room full of ballet barres.

583
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,609
I was overwhelmed by the room's atmosphere.

584
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,749
(Stretching)

585
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,849
They're really doing this like an actual audition.

586
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,849
I went back to how I used to attend auditions.

587
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,420
(A perfect straight line)

588
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,459
- Was his name Yu Chan? - Yes.

589
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,730
I won't stand next to him.

590
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,200
He is really good.

591
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,729
He has such a pretty physique.

592
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,730
(Jaw-dropping)

593
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,730
(Gulping)

594
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:52,240
Flexibility and detailed movements that men don't usually have.

595
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,139
I thought I could lose to him.

596
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,239
(Choi Kyu Tae in Group D with him cannot smile.)

597
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,068
(Solemn and serious)

598
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:00,009
Ballerino Kim Tae Seok in the same group.

599
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,250
He has a good physique.

600
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,849
From what I know, he is from the Korean National Ballet.

601
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,250
As expected, he was good.

602
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,920
(Another person that catches the ballerinos' eyes)

603
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,049
Yun Gu in my group.

604
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,230
I think he has the best physique on the show.

605
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,299
He has the leg shape not everyone has.

606
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,869
Min Kwon is handsome like a prince.

607
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:25,240
He is flexible and has a good physique.

608
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,670
I thought, "Do I stand a chance against him?"

609
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,769
(Kang Gyeong Ho of Group A's neat pirouette)

610
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,179
(All eyes on him)

611
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,740
I'm getting intimidated from the warm-ups.

612
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,379
(Glancing)

613
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,950
Gyeong Ho, why did you join this group?

614
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:41,380
Gyeong Ho is powerful and charismatic.

615
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,519
He is on the rise nowadays too.

616
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,390
(Rising star Kang Gyeong Ho's eyes are fixed on...)

617
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,730
Sung Wook studied abroad...

618
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,059
and has a wonderful physique.

619
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,799
He is very good.

620
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,359
I keep checking on him, obviously.

621
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,099
(The warm-up continues for a long time.)

622
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,299
Are they going to announce the order?

623
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,868
I think they would have...

624
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,339
a ballet master or someone like that.

625
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,439
We were curious too.

626
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,109
"Who will judge us and lead us?"

627
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:09,379
(The 16 ballerinos finish warming up...)

628
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,649
(and are waiting for the audition to start.)

629
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,619
(Nervous)

630
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,149
Who will it be?

631
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,949
(The ballet coaches enter with the dancers' cheer.)

632
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,049
(Charismatic)

633
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,519
(Wait, he is...)

634
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,759
"He is here?"

635
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,858
He is very famous.

636
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,199
A choreographer and a producer. He is an all-rounder.

637
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,730
He is very cool. He is my lecturer.

638
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:31,329
Even in school, he criticizes a lot.

639
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,098
I was very worried.

640
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,099
(Intimidated)

641
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:35,569
Bravo!

642
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:37,539
- Bravo! - Bravo.

643
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,308
This is crazy.

644
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,680
(Ballet Coach Han Seong Woo)

645
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,779
He is a world-famous ballerino.

646
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,179
He is in the American Ballet Theatre.

647
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,249
Not anyone can join it.

648
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,519
(The wannabe of ballerinos)

649
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:53,459
Where else can I go and be personally taught...

650
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,130
by a current dancer of the American Ballet Theatre?

651
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,159
How did he make time for this?

652
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,199
(Excited)

653
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,099
(Next, Stage Fighter Master enters with a graceful smile.)

654
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,829
(He can't believe what he's seeing.)

655
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,329
Bravo.

656
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,700
(Master Kim Joo Won)

657
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,838
(Korea's representative prima ballerina...)

658
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,169
She was the principal dancer of the Korean National Ballet.

659
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,909
(who was the principal dancer of the Korean National Ballet)

660
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,009
She is a very famous ballerina.

661
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,579
I had no idea she would join the show.

662
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,519
She's an absolutely amazing figure in the field of ballet.

663
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:23,619
She is one of the top Korean ballerinas.

664
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,758
I looked at her with lots of affection as her fan.

665
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,759
(His fan mode turns on.)

666
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,459
(And Stage Fighter's rehearsal director)

667
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,659
(Rehearsal Director Matthew Rich)

668
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,129
(He was a senior rehearsal director of the Rambert Dance Company.)

669
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,129
(The dance company has 100 years of history.)

670
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,098
(Stage Fighter's rehearsal director who adds details to the dance...)

671
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,599
(with his attention to detail.)

672
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,769
He was very charismatic.

673
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,269
I could feel his aura.

674
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,338
(A master, coaches, and a rehearsal director)

675
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,450
They know ballet inside and out.

676
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,849
They're legendary figures that I cannot even come close to.

677
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:53,119
It will be tough.

678
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,349
They are really serious about this.

679
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,249
It made me feel more nervous.

680
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,420
(Closing his mouth tight)

681
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,089
The class battle of dancers where they fight with their bodies.

682
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,899
On Stage Fighter, to become the best dancer,

683
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,430
you will fight intense dance class battles.

684
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,970
It is very cruel.

685
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,099
Can I survive?

686
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,579
It can't be helped that ballet itself is in a hierarchy.

687
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,380
Not everyone can play the same role.

688
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,410
You are given a role based on your performance.

689
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:27,019
We grew up in that kind of environment.

690
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,049
The classes will be decided based on the dancer's ability.

691
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,689
First Class...

692
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,789
will play the lead role that has a solo part.

693
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,159
Second Class...

694
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,829
will play the supporting role that dances in a duo or a trio.

695
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,299
Under Class will dance in a group.

696
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,629
I want to become First Class...

697
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,599
and perform onstage as the lead role.

698
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:49,109
I am aiming for the lead role.

699
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,068
It was my last bit of pride.

700
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,509
I couldn't dance in a group.

701
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:56,410
How well you managed your body...

702
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,779
and how well you use that body for various techniques...

703
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,519
are basic virtues for all dancers.

704
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,288
(Nodding)

705
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:06,359
(Agreeing)

706
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:10,829
Ballet especially has fixed forms and rules.

707
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,429
(Ballet has fixed forms from one's toes to one's fingertips.)

708
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,329
More than any other dance genre,

709
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,269
your physique matters a lot.

710
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,740
The physique you're born with is important too, but...

711
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,109
Keeping your body in shape is a must.

712
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,910
You change the shapes of your joints and muscles.

713
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,250
You craft a body that is fit for ballet.

714
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:30,950
That's how important it is.

715
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,848
We'll start the Physical and Technique Audition...

716
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,720
to evaluate this.

717
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,288
(Ballet Physical and Technique Audition)

718
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,889
The audition will be conducted...

719
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,130
in groups that you chose yourselves.

720
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,429
(Ballet Physical and Technique Audition Judging Groups)

721
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,730
It will be a relay of three rounds.

722
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,630
It will continue until one person remains.

723
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,139
It's a fight of stamina.

724
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,799
I thought it would be tough.

725
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,309
This is a war.

726
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,470
Round One is the Barre Technique.

727
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,210
Barre and Center Technique.

728
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,210
(Sighing)

729
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:03,609
Actually, the barre technique is a basic skill in ballet.

730
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,380
I didn't expect them to judge us on the classic barre technique.

731
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,618
(Kim Tae Yeon looks more nervous than the others.)

732
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,920
Barre technique is something that ballerinos do the most.

733
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,858
Those that did ballet for a long time...

734
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,420
obviously have a strong foundation.

735
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,660
The score difference could grow from the start.

736
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,559
It may look easy.

737
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,730
You just fold and unfold your legs.

738
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,700
But that's not all there is to it.

739
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,939
You need to use your inner muscles too.

740
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,039
Doing it consecutively is very tough.

741
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,680
I should grit my teeth and do it.

742
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:35,809
I'll give it my all.

743
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,450
Round Two is the Center Technique.

744
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,279
I was very worried about Center Technique.

745
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,549
What kind of male center techniques will they make us do?

746
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,259
Nobody could copy my foundation or technique...

747
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,859
that I honed with a lot of effort.

748
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,029
Round 3 is the 1-on-1 Fixed Technique.

749
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,528
When each round ends,

750
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,839
those that lack the technique will be cut out.

751
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,309
As soon as you're cut out, your class will be decided.

752
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,480
It's the first mission, and they are going all out.

753
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,509
We really are starting a survival show.

754
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,219
There are three rounds.

755
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,119
It won't be easy to pace myself in terms of stamina too.

756
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,420
Who will be the best in physical techniques...

757
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,858
and become First Class?

758
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,359
(Which ballerino will become First Class?)

759
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,199
(Round 1 of Ballet, Barre Technique audition...)

760
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,329
(to decide the First, Second, and Under Classes)

761
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,768
Ballet barres...

762
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,939
warm up a dancer's body and relax the muscles.

763
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,069
It is an important step to avoid an injury.

764
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,009
From the barre technique,

765
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,949
we can evaluate your physique, stamina, flexibility,

766
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,619
balance, technique, and expression.

767
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:51,119
Round 1, Barre Technique, has 4 levels.

768
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:54,159
From each group, the worst dancer...

769
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,029
will be cut out, which makes it four dancers in total.

770
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,528
They will become Under Class.

771
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:02,028
(Immediately, those 4 will become Under Class.)

772
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,538
Barre Technique shows your natural physique very clearly...

773
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,539
to the point that it becomes an evaluation criterion.

774
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,209
My pride won't be able to take it...

775
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,609
if I get eliminated in Barre Technique.

776
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,940
I was confident in my physique.

777
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,680
Ballet actually is an unfair art.

778
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,019
I played a lot of lead roles.

779
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,650
If you don't have the right height or leg shape,

780
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,149
no matter how well you spin and jump,

781
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,019
you can't get the lead role.

782
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,730
You have amazing legs.

783
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,099
- No. - They have the perfect shape.

784
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,859
I'm most worried about myself.

785
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,369
I wasn't born with the leg shape.

786
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,038
Everyone else is very tall, but I'm not.

787
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,109
So I kept getting more worried.

788
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,939
(Stretching)

789
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,409
(Meanwhile, Ballerino Kim Yu Chan is stretching comfortably.)

790
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,609
(Looking intensely)

791
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,150
He has a beautiful back.

792
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,950
I fall behind in terms of the physique I was born with.

793
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,219
If I don't work twice as hard,

794
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,450
I won't be seen by them.

795
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:00,390
Ballet is a very cruel form of art.

796
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,490
We cannot hide.

797
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,028
Not in white tights.

798
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,960
Physique isn't something you can ignore.

799
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,670
You can tell at once how they use their bodies.

800
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,099
In ballet, it's so obvious when you're bad at something.

801
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,470
Let's start the ballet Physical and Technique Audition.

802
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,409
First position.

803
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,149
(First position: Putting the heels of your feet together...)

804
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,579
(while maintaining the turn-out, both feet pointing outward)

805
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,289
Music, start.

806
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,089
If I make a mistake here, I'll become Under Class immediately.

807
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,328
I didn't want to end the audition...

808
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,890
at Barre Technique without showing them my other techniques.

809
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,798
I was confident in barre techniques.

810
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,660
I wanted to be the best out of the four.

811
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,670
Two, one.

812
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,099
Go.

813
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,368
(Ballet Round 1, Barre Technique Audition starts.)

814
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:48,440
The first preparation is very important.

815
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,710
There are some who express emotions with their fingertips.

816
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,209
(Elegant)

817
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,519
(Focused)

818
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,819
You can more or less tell from just the plie.

819
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,059
(Kang Gyeong Ho continues with the plie with ease.)

820
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,029
I like the first dancer. Gyeong Ho.

821
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,259
He looks sturdy.

822
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,159
It shows that he has good core and muscle strengths.

823
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,000
(Stretching)

824
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,639
The third dancer, Min Woo, dances really well.

825
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,869
He is flexible too.

826
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,210
But his weight...

827
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,909
(His weight)

828
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,910
Actually, I was a bit intimidated.

829
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,480
I would look very short and fat.

830
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,750
Sung Wook beside him has a nice body shape.

831
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,190
He has a nice figure.

832
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,190
- His standing leg is very strong. - Yes.

833
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,389
Ballerino Jung Sung Wook next to me is tall.

834
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,160
He has nicely shaped legs,

835
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:47,259
so he definitely attracts more attention than others.

836
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,140
Three, two, one.

837
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,140
Two, one.

838
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,710
Change.

839
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,039
(With the change of music, Barre Technique Level 2 starts.)

840
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,338
(A throwing movement of the leg in every direction...)

841
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,449
(while keeping it stretched out completely)

842
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,150
It's important to pay attention to the toes as much as possible.

843
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,050
(Pointing the feet while keeping the turn-out is key.)

844
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,289
Tae Seok.

845
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,719
How about him?

846
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,429
It's clean.

847
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,800
To me, his position, looks, and body shape...

848
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:22,369
- are ideal for ballet. - And...

849
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,538
Jeon Tae Hu has...

850
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:28,369
a good body shape. He's flexible and light.

851
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,839
(Losing his balance)

852
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,239
(Dancer Lee Ha Nel loses his control and balance.)

853
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,750
(Observing closely)

854
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,780
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

855
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,820
I was running out of strength.

856
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,948
Lee Ha Nel's movements...

857
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,589
aren't precise.

858
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,489
He doesn't look confident. It's unfortunate.

859
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,659
Shall we look at their bodies in profile?

860
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,429
I was startled.

861
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:55,429
When they suddenly came up to us, I thought, "This is crazy."

862
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,969
(Stealthy)

863
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:59,940
The dance masters and coaches are bleeding me dry.

864
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,500
(Masters and coaches evaluate them on the floor for more precision.)

865
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,409
When they're near, I must catch their attention.

866
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,980
We can see their bodies in profile from here.

867
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:11,509
We can see if they're turned out, if their bottoms are sticking out,

868
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,480
or if their ribs are open.

869
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,920
- Did you see someone? - Who is he?

870
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,219
We have to watch this accurately.

871
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,719
Someone was getting closer to me.

872
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,759
(Close-up evaluation continues for accuracy.)

873
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,489
I really should do my best.

874
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:26,059
Suffocating tension.

875
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,070
Goodness, I hope that they won't come near me.

876
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,400
(They're heading toward Ballet Dancer Kim Tae Yeon.)

877
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,969
Suddenly, I could feel their eyes on me.

878
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,939
I always thought that I had a weak foundation,

879
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,110
so I was scared.

880
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,139
He's very weak.

881
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,050
(His lips are dry.)

882
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,779
His standing leg is weak.

883
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,280
He must be strong to dance well in the center.

884
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,948
Shin Min Kwon has good technique.

885
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,719
I prefer his proportions.

886
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,328
Visually, it's more pleasing to my eyes.

887
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,460
- It feels like he's a prince. - A prince.

888
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,269
Yun Gu looks strong.

889
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,400
So I like his edgy energy.

890
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,569
(Just then)

891
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,409
Do you see Jun On?

892
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,239
The coaches stayed in front of me.

893
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:15,750
Compared to Yu Chan...

894
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,309
(Startled)

895
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,780
I heard names like Kim Yu Chan.

896
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,420
It must be easy to compare him to me.

897
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,018
- His feet and everything are sharp. - I agree.

898
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:27,460
His feet, legs, and turn-out are beautiful.

899
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,459
But for Jun On,

900
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,230
I don't see any accent on his feet.

901
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:36,329
(In terms of strength and details, Yu Chan and Jun On are different.)

902
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,900
I couldn't help but feel anxious.

903
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,969
I should do my best until the end.

904
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,739
Isn't it much better to look at them from the side?

905
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:46,179
You can see their heels and arches of their feet.

906
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,639
This is what we have to look at.

907
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,679
(The Barre Technique Audition continues.)

908
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,079
Three, two, one.

909
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,780
Change.

910
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,150
Even if it's hard, hold yourself together.

911
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,759
(Level 3: Rond de Jambe a Terre)

912
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,190
(A movement where the moving leg draws a circle on the floor)

913
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,070
Based on their standing legs, the two of them are...

914
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,070
The turn-out...

915
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:17,408
(Turn-out: When the legs are turned outward,)

916
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,539
(including the feet and the knees)

917
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,939
Kim Kyung Won has an amazing turn-out.

918
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,078
(Kim Kyung Won's foot, Choi Kyu Tae's foot)

919
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,780
He can't turn out.

920
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,448
It was like hanging off a cliff.

921
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,420
To me, the barre felt like a cliff.

922
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:33,388
When you're standing in the first position in ballet,

923
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:35,189
- First position. - your knees should touch.

924
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,729
That's when the evaluation of your dance starts.

925
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,098
I'm naturally bow-legged,

926
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,300
so it's hard to put my knees together.

927
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,899
For the turn-out,

928
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,099
I knew that I'd get points deducted.

929
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,940
I started to get very worried.

930
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:51,738
(Kim Sang Young keeps dancing while sweating profusely.)

931
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:52,840
(Panting)

932
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,550
(Drenched in sweat)

933
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,379
Next to me,

934
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,750
Kim Yu Chan stretched out his legs extremely high.

935
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,118
(It's hard not to compare them in the Barre Technique Audition.)

936
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,719
Yu Chan has a beautiful figure.

937
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,619
He knows how to use his feet.

938
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:10,429
(Satisfied)

939
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,530
(Concentrating)

940
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,429
(Leg stretched in a clean, straight line)

941
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,670
It's bad to get compared to others. How did this happen?

942
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:23,269
(The angles are clearly different as they stand next to each other.)

943
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:24,940
Lovely.

944
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,639
What if I get eliminated?

945
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,780
Three, two, one.

946
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,849
(A little more)

947
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:37,420
(Their strength and concentration become more important now.)

948
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:43,860
(The audition room is filled with sweating and panting dancers)

949
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,229
(The dancers are hitting their physical limits.)

950
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,400
(The dancers are hitting their physical limits.)

951
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,369
- It must be very hard. - It's extremely hard.

952
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,610
I felt like my thighs were going to burst.

953
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,909
My legs and feet were getting cramped.

954
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,650
Physically, it was very difficult.

955
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,079
- It's about having the technique. - Yes, and strong mentality.

956
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,018
For the last 19 years,

957
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:10,650
I practised ballet every day at the barre until late at night.

958
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:13,090
I practised ballet all day.

959
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,789
I trusted my muscle memory.

960
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,460
Energy and mentality.

961
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,630
Let's endure it no matter what.

962
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:22,469
Until the end.

963
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
(Panting)

964
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,840
As a professional, you must keep it up until the end.

965
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:31,469
(Masters and coaches keep evaluating them objectively.)

966
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,609
(Level 4: Grand Battement)

967
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,079
(Kicking of the leg above the head)

968
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,480
For me, Sung Wook and Gyeong Ho are my favourites.

969
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,590
He definitely moves with stability and perfection.

970
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,920
I don't want to join Under, no matter what.

971
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:53,230
I shouldn't relax. Let's do it as much as I can.

972
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:56,129
I earnestly wanted to last until the end.

973
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,170
(Shaking)

974
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,469
I tried to make it while gritting my teeth.

975
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,639
Three, two, one.

976
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,210
Stop.

977
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,009
(Ballet Round 1, Barre Technique Audition is over.)

978
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,948
(The audition room is filled with sounds of short breaths.)

979
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,679
(Panting)

980
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
It's so hot.

981
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,319
Gosh, this is...

982
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,750
(Dripping sweat)

983
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,949
Everyone is sweating so much.

984
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,689
(Sweating profusely as they tried their best)

985
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,900
(Sighing with disappointment)

986
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,899
(Flopping)

987
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,329
It was hard to have enough stamina to move with one breath.

988
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,569
There was a lot of pressure to make it.

989
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,710
(Exhaling)

990
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,940
What did you think of the barre difficulty?

991
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,139
The sequences were easy to follow, but they were hard.

992
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,210
- It was harder than an exam. - It was just as advanced.

993
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,320
In the end, I couldn't even do the up.

994
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,590
(Closing his eyes tightly)

995
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,260
(Which dancer will be sent to Under, the lowest class?)

996
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,058
I will announce the dancers...

997
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,989
in Under Class from Round One.

998
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,559
Gosh, I'm nervous.

999
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:03,598
(4 out of 16 ballet dancers will join Under Class.)

1000
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,170
(Trying to stay calm)

1001
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,800
Coach Han Seong Woo, please announce Group A's Under Class.

1002
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:10,839
(Striding)

1003
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,280
(Group A's ballet dancers wait for the result.)

1004
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,179
I felt confident that I'd pass.

1005
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,820
(Exhaling)

1006
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:23,819
(Turning)

1007
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,989
(All their eyes are on him.)

1008
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:29,189
(Coach Han Seong Woo passes through two dancers.)

1009
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,229
(Closing his eyes)

1010
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,289
To be honest, I was surprised.

1011
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,829
(That startled me.)

1012
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,170
Group A's dancer to join Under Class is...

1013
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,268
He was standing behind me.

1014
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:40,800
It made me very nervous.

1015
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,139
I wanted to join Second Class because I worked very hard.

1016
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,909
(Which ballet dancer will be the first to join Under Class?)

1017
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,149
(What?)

1018
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,550
(Gaping)

1019
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,658
It's Dancer Park Min Woo. Thank you.

1020
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,089
(Group A's Under Class, Park Min Woo)

1021
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,689
Gosh, it fell off.

1022
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,259
(Even the tag fell off.)

1023
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,000
(He puts his Under Class tag back on.)

1024
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,369
I don't believe this.

1025
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:12,170
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1026
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,609
I felt bad to be the first to join Under Class,

1027
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,909
but I had expected it.

1028
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,238
(Under Class from Group A)

1029
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,509
(Park Min Woo?)

1030
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,409
(He doesn't have the right physique.)

1031
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,448
In ballet,

1032
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:28,050
the evaluation starts with your body.

1033
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,219
You sure can't change what you were born with.

1034
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,319
I'll announce...

1035
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,559
the Under Class dancer from Group B.

1036
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,129
(I don't want to see it.)

1037
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,130
(Everyone is nervous.)

1038
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,170
I was quite confident about myself.

1039
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,139
In general, my performance was disappointing. I was worried.

1040
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,539
Honestly, I was somewhat nervous.

1041
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,309
Group B's dancer to join Under Class is...

1042
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,948
Lee Ha Nel.

1043
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:05,018
(Group B's Under Class, Lee Ha Nel)

1044
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:06,218
(Sighing)

1045
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:08,019
(Group B's Under Class, Lee Ha Nel)

1046
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,859
(In Group B...)

1047
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,759
(Lee Ha Nel?)

1048
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,828
(His positions weren't accurate.)

1049
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:14,859
(Stumbling)

1050
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,299
(He doesn't look confident. It's unfortunate.)

1051
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,570
(His lips are dry.)

1052
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,900
I felt uncomfortable and frustrated to join Under Class.

1053
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,939
(The class announcement continues.)

1054
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,638
Now, I will announce...

1055
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,840
the dancer from Group C to join Under Class.

1056
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:31,210
(Please stay away from me.)

1057
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,979
Matthew, please announce the Under Class dancer.

1058
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,178
(To whom is Matthew headed among Group C dancers?)

1059
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,190
(Group D also feels nervous by the announcement.)

1060
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,619
Group C's dancer to join Under Class is...

1061
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,760
I felt quite confident about myself.

1062
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,460
I didn't think I'd get eliminated after the barre.

1063
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:48,058
(Matthew stops and fixes his eyes on Moon Jun On.)

1064
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,059
(Turning)

1065
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:50,399
(Moon Jun On)

1066
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,500
(Could it be him?)

1067
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:53,500
My legs were shaking.

1068
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,769
(He's fidgeting his sweaty hands from nervousness.)

1069
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,368
(Matthew passes Moon Jun On.)

1070
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,879
(Which Group C dancer will be sent to Under Class?)

1071
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,510
Unfortunately, you've been rated Under.

1072
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,819
It's Kim Tae Yeon.

1073
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,948
(Under Class of Group C, Kim Tae Yeon)

1074
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:09,949
(Having mixed feelings)

1075
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,319
(The dancers applaud to cheer him up and comfort him.)

1076
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,618
(Kim Tae Yeon clearly looks disappointed.)

1077
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:14,658
(Sighing)

1078
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:15,719
From Group C?

1079
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:17,658
I wonder if...

1080
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:21,130
Tae Yeon will be able to do well in the Center Technique.

1081
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,400
He doesn't seem to have enough stamina.

1082
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,469
I kept feeling dejected.

1083
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,408
I've never felt so small...

1084
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:30,610
in my life.

1085
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,440
(Exhaling)

1086
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,980
I'll announce the Under Class dancer from Group D.

1087
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,420
(Which Group D dancer will join Under Class?)

1088
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,860
Group D's dancer to join Under Class is...

1089
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,130
I didn't think that I'd get eliminated.

1090
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:55,529
(Director Matthew passes by Kim Yu Chan.)

1091
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,868
(Nervous)

1092
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:01,199
Director Matthew was lingering around me.

1093
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,610
(Director Matthew prepares the Under Class tag in front of Sang Young.)

1094
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,869
My heart was beating fast.

1095
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,909
I wanted to avoid Under Class no matter what.

1096
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:14,150
(Which ballerino from Group D will be sent to Under Class?)

1097
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,018
Unfortunately, you've rated Under.

1098
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,158
- It's Choi Kyu Tae. - Thank you.

1099
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,760
(Under Class of Group D, Choi Kyu Tae)

1100
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,658
(Choi Kyu Tae is sent to Under Class from the Barre Technique Audition.)

1101
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,198
(He has many thoughts after being sent to Under Class.)

1102
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,598
(Glancing)

1103
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,729
(Lowering his head)

1104
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,469
(Ballet Barre Technique Audition is over.)

1105
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:38,139
He's having a mental breakdown.

1106
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,280
- Where is he? - Tell him that it's okay.

1107
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,079
The other dancers accepted it without getting emotional,

1108
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,349
but it looks like he's having a mental breakdown.

1109
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,389
Mentally, it was very hard.

1110
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,218
When I turned out, the judges passed by me.

1111
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,459
And I felt them looking at my knees.

1112
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,059
He doesn't have a turn-out.

1113
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,929
This has always been the case for me.

1114
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:07,670
Always...

1115
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:13,439
I want to become a ballerino and join a ballet company,

1116
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,679
but it gets revealed as soon as I stand onstage.

1117
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,049
So I either cross my legs while standing...

1118
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,479
or jump and move my legs a lot.

1119
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,519
I've had a hard time trying to hide my physical flaw.

1120
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,030
It's just...

1121
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,760
From the beginning, I felt that I'd get eliminated.

1122
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,699
- I'm sorry. - Oh, no.

1123
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,219
I hate...

1124
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,590
my natural body type.

1125
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,689
It's sad not to have a body that isn't appropriate...

1126
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:03,960
for classical ballet.

1127
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,940
Some of the dancers had less experience than me.

1128
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,210
I saw that they had beautiful figures in their leotards.

1129
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,679
I have no strength at all...

1130
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,179
in the basics.

1131
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,949
I felt terrible about myself.

1132
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,789
When you aren't qualified, you don't even get a chance.

1133
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:32,820
The ballet world is so cold-hearted.

1134
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:38,658
(Ballet Under Class: Park Min Woo, Lee Ha Nel,)

1135
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:41,229
(Kim Tae Yeon, Choi Kyu Tae)

1136
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,569
(Only 12 ballerinos moved up to Round 2.)

1137
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,069
Under Class dancers...

1138
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,800
no longer have a chance to audition.

1139
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:49,940
It was cruel.

1140
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:52,139
I felt compassion for them.

1141
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:55,710
The upcoming Rounds 2 and 3 will be...

1142
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,480
technique in the center.

1143
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:59,779
Center technique is the basis of ballet.

1144
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,779
There are set techniques in ballet.

1145
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,690
Pirouette is spinning like a top with one leg as an axis.

1146
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,259
Saut de basque is jumping while turning with one foot on the knee.

1147
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,689
Tour en l'air is spinning the entire body in the air.

1148
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,959
Cabriole is hitting the legs in the air.

1149
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,099
Entrechat six is crossing the thighs in the air.

1150
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,098
Manege is jumping across the stage in circles.

1151
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,440
Ciseaux is splitting the legs after crossing them in the air.

1152
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,038
I kept wondering what techniques would come up.

1153
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,609
I exhausted myself so much at the barre,

1154
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,750
so I was worried.

1155
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,819
As we're male dancers,

1156
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,250
they'll probably give us movements that require advanced techniques.

1157
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:38,948
I'm not good at jumps.

1158
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,158
I was worried about getting difficult jumps.

1159
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,260
Here is...

1160
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,329
the center technique video for Rounds 2 and 3.

1161
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:53,569
Five, four, three, two, one. Go.

1162
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,639
(Round 2 Center Technique video starts.)

1163
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:57,269
We have to begin with the start position.

1164
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:00,509
(Scanning)

1165
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,578
(Demonstration video for Round 2)

1166
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,579
- Do a pirouette. - Pirouette?

1167
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,609
I can do this well.

1168
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,618
(Nodding)

1169
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:08,279
Ballet is about aesthetics,

1170
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,649
so you must turn beautifully in the standard position.

1171
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,820
I got it.

1172
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,260
Cabriole.

1173
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,820
It's a double cabriole, not single.

1174
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,328
Cabriole?

1175
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,229
Since my knee operation, I've been avoiding that movement.

1176
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,499
It looks easy enough. It's worth trying.

1177
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,299
I'm confident about jumps.

1178
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,968
They're basic techniques.

1179
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:27,139
This is worth trying.

1180
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,300
Ciseaux.

1181
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,039
I'm doomed.

1182
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,879
Ciseaux is technically very difficult.

1183
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,078
- It's a feast of techniques. - I know.

1184
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,109
I didn't know that they'd include something like this.

1185
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,018
You can do it only when you have good jumping skills.

1186
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,820
There are professional dancers who can't do the ciseaux.

1187
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,218
However, I felt confident about it.

1188
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:47,259
I should do it well.

1189
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,658
I know how good Gyeong Ho is,

1190
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:51,428
so I felt worried.

1191
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,928
I was very confident.

1192
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:54,300
It's a piece of cake.

1193
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,629
(Wary)

1194
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,730
Let's think about the shape of the next movement.

1195
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,069
Next is entrechat six.

1196
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,199
Here?

1197
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,468
Opening the legs wider would be better.

1198
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:05,539
It's a test of your thigh strength.

1199
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,139
Their thighs will burst.

1200
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,409
Entrechat six is about strength.

1201
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,709
It's very exhausting for...

1202
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,250
the outer and inner thighs.

1203
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,218
The combination looked physically demanding.

1204
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:19,189
- Three, two, one. - Passe tour en l'air.

1205
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,190
Stop.

1206
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:22,788
(Round 2 Center Technique video ends.)

1207
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:23,888
(The back of his head looks flustered.)

1208
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:25,059
This is insane.

1209
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,098
It won't be easy.

1210
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:28,929
Seong Woo, isn't the combination too difficult?

1211
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,828
They should be able to pull it off.

1212
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:33,300
It will allow us to see many things.

1213
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,069
It's worth a try.

1214
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,268
Let's make it to First Class.

1215
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:39,509
It involves all the basic techniques.

1216
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,138
I thought, "I'll finish it with..."

1217
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,750
"an amazing passe tour en l'air."

1218
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:46,249
Both entrechat six and ciseaux are...

1219
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,519
movements I can do in my sleep.

1220
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:52,888
I knew that Kim Kyung Won would definitely do the ciseaux.

1221
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:56,729
It had many movements like ciseaux that I wasn't confident about.

1222
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,928
I was worried.

1223
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,159
Here is the video for Round Three.

1224
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,129
Each dancer will perform the assigned techniques.

1225
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,869
Two, one. Go.

1226
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:08,499
(Demonstration video for Round 3)

1227
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,868
- Double tour en l'air. - Double tour en l'air is...

1228
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:12,808
about keeping the balance...

1229
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:14,809
with your feet off the floor.

1230
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:18,348
I wasn't so worried about double tour en l'air.

1231
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:19,709
Next is manege.

1232
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,320
(Jumping around in huge circles)

1233
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,689
I was very flustered by the manege.

1234
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,519
You have to show a straight line in the air to look good.

1235
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,759
As I was already exhausted,

1236
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,460
I couldn't show my full potential.

1237
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,098
Having control over your body is key in manege.

1238
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:38,929
You have to overcome the air resistance and move in circles.

1239
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,368
Strength is also an important part...

1240
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:42,768
of your skills.

1241
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,409
Two, one. Stop.

1242
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,139
This won't be easy.

1243
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:48,909
It looked very difficult.

1244
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,649
- Five, four, - What?

1245
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,150
- three, two, one. Go. - No way.

1246
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,789
This is very demanding.

1247
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,659
Two of you will come out and do grand pirouettes.

1248
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:04,759
Usually, grand pirouettes are done for 16 counts.

1249
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,760
But to make it special, it will be for 32 counts.

1250
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,800
I thought that I misheard it.

1251
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,768
Usually, you do grand pirouettes for 16 counts.

1252
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:16,070
We had to do them for 32 counts, which was twice as long.

1253
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:18,469
No one does grand pirouettes...

1254
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,669
for 32 counts.

1255
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,139
They want to evaluate the dancers thoroughly.

1256
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,480
I resented them a lot.

1257
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,719
How...

1258
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,380
I told myself to do it no matter what.

1259
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,819
Do single pirouettes during the 1st 16 counts.

1260
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,288
During the 2nd 16 counts,

1261
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:36,118
show us your best turning technique.

1262
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,158
(Nodding)

1263
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:39,959
Grand pirouettes for 32 counts, which is unusual.

1264
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,859
I should draw their attention.

1265
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,670
I thought that it could be an advantage for me.

1266
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:46,400
I have to distribute my stamina.

1267
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,899
As long as I'm willing,

1268
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,399
I can do it better than anyone else.

1269
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,969
I'll make it with force and tenacity.

1270
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,979
I was determined to work hard because I didn't want to lose.

1271
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,138
I'll go for First Class.

1272
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,280
Let's try it.

1273
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,920
(Which dancer will join First Class from each group?)

1274
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,488
Ballet Physical and Technique Audition,

1275
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:05,920
Round Two, Center Technique, will start.

1276
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,420
Let's begin with Group A.

1277
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:11,689
Kang Gyeong Ho.

1278
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,828
(Kang Gyeong Ho, Group A)

1279
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:13,960
Jung Min Chan.

1280
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,199
- And Jung Sung Wook. - Yes.

1281
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,599
Let's take our first position.

1282
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:25,039
The three people from Group A are some of the best dancers.

1283
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,809
You can tell by their standing positions.

1284
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,980
Nice.

1285
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,579
I think Group A is really good.

1286
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,319
They went to Korea National University of Arts.

1287
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,480
They all went to Korea National University of Arts.

1288
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,848
I know Gyeong Ho.

1289
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:39,820
I know how good he is.

1290
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,259
Gyeong Ho...

1291
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,158
(Only Group A has an available spot.)

1292
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,389
Gyeong Ho is a tough opponent.

1293
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:49,999
He has everything I lack.

1294
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,469
That's why I felt rivalry against him.

1295
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,139
Against Gyeong Ho only.

1296
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,010
I really like him,

1297
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,110
but we need to compete.

1298
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,280
I really wanted to win.

1299
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,949
I really wanted to win and felt rivalry against him.

1300
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,279
- I thought Sung Wook and I... - Pose?

1301
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,519
would be competing to be in First Class.

1302
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,289
So I feel the most competitive against him.

1303
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,820
Gyeong Ho.

1304
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:16,829
We should become the first scene-stealers.

1305
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,760
- I don't think I can do it. - Me neither.

1306
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,460
I was like, "What was that?" I stared at them for a long time.

1307
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:26,029
They didn't feel the need to keep me in check.

1308
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,400
They felt competitive against each other, excluding me.

1309
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,010
It actually didn't feel great.

1310
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:34,839
They're my college juniors.

1311
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,138
(2006 Korea National University of Arts)

1312
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,809
He entered the university in 2006.

1313
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,849
You weren't the oldest.

1314
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,519
Min Chan is my senior.

1315
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,189
Classical ballet has a short lifespan,

1316
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,718
with the prime years...

1317
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:47,888
often considered to be in the early 20s.

1318
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:51,360
He's quite old, so...

1319
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,829
So you think you can step on me?

1320
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,130
(He's just smiling.)

1321
00:54:54,131 --> 00:54:56,059
As my juniors excluded me like that,

1322
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,899
I wanted to show I'm doing just as good...

1323
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,269
as an active ballerino.

1324
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,070
I wanted to win against those younger guys.

1325
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:06,369
I thought I could be in First Class.

1326
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,809
I was confident.

1327
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:09,880
I think I'll be in First Class.

1328
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,550
I'll do my best. It's mine.

1329
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,579
Music,

1330
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:15,719
start.

1331
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:18,289
(Group A, Round 2, Center Technique)

1332
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,819
(Allonge: A movement that involves the extension of arms.)

1333
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,920
His leg shape is pretty.

1334
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,388
(Impressed)

1335
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,158
Min Chan especially looks good when he extends his leg.

1336
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:26,329
I like his pointed toes.

1337
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,098
When he does en tournant, he puts his legs together.

1338
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,230
I like his turn-out.

1339
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:33,869
- Nice. - I like Gyeong Ho.

1340
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:38,340
"I'll end it with my pirouette."

1341
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:39,908
(Pirouette: A movement where you spin on one leg like a top.)

1342
00:55:39,909 --> 00:55:41,809
- Oh, my. - Good techniques.

1343
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,150
They turned four times perfectly.

1344
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:45,309
It was clean.

1345
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,480
He made a mistake.

1346
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,789
And...

1347
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,389
- Gyeong Ho. - Good.

1348
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,320
They did double cabrioles very nicely.

1349
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:56,988
But Sung Wook just tapped his feet.

1350
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:58,860
It means Gyeong Ho has a better technique.

1351
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:02,559
Min Chan did a single cabriole, which is unfortunate.

1352
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:05,099
There is a significant difference in their skills.

1353
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:07,139
It won't be difficult to make a decision for Round Two.

1354
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,599
I was like, "Oh, no."

1355
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,238
Gyeong Ho and Sung Wook were amazing.

1356
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:14,710
I thought I should appeal to them when I do the ciseaux.

1357
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,150
Ciseaux. I should kill it.

1358
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:19,010
(Ciseaux: A jump where the legs are stretched in the air.)

1359
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,980
- Gosh. - That's crazy.

1360
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:24,050
Both extended their legs very well, making a straight line.

1361
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,888
The jumps are so good.

1362
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,158
- Gyeong Ho's jumps are great. - That's amazing.

1363
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:29,519
I think he's one of the best in Korea.

1364
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,788
(Meanwhile, Sung Wook couldn't do a ciseaux.)

1365
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:33,800
- Oh, my. - Why did he do an assemble?

1366
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,960
(Frowning)

1367
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:36,360
Sung Wook didn't do a ciseaux.

1368
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:39,570
(Oh, no)

1369
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:42,940
"This is not it."

1370
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,070
"He's perplexed."

1371
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:46,670
I thought it was an opportunity for me.

1372
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:49,308
Gyeong Ho is indeed great. Min Chan...

1373
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:50,409
His moves are clean, though.

1374
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:52,349
I think we should keep watching.

1375
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:57,590
Even though Min Chan isn't so young,

1376
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:00,019
I can tell he's experienced. Don't you think so?

1377
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:02,159
(It's the same move,)

1378
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,389
(but they're showing ballet techniques in different styles.)

1379
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,299
Both have personalities...

1380
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,500
- Yes. - in their dance.

1381
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:11,799
It's pretty.

1382
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,499
Yes. He catches your eye.

1383
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,570
Yes.

1384
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:19,869
I thought I would pass this round if I kept going like this.

1385
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:23,980
"Let's not waver and finish it neatly until the end."

1386
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:27,619
"Let's finish the last position well to survive."

1387
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,519
Chaines.

1388
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,448
Passe tour en l'air.

1389
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:34,690
Yes.

1390
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,030
Everyone did the passe tour en l'air very well at the end.

1391
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:41,799
(Ballet Physical and Technique Audition)

1392
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,900
(Center Technique, Round 2 for Group A has ended.)

1393
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,999
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

1394
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,238
It's definitely Gyeong Ho, right?

1395
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:49,198
Yes. The quality was different.

1396
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,209
He was great.

1397
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,909
- But this guy wasn't bad either. - Right.

1398
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,079
Sung Wook. He's got some character.

1399
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,279
- He's charismatic. Right? - Yes.

1400
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,750
So, for me, these are my two favourites.

1401
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,420
- Sung Wook and Gyeong Ho. - Yes.

1402
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,488
- Gyeong Ho. - Is it okay...

1403
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,590
to do a different move, though?

1404
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:13,799
(Sung Wook replaced ciseaux, a fixed technique, with another move.)

1405
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,030
(Disappointed)

1406
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,829
Who do you think will be eliminated?

1407
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,170
Sung Wook did the moves in the wrong order.

1408
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:21,570
So...

1409
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,039
I'm a little nervous.

1410
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,578
I'm a left-footer.

1411
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:31,710
So I always did a ciseaux in the other direction.

1412
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,719
I've never done it on my right side.

1413
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:38,420
So I tried to change the direction.

1414
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:40,519
But if I change the direction,

1415
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:43,090
I can't do the following steps properly.

1416
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,260
So it is a disadvantage.

1417
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,530
But it was me who made a mistake.

1418
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,269
I thought I might be eliminated if it didn't go well.

1419
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,940
First of all, I really enjoyed it.

1420
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:56,639
Min Chan,

1421
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,309
I liked how you enjoyed it while dancing.

1422
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:01,839
I loved your shapes, expressions,

1423
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,980
and energy.

1424
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,209
But technically,

1425
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,178
you weren't very accurate,

1426
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:10,219
which is a little disappointing.

1427
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:14,619
Sung Wook is a left-footer,

1428
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:17,459
so I understand it wasn't easy in many ways.

1429
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,729
But you did the moves in the wrong order,

1430
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,900
which is a little disappointing.

1431
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,529
Your turn-out, shapes, and jumps...

1432
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,329
were very good.

1433
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,900
- Thank you. - Gyeong Ho,

1434
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:31,570
your techniques were great.

1435
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:35,239
But you could make better facial expressions.

1436
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,448
(Gyeong Ho had a straight face while dancing.)

1437
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:41,679
(Looking closely)

1438
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,788
- Gyeong Ho... - His thighs.

1439
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,218
- has great techniques, - Yes.

1440
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,319
- but his facial expression is... - He looks nervous.

1441
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,920
I'm not sure if he's just nervous, or...

1442
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,829
- Sung Wook smiles sometimes. - Right.

1443
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,460
He looks charismatic.

1444
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,730
Compared to your technique,

1445
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:59,369
you lack artistic expression.

1446
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,469
I hope you can work on it a little more.

1447
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:08,339
We'll now reveal the dancer who got cut out...

1448
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,280
and joined the Second Class.

1449
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,610
They cut them out right away.

1450
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:15,449
I was nervous.

1451
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,090
Sung Wook made a big mistake.

1452
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:20,090
So I thought I could make it if things went well.

1453
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,730
The Second Class is...

1454
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,529
(Matthew stands in front of the dancers from Group A.)

1455
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,800
(Nervous)

1456
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,570
(Matthew is looking at Sung Wook.)

1457
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,440
(Approaching)

1458
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:40,738
Unfortunately, you've ranked Second.

1459
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:41,879
Please leave the floor.

1460
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,308
(Second Class of Group A, Jung Min Chan)

1461
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,579
(Disappointed)

1462
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,519
It's disappointing. Sung Wook made a mistake.

1463
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,119
Of course, he's a great dancer.

1464
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:57,488
But I wish I could've done...

1465
01:00:57,489 --> 01:00:58,889
- better. - You did well.

1466
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,500
But...

1467
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,329
I did very well for someone who was born in 1988.

1468
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,399
Fortunately, I made it.

1469
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,269
I'm getting ready to make up for it properly.

1470
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:11,368
(Glancing)

1471
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:12,840
He's still my rival, of course.

1472
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:16,780
Sung Wook is a dancer with great techniques.

1473
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:19,949
If I make a mistake, I might be eliminated.

1474
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:21,880
I should do better.

1475
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,489
Gyeong Ho is good.

1476
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:27,260
But it's okay if I do better.

1477
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:29,889
- I'm confident. - I'm confident.

1478
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:37,099
But the fact that those two are competing here is...

1479
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:39,529
I know. Those two...

1480
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,638
(The big match makes even the master and the coaches nervous.)

1481
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:44,409
It's going to be interesting.

1482
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:48,280
Round 3. Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho will go 1st.

1483
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,849
- I really want to win. - Five,

1484
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,848
- I'm going to win. - four, three,

1485
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:54,679
two, one.

1486
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:56,179
Go.

1487
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,849
(Fixed Technique for Round 3: Tour en l'air, 3 times)

1488
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,288
(Exclaiming automatically)

1489
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:02,320
His jump is great.

1490
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:04,530
He was good, indeed.

1491
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,828
(Tour en l'air, 1st time)

1492
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:07,829
Nice.

1493
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,530
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

1494
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,969
Good. His jumps are great, indeed.

1495
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,139
It's clean.

1496
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,038
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

1497
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:18,440
Gyeong Ho's rotation in the air is amazing.

1498
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:19,839
(Gyeong Ho's moves draw attention.)

1499
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,909
He's good.

1500
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:24,779
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

1501
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,110
He's so bouncy.

1502
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,579
(Tour en l'air, 3rd time)

1503
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,349
It was clean.

1504
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:33,550
"Let's not make a mistake. Let's rotate neatly."

1505
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,158
"Let's follow the movements my body remembers."

1506
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:36,189
Let's look at his manege.

1507
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,388
(Manege)

1508
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:38,659
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1509
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,599
It's a low and long jump.

1510
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,928
His legs make a straight line...

1511
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,299
while he jumps forward.

1512
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,340
It's good.

1513
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,069
Five...

1514
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,439
(Chaines)

1515
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,440
- Finish up. - Two,

1516
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:53,510
- one. Go. - It was very stable.

1517
01:02:54,579 --> 01:02:56,809
(The other dancers can't help but acknowledge his moves.)

1518
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,449
- Okay. - Go.

1519
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,420
But he definitely lacks personality.

1520
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,619
I don't think I made a mistake.

1521
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:06,050
I was confident.

1522
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:09,659
- I think his moves were clean, - Five,

1523
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:13,488
- but I think I can win if I show... - four, three, two,

1524
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,929
- one. Go. - my artistry and elegance.

1525
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,399
(Tour en l'air, 3 times)

1526
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,469
To the left.

1527
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:19,329
Oh, my.

1528
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,199
- Good. - A nice spin.

1529
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:26,670
Sung Wook is also good. I love it.

1530
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,709
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

1531
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,079
- Nice. - It was neat.

1532
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,710
Look at how he raised his chin.

1533
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,280
Look. Sung Wook's facial expression is great.

1534
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:37,420
I like him very much.

1535
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:40,250
He's cool and charismatic.

1536
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:42,190
I was a little nervous.

1537
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:44,730
(Sung Wook shows his techniques with confidence.)

1538
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,429
(Tour en l'air, 3rd time)

1539
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:47,959
(Eyes widening)

1540
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,359
(Tour en l'air, 3rd time)

1541
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,599
He made a nice shape. His spins in the air are impressive.

1542
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,469
He has better basic techniques and coordination.

1543
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,139
I thought, "I'll make it if I keep going like this."

1544
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,440
The manege.

1545
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:02,480
He's flexible.

1546
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,579
(Panting)

1547
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:06,909
- He looks very tired. - Kick with your rear leg.

1548
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,119
(Tilting his head)

1549
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,249
He was tired when doing the manege.

1550
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,250
His rear leg wasn't as high as Gyeong Ho's.

1551
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,989
He looked very tired.

1552
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:17,860
I thought I'd be in First Class.

1553
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:19,730
That's what I felt.

1554
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,130
"This is not it."

1555
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:25,929
I thought I'd keep going until the end even if it wasn't going well.

1556
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,369
- Yes. Do it quickly. - Three,

1557
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,238
- Go up. - two, one.

1558
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:31,010
(Ending pose)

1559
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,768
(Hawk eyes)

1560
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,480
- Stop. - Okay.

1561
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:35,940
He tried until the end.

1562
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,409
He tried.

1563
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,618
(Sung Wook is breathing heavily.)

1564
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,650
- He must be so tired. - This is crazy.

1565
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:45,449
And he must do 32 grand pirouettes?

1566
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:48,090
I know. Why 32?

1567
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,289
- It's exhausting. - Right.

1568
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,130
Skills are important,

1569
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,130
- but endurance is also important. - Right.

1570
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:54,559
You need good stamina.

1571
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,559
The ballet battle is so scary.

1572
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,328
- I'm so scared. - Yes.

1573
01:04:58,329 --> 01:04:59,630
It lays bare your true abilities.

1574
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,570
Is this a fight against yourself or what?

1575
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,610
(They can't catch their breath easily.)

1576
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,110
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm good. How about you?

1577
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,349
It was really tiring.

1578
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:18,589
Thinking I would be in First Class...

1579
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,690
if I finished it well,

1580
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:22,119
I tried my utmost best.

1581
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,659
I wanted to be in the First Class.

1582
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,130
I was like, "I don't want him to take it away from me. It's mine."

1583
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,929
(They are getting ready for the 1-on-1 Fixed Technique in Round 3.)

1584
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,669
I'm so nervous. Oh, my gosh. I'm so anxious.

1585
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,099
I'm just watching, but my hands are sweaty.

1586
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,379
(Their last match will decide on who will be in the First Class...)

1587
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,539
(in Group A.)

1588
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:47,009
Five, four, three...

1589
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,049
(Wearing a smile)

1590
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,448
His facial expression is good, right?

1591
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:50,619
- He looks like a prince. - Two.

1592
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,650
Three, two, one.

1593
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:55,260
Go.

1594
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,429
- Both are so good. - Nice.

1595
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,929
I like their spins.

1596
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:03,599
They're not slow. They're on the beat.

1597
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,130
A nice leg position, a good upper body position.

1598
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,469
Their spins are great. Both are doing great.

1599
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:11,739
Their turns are so good that I can't say which one is better.

1600
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,010
This is cruel.

1601
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,909
It's so cruel.

1602
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,549
It's about who holds out...

1603
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,309
- until the end. - I know. It's so cruel.

1604
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:20,609
(Impressed)

1605
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,650
They're good.

1606
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,980
You got this.

1607
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,590
It has started now.

1608
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,360
Show us your skills.

1609
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,159
Do a double.

1610
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:32,730
Keep trying until the end.

1611
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,629
Look at the speed. It's so good.

1612
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:38,400
As he was trying to show another technique here, he was pushed back.

1613
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,669
How can you show another move while doing that?

1614
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:41,869
- I know. - It's impossible.

1615
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,639
"I'm doomed."

1616
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,939
But showing everything I can show...

1617
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,579
How can he do that there?

1618
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:52,550
That would be best.

1619
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,349
(Sung Wook made a bold attempt, but he faltered again.)

1620
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,190
(Meanwhile, Gyeong Ho keeps turning without showing another move.)

1621
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,989
I thought, "Sung Wook is tired."

1622
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:02,760
"I'm going to be in the First Class."

1623
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,289
It's not over.

1624
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:11,400
(Gyeong Ho stopped turning before the music ended.)

1625
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:14,000
(He made a safe choice by doing single turns before he stopped.)

1626
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,840
"Oh, it's not over."

1627
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,268
- "He's turning." - Three, two,

1628
01:07:18,269 --> 01:07:19,340
- "This is embarrassing." - one.

1629
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:22,909
I thought I might win, so I kept trying until the end.

1630
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,550
- Three, two, one. - How can he turn so much?

1631
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,449
Three, two, one.

1632
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,980
Stop.

1633
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,320
Oh, no.

1634
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:37,829
(Their mistakes upset people who were watching.)

1635
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:41,159
It takes a very long time to count to 32.

1636
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,960
But he tried until the end.

1637
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,769
After it was over,

1638
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,539
I wasn't in my right mind. I was so tired.

1639
01:07:51,409 --> 01:07:54,280
I'm not sure if it's because I tried too hard,

1640
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,579
but I made a few mistakes.

1641
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,550
It was very disappointing.

1642
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,550
Let me guide you.

1643
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,448
I thought the music stopped there.

1644
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,149
It's so embarrassing.

1645
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,590
A ballet dancer counted incorrectly.

1646
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:11,059
I felt so small and was ashamed of myself.

1647
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:17,500
- I wish he'd finished. - That's what I said.

1648
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,399
You know, here's what I'm afraid of.

1649
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,438
If he can't get through 30 seconds,

1650
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:24,210
how is he going to get through three minutes?

1651
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,939
But we should consider the moves they did before this.

1652
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:30,038
- Their solo techniques. - Right.

1653
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,050
(They should consider the techniques they showed prior to this.)

1654
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:34,550
Gyeong Ho has great techniques.

1655
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,589
His moves are clean, but he lacks artistry.

1656
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:38,618
(Gyeong Ho lacks artistry.)

1657
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:41,890
Sung Wook's moves aren't as clean as Gyeong Ho's,

1658
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:43,760
but he has charisma.

1659
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:48,000
I wonder which of them will move people's hearts more.

1660
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,699
I'm conflicted.

1661
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,029
So difficult.

1662
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,100
(Which one will be in the First Class?)

1663
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:57,869
Both of you did a great job.

1664
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,140
Good work.

1665
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,578
One of you will be in the First Class.

1666
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:08,079
And the other will be in the Second Class.

1667
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,648
Gyeong Ho was clearly better than Sung Wook...

1668
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:13,890
in terms of the movement quality.

1669
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:17,929
I think it would've been better if you had tried until the end.

1670
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,328
It was a little disappointing.

1671
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:22,159
Sung Wook, you were tired,

1672
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:25,068
and it wasn't your best.

1673
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:27,329
But I think highly of you...

1674
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:30,939
as you tried until the end.

1675
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:33,270
I wish you had better stamina.

1676
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:37,850
Doing 32 turns is extremely challenging,

1677
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:41,478
especially right after the tour en l'air and manege...

1678
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:42,750
with no rest.

1679
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:45,590
It was very difficult, but you did your best.

1680
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,219
We took into account your determination to try...

1681
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,720
until the end of our evaluation.

1682
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:52,989
I will announce the result.

1683
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,260
Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho and Ballerino Jung Sung Wook.

1684
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,000
The First Class is...

1685
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:01,699
I really want to win,

1686
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:04,970
but I can't say I'm confident.

1687
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:07,140
It's not easy.

1688
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:09,739
But I thought it wasn't impossible.

1689
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,380
(They're also nervous.)

1690
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,180
(Which one will be in the First Class?)

1691
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:20,420
(First Class of Group A, Kang Gyeong Ho)

1692
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:23,090
It's Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho. Congratulations.

1693
01:10:24,989 --> 01:10:27,800
It felt good, but I wasn't really sure about it.

1694
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:31,430
I should do well to show that I deserve the position.

1695
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:33,799
- Thank you. - You've achieved the highest rank.

1696
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,868
Congratulations.

1697
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:35,899
Thank you.

1698
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:39,510
(Everyone was holding their breath while watching their match.)

1699
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:43,309
(They end up in different ranks by a narrow margin.)

1700
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,350
I think I'm going to pass out.

1701
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,409
I'm upset.

1702
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:50,079
I'm in the Second Class today,

1703
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,350
but this is not what I truly am.

1704
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,590
I'll show you.

1705
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,389
(Ballet Physical and Technique Audition)

1706
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,060
So next, we have Group C.

1707
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,460
Moon Jun On.

1708
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:00,559
(Ballerino Moon Jun On)

1709
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,999
Shin Min Kwon.

1710
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,198
(Ballerino Shin Min Kwon)

1711
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,568
And Kang Yun Gu.

1712
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:06,130
(Ballerino Kang Yun Gu)

1713
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,199
Kang Yun Gu is so cool.

1714
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:10,470
I think the dancer from Hamburg Ballet...

1715
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:11,939
will be in the First Class.

1716
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,140
- An elite dancer from abroad. - I'm so curious.

1717
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,679
(The first Korean ballerino in Hamburg Ballet)

1718
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,710
He's the first Korean ballerino in Hamburg Ballet.

1719
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,608
When I say, "I'm from Hamburg Ballet,"

1720
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,920
people think I'm a good dancer. It's a famous ballet company.

1721
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,050
The physical ranking. My goodness.

1722
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:27,590
How can you get 18 points?

1723
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,890
But I can tell he has a great body just by looking at the picture.

1724
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,489
He's confident in pirouette.

1725
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,629
Looking at his body, I think his turns will be great.

1726
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:35,759
(Technique I'm confident in: Pirouette)

1727
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,799
I was born with a nice body.

1728
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,929
People in the ballet company said...

1729
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:43,038
my pirouette was clean.

1730
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:45,368
Many people said my mid-air positions...

1731
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:47,009
were nice.

1732
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,938
I'm confident...

1733
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:50,680
that I'll do better than any other dancer here.

1734
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:54,209
Ballerino Moon Jun On. He's so brave...

1735
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,949
because he's not intimidated only with 2.5 years of experience.

1736
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,989
He has a great potential.

1737
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:00,389
(Clean and upright)

1738
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,819
Min Kwon is a good-looking guy.

1739
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,188
- He's handsome. - Yes.

1740
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:06,029
He looks like a ballet prince.

1741
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,829
Min Kwon has beautiful legs.

1742
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,960
I think Min Kwon is an ideal dancer in terms of his physical appearance.

1743
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:13,129
From what I know, he went to Korea National University of Arts.

1744
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,500
I think he'll be in the First Class.

1745
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:16,739
I was a little mad.

1746
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,510
I thought I should show them properly.

1747
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:21,439
(When the ballet judging groups were revealed)

1748
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,479
- What? - What?

1749
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:24,680
Jun On has 2.5 years of experience.

1750
01:12:25,109 --> 01:12:27,250
I wanted to avoid Kang Gyeong Ho. It was a little annoying.

1751
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:28,850
He came to my group because of that?

1752
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,749
"What's this guy?"

1753
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,789
Min Kwon.

1754
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:33,719
As for Min Kwon, I remember him...

1755
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,260
as someone whose looks shined more than his skills.

1756
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:38,629
He wasn't anything more than that.

1757
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,188
(Kang Yun Gu)

1758
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,358
(Group C)

1759
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:42,800
I'm sure he knows my name.

1760
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,198
We often met at competitions.

1761
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,600
The result was my victory.

1762
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:49,670
I thought that I'd help him remember the past.

1763
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,170
I kept seeing Min Kwon.

1764
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,010
(Light and airy)

1765
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:58,148
He didn't have the best technique in the past.

1766
01:12:58,149 --> 01:13:00,608
But he has good technique now.

1767
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:01,979
I thought, "I'll need to work hard."

1768
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:04,689
Seriously, the pirouette is the problem.

1769
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:06,489
(Faltering)

1770
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,659
Pirouette is my weak suit.

1771
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,890
I was very worried.

1772
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,629
Hold on.

1773
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,500
The member who has confidence in the pirouette is here.

1774
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:16,899
I have no confidence in the pirouette.

1775
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:18,699
How many turns can you do?

1776
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,670
If I do well, I do four turns.

1777
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,699
- Otherwise, I do three turns. - Two turns.

1778
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,470
You must be confident.

1779
01:13:25,069 --> 01:13:27,739
Pirouette is your specialty, right?

1780
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,108
Can you do nine turns?

1781
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:31,549
I can't do 9 turns. I do 6 to 7 turns.

1782
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,550
(I'm jealous.)

1783
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:34,148
(Fancy)

1784
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:37,020
I think the pirouette is my strong suit.

1785
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:40,119
It's my weapon and skill.

1786
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,390
I have confidence.

1787
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,920
My experience only goes back a few years.

1788
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,528
But the other contestants are from Korea National University of Arts...

1789
01:13:46,529 --> 01:13:47,760
and a German ballet company.

1790
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,460
It'll be tough.

1791
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,899
- Still, - No, I can do it.

1792
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:54,969
I don't get intimidated.

1793
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:55,970
(Very confident)

1794
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:58,139
I can spin very well.

1795
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,209
I have confidence when it comes to jumping.

1796
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:01,238
(Look at him.)

1797
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:02,510
(He practices without a break.)

1798
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,949
I'll go as far as I can.

1799
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:07,819
Let's join the First Class.

1800
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,478
I'll join the First Class.

1801
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,689
I'll claim the title of the First Class.

1802
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:14,090
Let's take our first position.

1803
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,029
- I'm excited about Kang Yun Gu. - How cool.

1804
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,430
- Music. - They must be nervous.

1805
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,199
Start.

1806
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:26,828
Three, two, one.

1807
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,068
(Group C, Round 2, Center Technique starts.)

1808
01:14:28,069 --> 01:14:29,099
(Concentrating)

1809
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,368
Allonge.

1810
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:31,438
(Allonge: A lengthening movement of the arms)

1811
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:32,769
Shin Min Kwon pointed his toes well.

1812
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,909
He pointed his toes well.

1813
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:36,680
Let's go.

1814
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,749
(Pirouette: A spinning movement on one leg)

1815
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,449
I'm really confident when it comes to pirouette.

1816
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,020
Pirouette.

1817
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,118
Oh, no.

1818
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:47,390
(Oh, no!)

1819
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:50,219
He wanted to do three turns,

1820
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,788
but ended up doing two turns because the music rushed him.

1821
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:55,460
And the spotting was very lacking. The head rotated with the body.

1822
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,068
Jun On's spotting was very nice.

1823
01:14:58,069 --> 01:14:59,129
(Moon Jun On made good use of the spotting technique.)

1824
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,069
What was that? They were unimpressive.

1825
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,170
Sissonne.

1826
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:04,670
Double cabriole.

1827
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:08,239
Kang Yun Gu didn't do a double cabriole.

1828
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:09,779
Perhaps, he can't do it.

1829
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,479
(Kang Yun Gu and Moon Jun On beat their feet once in the air.)

1830
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:16,920
(Shin Min Kwon beat his feet twice in the air.)

1831
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:21,389
(Jete)

1832
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,818
Ciseaux.

1833
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:25,288
Nice.

1834
01:15:25,289 --> 01:15:27,288
You need to make a straight line with your legs in the air.

1835
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,129
As for Min Kwon, he made a straight line.

1836
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,228
It was very nice.

1837
01:15:31,229 --> 01:15:34,969
As for Yun Gu, his movement didn't look like a ciseaux.

1838
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,000
(Disappointed)

1839
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,069
The dominating thought was that I might get eliminated.

1840
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:41,710
Six.

1841
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,438
Min Kwon is clean...

1842
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,509
- compared to the other two. - Yes.

1843
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:49,519
I had the most confidence in the last one, passe tour en l'air.

1844
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,549
I decided to wrap up in a cool way.

1845
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,550
Stop.

1846
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:55,759
(The ones who wrapped up stably were Shin Min Kwon...)

1847
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,859
(and Moon Jun On.)

1848
01:15:58,229 --> 01:15:59,789
One. Stop.

1849
01:16:00,829 --> 01:16:02,129
- Be careful. - It's okay.

1850
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:03,229
Stop.

1851
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,569
(Kang Yun Gu ended the performance with an unstable landing.)

1852
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,799
(He can't bear to watch it.)

1853
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,199
How disappointing.

1854
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,270
(Group C, Round 2, Center Technique ends.)

1855
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,438
(Sighing)

1856
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:17,009
(Kang Yun Gu can't hide his disappointment as he goes back.)

1857
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,078
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

1858
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:20,710
- Watching him made my heart ache. - I know.

1859
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,149
(I see.)

1860
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,420
That was unexpected.

1861
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,090
- It was weaker than I expected. - It was too weak.

1862
01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:31,089
This is so sad. Seriously. I looked forward to seeing them.

1863
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,130
- I know. - Yes.

1864
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,659
They looked so beautiful in a standing position.

1865
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:37,228
I'm in trouble.

1866
01:16:37,229 --> 01:16:39,100
I'm disappointed in myself.

1867
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,399
As for Yun Gu...

1868
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:43,470
I was just dumbfounded.

1869
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,269
What was that? As for Yun Gu,

1870
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,670
I still don't understand him.

1871
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,078
We'll now reveal the dancer...

1872
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:52,880
who got cut out...

1873
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,609
and joined the Second Class.

1874
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:59,189
I wasn't very worried.

1875
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,289
I thought that I did pretty well.

1876
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,289
I waited for the result calmly.

1877
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,858
It'll be the one in the middle.

1878
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:10,930
(Nodding)

1879
01:17:11,529 --> 01:17:13,100
The Second Class dancer is...

1880
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,509
Unfortunately, you've ranked Second.

1881
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:20,639
It's all right. Thank you.

1882
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,880
Dancer Kang Yun Gu.

1883
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,210
(Second Class of Group C, Kang Yun Gu)

1884
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:27,679
(Wary)

1885
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,818
(The result of Kang Yun Gu, the ace, brings tension to Group C.)

1886
01:17:30,819 --> 01:17:34,488
He has... He gives a lot of main character energy.

1887
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:37,188
But unfortunately, the dancing did not support that.

1888
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:40,560
- Yun Gu couldn't do any techniques. - You're right.

1889
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:43,658
(Double cabriole)

1890
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,300
(Failed)

1891
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:46,799
(Ciseaux)

1892
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,800
(Failed)

1893
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,068
(Passe tour en l'air)

1894
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:51,369
(Failed)

1895
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:52,608
Kang Yun Gu is...

1896
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:54,409
- below my expectations. - Me too.

1897
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,509
- Good work. - Good work.

1898
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,510
(Kang Yun Gu exits after a poor result.)

1899
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,880
It hurt my pride, to be honest.

1900
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:05,389
But there was a risk of an injury...

1901
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:06,949
since I had taken a long break.

1902
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,560
During my time in the Hamburg Ballet,

1903
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:13,159
I sustained a big knee injury.

1904
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,429
My dancing wouldn't be the same after the surgery,

1905
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:18,099
so people advised me to get it after retirement.

1906
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,800
So I haven't gotten the surgery yet.

1907
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,198
When I watched the Center Technique video,

1908
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,840
I realized that it wouldn't be easy.

1909
01:18:26,109 --> 01:18:28,239
There were many big jumps.

1910
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,710
I thought, "What will I do if I get injured?"

1911
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:34,649
"If I get injured,"

1912
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,020
"it'll be a big loss."

1913
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,719
I'm disappointed, but I can't undo the past hiatus.

1914
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,589
Until the next mission, I'll get back into shape...

1915
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:46,890
and show everyone.

1916
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,559
Round Three will begin.

1917
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,999
(Shin Min Kwon versus Moon Jun On, Who will be the First Class?)

1918
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,399
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1919
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:56,299
(Startled)

1920
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,399
How cute.

1921
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,409
You have confidence. I'll watch carefully.

1922
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:03,210
Look at those youngsters.

1923
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,608
Moon Jun On is on the younger side.

1924
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:10,749
He has only done ballet for two and a half years.

1925
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,020
But he came this far.

1926
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:13,390
It means that he has talent.

1927
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,590
So I became wary of him.

1928
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,429
I thought, "This is insane."

1929
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:20,488
I couldn't believe that my competitor was...

1930
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,760
from Korea National University of Arts.

1931
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,229
I had hopes of joining the First Class.

1932
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,329
I couldn't wait to get started.

1933
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,170
Music,

1934
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:32,609
start.

1935
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:34,809
(How will Ballerino Moon Jun On do on the verge of being First Class?)

1936
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,710
- Let's go. - I hope he does well.

1937
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,049
(Tour en l'air, 3 times)

1938
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:40,250
Tour en l'air.

1939
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:41,919
That's it.

1940
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,250
(Impressed)

1941
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,619
- Not bad. - He can jump well.

1942
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,118
(Tour en l'air, 1st time)

1943
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:51,060
His jumps are powerful. There's nice elasticity.

1944
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,130
What? He's good.

1945
01:19:53,529 --> 01:19:55,828
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

1946
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:57,328
He has nice coordination.

1947
01:19:57,329 --> 01:19:58,829
- Yes. - He does it instinctively.

1948
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:01,539
- He needs to be careful. - My goodness.

1949
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:02,699
Be careful.

1950
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:05,969
My knees continued to ache.

1951
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,238
Let's see the manege.

1952
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:09,309
(Manege)

1953
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:10,609
(Sighing)

1954
01:20:11,079 --> 01:20:12,149
(Grinning)

1955
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:14,549
(Manege)

1956
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:17,478
The back leg was bent. He couldn't push through.

1957
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,289
Because of that, his arms kept going up.

1958
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:23,520
Watching his manege made me think, "I have a chance of winning."

1959
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:26,589
My knees hurt so much.

1960
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,028
(Groaning)

1961
01:20:28,029 --> 01:20:29,429
I decided to jump until the end.

1962
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:31,629
- Keep going until the end. - Keep going until the end.

1963
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:32,970
I think his knees hurt.

1964
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:35,669
(Ciseaux)

1965
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:36,670
(Passe tour en l'air)

1966
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:37,670
(Ending pose)

1967
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:40,408
Two, one. Stop.

1968
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:41,439
(Moon Jun On endured the pain and finished Round 3.)

1969
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,979
He didn't get injured, did he?

1970
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:48,250
He got hurt. I'm 100 percent sure. His knees were hurt.

1971
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,890
My knees hurt too much.

1972
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:55,159
That was when my worry grew.

1973
01:20:56,989 --> 01:21:00,688
If I don't make a big mistake, I'll be able to win.

1974
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,228
(Ballerino Shin Min Kwon takes over!)

1975
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:03,460
Tour en l'air.

1976
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:05,699
Okay.

1977
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:08,839
His tour en l'air is perfect.

1978
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,839
There are definitely comfort and stability.

1979
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,909
(Impressed)

1980
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:14,108
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

1981
01:21:14,109 --> 01:21:15,139
Good.

1982
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,140
He's definitely good.

1983
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:19,349
(Tour en l'air, 3rd time)

1984
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:21,680
- It was clean. - He's very calm.

1985
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,350
Manege.

1986
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:25,788
I had confidence, so I decided to do it as I always have.

1987
01:21:25,789 --> 01:21:27,189
There you go.

1988
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,259
Both legs form a straight line.

1989
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,059
His arm movements are very stable too.

1990
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,699
The upper body movements are very clean.

1991
01:21:38,029 --> 01:21:39,499
It's so clean.

1992
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,369
He did very well. He had good basic skills.

1993
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,810
I thought, "Nice. Let's keep it up until the end."

1994
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:48,509
He has an intelligent vibe when he dances.

1995
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,279
- He's like a gentleman. - He's calm.

1996
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,409
Three...

1997
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:54,108
"Let's get points with the technique I have confidence in,"

1998
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,349
"passe tour en l'air."

1999
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:56,448
(Passe tour en l'air)

2000
01:21:56,449 --> 01:21:57,920
(Ending pose)

2001
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,590
Nice.

2002
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:03,959
(My goodness)

2003
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,159
He really looks like a prince.

2004
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,698
(The last technique, grand pirouette)

2005
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:11,359
I wrapped up well.

2006
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:14,199
Let's join the First Class with the grand pirouette.

2007
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,369
Will my knees hold out?

2008
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,470
It was the last chance to make up for my mistake.

2009
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,709
I decided to forget about my knees and do my absolute best.

2010
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:24,779
I can do it.

2011
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,409
I can do it.

2012
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,379
I'll definitely win. My experience is on another level.

2013
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:33,318
Four, three, two,

2014
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:34,949
one. Go.

2015
01:22:35,319 --> 01:22:36,720
(Round 3, 1-on-1 Fixed Technique, Grand pirouette starts.)

2016
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,960
Nice.

2017
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,430
What? Why is he so good?

2018
01:22:40,659 --> 01:22:41,899
How is he turning so fast?

2019
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:44,629
(Ballerino Moon Jun On shows incredible speed.)

2020
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:45,770
His fouette is nice.

2021
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,398
His pirouette is very nice.

2022
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:48,639
He knows how to turn.

2023
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,670
It's nice.

2024
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,840
They say young blood is scary. He was so fast.

2025
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,709
- Min Kwon... - He's stable.

2026
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,309
- turns in a stable way. - He's stable.

2027
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,709
He's very calm.

2028
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,478
- Yes. - He's very cautious.

2029
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:01,379
- His dance is very calm. - Very.

2030
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,720
- That's why it looks very noble. - Yes.

2031
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:06,250
In terms of the angle and speed, I'm a bit better.

2032
01:23:06,489 --> 01:23:08,590
It's very unexpected. I'm talking about Moon Jun On.

2033
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,118
In terms of technique, Moon Jun On is better.

2034
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:12,130
My goodness.

2035
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:13,590
- What? - What?

2036
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,158
(Moon Jun On loses his balance and falters.)

2037
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,159
What?

2038
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,169
They'll clash.

2039
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,429
(Hold on.)

2040
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,039
They'll clash.

2041
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:25,140
He kept coming closer to me. I was scared that we'd collide.

2042
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,869
They'll clash.

2043
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:28,209
(Faltering)

2044
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,439
Use your strength.

2045
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:34,310
(Moon Jun On finishes turning before the music ends.)

2046
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:35,819
Oh, no.

2047
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:37,318
- Three, - Interesting.

2048
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:39,720
two, one. Stop.

2049
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:41,688
(My goodness)

2050
01:23:41,689 --> 01:23:43,520
Had he landed well, it would've been fine.

2051
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:45,890
(Disappointed)

2052
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,698
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

2053
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:51,299
(He hangs his head.)

2054
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,000
- All right. Thank you. - Finish.

2055
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:57,170
So important.

2056
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,970
It's a big pet peeve of mine when people don't finish.

2057
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,038
I mean, it's so hard.

2058
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,839
It's so... I know it's hard.

2059
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,680
But... Imagine if they had to do that onstage.

2060
01:24:07,949 --> 01:24:08,949
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

2061
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,890
I couldn't believe it. I ended it like a fool.

2062
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:17,419
Even if he couldn't finish doing 32 turns,

2063
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:20,090
he had to fill the music with movements.

2064
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,460
Had I clashed with him, it would've been a disaster.

2065
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,559
I wanted to wrap up...

2066
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,229
even if I had to end the performance a bit earlier.

2067
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,239
The two of you did very well.

2068
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:33,310
We'll now announce the result.

2069
01:24:38,779 --> 01:24:40,710
Shin Min Kwon,

2070
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:43,649
you were very calm and noble.

2071
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,649
You rarely faltered.

2072
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:49,358
You even had a serene smile on your face.

2073
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:50,789
Your performance was impressive.

2074
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:53,689
Moon Jun On, you kept catching my eyes.

2075
01:24:53,989 --> 01:24:55,759
You pushed yourself to finish the performance.

2076
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,599
Your resolution and passion to show what you can do...

2077
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,868
moved me greatly.

2078
01:24:59,869 --> 01:25:03,899
If Shin Min Kwon and Moon Jun On had a difference...

2079
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:07,438
It was a match between passion and basic skills.

2080
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:08,510
Good work.

2081
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:11,009
This is hard.

2082
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,109
I have no idea who'll win.

2083
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:16,749
(Rehearsal Director Matthew moves to announce the result.)

2084
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:20,189
Ballerino Shin Min Kwon and Ballerino Moon Jun On.

2085
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,890
The First Class is...

2086
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:26,590
After advancing this far, I became ambitious.

2087
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:29,529
I thought I had a chance.

2088
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:35,640
You've achieved the highest rank first. Congratulations.

2089
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:36,770
Thank you so much.

2090
01:25:36,771 --> 01:25:38,608
(First)

2091
01:25:38,609 --> 01:25:42,039
(First Class of Group C, Shin Min Kwon)

2092
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:43,310
(Disappointed)

2093
01:25:43,311 --> 01:25:46,050
(The competitors of Group C applaud him.)

2094
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:48,109
It made me happy.

2095
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:50,750
I need to protect the title of First Class.

2096
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:52,519
I'll work hard to do that.

2097
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,020
I'll show everyone who Group C's First Class is.

2098
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:58,119
(Shin Min Kwon in the 1st Class)

2099
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,288
- You're the Second Class. - Thank you.

2100
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:02,100
- Practice the basics a bit harder. - Okay.

2101
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,130
Moon Jun On joined the Second Class.

2102
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:08,270
I was very disappointed.

2103
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:10,300
Had my knees been fine, I would've had a chance.

2104
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:12,738
(Shin Min Kwon and Moon Jun On return...)

2105
01:26:12,739 --> 01:26:13,869
(as members of different classes.)

2106
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:15,779
Your passion and spirit were nice.

2107
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:18,140
You did well. You fought well.

2108
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:19,810
- Youth is the best. - Moon Jun On.

2109
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:22,649
I'll remember his eyes.

2110
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:26,050
We're gaining energy from them. It's a therapeutic experience.

2111
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,688
Dancers who throw their bodies into the performance...

2112
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,060
give a therapeutic experience.

2113
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,028
(Ballet, Physical and Technique Audition)

2114
01:26:33,029 --> 01:26:35,029
(Group D: Kim Kyung Won, Kim Sang Young, and Kim Yu Chan)

2115
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:36,560
(Watching carefully)

2116
01:26:36,829 --> 01:26:38,460
They're neck-and-neck.

2117
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:40,600
I think Group D is the group of death.

2118
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:43,339
Yu Chan is a dancer who studied abroad.

2119
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,899
He was in the Joffrey Ballet.

2120
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:48,339
Kyung Won was in the Korean National Ballet.

2121
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:49,640
Anyone will agree that he's a talented dancer.

2122
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,908
(A tall man stands between the two talented dancers.)

2123
01:26:52,909 --> 01:26:54,578
(Kim Sang Young is a college student with a short and sweet resume.)

2124
01:26:54,579 --> 01:26:55,978
(Worked as a musical actor)

2125
01:26:55,979 --> 01:26:58,149
That was when I became incredibly nervous.

2126
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:01,619
I was contending against professional dancers.

2127
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,988
(His two hands become polite.)

2128
01:27:04,989 --> 01:27:08,489
I realized that I'd have to pull up my energy 100 times more.

2129
01:27:08,859 --> 01:27:10,659
Group D, Kim Yu Chan,

2130
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,600
Kim Sang Young,

2131
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:14,899
Kim Kyung Won.

2132
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:19,839
(Kim Kyung Won blows a kiss in a relaxed way.)

2133
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,339
(Satisfied)

2134
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,339
(He's so relaxed.)

2135
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,350
Nice.

2136
01:27:25,609 --> 01:27:26,850
He's relaxed.

2137
01:27:27,579 --> 01:27:29,449
I have so much confidence.

2138
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:33,250
When they showed us the video of the techniques...

2139
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:34,989
Okay.

2140
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:38,359
I realized that there were many techniques I could do well.

2141
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,359
There was the ciseaux.

2142
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,600
And I have confidence in the cabriole.

2143
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:47,470
I think I'll be the First Class.

2144
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,600
(Glancing over)

2145
01:27:50,869 --> 01:27:52,840
I was a bit worried.

2146
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:56,779
I have confidence in raising one leg and holding the position...

2147
01:27:56,979 --> 01:27:58,850
for the arabesque or doing the pirouette.

2148
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:02,278
But jump techniques aren't my strong suit.

2149
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:03,279
So...

2150
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,420
I decided to use a different strategy.

2151
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:11,559
That was why I decided to join Group D.

2152
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,460
I don't start a losing fight.

2153
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:17,029
I'll leave a strong impression from the start.

2154
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:21,068
Many dancers in the previous groups made mistakes.

2155
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:25,039
So I thought of ways to minimize the mistakes.

2156
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,010
(Practice before the audition)

2157
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:28,539
I can't do the ciseaux.

2158
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,079
I'll do the assemble instead.

2159
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,209
Just like that?

2160
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,448
I need to do what I'm good at.

2161
01:28:32,449 --> 01:28:34,479
I can't perfect a technique in a short amount of time.

2162
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,379
Instead of perfecting a weak technique...

2163
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:38,579
in a short amount of time,

2164
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:41,619
I'll show a strong technique and make an impression.

2165
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,289
I have a plan.

2166
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,989
Let's take our first position, please.

2167
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:50,130
First Class is my goal.

2168
01:28:50,329 --> 01:28:52,199
Let's focus. Let's not get too excited.

2169
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:55,029
Let's follow the plan.

2170
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:57,599
(Staring intently)

2171
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,239
Yu Chan's turn-out is very nice. So is Sang Young's.

2172
01:29:00,909 --> 01:29:02,239
Kyung Won's turn-out is nice too.

2173
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,710
I love the way they're pointing with their back feet.

2174
01:29:05,449 --> 01:29:06,810
I'm looking forward to this group.

2175
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:08,609
Music,

2176
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,749
(Group D, Round 2, Center Technique)

2177
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,750
start.

2178
01:29:10,751 --> 01:29:14,119
(Allonge: A lengthening movement of the arms)

2179
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:15,858
Yu Chan.

2180
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:17,118
(Yu Chan makes a strong impression by using the lines of his body.)

2181
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,829
He's showing his strengths from the start.

2182
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:23,060
He used a bit of a trick.

2183
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:24,430
Pirouette.

2184
01:29:24,729 --> 01:29:26,170
I have confidence in the pirouette.

2185
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,829
- Good. - Good. Sissonne.

2186
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:30,239
One, two, three.

2187
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:31,670
Four turns.

2188
01:29:33,939 --> 01:29:35,578
(Meanwhile, Kim Sang Young and Kim Kyung Won made three turns.)

2189
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,779
I would've loved to see four turns. That was a bit disappointing.

2190
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,379
Sissonne. Double cabriole.

2191
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,149
(Double cabriole: A movement of beating the legs twice in the air)

2192
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:43,449
Okay.

2193
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:46,648
(Kim Kyung Won beat his feet twice in the air.)

2194
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:48,789
Even his double cabriole was perfect.

2195
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,460
Cabriole. One beat was disappointing.

2196
01:29:52,859 --> 01:29:55,960
Making two beats in the air is very difficult.

2197
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,229
I have so much confidence in such techniques.

2198
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:02,069
Grand jete.

2199
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:03,439
(Impressed)

2200
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:06,210
It was nice. He jumped high.

2201
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,170
He's very springy.

2202
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:09,779
He was in the air for a longer period of time.

2203
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:12,279
Yu Chan also seemed to jump very high.

2204
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:14,608
But it wasn't his jump that was nice.

2205
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:16,350
It just seemed that way because he was flexible.

2206
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,179
His jump is incredibly low.

2207
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:21,489
But it looks high since his legs are split in the air.

2208
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,159
As for Sang Young, he stayed on the same level.

2209
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,129
His jump is a bit lacking.

2210
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,429
(Here comes the ciseaux.)

2211
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:29,199
I'm the most confident in the ciseaux.

2212
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,130
Ciseaux.

2213
01:30:32,029 --> 01:30:33,299
(He has my approval.)

2214
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,630
Nice.

2215
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,840
His elasticity is very nice.

2216
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:38,439
He's full of strength.

2217
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,909
(How about Kim Yu Chan who had no confidence in the ciseaux?)

2218
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:45,310
What was that?

2219
01:30:45,579 --> 01:30:46,850
He didn't do the ciseaux.

2220
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:50,648
(Well...)

2221
01:30:50,649 --> 01:30:53,020
I think he did the assemble since he lacked confidence.

2222
01:30:53,819 --> 01:30:55,560
Kim Yu Chan's jump is a bit lacking.

2223
01:30:56,189 --> 01:30:57,858
Instead of doing a technique I have no confidence in,

2224
01:30:57,859 --> 01:30:59,689
I'll show a technique I can do well.

2225
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,390
Chaines.

2226
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,199
Tour en l'air. Yes.

2227
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:09,499
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

2228
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,139
(Just like Kim Yu Chan,)

2229
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,909
(Kim Kyung Won wrapped up in a stable way.)

2230
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:15,439
(Faltering)

2231
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,679
(Kim Sang Young's landing was unstable.)

2232
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,810
(I feel bad.)

2233
01:31:18,409 --> 01:31:21,109
The thing is, it's a big mistake.

2234
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:22,819
I was disappointed.

2235
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:25,220
I'm satisfied with my performance.

2236
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,519
Even though I omitted the ciseaux because I had no confidence,

2237
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,890
I didn't make any big mistakes.

2238
01:31:33,289 --> 01:31:34,989
I focused on that thought throughout the performance.

2239
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:38,969
We'll now reveal the dancer who got cut out...

2240
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:40,869
and joined the Second Class.

2241
01:31:41,869 --> 01:31:42,938
When I was waiting for the result,

2242
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:45,000
what I did badly kept replaying in my head.

2243
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,170
I thought that I might join the Second Class.

2244
01:31:48,609 --> 01:31:50,779
The Second Class dancer is...

2245
01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:53,180
(Turning)

2246
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:01,649
Unfortunately, you've ranked Second.

2247
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,099
Dancer Kim Sang Young.

2248
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,629
Thank you for your hard work.

2249
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:13,829
Sang Young's jump was a bit low.

2250
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:15,970
His core strength was a bit lacking.

2251
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:17,599
Thank you for your hard work.

2252
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,840
(Second Class of Group D, Kim Sang Young)

2253
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:22,640
I really enjoyed the performance.

2254
01:32:22,909 --> 01:32:23,978
Yu Chan,

2255
01:32:23,979 --> 01:32:26,550
your jump was a bit disappointing.

2256
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:30,350
But I thought that your movements were very delicate and flexible.

2257
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:33,219
I enjoyed the way you presented basic techniques.

2258
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,960
When I watched Kim Kyung Won,

2259
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:37,859
it was like a film noir.

2260
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:40,430
Extreme charisma and jumps.

2261
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:43,829
I think that was a very professional power.

2262
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:48,199
Round 3 is the 1-on-1 Fixed Technique.

2263
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,738
Only one ballerino...

2264
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:52,340
can be in the First Class.

2265
01:32:53,239 --> 01:32:55,039
But they're both very good.

2266
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:57,979
This will give us the answer.

2267
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:00,979
- Let's go. - I can do it.

2268
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:05,648
Because I feel confident in moving faster with more power,

2269
01:33:05,649 --> 01:33:08,350
I will be able to win.

2270
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,489
If I beat all these outstanding ballerinos...

2271
01:33:11,689 --> 01:33:14,390
and enter the First Class, it'll be more satisfying.

2272
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:16,300
First position.

2273
01:33:17,329 --> 01:33:18,329
Music,

2274
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:20,699
start.

2275
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:23,269
Five, four...

2276
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:26,738
(Laid-back hand gesture)

2277
01:33:26,739 --> 01:33:28,738
(Charismatic)

2278
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:30,210
(Mesmerized)

2279
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,180
(Stretching)

2280
01:33:32,181 --> 01:33:34,408
(Tour en l'air, 3 times)

2281
01:33:34,409 --> 01:33:36,419
(Tour en l'air, 1st time)

2282
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:37,479
(Exclaiming)

2283
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:39,720
The landing was heavy.

2284
01:33:39,819 --> 01:33:41,020
Nice jump.

2285
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:42,858
(Tour en l'air, 1st time)

2286
01:33:42,859 --> 01:33:45,560
When the spin looks clear in the air,

2287
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:46,890
it looks even better.

2288
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:49,130
That was neat.

2289
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:50,399
I was full of confidence.

2290
01:33:50,829 --> 01:33:52,770
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

2291
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:54,099
That's right.

2292
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:55,170
(Nodding)

2293
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:56,699
I was worried.

2294
01:33:57,439 --> 01:33:58,698
I am the First Class.

2295
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:00,770
(Tour en l'air, 3rd time)

2296
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,039
That's amazing.

2297
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:04,479
(A laid-back smile)

2298
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,049
- Manege. - What have I done until now?

2299
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,249
(Manege)

2300
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,319
Okay. Good.

2301
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:11,279
Keep stretching forward.

2302
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:14,188
He tends to turn his arms upside down,

2303
01:34:14,189 --> 01:34:16,189
but still, it's very nice.

2304
01:34:16,289 --> 01:34:17,390
It wasn't impressive enough.

2305
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,389
Three, two...

2306
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:21,028
(Passe tour en l'air)

2307
01:34:21,029 --> 01:34:22,729
(Kim Kyung Won's ending pose)

2308
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:23,930
Okay.

2309
01:34:23,931 --> 01:34:25,130
(They can't take their eyes off Kim Kyung Won's moves.)

2310
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:26,670
Nice jump.

2311
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,769
He showed masculine energy.

2312
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:29,898
(Kim Yu Chan presents his techniques next.)

2313
01:34:29,899 --> 01:34:31,368
I should be confident.

2314
01:34:31,369 --> 01:34:32,568
(Kim Yu Chan presents his techniques next.)

2315
01:34:32,569 --> 01:34:33,938
(Tour en l'air, 3 times)

2316
01:34:33,939 --> 01:34:36,539
(Tour en l'air, 1st time)

2317
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:38,710
His jumps are rather weak.

2318
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,078
A bit more.

2319
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:42,619
(Tour en l'air, 2nd time)

2320
01:34:42,949 --> 01:34:43,979
Oh, no.

2321
01:34:44,449 --> 01:34:46,689
Yu Chan looks like he turns once in the air...

2322
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,549
and finishes the rest on the ground.

2323
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,590
I have a chance.

2324
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,829
His jumps and spins are a bummer.

2325
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:54,988
(Manege)

2326
01:34:54,989 --> 01:34:56,430
I feel confident in manege.

2327
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,368
(They are...)

2328
01:34:59,369 --> 01:35:00,698
(impressed.)

2329
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:01,699
Gosh.

2330
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,099
(Manege)

2331
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,369
He's clearly flexible.

2332
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:07,710
It's pretty. So pretty.

2333
01:35:07,909 --> 01:35:09,479
(Nervous)

2334
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:13,810
The angle was different compared to Kim Kyung Won's manege,

2335
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:16,350
He was good at jumping.

2336
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,879
That is...

2337
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,819
one nice and flexible manege.

2338
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:24,390
His manege is nice to see since he's flexible.

2339
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,789
(Passe tour en l'air and ending pose)

2340
01:35:28,029 --> 01:35:29,560
His manege was really pretty.

2341
01:35:31,399 --> 01:35:32,430
Good job.

2342
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:34,369
The two are complete opposites.

2343
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,300
I want to give Yu Chan points for manege.

2344
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,170
And I want to give Kyung Won points for tour en l'air.

2345
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:44,778
We'll have to see the pirouette...

2346
01:35:44,779 --> 01:35:46,079
- To know. - to decide it, right?

2347
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:49,009
(Kim Kyung Won and Kim Yu Chan get ready for the grand pirouette.)

2348
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,679
(Kim Kyung Won and Kim Yu Chan ran out of breath...)

2349
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,379
(due to the series of technique combinations.)

2350
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,449
Yu Chan.

2351
01:35:53,989 --> 01:35:55,049
(Kim Kyung Won passes Kim Yu Chan water.)

2352
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,060
Thank you.

2353
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:58,589
He looked pitiful.

2354
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,729
I'm so drained. He must be drained too.

2355
01:36:02,529 --> 01:36:03,560
(Exhaling)

2356
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,198
Good luck.

2357
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,000
(Although they're rivals, they root for each other.)

2358
01:36:07,569 --> 01:36:11,140
Are you two ready? Let's begin the grand pirouette.

2359
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:15,068
(At that moment, Coach Ryu Hoi Woong notices something.)

2360
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,079
Hey.

2361
01:36:16,779 --> 01:36:17,909
(Look at this.)

2362
01:36:18,409 --> 01:36:20,250
Gosh. In here?

2363
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,680
It says Yu Chan is good at grand pirouette.

2364
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:27,350
(Kim Yu Chan picked grand pirouette as his confident technique.)

2365
01:36:27,789 --> 01:36:30,960
I'm good at grand pirouette, and I feel confident about it.

2366
01:36:31,859 --> 01:36:33,829
I can't help but become the First Class.

2367
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:37,029
I'll have to focus as much as I can.

2368
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:39,130
First position.

2369
01:36:39,829 --> 01:36:41,470
Music, start.

2370
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,499
Five, four,

2371
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,170
- three, two... - He's already confident.

2372
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:49,310
(Round 3, 1-on-1 Fixed Technique, grand pirouette starts.)

2373
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:52,850
- Nice. - Good.

2374
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:54,849
(Watching)

2375
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:55,879
(Yu Chan and Kyung Won continue with stable grand pirouettes.)

2376
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,779
Good. They're both very good.

2377
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:00,819
- They're very good. - Keep it up.

2378
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:02,149
(At that moment)

2379
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,589
He's bending his leg.

2380
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:05,889
(Did I see that right?)

2381
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:06,988
(Spotting)

2382
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:08,390
My legs became jelly.

2383
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,000
Kyung Won's leg is getting tired.

2384
01:37:13,069 --> 01:37:15,899
I expected him to falter.

2385
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,939
I'll end it here.

2386
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,509
(Kim Yu Chan even shows a variation.)

2387
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:25,509
(Eyes focused)

2388
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:26,810
Gosh.

2389
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,680
Gosh.

2390
01:37:30,579 --> 01:37:31,579
He looked like a swan, didn't he?

2391
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:33,750
He's putting on a very difficult technique.

2392
01:37:34,689 --> 01:37:36,319
I have to say Yu Chan is good.

2393
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:38,859
I'll endure it until the end.

2394
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:41,729
(One more time!)

2395
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,129
(Impressive)

2396
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:45,158
How...

2397
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:46,300
(How is that possible?)

2398
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:47,699
He nailed it.

2399
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,469
(Yu Chan finished it before the music.)

2400
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:54,709
(That's a shame.)

2401
01:37:54,710 --> 01:37:55,738
(No.)

2402
01:37:55,739 --> 01:37:57,779
I'll grit my teeth and endure it.

2403
01:37:58,279 --> 01:37:59,750
- Until the end. - Until the end.

2404
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,779
Yes. Finish it no matter what.

2405
01:38:05,949 --> 01:38:09,358
(Kim Kyung Won finishes the grand pirouette according to the music.)

2406
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:12,219
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

2407
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,130
He should've turned until the end. That was a shame.

2408
01:38:14,529 --> 01:38:15,659
(Nodding)

2409
01:38:17,859 --> 01:38:18,930
(Sighing)

2410
01:38:19,229 --> 01:38:20,698
If I messed up the ending,

2411
01:38:20,699 --> 01:38:24,340
I might as well do chaines, despite losing points.

2412
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:29,010
I did my best with no regrets.

2413
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:30,779
(Respect)

2414
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:31,840
Awesome.

2415
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:34,148
That was crazy.

2416
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:35,778
That was neck-and-neck.

2417
01:38:35,779 --> 01:38:37,579
How are they going to choose?

2418
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:39,019
I think Kyung Won...

2419
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,020
(The master and coaches begin discussing.)

2420
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:41,250
was better.

2421
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:43,390
Kyung Won was better,

2422
01:38:43,789 --> 01:38:46,759
but we can't ignore the grand pirouette.

2423
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:47,828
He did a good job.

2424
01:38:47,829 --> 01:38:48,889
(Kim Yu Chan put on the perfect grand pirouette.)

2425
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:51,060
His attitude and posture.

2426
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,299
(The master and coaches have a disagreement for a while.)

2427
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,029
I felt that his grand pirouettes...

2428
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:57,199
Kyung Won was really nice.

2429
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,710
(Kim Kyung Won's tour en l'air was better.)

2430
01:39:00,039 --> 01:39:02,068
(Kim Yu Chan's manege was better.)

2431
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:05,840
(Although Kim Kyung Won's pose was a bummer, he still finished it.)

2432
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:09,449
(Kim Yu Chan's pose was perfect, but he didn't finish it.)

2433
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:12,649
(Who will be the one to become First Class?)

2434
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:14,920
I'll announce the result.

2435
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,288
One of you will become First Class.

2436
01:39:18,289 --> 01:39:20,590
And the other will become Second Class.

2437
01:39:20,689 --> 01:39:21,960
I vote for Kyung Won.

2438
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:24,159
I vote for Yu Chan.

2439
01:39:24,529 --> 01:39:26,329
I'll announce the result.

2440
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,898
Between the two, the First Class is...

2441
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:29,970
(Who will win the First Class?)

2442
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,369
We couldn't decide it.

2443
01:39:33,909 --> 01:39:36,579
(Unable to judge)

2444
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:37,779
What?

2445
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:39,310
(Then what's going to happen?)

2446
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:43,020
So we're going to ask you for a favour.

2447
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:46,019
(A favour?)

2448
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,618
Can you put on...

2449
01:39:48,619 --> 01:39:50,988
your best ballet moves...

2450
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:53,089
in 32 counts?

2451
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:56,629
But it should be something that shows...

2452
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:58,260
ballet techniques and basic ballet skills.

2453
01:39:58,899 --> 01:39:59,899
It's not easy.

2454
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,568
That must be really tough.

2455
01:40:01,569 --> 01:40:03,199
How are they going to do that?

2456
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:05,399
It's the end. I must pull it off.

2457
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:08,039
My goal is to become First Class.

2458
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:10,779
Let's start with Kim Kyung Won.

2459
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,409
First position.

2460
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:14,949
Music, start.

2461
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:17,478
(The master and coaches' unprecedented suggestion)

2462
01:40:17,479 --> 01:40:19,180
(What will Kim Kyung Won present?)

2463
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:21,250
It's already begun with his pose.

2464
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:25,119
Should I show my best technique I already showed in Round Three?

2465
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:29,699
I'll prove myself in an artistic way.

2466
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:30,899
Go.

2467
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,228
(Impressed)

2468
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:36,369
(Amazing)

2469
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:38,800
Gosh.

2470
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:41,640
(He's good.)

2471
01:40:41,909 --> 01:40:43,810
I can do better than that.

2472
01:40:44,109 --> 01:40:45,210
Gosh.

2473
01:40:47,649 --> 01:40:48,949
Okay.

2474
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:52,619
It's amazing.

2475
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:53,890
It's wonderful.

2476
01:40:58,789 --> 01:40:59,789
Nice.

2477
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:03,559
It's like watching a scene from "Carmen."

2478
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,560
It reminds me of "Carmen."

2479
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,869
Stay focused until the end.

2480
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:14,039
Three, two, one.

2481
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:15,438
Stop.

2482
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:16,509
Gosh.

2483
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:18,739
(Wrapping up with a controlled posture)

2484
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:21,350
Well done.

2485
01:41:21,949 --> 01:41:22,949
(Approved)

2486
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,779
That was cool.

2487
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:28,419
- That was sexy. - I could feel...

2488
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:29,460
his years of experience.

2489
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:32,460
(Kim Kyung Won presented his charm with his artistic performance.)

2490
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:35,430
I'm embarrassed.

2491
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:38,760
(Kim Kyung Won is embarrassed after performing.)

2492
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,500
I'm so tired.

2493
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,270
Kim Yu Chan will start.

2494
01:41:43,939 --> 01:41:45,000
First position.

2495
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,609
Music, start.

2496
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,479
(Kim Yu Chan starts from the corner of the stage.)

2497
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:52,579
What's he planning to do in the far back?

2498
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:57,119
I've had many regrets.

2499
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:01,420
This time, I decided to show my strength.

2500
01:42:03,489 --> 01:42:05,989
Five, four, three,

2501
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:07,789
two, one.

2502
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:09,630
Go.

2503
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:14,499
(Eyes focused)

2504
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:19,969
(A light and flexible jump to present his shape)

2505
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:22,909
(Everyone is in awe.)

2506
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:25,279
Gosh.

2507
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:27,108
Gosh.

2508
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:29,010
(Kim Yu Chan dances all over the stage.)

2509
01:42:29,649 --> 01:42:32,220
- He's flexible. - It's very nice.

2510
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:34,648
(Kim Yu Chan's specialty, the grand pirouette)

2511
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:35,989
He still has stamina left?

2512
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,319
Yu Chan is full of energy.

2513
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:43,260
(Kim Yu Chan overpowers the stage with his perfect technique.)

2514
01:42:46,569 --> 01:42:47,729
He's doing even better.

2515
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:50,938
(A perfect turn)

2516
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:53,339
(A relaxed expression as if he's enjoying the stage)

2517
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:56,939
Three, two, one. Stop.

2518
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,448
Two, one. Stop.

2519
01:43:00,449 --> 01:43:01,449
(A charismatic end pose)

2520
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:05,919
That was unbelievable.

2521
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,288
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

2522
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:12,259
(Kim Yu Chan showed off his various techniques and specialty.)

2523
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,329
(As expected from the ballet strategist)

2524
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:19,430
Dancers, please move to the center of the stage for your evaluations.

2525
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:20,770
That was insane.

2526
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:22,130
He's unbeatable.

2527
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:24,170
Yu Chan had a great strategy.

2528
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,609
- Who do you think it'll be? - Yu Chan.

2529
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:29,038
- That was... - I'm the opposite.

2530
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:30,108
- Really? - Yes.

2531
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:31,310
Both of them were amazing.

2532
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:32,609
It's tough.

2533
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:34,449
Your dances were superb.

2534
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:35,948
It was as we expected.

2535
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:38,478
Kim Kyung Won showed us...

2536
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:40,089
his confident energy.

2537
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:42,349
Kim Yu Chan showed us his classic technique,

2538
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:44,590
based on his basic skills.

2539
01:43:44,789 --> 01:43:47,089
Both of you are very different dancers...

2540
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:49,799
and offer very different qualities.

2541
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,630
So I think both of you should feel successful today in what you showed.

2542
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,199
I will announce the result.

2543
01:43:56,869 --> 01:43:59,470
Ballerino Kim Kyung Won and Ballerino Kim Yu Chan.

2544
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:01,810
The First Class is...

2545
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:04,510
Who is it?

2546
01:44:04,939 --> 01:44:07,909
(Who is Ballet Group D's First Class?)

2547
01:44:08,779 --> 01:44:10,379
Ballerino Kim Yu Chan.

2548
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:11,879
(Group D First Class Kim Yu Chan)

2549
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:12,949
Congratulations.

2550
01:44:14,119 --> 01:44:15,589
Ballerino Kim Yu Chan.

2551
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:16,689
(Bummed out)

2552
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:21,390
(Comforting each other after their hard work)

2553
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:24,930
(He agrees.)

2554
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:27,368
You achieved the highest rank of first place.

2555
01:44:27,369 --> 01:44:28,469
- Congratulations. - Thank you so much.

2556
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:30,140
- You were amazing. - Thank you.

2557
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:37,078
Failing the ciseaux move...

2558
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:40,349
in Round Two kept bothering me.

2559
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:42,608
So I did the grand jete,

2560
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:46,179
a different jump move,

2561
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:48,289
to highlight my flexibility.

2562
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:51,188
I didn't hold back on anything,

2563
01:44:51,189 --> 01:44:52,460
which makes me happy.

2564
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:56,828
Ballerino Kim Kyung Won is in Second Class.

2565
01:44:56,829 --> 01:44:57,999
(Group D Second Class Kang Gyeong Ho)

2566
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,670
Unfortunately, I got placed in Second Class.

2567
01:45:00,869 --> 01:45:04,339
But I'm satisfied with giving it my best in the audition...

2568
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:07,170
and don't regret anything.

2569
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,669
(The two finally smile.)

2570
01:45:08,670 --> 01:45:09,710
You're First Class.

2571
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:12,279
I'm exhausted.

2572
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:13,850
Great job.

2573
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:18,919
(24 Korean dance classical scholars appear)

2574
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:21,688
(Will there be a rival match between Ki Moo Gan and Choi Ho Jong?)

2575
01:45:21,689 --> 01:45:23,389
(24 contemporary dance beasts appear)

2576
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:26,019
(The beasts are highly competitive.)

2577
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:30,459
(The Physical and Technique Audition is finally starting.)

2578
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:34,399
(The deadly battle to become First Class begins.)

2579
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,640
(STF Dance Company where the dancers gather)

2580
01:45:40,069 --> 01:45:41,310
(What is the last genre to enter?)

2581
01:45:42,039 --> 01:45:44,608
(The orange locker room is prepared to welcome the dancers.)

2582
01:45:44,609 --> 01:45:46,379
(This bright and neat space is...)

2583
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:47,649
(the Korean dance locker room.)

2584
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,250
- Hi. - Hi.

2585
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,219
(A Korean dancer with strong facial features appears)

2586
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,389
I'm Jang Sung Bum in Korean dance.

2587
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:57,489
Despite having exotic features,

2588
01:45:57,789 --> 01:46:01,289
I'm Jang Sung Bum who's majoring in Korean dance.

2589
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:03,129
"Where are you from?"

2590
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:05,358
People guess the Arab countries.

2591
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:06,499
(An Arabian feature)

2592
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,300
My hobby is playing Go.

2593
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:10,299
I like makgeolli.

2594
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,999
My favourite ice creams are the ones elders like with red beans...

2595
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,039
and chestnuts.

2596
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:16,209
I may have exotic features,

2597
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:18,879
but I can express the Korean vibe well.

2598
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,948
(He has the Korean moves.)

2599
01:46:19,949 --> 01:46:21,578
In a recent competition,

2600
01:46:21,579 --> 01:46:25,180
everyone said that I had a good physique and great technique.

2601
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:28,148
The technique I'm most confident in is the walkover.

2602
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:30,020
I can do it smoothly.

2603
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,619
Give it to me.

2604
01:46:31,859 --> 01:46:35,060
The guy I came with today is Sung Hun Mo.

2605
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:36,929
He's my only guy friend...

2606
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:39,028
from Chung-Ang University's freshmen of 2018.

2607
01:46:39,029 --> 01:46:41,868
My focus is on Korean interpretative dance,

2608
01:46:41,869 --> 01:46:44,170
while he is focused on traditional dance.

2609
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,099
Korean interpretative dance...

2610
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:49,509
utilizes traditional breathing and moves as the base...

2611
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:51,978
to add modern moves.

2612
01:46:51,979 --> 01:46:53,310
That's what Korean interpretative dance is.

2613
01:46:53,779 --> 01:46:55,679
The charms of Korean traditional dance are...

2614
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,219
moving the legs heavily,

2615
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:01,419
the chest lightly, and the fingers in detail using our breath.

2616
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:02,948
Korean traditional dance...

2617
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:05,959
encompasses Korean sentiments and the people's outlook...

2618
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,390
on the world.

2619
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:09,688
Hi. I'm a 24-year-old...

2620
01:47:09,689 --> 01:47:11,800
Korean dancer, Sung Hun Mo.

2621
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,698
Majoring in Korean traditional dance,

2622
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:17,640
I'm taking courses in National Intangible Cultural Heritage's...

2623
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,839
Gang Seon Yeong Taepyeongmu...

2624
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,140
and Seoul Intangible Cultural Heritage's Hanryangmu.

2625
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,379
It's here. "Korean dance."

2626
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:26,809
- Let's go in. - My heart is pounding.

2627
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:28,108
(Entering)

2628
01:47:28,109 --> 01:47:29,109
(The two enter excitedly.)

2629
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:30,850
- My gosh. - We're sharing the locker room.

2630
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,578
It's so fascinating.

2631
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:33,618
(We're here!)

2632
01:47:33,619 --> 01:47:34,648
(Opening)

2633
01:47:34,649 --> 01:47:36,288
(Let's have a look.)

2634
01:47:36,289 --> 01:47:37,389
There are a lot of bits and bobs.

2635
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:38,459
(Customized gifts for the dancers)

2636
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,158
(We love gifts.)

2637
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,228
(While they're looking around the locker room...)

2638
01:47:41,229 --> 01:47:42,289
(Startled)

2639
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:43,929
(What?)

2640
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:45,559
(Name: Jang Sung Bum, Age: 25)

2641
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,599
(Embarrassed)

2642
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,129
(His beautiful profile photo made his friend laugh.)

2643
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:49,970
Fifteen points rank you fourteenth.

2644
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:52,000
You're sharing 17th place.

2645
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:53,669
I'm in the far back.

2646
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:54,738
(Shocked)

2647
01:47:54,739 --> 01:47:57,180
Neither of us even ranked in the middle.

2648
01:47:57,579 --> 01:48:01,009
I thought my physical score could become a weakness.

2649
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:02,010
(A little anxious)

2650
01:48:03,579 --> 01:48:04,619
What?

2651
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:07,220
(What's that?)

2652
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:09,489
A shared second place.

2653
01:48:09,619 --> 01:48:11,618
Five points for squats, five points for push-ups,

2654
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:13,188
five points for rotational stability,

2655
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:14,328
and three points for balance.

2656
01:48:14,329 --> 01:48:16,358
- I could've done better. - Right?

2657
01:48:16,359 --> 01:48:19,130
- You're highly competitive. - I am.

2658
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,469
I can do it.

2659
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:21,499
(Burning with motivation)

2660
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,799
As a dancer,

2661
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,898
I get highly motivated...

2662
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:27,310
if my physique falls behind.

2663
01:48:27,369 --> 01:48:29,608
The presence...

2664
01:48:29,609 --> 01:48:32,779
my gifted physique gives out is my strongest point.

2665
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:34,380
Physique is the most important.

2666
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:36,549
(Judging Groups Register)

2667
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:37,920
I have to stick it on here?

2668
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,478
(The dancers register for the Korean Dance...)

2669
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:40,919
(Physical and Technique Audition.)

2670
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,118
(They will be judged in their registered groups.)

2671
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:44,159
Group D.

2672
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:48,960
I don't really mind who I go up against.

2673
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:51,460
As long as it's not Hyo Joon.

2674
01:48:52,329 --> 01:48:55,099
I'm Kim Hyo Joon who's majoring in Korean dance.

2675
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:56,868
My body...

2676
01:48:56,869 --> 01:48:59,568
is made of compressed muscles from dancing.

2677
01:48:59,569 --> 01:49:00,969
A body fat percentage of 3 is a 1st.

2678
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:02,339
Do you manage your body fat?

2679
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,439
No. I only dance a lot.

2680
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:07,448
As I dance, I make great use of...

2681
01:49:07,449 --> 01:49:09,479
my flexibility and muscular strength.

2682
01:49:09,779 --> 01:49:11,250
I'm confident in everything.

2683
01:49:11,449 --> 01:49:13,649
But my techniques stand out.

2684
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:16,589
I modify jaban.

2685
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:19,090
Utilizing novel textures and physical moves.

2686
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:21,358
My goodness.

2687
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:23,699
(The two are made speechless by their outstanding rivals.)

2688
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:25,930
(Nervous)

2689
01:49:26,229 --> 01:49:27,369
What now?

2690
01:49:27,899 --> 01:49:29,939
- We saw them at the concert hall. - I know.

2691
01:49:30,899 --> 01:49:33,738
I went to watch Hyo Joon's performances a couple of times.

2692
01:49:33,739 --> 01:49:34,769
(This is bad.)

2693
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:35,809
He's here.

2694
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:36,879
(This is bad.)

2695
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,408
Both of them have a lot of experience...

2696
01:49:39,409 --> 01:49:41,949
and are excellent dancers.

2697
01:49:42,949 --> 01:49:44,049
What now?

2698
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:45,978
I hope they don't stick it next to mine.

2699
01:49:45,979 --> 01:49:47,289
(Spacing out)

2700
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,648
Is it because the two are on top and bottom?

2701
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:51,220
I can't take my eyes off those spots.

2702
01:49:51,289 --> 01:49:53,389
Right? I was going to go for Group B.

2703
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:55,130
But Groups C and D don't look bad.

2704
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:57,460
Shall we split into Groups C and D?

2705
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:00,599
- I can feel it. - Which group is it?

2706
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,599
I'm going to this group.

2707
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:03,600
(Which group did Kim Si Won choose?)

2708
01:50:03,601 --> 01:50:05,238
(Korean Dance Locker Room)

2709
01:50:05,239 --> 01:50:06,270
What?

2710
01:50:07,609 --> 01:50:09,709
(Sung Hun Mo's neighbouring spots have been filled.)

2711
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:10,710
(A bitter smile)

2712
01:50:10,711 --> 01:50:12,578
Hun Mo. You've been chosen.

2713
01:50:12,579 --> 01:50:13,810
(Laughing)

2714
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:16,778
Why?

2715
01:50:16,779 --> 01:50:18,019
(Why me?)

2716
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:19,078
Why?

2717
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:20,119
(Why is it me?)

2718
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:21,549
Why?

2719
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,789
Why are you doing this to me?

2720
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:27,029
Hyo Joon or Si Won? Who stuck their name next to mine?

2721
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:28,188
(Opening)

2722
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:29,789
(The two dancers who made them tense appear.)

2723
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:31,559
- Hi. - Hi.

2724
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,799
- Hi. - Hi.

2725
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,898
- Hi. - Hi.

2726
01:50:33,899 --> 01:50:34,999
Hi.

2727
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,369
(Nervous and wary)

2728
01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:37,770
(Peeking)

2729
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,238
(The locker room is filled with tension after an awkward greeting.)

2730
01:50:41,239 --> 01:50:43,510
My heart is pounding.

2731
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:46,309
(Looking around)

2732
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:47,979
Who is next to me?

2733
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:49,550
The locker next to Hun Mo's.

2734
01:50:50,149 --> 01:50:51,278
(A solemn face)

2735
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:52,979
(Getting nervous as well)

2736
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:55,949
Did you choose Group C?

2737
01:50:56,189 --> 01:50:57,659
(Unresponsive)

2738
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:02,289
Did I look easy to deal with?

2739
01:51:03,329 --> 01:51:04,460
(Walking on eggshells)

2740
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,300
(What?)

2741
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,170
(Kim Hyo Joon chose Group C.)

2742
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,999
I know his techniques and physique are great.

2743
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,038
(Shocked)

2744
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:14,269
I'm scared.

2745
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:15,868
My eyes were drawn to it.

2746
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:18,979
Whoever I compete against, I'm confident about winning.

2747
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:21,478
(The locker room is silent after the group reveal.)

2748
01:51:21,479 --> 01:51:23,209
(Glancing)

2749
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:24,919
(Pressured)

2750
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,219
(Kim Si Won can't take his eye off someone.)

2751
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,618
- We have similar hairstyles. - Right.

2752
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:29,289
- Yes, our concepts overlap. - Right?

2753
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:31,819
(The dancers' exotic features and long hair overlap.)

2754
01:51:32,119 --> 01:51:33,318
But I'm wearing a binyeo.

2755
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:35,389
My hair is probably prettier.

2756
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:37,100
(Kim Si Won: I have the best long hair!)

2757
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:39,229
Do you two know each other?

2758
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:41,299
- We're friends. - University friends.

2759
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:42,600
(Surprised)

2760
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:45,198
- Which university are you from? - Sungkyunkwan University.

2761
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,399
Same here.

2762
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,509
Are people from the same university coming together?

2763
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:49,609
It seems like it.

2764
01:51:49,869 --> 01:51:51,039
(At that moment)

2765
01:51:51,609 --> 01:51:53,209
(Turning)

2766
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:56,010
- Kyu Nyeon's here. - Kim Kyu Nyeon. It's Kyu Nyeon.

2767
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:58,380
"The next-generation Korean dance talent."

2768
01:51:58,649 --> 01:52:00,949
Kyu Nyeon came first this year.

2769
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:03,319
(Judging Groups Register)

2770
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:05,319
Hi.

2771
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,629
I'm a 23-year-old Korean dancer, Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2772
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:10,930
I won quite a lot of competitions.

2773
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,068
I must've won about ten awards in middle school.

2774
01:52:14,069 --> 01:52:15,129
(An awards collector since middle and high school)

2775
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:18,099
I won the Grand Prize and Kim Paek Pong Award...

2776
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:20,608
in the 54th Dong-A Dance Competition...

2777
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:22,938
for general interpretative dance.

2778
01:52:22,939 --> 01:52:24,109
(The talent among talents)

2779
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:26,339
The guys I came with today...

2780
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:29,210
are Park Jun Woo and Kim Jong Cheol.

2781
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,578
We're like a family...

2782
01:52:30,579 --> 01:52:32,549
from Korea National University of Arts.

2783
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:33,789
That's why we came together.

2784
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:36,789
Jun Woo has good techniques.

2785
01:52:37,619 --> 01:52:39,420
His jaban jumps are great.

2786
01:52:39,689 --> 01:52:42,059
The floor technique I created...

2787
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:44,228
was very novel.

2788
01:52:44,229 --> 01:52:45,800
I'm good at it.

2789
01:52:46,529 --> 01:52:48,629
And I'm confident in making use of...

2790
01:52:48,630 --> 01:52:50,339
the smooth moves of Korean dance.

2791
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:51,670
Those are my charming points.

2792
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:57,009
Kyu Nyeon and Jong Cheol are my top competitors.

2793
01:52:57,010 --> 01:53:01,010
As for Jong Cheol, he has a sexy physique.

2794
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:03,109
Jong Cheol.

2795
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,020
"A wild charm?" He does look wild.

2796
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:07,420
He has a great body.

2797
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:10,618
Physique-wise, I heard I was masculine...

2798
01:53:10,619 --> 01:53:13,560
and had great muscles.

2799
01:53:14,029 --> 01:53:15,929
- I was shocked... - Yes?

2800
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:17,659
when you walked inside.

2801
01:53:18,029 --> 01:53:22,069
Among the dancers I met here, you have a well-built upper body.

2802
01:53:22,329 --> 01:53:24,939
I like physiques like yours.

2803
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,369
Thank you.

2804
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:31,210
I'm a lot more muscular compared to other dancers.

2805
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:34,549
Many have told me my dance...

2806
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:36,710
is erotic and sexy.

2807
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:40,149
Jong Cheol is very young.

2808
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:41,720
He's 21 years old.

2809
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:43,889
Isn't your age gap wide?

2810
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:47,389
The dancers could be my disciples.

2811
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:48,390
(Disciples?)

2812
01:53:48,391 --> 01:53:51,300
It doesn't feel easy anymore.

2813
01:53:51,859 --> 01:53:54,299
(His possible disciples have chosen their groups.)

2814
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:56,328
(Kim Si Won and Jang Sung Bum have competitors now.)

2815
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,898
(Gone mad?)

2816
01:53:57,899 --> 01:53:58,899
(Glaring)

2817
01:53:59,439 --> 01:54:01,669
(Can't help but let out a sigh)

2818
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:04,479
A guy stuck his name in the group I was in.

2819
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,880
Who is it?

2820
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,180
I want to know who stuck his name next to mine.

2821
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:09,350
Kyu Nyeon?

2822
01:54:09,449 --> 01:54:10,449
(His lips are trembling.)

2823
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:12,179
- Jun Woo? - I think it's the other guy.

2824
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:13,278
- Jong Cheol? - Yes.

2825
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:14,688
(You mean Jong Cheol?)

2826
01:54:14,689 --> 01:54:16,288
(Opening)

2827
01:54:16,289 --> 01:54:18,089
- Hi. - Welcome.

2828
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:19,460
(Kim Jong Cheol arrives just in time.)

2829
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:22,859
- Hi. - Hi.

2830
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:24,299
(Who stuck their names next to Jang Sung Bum and Kim Si Won?)

2831
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:25,499
(Peeking)

2832
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:26,658
(There's a tension in the locker room.)

2833
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:27,869
I'm using the third one.

2834
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:29,269
Okay.

2835
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:32,039
So, who is it next to Si Won?

2836
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:33,609
(Curious)

2837
01:54:33,909 --> 01:54:35,109
It's one of us.

2838
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:37,310
Is it Kyu Nyeon?

2839
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:39,239
(Looking away)

2840
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:41,078
(Kim Kyu Nyeon answers with an awkward laugh.)

2841
01:54:41,079 --> 01:54:42,249
(Not giving up)

2842
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,979
- Jun Woo. - Yes?

2843
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:46,020
You're avoiding my eyes.

2844
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:47,449
(Laughing)

2845
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:49,250
Wait for me.

2846
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:52,719
(The laughs can't cover up the suspense.)

2847
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,029
(Which group did the three K-Arts students choose?)

2848
01:54:55,859 --> 01:54:57,959
(Kim Jong Cheol chose Group B.)

2849
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,459
(Trying hard to smile)

2850
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:00,470
(Come on.)

2851
01:55:01,130 --> 01:55:02,198
It's okay.

2852
01:55:02,199 --> 01:55:03,799
Is it because you like me?

2853
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:04,840
Of course.

2854
01:55:05,069 --> 01:55:06,769
That wasn't what you said earlier.

2855
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:08,438
(Flustered)

2856
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:09,710
Am I worth a try?

2857
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:11,380
(Why did Kim Jong Cheol choose Group B?)

2858
01:55:11,710 --> 01:55:13,509
- Do we stick it on now? - Yes.

2859
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:14,510
This is crazy.

2860
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:15,510
(What do I do?)

2861
01:55:15,979 --> 01:55:17,020
I choose this spot.

2862
01:55:17,449 --> 01:55:20,020
Si Won. I'll stick to you.

2863
01:55:20,489 --> 01:55:22,889
(Is it out of admiration for Si Won?)

2864
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:24,689
I'll bring you down.

2865
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:26,319
(Smiling)

2866
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,228
The technique...

2867
01:55:28,229 --> 01:55:30,728
is not Kim Si Won's strong point.

2868
01:55:30,729 --> 01:55:32,859
I can earn First Class.

2869
01:55:33,829 --> 01:55:35,729
Did he think I was beatable?

2870
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,670
Then I'll show him.

2871
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:40,738
Give it your best, Jong Cheol, because I will too.

2872
01:55:40,739 --> 01:55:41,739
(Angry)

2873
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:43,209
Where do I go?

2874
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:45,510
These two are incredible.

2875
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:49,010
But this audition has to do with physique and technique.

2876
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:51,350
- Must we avoid the youngsters? - Yes.

2877
01:55:51,619 --> 01:55:54,488
Kim Si Won is my high school senior.

2878
01:55:54,489 --> 01:55:56,649
A junior challenging his senior. Group B.

2879
01:55:57,289 --> 01:55:58,859
I'll see you on stage, kids.

2880
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,890
Come on. I'm full of confidence.

2881
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:02,559
"Former acrobat?"

2882
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,460
"Gymnastic acrobatics?"

2883
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:06,500
We have our first five-star technique.

2884
01:56:07,229 --> 01:56:08,329
I was taken aback.

2885
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:12,299
New words like cartwheel full twist, corkscrew, and such.

2886
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,710
Are those techniques by Korean dancers?

2887
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:16,710
- Hi. - Hi.

2888
01:56:18,010 --> 01:56:19,079
We're doomed.

2889
01:56:19,579 --> 01:56:21,349
(They chose the empty groups, A and F.)

2890
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:22,578
(Everyone is relieved.)

2891
01:56:22,579 --> 01:56:24,118
(Thank goodness.)

2892
01:56:24,119 --> 01:56:25,180
Gosh.

2893
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:27,920
It was a relief they weren't in my group.

2894
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:33,090
More and more interesting people are arriving.

2895
01:56:33,729 --> 01:56:35,028
(The reveal of a new profile...)

2896
01:56:35,029 --> 01:56:36,029
(shocks everyone.)

2897
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:38,228
(A dancer startling everyone is here?)

2898
01:56:38,229 --> 01:56:39,358
He's here.

2899
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:40,630
Ho Jong is here.

2900
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,000
He has all gold, silver, and bronze.

2901
01:56:43,369 --> 01:56:44,698
See that hashtag?

2902
01:56:44,699 --> 01:56:46,239
"National Dance Company of Korea lead dancer."

2903
01:56:46,739 --> 01:56:47,869
He's named.

2904
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:49,439
The best in Korea.

2905
01:56:49,609 --> 01:56:51,009
Choi Ho Jong.

2906
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:53,478
He is the dancer to dancers.

2907
01:56:53,479 --> 01:56:55,250
I can risk everything on him.

2908
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:56,479
He's indomitable.

2909
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,649
- My role model. - A legend.

2910
01:56:59,079 --> 01:57:01,749
He's been the lead dancer...

2911
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:04,189
of the best national dance company.

2912
01:57:04,619 --> 01:57:07,889
A dancer would've watched his competition clip at least once.

2913
01:57:07,890 --> 01:57:09,488
I started dancing...

2914
01:57:09,489 --> 01:57:11,529
after watching Choi Ho Jong's video.

2915
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:13,158
(Korean dancer Choi Ho Jong won...)

2916
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:14,328
(the 2016 Dong-A Dance Competition Grand Prize.)

2917
01:57:14,329 --> 01:57:17,499
When I first started dancing, one of the clips I watched...

2918
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,999
was Choi Ho Jong's competition performance.

2919
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,938
It's what made me dance.

2920
01:57:21,939 --> 01:57:23,709
(The legend and the reason himself has come.)

2921
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:27,449
His technique has been incredible since then.

2922
01:57:28,279 --> 01:57:30,648
From floor technique to jumping,

2923
01:57:30,649 --> 01:57:33,380
he's great at everything like an all-genre dancer.

2924
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:35,819
The deity of the dancing world.

2925
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:37,259
A monster.

2926
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:40,528
His muscles aren't like a Korean's.

2927
01:57:40,529 --> 01:57:41,930
He has the best physique.

2928
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:44,759
Putting aside his efforts,

2929
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:47,199
Ho Jong has an outstanding physique talent.

2930
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:50,198
Physical ability and mobility-wise,

2931
01:57:50,199 --> 01:57:53,670
I doubt there's a better dancer than him.

2932
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:55,710
He's in first place.

2933
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:56,710
(For real?)

2934
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:57,710
(This is bad.)

2935
01:57:57,711 --> 01:58:00,550
As expected from the physical monster, he got a full score.

2936
01:58:00,949 --> 01:58:02,010
Darn it.

2937
01:58:03,079 --> 01:58:04,920
Ho Jong got first place for the physical test.

2938
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:07,220
The fact that I was in second place was...

2939
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,350
- But... - Each only has one star.

2940
01:58:10,489 --> 01:58:12,590
Why did he only give himself one star each?

2941
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,429
(That's absurd.)

2942
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:15,430
I'm shocked.

2943
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:17,260
Thank you.

2944
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,728
(Choi Ho Jong calmly walks inside.)

2945
01:58:20,729 --> 01:58:22,698
- Hi. - Hi.

2946
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:23,839
(The legendary Korean dancer)

2947
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,170
I will always give myself one star.

2948
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:29,309
I started dancing at a late age.

2949
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:32,409
So I lived with a sense of inferiority.

2950
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:33,538
"What's wrong with me?"

2951
01:58:33,539 --> 01:58:34,779
"Why can't I do that?"

2952
01:58:35,079 --> 01:58:36,309
There was a time...

2953
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:38,680
when I lost it and danced without a break.

2954
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:41,089
I pushed myself to the point...

2955
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:43,149
I had no sweat left in my body.

2956
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,989
I realized back then...

2957
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:47,260
that I should dance to be happy.

2958
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:49,629
The awakening...

2959
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:51,060
was my turning point.

2960
01:58:52,029 --> 01:58:54,299
(Choi Ho Jong stands before the judging groups.)

2961
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:56,999
(He scans through the judging groups closely.)

2962
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,369
I expected more distinguished dancers to participate.

2963
01:59:01,739 --> 01:59:03,909
It disappointed me a little.

2964
01:59:04,409 --> 01:59:06,078
(Quiet but deadly...)

2965
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:07,139
I'm confident.

2966
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:08,148
(is his confidence.)

2967
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:09,509
(Which group did Choi Ho Jong choose?)

2968
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:12,619
(Hands together)

2969
01:59:12,949 --> 01:59:14,619
I'm curious as to which group he chose.

2970
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:17,220
This is putting me in fear.

2971
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:19,519
I'm scared.

2972
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,329
I should pray now.

2973
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:23,430
It was nerve-racking since then.

2974
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:25,260
First place.

2975
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:26,260
(The top physique)

2976
01:59:26,261 --> 01:59:27,369
(Which group was chosen by Choi Ho Jong?)

2977
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:28,999
(Opening)

2978
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,038
(Korean dancer Choi Ho Jong has finally appeared.)

2979
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:32,869
- He's here. - Hi, Ho Jong.

2980
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,639
(Everyone is nervous.)

2981
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:35,669
- Hey. - Hi.

2982
01:59:35,670 --> 01:59:37,038
(Choi Ho Jong looks relaxed.)

2983
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:38,479
(Nervous yet curious)

2984
01:59:39,079 --> 01:59:40,680
He has this aura.

2985
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:42,710
(Frozen)

2986
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,880
I guess the atmosphere got chilly.

2987
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,488
(Everyone is focused on Choi Ho Jong.)

2988
01:59:47,489 --> 01:59:50,859
Before I knew it, I kept my mouth shut since then.

2989
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:53,819
All of us got overpowered by his presence.

2990
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:56,460
(Please not my group.)

2991
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:58,460
It won't be me.

2992
01:59:59,899 --> 02:00:01,229
Don't be next to me.

2993
02:00:02,069 --> 02:00:03,129
Oh, my gosh.

2994
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:04,599
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition Judging Groups)

2995
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,140
(Choi Ho Jong chose Group E.)

2996
02:00:07,069 --> 02:00:08,069
(Laughing)

2997
02:00:08,070 --> 02:00:09,969
(I feel bad for him.)

2998
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:11,810
(I'm the saddest person on earth.)

2999
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:15,880
(All he can do is let out a sigh.)

3000
02:00:16,649 --> 02:00:17,719
I'm sorry.

3001
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,879
(Smiling)

3002
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,220
I wouldn't want to compete against me either.

3003
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:23,390
It helped me feel at ease.

3004
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:26,359
Since my group has an invincible dancer,

3005
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,188
I can dance at peace.

3006
02:00:28,189 --> 02:00:29,590
(Resigned)

3007
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:31,698
Everyone is good-looking.

3008
02:00:31,699 --> 02:00:32,828
I know, right?

3009
02:00:32,829 --> 02:00:35,930
I thought I would leave the strongest impression.

3010
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,499
It made me wonder if the dancers were chosen based on their looks.

3011
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:42,140
Everyone was waiting like classical scholars.

3012
02:00:42,739 --> 02:00:44,640
They looked very oriental.

3013
02:00:44,909 --> 02:00:47,179
I thought they were scholars, like no joke.

3014
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:48,978
(They brighten up the locker room.)

3015
02:00:48,979 --> 02:00:51,449
(Who is the next attractive Korean dancer?)

3016
02:00:52,119 --> 02:00:53,618
(Who is this strange man approaching the STF Dance Company?)

3017
02:00:53,619 --> 02:00:56,720
Stage Fighter. I'm getting nervous.

3018
02:00:56,850 --> 02:00:59,288
(A guy wearing floral-printed clothes and not a scholar)

3019
02:00:59,289 --> 02:01:01,728
I've got to overcome it with my vibe. This is me.

3020
02:01:01,729 --> 02:01:02,829
Now then.

3021
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:05,159
What can the people with long arms and legs do?

3022
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:07,669
(An unusual move by an unusual intruder)

3023
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:08,799
(Dancing)

3024
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,328
(Flashy from head to toe)

3025
02:01:10,329 --> 02:01:11,339
Get over it.

3026
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:12,438
(Who is this man?)

3027
02:01:12,439 --> 02:01:15,009
I'm a YouTuber with 58,000 subscribers.

3028
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:16,039
I can make it through.

3029
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:20,279
Hi. I'm a professional YouTuber, Suncapboi.

3030
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,909
- What? - Hold on.

3031
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:24,550
"Suncapboi."

3032
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,179
(The dancers know Suncapboi.)

3033
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:27,180
Is he Suncapboi?

3034
02:01:27,181 --> 02:01:28,249
"Suncapboi?"

3035
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:29,749
I even asked him for an autograph.

3036
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:30,760
- Really? - Yes.

3037
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:35,429
Suncapboi got 17.92 million views for one short video.

3038
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:38,698
I wanted dance to become an art loved by many.

3039
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:41,528
It would be nice if people took an interest...

3040
02:01:41,529 --> 02:01:44,800
and came watch dance performances through Suncapboi.

3041
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:47,939
It's my alter ego made for that purpose.

3042
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,879
I'm a Korean dance graduate from Sungkyunkwan University,

3043
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:55,279
Choi Jong In.

3044
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:58,250
I started with popping, then moved on to Korean dance.

3045
02:01:58,449 --> 02:02:01,318
My hope is to make a charming dance with Korean dance as the base...

3046
02:02:01,319 --> 02:02:03,220
and pique people's interest.

3047
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:05,090
(Name: Choi Jong In, Age: 29)

3048
02:02:05,091 --> 02:02:07,159
Isn't it like him to write silly dance as his other genre?

3049
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,159
He's good at dancing.

3050
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:11,159
But Jong In's...

3051
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,100
technique is...

3052
02:02:14,829 --> 02:02:15,829
Okay.

3053
02:02:17,229 --> 02:02:18,399
Why did you stop midway?

3054
02:02:18,939 --> 02:02:20,439
He's my friend. I'll save my breath.

3055
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:24,939
I believe dance and technique are different.

3056
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,779
He put zero stars in his technique on his profile.

3057
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:31,720
I wonder how he'll take and pass the Physical and Technique Audition.

3058
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:33,649
(Opening)

3059
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:37,960
(He enters the room with a sun visor.)

3060
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:39,089
(He draws attention just by appearing!)

3061
02:02:39,090 --> 02:02:40,090
(Laughing)

3062
02:02:40,359 --> 02:02:41,359
(It's me!)

3063
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:42,828
(I'm here.)

3064
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:45,500
(They give him a standing ovation as if they're in a trance.)

3065
02:02:45,529 --> 02:02:47,969
I didn't think Jong In would come out,

3066
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:49,899
but I understood why as soon as he entered the room.

3067
02:02:50,699 --> 02:02:52,699
He drew attention with his look already.

3068
02:02:52,939 --> 02:02:55,539
He changed the atmosphere of the space at that moment.

3069
02:02:56,939 --> 02:02:59,010
See what will happen when you're on camera with me.

3070
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:00,439
(Laughing)

3071
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:01,779
I'm going to erase you.

3072
02:03:01,949 --> 02:03:02,949
He was something else.

3073
02:03:03,909 --> 02:03:06,379
The moment Suncapboi came,

3074
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:08,220
I hoped he wouldn't sit next to me.

3075
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:10,689
He left a strong first impression.

3076
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:13,719
I was like, "Can I win..."

3077
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:14,989
"against someone like him?"

3078
02:03:15,829 --> 02:03:17,288
(Group F: Kang Seong Bae, Kim Sang Gil, Choi Jong In)

3079
02:03:17,289 --> 02:03:19,029
(Choi Jong In chose Group F with Kang Seong Bae and Kim Sang Gil.)

3080
02:03:20,329 --> 02:03:21,470
(As soon as the judging group is revealed, he starts observing.)

3081
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:23,069
Group F.

3082
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:25,398
He joined Group F.

3083
02:03:25,399 --> 02:03:27,300
It didn't go as I wanted.

3084
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:31,979
But I think I can win with my techniques.

3085
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:34,949
It feels like he's a hidden master.

3086
02:03:35,109 --> 02:03:37,778
I don't know what he's hiding.

3087
02:03:37,779 --> 02:03:39,119
He's like the Joker.

3088
02:03:39,479 --> 02:03:41,818
I'll prove why I'm here...

3089
02:03:41,819 --> 02:03:44,220
with my expression and texture.

3090
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:46,358
You thought Group F was easy, right?

3091
02:03:46,359 --> 02:03:47,359
You were wrong.

3092
02:03:47,529 --> 02:03:48,789
I'll show you.

3093
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,659
I hope the other people come quickly. I'm curious.

3094
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:55,269
(Two Korean dancers enter the STF Dance Company.)

3095
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:56,470
(Sighing)

3096
02:03:56,569 --> 02:03:57,600
I'm nervous.

3097
02:03:57,939 --> 02:04:00,199
- Wait. - Why are you nervous? Hey.

3098
02:04:00,699 --> 02:04:01,769
Let's just do it.

3099
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:02,908
(Who are these young Korean dancers who look close?)

3100
02:04:02,909 --> 02:04:05,479
(Calm, nervous)

3101
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:07,709
Here it comes again.

3102
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:09,249
What? 19 years old?

3103
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:10,609
He's young.

3104
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:13,250
I guess he's the youngest.

3105
02:04:13,350 --> 02:04:14,850
It says "The cute youngest boy."

3106
02:04:15,619 --> 02:04:17,390
He's a freshman.

3107
02:04:17,819 --> 02:04:19,289
He's a baby.

3108
02:04:19,659 --> 02:04:21,659
The age gap between us is ten years.

3109
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:22,828
Jong In, let's show them the power of veterans.

3110
02:04:22,829 --> 02:04:23,889
Yes.

3111
02:04:23,890 --> 02:04:24,999
(22-year-old Jun Woo who was listening to their conversation)

3112
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,829
Twenty-year-olds are really fit.

3113
02:04:27,130 --> 02:04:28,399
(What?)

3114
02:04:28,899 --> 02:04:30,129
I think he disrespected you.

3115
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:32,038
Hey, 30-year-olds are fit too.

3116
02:04:32,039 --> 02:04:33,139
(It's a joke.)

3117
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:34,470
(I'm smiling, but not because I'm happy.)

3118
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:37,439
They went to the same high school and university.

3119
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,180
They went to Korea National University of Arts.

3120
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:42,349
They went to Gugak National High School and K-Arts. Are they...

3121
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:43,380
young dark horses?

3122
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,180
They're elite dancers. You can't underestimate their skills.

3123
02:04:47,789 --> 02:04:51,019
I thought I shouldn't underestimate them even though they're young.

3124
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:53,959
They must've learned percussion, traditional dance,

3125
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:55,259
and interpretative dance at Gugak National High School.

3126
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:57,359
Because they make you learn everything.

3127
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,460
Min Suk is a great dancer.

3128
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:01,270
Do you know him?

3129
02:05:01,529 --> 02:05:03,770
I saw him when I lectured in Korea National University of Arts.

3130
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,439
He's passionate and a great dancer.

3131
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:10,170
People around me often say I'm passionate.

3132
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:14,079
I don't like it when I feel like I wasted my day.

3133
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:16,279
When I'm given an opportunity, I try to seize it.

3134
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:18,920
That's why I was happy to participate in the show.

3135
02:05:18,979 --> 02:05:21,849
I thought if there's something I can pour my passion into,

3136
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:24,149
it'd be an opportunity for me to improve.

3137
02:05:24,359 --> 02:05:26,920
I'm young, so there's nothing to lose.

3138
02:05:27,659 --> 02:05:28,788
(Staring)

3139
02:05:28,789 --> 02:05:31,800
(The elite young dancers will choose their judging group.)

3140
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:34,028
(There are only four spots left.)

3141
02:05:34,029 --> 02:05:35,398
Wait.

3142
02:05:35,399 --> 02:05:36,769
(Even the golden boys step back as they see the line-up.)

3143
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:38,239
I think we came too late.

3144
02:05:38,939 --> 02:05:41,969
I know. There'll be only one spot left after us.

3145
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,069
(Only Group A, Group E, and Group F have a remaining spot.)

3146
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:46,479
(Kim Min Suk chooses Group F and Kim In Su chooses Group A.)

3147
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:48,479
(You put your name tag next to mine.)

3148
02:05:48,949 --> 02:05:51,279
(Making passionate eye contact)

3149
02:05:51,819 --> 02:05:52,978
I'm Kim Min Suk.

3150
02:05:52,979 --> 02:05:54,020
(He hurriedly holds his hand.)

3151
02:05:55,550 --> 02:05:57,859
I put my name tag on Group F as I thought I could win.

3152
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:00,489
The remaining spot is next to Ho Jong.

3153
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:01,759
I knew it.

3154
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:02,829
(In the end, Group E with Choi Ho Jong has a remaining spot.)

3155
02:06:03,229 --> 02:06:05,060
I just want to avoid Group E, the most competitive one.

3156
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:06,399
(Surprised)

3157
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,699
- Oh, my gosh. - Choi Ho Jong in Group E.

3158
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:09,930
I should avoid it.

3159
02:06:10,069 --> 02:06:12,340
- It's a deadly group. - It really is deadly.

3160
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:15,539
If my last choice is Group E,

3161
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:17,039
I would hate it so much.

3162
02:06:17,609 --> 02:06:18,739
Who would be the last person?

3163
02:06:19,180 --> 02:06:20,710
Someone strong.

3164
02:06:21,479 --> 02:06:22,578
He'd be the last one.

3165
02:06:22,579 --> 02:06:23,608
(Who is the last Korean dancer who will compete against Choi Ho Jong?)

3166
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:25,719
(Judging Groups Register)

3167
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,519
(He's here.)

3168
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,289
(The last remaining spot catches his eye as soon as he comes.)

3169
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:32,289
(There's only one spot left in Group E.)

3170
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:33,590
(Oh, my)

3171
02:06:33,591 --> 02:06:35,188
(He rushes to the empty spot.)

3172
02:06:35,189 --> 02:06:36,689
(He puts his name tag without hesitation.)

3173
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:39,198
(After putting his name tag on,)

3174
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:40,698
(he found the name!)

3175
02:06:40,699 --> 02:06:41,929
(How will the last Korean dancer react, spotting Ho Jong's name tag?)

3176
02:06:41,930 --> 02:06:43,799
(Tilting his head)

3177
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,868
(Look at this.)

3178
02:06:44,869 --> 02:06:46,039
They made it like this?

3179
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:48,569
Did they do this on purpose?

3180
02:06:49,069 --> 02:06:50,169
(Look at this.)

3181
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:51,340
It's going to be interesting.

3182
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:53,679
I want Ho Jong to come.

3183
02:06:53,680 --> 02:06:54,710
(During the interview in June)

3184
02:06:54,810 --> 02:06:55,880
He might come.

3185
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:58,618
There should be someone who is that good...

3186
02:06:58,619 --> 02:07:00,850
to motivate me to put in blood, sweat, and tears.

3187
02:07:01,819 --> 02:07:04,020
(Who is the last Korean dancer who wanted to compete against Ho Jong?)

3188
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:08,129
Hello. I'm Ki Moo Gan,

3189
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,689
a dancer.

3190
02:07:09,829 --> 02:07:10,929
(Starting talking)

3191
02:07:10,930 --> 02:07:12,328
(Oh, my goodness)

3192
02:07:12,329 --> 02:07:15,529
I watched many of his videos.

3193
02:07:16,199 --> 02:07:18,670
Choi Ho Jong and Ki Moo Gan are really famous.

3194
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:21,238
I thought it'd be interesting.

3195
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:22,409
(I'm in trouble!)

3196
02:07:22,810 --> 02:07:24,270
He has 18 years of experience.

3197
02:07:24,409 --> 02:07:25,839
It's similar to our age.

3198
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:26,979
(His dance career is 2 years shorter than their age.)

3199
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:29,250
Come to think of it, Moo Gan has great techniques.

3200
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:31,819
Moo Gan has amazing floor techniques.

3201
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:33,449
Good dancers have come.

3202
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,689
He has long arms too.

3203
02:07:35,819 --> 02:07:38,289
- He has a great body. - He really does.

3204
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,828
I think Moo Gan has some of the best bodies...

3205
02:07:42,829 --> 02:07:44,359
among dancers.

3206
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,100
I feel competitive against him.

3207
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:49,930
A dancer with a great body. I couldn't give up on the title.

3208
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:52,639
I think I'm lucky...

3209
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:54,738
to have a small waist and long limbs.

3210
02:07:54,739 --> 02:07:57,810
My body is definitely better than my face.

3211
02:07:57,909 --> 02:08:00,979
What I hear the most is I have a presence.

3212
02:08:01,079 --> 02:08:02,949
They say I have an outstanding presence.

3213
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:06,118
It feels different when I'm on stage and when I'm not.

3214
02:08:06,119 --> 02:08:07,750
Because I make a difference.

3215
02:08:08,949 --> 02:08:11,389
(Ki Moo Gan, the last Korean dancer enters the room.)

3216
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:12,759
(Park Jun Woo in Group E is smiling, but not because he's happy.)

3217
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,288
(Kim Min Su in Group E)

3218
02:08:14,289 --> 02:08:15,960
(Choi Ho Jong in Group E is wearing a suggestive smile.)

3219
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:17,899
It's nice to meet you.

3220
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:22,229
If he competes against Ho Jong, it's going to be interesting.

3221
02:08:22,529 --> 02:08:23,529
(Looking around)

3222
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:25,568
It's a match between Ho Jong and Moo Gan.

3223
02:08:25,569 --> 02:08:26,969
(Suggestive)

3224
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:30,439
I thought Moo Gan would be the biggest obstacle for me.

3225
02:08:31,109 --> 02:08:33,539
There's only one rival for me.

3226
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:36,350
That's Ho Jong.

3227
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:40,149
I'm so curious about Group E.

3228
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:41,819
Group E is a group of death.

3229
02:08:42,649 --> 02:08:43,688
(Oh, my gosh)

3230
02:08:43,689 --> 02:08:44,788
I'm in trouble.

3231
02:08:44,789 --> 02:08:45,858
(Sighing)

3232
02:08:45,859 --> 02:08:46,920
Should I go home?

3233
02:08:46,989 --> 02:08:49,060
(The saddest smile in the world)

3234
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:51,529
I'm in the group.

3235
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:53,429
So it's going to be intense.

3236
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:54,630
(Smiling)

3237
02:08:55,529 --> 02:09:00,399
We're now starting the Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition.

3238
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:05,409
Guys, something big is coming.

3239
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:08,979
And next, we have Group E.

3240
02:09:09,149 --> 02:09:11,118
(Everyone is anticipating Group E, the group of death.)

3241
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:12,180
It's crazy.

3242
02:09:13,779 --> 02:09:15,389
I think it's going to be crazy.

3243
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:17,090
(Cracking his knuckles)

3244
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:20,689
(All eyes are on them.)

3245
02:09:21,829 --> 02:09:22,829
Choi Ho Jong.

3246
02:09:22,830 --> 02:09:24,029
(The audition for Dancer Choi Ho Jong has started.)

3247
02:09:25,529 --> 02:09:28,399
He has a crazy aura.

3248
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:31,099
I got goosebumps.

3249
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:32,140
(Goosebumps)

3250
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:33,969
And Ki Moo Gan.

3251
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:35,039
(And Dancer Ki Moo Gan)

3252
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:37,340
(Glaring)

3253
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:39,640
(It's insane.)

3254
02:09:39,779 --> 02:09:41,149
It has finally come.

3255
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:43,948
Are there any outstanding dancers among them?

3256
02:09:43,949 --> 02:09:45,250
(Dancer Choi Ho Jong)

3257
02:09:45,449 --> 02:09:46,949
This person.

3258
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:49,819
- He must be so good. - Right.

3259
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:52,818
Everyone is afraid of Ho Jong.

3260
02:09:52,819 --> 02:09:55,630
Everyone knows he's an all-rounder.

3261
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:58,328
- Moo Gan too. - He's good.

3262
02:09:58,329 --> 02:09:59,399
He's amazing.

3263
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,800
Moo Gan is a unique dancer...

3264
02:10:03,069 --> 02:10:04,739
with great techniques.

3265
02:10:05,239 --> 02:10:06,269
This group is...

3266
02:10:06,270 --> 02:10:07,639
It's a fight between Ho Jong...

3267
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:10,010
And Moo Gan in the end.

3268
02:10:10,739 --> 02:10:11,809
I'm excited.

3269
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:14,809
They have unique styles.

3270
02:10:14,810 --> 02:10:16,309
I wonder what they will show...

3271
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:18,550
and how it will turn out.

3272
02:10:18,619 --> 02:10:21,289
If Ho Jong and Moo Gan compete against each other,

3273
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:23,849
the one who is in a better condition will win.

3274
02:10:23,850 --> 02:10:24,859
(It's impossible to make predictions.)

3275
02:10:25,319 --> 02:10:26,989
Moo Gan must be a little nervous.

3276
02:10:27,090 --> 02:10:28,188
(Opening his eyes)

3277
02:10:28,189 --> 02:10:30,029
I'm not nervous.

3278
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:33,398
I'm confident I'll execute it better than anyone.

3279
02:10:33,399 --> 02:10:34,599
I trust myself.

3280
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:35,600
(Chuckling)

3281
02:10:35,601 --> 02:10:38,499
Actually, I think I must...

3282
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:40,439
be in a high class.

3283
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:43,670
I think that's how it should be.

3284
02:10:43,770 --> 02:10:45,380
If I don't...

3285
02:10:46,279 --> 02:10:47,840
(Questioning)

3286
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:49,050
That's weird.

3287
02:10:49,479 --> 02:10:50,479
(A big match between 2 dancers who want to be in the 1st Class)

3288
02:10:50,479 --> 02:10:51,479
It's going to be fun.

3289
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:52,948
(Choi Ho Jong versus Ki Moo Gan)

3290
02:10:52,949 --> 02:10:53,979
Music...

3291
02:10:54,449 --> 02:10:55,520
I must watch this.

3292
02:10:55,949 --> 02:10:57,149
How will Ho Jong do it?

3293
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:58,689
It's going to be fun.

3294
02:10:59,289 --> 02:11:00,489
Let's watch their performance.

3295
02:11:01,229 --> 02:11:02,229
Start.

3296
02:11:02,489 --> 02:11:06,199
Three, two, one. Go.

3297
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:09,299
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition, Round 1 for Group E)

3298
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:10,499
The head move.

3299
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:11,970
I like the head move.

3300
02:11:12,069 --> 02:11:13,639
- He's good. - He's different.

3301
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:14,669
(They're exclaiming at Choi Ho Jong.)

3302
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:17,039
- It's crazy. - His breathing technique is great.

3303
02:11:17,569 --> 02:11:18,639
(Super focused)

3304
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,710
The way he's moving his hands is different.

3305
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:22,978
(Turning)

3306
02:11:22,979 --> 02:11:24,679
(The Korean dance coaches can't take their eyes off Ho Jong.)

3307
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,220
(Covering his mouth)

3308
02:11:27,619 --> 02:11:28,749
(A perfect house turn)

3309
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:29,818
The house turn.

3310
02:11:29,819 --> 02:11:31,420
- My gosh. - He's so good.

3311
02:11:33,189 --> 02:11:35,130
The one-leg spin was clean.

3312
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:42,528
- I like the jump. - It was nice.

3313
02:11:42,529 --> 02:11:44,699
- His overall balance is excellent. - Yes.

3314
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:47,399
It's crazy.

3315
02:11:47,539 --> 02:11:50,539
- Three, two, one. - His moves are relaxed indeed.

3316
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:52,879
Stop. Change.

3317
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:54,779
(They change positions.)

3318
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:55,880
He killed it.

3319
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:57,810
Ho Jong is amazing indeed.

3320
02:11:58,079 --> 02:12:00,719
(Ho Jong and Moo Gan switch spots after Round 1.)

3321
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,050
Ho Jong wasn't that good.

3322
02:12:03,689 --> 02:12:05,289
I should watch Moo Gan this time.

3323
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:07,419
- Four, three. - Let's see what he got.

3324
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:09,629
Two, one.

3325
02:12:09,630 --> 02:12:11,089
- Go. - I'm good.

3326
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:16,000
(To be continued)

3327
02:12:16,106 --> 02:12:17,375
(The Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition continues.)

3328
02:12:17,376 --> 02:12:18,844
(That's an acrobatic movement!)

3329
02:12:18,845 --> 02:12:21,105
(I don't mind competing against anyone.)

3330
02:12:21,106 --> 02:12:22,174
(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

3331
02:12:22,175 --> 02:12:25,044
(The Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition begins.)

3332
02:12:25,045 --> 02:12:27,214
(I'm confident to be in the First Class.)

3333
02:12:27,215 --> 02:12:29,455
(I should be on the top.)

3334
02:12:29,456 --> 02:12:31,054
(There was no one for me to keep an eye on.)

3335
02:12:31,055 --> 02:12:33,456
(A fierce competition among those with amazing bodies)

3336
02:12:33,626 --> 02:12:35,195
(I will kill them all.)

3337
02:12:35,196 --> 02:12:36,295
(He's showing all the best moves he got.)

3338
02:12:36,526 --> 02:12:38,054
(I'm not sure if this is Stage Fighter...)

3339
02:12:38,055 --> 02:12:39,125
(or "Street Man Fighter.")

3340
02:12:39,126 --> 02:12:41,166
(It became a dance battle.)

3341
02:12:41,765 --> 02:12:44,235
(It's the day of the Class Battle...)

3342
02:12:44,236 --> 02:12:46,536
(for the Dance Film Mission in different genres.)

3343
02:12:47,135 --> 02:12:48,575
(The judges will move them to different classes...)

3344
02:12:48,576 --> 02:12:49,974
(in the Class Battle.)

3345
02:12:49,975 --> 02:12:51,334
(Through the Class Battle,)

3346
02:12:51,335 --> 02:12:54,245
(only one dancer in each group...)

3347
02:12:54,246 --> 02:12:56,844
(will be in the First Class.)

3348
02:12:56,845 --> 02:12:59,714
(1st Class: Lead dancer, 2nd Class: Supporting dancer)

3349
02:12:59,715 --> 02:13:02,384
(Under Class: Ensemble)

3350
02:13:02,385 --> 02:13:04,115
(I want to be in the First Class instead of him.)

3351
02:13:04,116 --> 02:13:05,655
(I'll never go down.)

3352
02:13:05,656 --> 02:13:07,554
(I don't want them to take it away from me. It's mine.)

3353
02:13:07,555 --> 02:13:08,594
(I'll keep my position...)

3354
02:13:08,595 --> 02:13:10,126
(in the First Class.)

3355
02:13:10,456 --> 02:13:13,026
(When the judging groups for ballet were revealed)

3356
02:13:13,196 --> 02:13:14,395
(Glancing)

3357
02:13:14,795 --> 02:13:16,095
(My goodness)

3358
02:13:16,196 --> 02:13:18,235
(Kang Gyeong Ho and Kim Yu Chan got to compete in the same group.)

3359
02:13:18,236 --> 02:13:20,206
(They're all strong.)

3360
02:13:20,435 --> 02:13:22,504
(Isn't it a group of death?)

3361
02:13:22,505 --> 02:13:25,004
(There was an odd tension between them.)

3362
02:13:25,005 --> 02:13:26,345
(I'll fight well.)

3363
02:13:26,746 --> 02:13:28,376
(I'll raise my guard even more.)

3364
02:13:28,816 --> 02:13:30,215
(During a rehearsal on the day of the Class Battle)

3365
02:13:30,715 --> 02:13:32,215
(He missed a beat?)

3366
02:13:32,486 --> 02:13:34,816
(Gyeong Ho was the only one who moved to a different beat.)

3367
02:13:35,156 --> 02:13:37,055
(What is it? What's going on?)

3368
02:13:37,816 --> 02:13:40,054
(Because there was a fixed choreography,)

3369
02:13:40,055 --> 02:13:42,594
(I tried harder...)

3370
02:13:42,595 --> 02:13:43,924
(to stand out.)

3371
02:13:43,925 --> 02:13:45,825
(This is the original count.)

3372
02:13:45,826 --> 02:13:48,565
(Yu Chan points out Gyeong Ho counted differently.)

3373
02:13:48,566 --> 02:13:49,934
This is what Gyeong Ho did.

3374
02:13:49,935 --> 02:13:52,105
(Gyeong Ho is the only one who counted one more time.)

3375
02:13:52,106 --> 02:13:53,934
(I'll count to 8 then.)

3376
02:13:53,935 --> 02:13:56,674
(It was uncomfortable. He counted differently...)

3377
02:13:56,675 --> 02:13:58,304
(as he wanted to stand out.)

3378
02:13:58,305 --> 02:14:00,905
(I thought it wasn't right.)

3379
02:14:00,906 --> 02:14:02,344
(Kim Yu Chan,)

3380
02:14:02,345 --> 02:14:05,286
(Kang Gyeong Ho, I want to see your dance again.)

3381
02:14:05,486 --> 02:14:07,745
(I should go crazy to win.)

3382
02:14:07,746 --> 02:14:09,916
(I don't start a fight that I know I'll lose.)

3383
02:14:10,786 --> 02:14:12,285
(He deserves to be the main dancer.)

3384
02:14:12,286 --> 02:14:13,685
(Sexy)

3385
02:14:14,895 --> 02:14:16,255
(He has a star quality.)

3386
02:14:16,425 --> 02:14:18,566
(I think he should go to First.)

3387
02:14:18,895 --> 02:14:20,326
(Who will be in the 1st Class in Group 1?)

3388
02:14:20,696 --> 02:14:22,394
(It's followed by the Contemporary Dance Class Battle.)

3389
02:14:22,395 --> 02:14:24,394
(The main dancer? I want it, of course.)

3390
02:14:24,395 --> 02:14:26,804
(It's the last opportunity to move up to the First Class.)

3391
02:14:26,805 --> 02:14:28,105
(I want to switch their classes.)

3392
02:14:28,106 --> 02:14:29,535
(I was mad.)

3393
02:14:29,536 --> 02:14:31,434
(It felt like I was robbed of what I had.)

3394
02:14:31,435 --> 02:14:32,974
(The Class Battle where even the slightest mistake is not tolerated)

3395
02:14:32,975 --> 02:14:35,344
(You've been demoted to the Under Class.)

3396
02:14:35,345 --> 02:14:37,044
(It was so embarrassing.)

3397
02:14:37,045 --> 02:14:38,915
(I don't think he's good enough to be in the First Class.)

3398
02:14:38,916 --> 02:14:40,644
(I clenched my teeth and did my best.)

3399
02:14:40,645 --> 02:14:42,584
(The First Class has changed.)

3400
02:14:42,585 --> 02:14:44,384
(I wanted to die.)

3401
02:14:44,385 --> 02:14:46,155
(He's superior.)

3402
02:14:46,156 --> 02:14:47,825
(I think I'll be in the First Class.)

3403
02:14:47,826 --> 02:14:49,755
(Thrilled)

3404
02:14:49,895 --> 02:14:51,895
(His eyes are crazy.)

3405
02:14:52,765 --> 02:14:54,464
(As for this group,)

3406
02:14:54,465 --> 02:14:56,965
(there will be changes in the class.)

3407
02:14:57,435 --> 02:14:59,935
(I will announce the dancer to be demoted.)

3408
02:15:00,435 --> 02:15:02,135
(It's difficult to announce it.)

3409
02:15:02,776 --> 02:15:04,334
(Dancer Choi Ho Jong will be demoted.)

3410
02:15:04,335 --> 02:15:07,576
(Shocked)

3411
02:15:08,206 --> 02:15:09,245
No way.

3412
02:15:09,246 --> 02:15:11,345
(Does it make sense? I didn't think it'd turn out like this.)

3413
02:15:11,885 --> 02:15:16,116
(It's because I wasn't good enough. I couldn't do it.)
