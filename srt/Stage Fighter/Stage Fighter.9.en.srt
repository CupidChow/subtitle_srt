1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,089
(Stage Fighter Final)

2
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,460
Ready? Fight!

3
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,530
Starting with "Street Woman Fighter" in 2021,

4
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:23,999
it continued to...

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,428
"Steet Dance Girls Fighter" and "Street Man Fighter."

6
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,799
Mnet's original dance series was a great sensation...

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,369
in the street dance scene, a league only among dancers.

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,539
It even dominated the global dance scene.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,839
In 2024, another new challenge began...

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,450
in Mnet's original dance series.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,950
(Classical dance)

12
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:45,218
(Classic dance with a long history)

13
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,989
When it comes to ballet, people find it very classic...

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,319
and hard to approach.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,688
You must do research to see a ballet show.

16
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,890
Everyone asks, "What's Korean dance? Is it talchum?"

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,728
There are various moves,

18
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,859
but many don't know about it.

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,658
I'm dancing hard.

20
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,968
But the same people watch me over and over again.

21
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,068
Complimenting each other within our people isn't meaningful.

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,670
Contemporary dance might disappear.

23
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,739
There aren't any performances right now. I'm working part-time.

24
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,809
Everyone is leaving the dance field...

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,109
as reality comes crashing down.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,509
I wish the art of dance grows bigger.

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,449
I hope it becomes well-known to the public.

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,980
The classical dance is in the unseen field.

29
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,949
Korean dance.

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,620
Korean dancers must dance with their breath.

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,060
Look at that pretty line.

32
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,759
(The Korean style...)

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,090
(and trendiness coexist in Korean dance.)

34
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:30,729
Contemporary dance.

35
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,128
They're full of great techniques.

36
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,500
- We're seeing beasts. - It's wild.

37
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,430
(Contemporary dance expresses freedom and power with the body.)

38
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,539
Ballet.

39
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,999
- That jump was unbelievable. - Wasn't he like a swan?

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,468
- A prince. - How elegant.

41
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,509
(Ballet is graceful yet energetic.)

42
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,679
The opening act of their first journey became...

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,609
the talk of the town.

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,548
(The first mission marking the beginning)

45
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,450
(Physical and Technique Audition)

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,318
Having to overcome the physical limit,

47
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,189
it was a battle to win solely using their body.

48
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,458
(What was that technique?)

49
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,018
(They're full of great techniques.)

50
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,530
I should prove I'm good at spinning.

51
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,459
Ciseaux. I'll kill it.

52
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,999
(I like Gyeong Ho.)

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,729
The Physical and Technique Audition...

54
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,469
was a refreshing dopamine.

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,900
The Dance Films of ballet, Korean dance,

56
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,710
and contemporary dance...

57
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,340
imprinted each genre's color and charms to the public.

58
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,680
It served as a chance to draw in new fans.

59
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,348
The Mega Stage Mission pushed the boundaries of the three genres...

60
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,750
and created a legendary performance with 64 dancers.

61
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,549
K-Contents Mission,

62
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,389
using the hit works of Korea's global content as motives,

63
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,589
made the headlines with 164,000 votes...

64
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,900
in the ticketing vote.

65
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,098
In Stage Choice by Public Mission,

66
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,900
the individual video ranked in the trending videos.

67
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,698
(After the show, )

68
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,638
(the tickets sold out within 5 minutes.)

69
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,709
The seats of the ticketing vote sold out...

70
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,279
with the fastest record,

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,840
proving the dancers' ticket power.

72
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,979
The destiny in that some become the lead role,

73
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,180
some become the supporting role, and others become the ensemble.

74
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,218
(If you can't do this, )

75
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,219
(you better go home.)

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,360
The dancers proved their competence.

77
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,659
Park Jin Ho. Congratulations.

78
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,198
(Overcoming the limit of classes)

79
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,900
Ha Won Jun.

80
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,930
It's a human triumph for Won Jun.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,539
(Rediscovering their own abilities)

82
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,139
(At the end of the wild ride, )

83
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,508
(they achieved a result acknowledged by everyone.)

84
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,240
(Your choreography was amazing. It was dynamic.)

85
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,438
(Touching the people with dance, )

86
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,609
(the dancers proved themselves.)

87
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,479
As a result, it topped the charts for nondrama TV shows...

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,718
and the ratings among shows aired at the same time.

89
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,218
Not only that, a dancer ranked among the popular figures.

90
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,289
With the dancers gaining attention and interest,

91
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,459
- Let's go! - Let's go!

92
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,489
K-dance is no longer in the unseen field.

93
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,688
It's become a genre of the cultural arts enjoyed by the public.

94
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,199
("K-dance is so popular")

95
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,300
Endlessly proving their abilities,

96
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,239
twenty dancers have advanced to the final.

97
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,439
(20 dancers who are in the final)

98
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,210
And Stage Fighter's long-awaited final...

99
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,210
that will decide the 20 dancers' fates.

100
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,550
In the final, through STF Online Casting Voting...

101
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,550
and Live Text Voting,

102
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,218
the final 12 dancers to join...

103
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:09,090
the Global Dance Company will be decided.

104
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,719
The dancer joining the Global Dance Company...

105
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,629
will tour domestically and internationally...

106
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,959
and be given a certificate necklace for joining the STF Dance Company.

107
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,398
Starting with the Final STF Showcase,

108
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,698
(The domestic gala show will start with the Final STF Showcase.)

109
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,768
the dancers will perform on stages worldwide.

110
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,269
(The dancers will perform worldwide.)

111
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,839
The dancers' ten-month-long journey to join the Global Dance Company.

112
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,009
Today will end that journey and start a new one.

113
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,109
(Who is the one dancer...)

114
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,220
(to become the principal?)

115
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,148
- As it's our last chance... - I'll pour everything into it...

116
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,850
and put on the best show.

117
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,319
I will become 1 of the 12 finalists.

118
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,259
Stage Fighter's showcase starts now.

119
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,758
First position. Music, start.

120
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,230
(Stage Fighter Final)

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,269
(Si Won school for dancing)

122
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
(Kim Yu Chan)

123
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,970

124
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
(Ho Jong the Great, Ho Jong)

125
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,000
(Yun Hyeok Jung, did you have raw octopus today?)

126
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,730
(Stage Fighter)

127
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,810

The main host, Kang Daniel.

130
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,440
(Kim Jong Cheol is a good-looking guy.)

131
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,138
Hi. The class battle of dancers where they fight with their bodies.

132
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,538
Stage Fighter. I'm MC Kang Daniel. Nice to meet you.

133
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,580
(Jong Cheol, you are my star.)

134
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,949
(Hye)

135
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,878
Final STF Showcase's opening performance,

136
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,549
"Human Impact," was impressive, with gracefulness...

137
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,190
and fierceness coexisting.

138
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,120
Ballet, Korean dance,

139
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,490
and contemporary dance.

140
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,329
Stage Fighter, which started with 64 dancers from 3 genres,

141
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,730
will end its four-month-long journey...

142
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,399
and mark a new beginning tonight.

143
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,069
The 12 dancers to join STF Global Dance Company...

144
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,008
and wear the glorious necklace...

145
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,570
will be decided.

146
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:05,779
Out of the 20 dancers,

147
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,309
who will join STF Global Dance Company...

148
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,450
and perform on both domestic...

149
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,219
and international stages?

150
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,589
(Fly, Bread. Don't forget me, Park Jun Woo.)

151
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,949
(Kang Daniel)

152
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,559
Soon, the 12 well-deserved dancers...

153
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,159
will be born.

154
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,558
Here is how the evaluation will be conducted...

155
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,869
for the Final STF Showcase, which will decide...

156
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,669
the dancers to join STF Global Dance Company.

157
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,769
The 12 dancers to join STF Global Dance Company tonight...

158
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,439
will be decided through the ongoing Online Casting Voting...

159
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,710
on the Mnet Plus app and the soon-to-begin Live Text Voting.

160
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:45,648
For each voting result, scores are awarded based on rank,

161
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,320
with a difference of 20 points per rank on a 1,000-point scale.

162
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,720
Admission to STF Global Company and the principal dancer...

163
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,889
will be decided based on a combined score of...

164
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,000
thirty percent Online Casting Voting...

165
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:00,659
and 70 percent Live Text Voting.

166
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,039
In the solo video for the Online Casting Voting,

167
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,710
the dancers expressed their message through dancing.

168
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,678
The casting video...

169
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,710
was released after episode eight last week.

170
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,679
The Seat Class Evaluation is currently taking place...

171
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,250
by voting with the Seat Class for the dancer rooting for.

172
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,289
Through the Seat Class Evaluation...

173
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,120
divided into VIP, R, S, and A seat classes,

174
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,919
which dancer...

175
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,590
will secure the most seats?

176
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,360
The time...

177
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,269
is currently 10:11 p.m.

178
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,628
The Online Casting Voting...

179
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,940
through the Seat Class Evaluation will soon end.

180
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,808
From the Online Casting Voting...

181
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,980
taking up 30 percent, which dancer will secure...

182
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,379
the most seats?

183
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,720
The Online Casting Voting's result will soon be revealed.

184
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,258
(Kim Yu Chan is brilliant.)

185
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,359
(Ho Jong)

186
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,628
(Please vote a lot.)

187
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,529
The 20 dancers who survived the class battle,

188
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,139
which started with 64 dancers,

189
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,639
must compete with their dances...

190
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,169
at the Final STF Showcase once again.

191
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,809
When these dancers were confirmed finalists,

192
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,609
they were provided with products...

193
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,980
to boost their energy from the class battle's fatigue.

194
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,178
After cheering up, the dancers...

195
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,690
are performing at today's Final STF Showcase.

196
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,090
(Dancing Potato)

197
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:30,888
Before starting officially,

198
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,259
let me introduce the master, coaches,

199
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,829
and rehearsal director...

200
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,629
who have been part of Stage Fighter's long journey.

201
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,470
Firstly, Master Kim Joo Won.

202
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,439
You must be filled with emotions before the Final STF Showcase.

203
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,509
How do you feel?

204
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,240
Hi, I'm Master Kim Joo Won.

205
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,008
We started with 64 dancers,

206
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,509
and 20...

207
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,279
have come to the final.

208
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,219
The journey until now...

209
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,720
was very touching.

210
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,319
Despite it being a competition,

211
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,359
we were able to watch the growth...

212
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,158
of the 64 dancers...

213
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,899
through the performances.

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,899
I was grateful for the opportunity, and it was meaningful.

215
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,470
Had it not been for Stage Fighter,

216
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,110
we would've met these 64 dancers...

217
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,649
only on the stage.

218
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,619
I'm very thankful to Mnet...

219
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,649
for showcasing...

220
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,918
these outstanding dancers...

221
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,090
to the public.

222
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,028
To all the 64 dancers...

223
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,360
who were on this journey,

224
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,329
including the 20 who will devote themselves...

225
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,299
to today's stage,

226
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,440
I would like to say bravi.

227
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,970
Thank you.

228
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,009
Thank you for your kind words.

229
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,178
Korean Dance Coach Jung Bo Kyung,

230
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,449
who wasn't with us for a short while,

231
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,110
gave birth to a pretty girl not long ago. Congratulations.

232
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,690
Thank you.

233
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:13,259
Although I couldn't be on-site in person midway,

234
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,888
I kept cheering...

235
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,289
with all my heart through the monitor.

236
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,529
I see. Thank you.

237
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,200
May I ask you...

238
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,898
to say some encouraging words to the 20 dancers...

239
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,570
who must perform today?

240
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,669
To the beautiful dancers I feel proud of.

241
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,309
You've done excellently until now.

242
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,980
I hope you enjoy your last performance today,

243
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,049
both for the numerous dance fans here...

244
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,519
and the TV viewers.

245
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,250
I will applaud with all my might.

246
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,889
Thank you.

247
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,899
We will now close the Online Casting Voting...

248
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,370
through the Seat Class Evaluation.

249
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,700
(STF Online Casting Voting closed)

250
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,408
(Online Casting Voting closed)

251
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:10,008
The Online Casting Voting has closed.

252
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,480
Thank you to the viewers...

253
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,179
who took part in the Online Casting Voting.

254
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,289
Many special guests have come...

255
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,820
to Stage Fighter's...

256
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,258
Final STF Showcase...

257
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,159
to cheer the dancers on.

258
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,730
Firstly, actor Joo Won,

259
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,798
who loves Stage Fighter and dance,

260
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,139
is here with us. Nice to meet you.

261
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,539
Actor Joo Won.

262
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,679
Please greet the viewers.

263
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,480
Right. I'm Joo Won.

264
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,350
As a devoted viewer who loves Stage Fighter,

265
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,120
it's a great pleasure to be able to know...

266
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,320
such beautiful and cool dancers.

267
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,360
And I hope classical dance becomes more popular.

268
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,159
I, too, want to make it more known.

269
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:02,999
But I don't think there's a need to worry.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,500
It has already become famous and highly sought after.

271
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
I look forward to today's performances.

272
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,939
It's giving me butterflies.

273
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,909
- Thank you. - Thank you.

274
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,849
May I ask you another question?

275
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,149
You said that you enjoyed watching our show.

276
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,678
What do you think the unique charms...

277
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,690
of dance is?

278
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,159
I'm not sure.

279
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,329
I've watched all the seasons,

280
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,129
and this is certainly charming in a different way.

281
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:37,500
I attended an art high school,

282
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,769
so I've met a lot of dancers.

283
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,639
The word "beauty" meant...

284
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,779
something cool in other seasons.

285
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,449
But watching the dancers from three different genres...

286
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,149
on Stage Fighter,

287
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,189
I realized how beautiful a person could be.

288
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,190
I believe the show's forte is...

289
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,758
its beauty.

290
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,199
Thank you for the kind words.

291
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,299
I hope you enjoy today's performance.

292
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,739
There's another actor who visited our show.

293
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,240
To watch the Final STF Showcase, Lee Sang Yeob...

294
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,779
has visited.

295
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,619
Did you normally watch Stage Fighter?

296
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,490
It's the joy of my life these days.

297
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,088
I always have the show on, and I never skip a week.

298
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,660
I rewatch it, watch the first airing and the rerun.

299
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,900
- That's what I've been doing. - We appreciate it.

300
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,969
This is the final show,

301
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,098
so there must be performances that are even more spectacular.

302
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,869
Which dancer are you looking forward to seeing?

303
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:51,779
That's a tough question.

304
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,809
If I have to say the first one that comes to mind,

305
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
it's Ho Jong the Great.

306
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,720
- Great. - Yes.

307
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,450
Thank you.

308
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,960
I hope you enjoy the show tonight.

309
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,229
Next to Sang Yeob, it's another actor, Song Jin Woo.

310
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,259
Nice to meet you.

311
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,768
Hello, I'm Song Jin Woo, an actor. It's a pleasure.

312
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:15,868
It's a pleasure.

313
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:18,068
Did you normally watch our show?

314
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,268
Yes, I've watched it.

315
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,639
Watching the opening performance today,

316
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
I couldn't stop getting chills...

317
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,210
from start to finish...

318
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,150
as I watched it right before my eyes.

319
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,079
- Thank you. - They're incredible.

320
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:33,349
I hope they finish the final performance well.

321
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,249
I'll thoroughly enjoy the show tonight.

322
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,289
- Thank you. - Great.

323
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,689
May I ask you for a word of support...

324
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,890
for the dancers who are nervous?

325
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,389
I believe the final show is important for everyone.

326
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,729
The word "final" gives you anxiety...

327
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,700
as it's their last time.

328
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,839
I hope they leave everything on that stage...

329
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,869
and enjoy the performance itself.

330
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,309
- Thank you. - Give your everything!

331
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,809
Thank you.

332
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,679
And next to him is Aiki, the leader of HOOK,

333
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,910
who performed so well in "Street Woman Fighter."

334
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,150
Nice to see you.

335
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,720
Hi, I'm Aiki.

336
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,419
Watching this performance,

337
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,059
it reminds us of ourselves three years ago.

338
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:21,098
I'm well aware of how nervous it makes you.

339
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,170
I hope the dancers on the final show...

340
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,199
don't get hurt and make this moment...

341
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,008
something that they can recall for the rest of their lives.

342
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,210
Good luck, everyone!

343
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,910
Thank you for the kind words.

344
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,078
And Lip J of PROWDMAN,

345
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,419
say a few words... No, please introduce yourself first.

346
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,819
- Hello, I'm Lip J. - Thank you for coming.

347
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,519
I'm sure the dancers are very nervous backstage.

348
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,598
Our crew never got to perform in the finals,

349
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,759
so I'm jealous of you!

350
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:58,469
Anyhow, I hope you don't get hurt tonight,

351
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,098
and I look forward to your impressive performance.

352
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,139
Good luck.

353
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,368
- Thank you. - Good luck!

354
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,910
The leader of PROWDMAN, Monika, has also joined us.

355
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,809
Hello, I'm Monika.

356
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,119
Welcome. It's a pleasure.

357
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,179
It's nice to see you after so long.

358
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,420
It's nice to see you every time as well.

359
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,219
May I ask you for a few words of support...

360
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,660
for the nervous dancers?

361
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,828
Watching the opening performance,

362
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:28,130
I reacted in a way that I never expected.

363
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,469
I thought, "I would be witnessing..."

364
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,640
"the best performance of the year tonight."

365
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,868
It's almost December,

366
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,309
and my heart is racing once again so late.

367
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,308
They were incredible.

368
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,250
I can't wait to watch the other performances.

369
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,509
- Good luck, guys! - Thank you.

370
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,989
In Stage Fighter's Final STF Showcase,

371
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,058
we'll tally the votes from STF Online Casting Voting...

372
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,689
and Live Text Voting to determine who will join the STF Company...

373
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,730
and be the principal dancer.

374
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,268
The STF Online Casting Voting has just been closed.

375
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,798
In the STF Online Casting Voting for Seat Class Evaluation,

376
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,308
the total number of seats voted...

377
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,838
(Hye Hyun has the best skills.)

378
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,480
is 175,007.

379
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,079
We appreciate everyone who voted.

380
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,979
The 20 dancers who advanced to the finals...

381
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,518
have sold out all 3,000 VIP seats...

382
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,190
today...

383
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,690
and proved their ticket-selling power.

384
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,960
Once again, I appreciate everyone who voted.

385
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,929
However, the dancer's fate...

386
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,569
will be determined...

387
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,939
by Live Text Voting.

388
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,838
I will now announce how to participate in Live Text Voting...

389
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,749
to determine who will join...

390
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,480
Live Text Voting, which will take up 70 percent.

391
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,490
Here's how to participate in Live Text Voting.

392
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,588
During the live broadcast, write the first and last name...

393
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:05,400
of the dancer of your choosing and send it to 0011.

394
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,900

(Live Text Voting begins now.)

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,079
We will now commence Live Text Voting of Stage Fighter.

417
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:55,579
Five.

418
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,579
Four.

419
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Three.

420
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,519
Two.

421
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,549
One.

422
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,420
(Live Text Voting begins.)

423
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,258
The Live Text Voting of the Final STF Showcase...

424
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:14,499
on Stage Fighter has begun.

425
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,729
Write the first and last name of the dancer you're rooting for...

426
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,038
and send it to 0011.

427
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,008
We encourage all of you to participate...

428
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,569
to support the dancers.

429
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,949
I will now reveal the final mission...

430
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,119
before joining the STF Dance Company.

431
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,720
The mission of the Final STF Showcase is...

432
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,019
(Jong Cheol)

433
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,559
the STF Last Casting Mission.

434
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,489
The STF Last Casting Mission is...

435
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,358
the final mission for the dancers...

436
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,929
to earn the solo part of the song.

437
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,768
Which dancer will take the solo part...

438
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:56,469
and join the STF Dance Company?

439
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,039
It will be revealed during tonight's show.

440
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:02,848
Final STF Showcase.

441
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,818
Here are the synopsis and casting board...

442
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,879
of the first piece in the STF Last Casting Mission,

443
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,220
which will determine who will join the STF Dance Company.

444
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,558
("A Divine Pastime")

445
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,859
(choreographer: Jo In Ho)

446
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,230
(Hye Hye)

447
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,568
The first piece of the STF Last Casting Mission,

448
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,899
"A Divine Pastime," portrays...

449
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,969
the free-spirited and joyful dances of immortals,

450
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,380
delivering hope and comfort to the world.

451
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,210
Here are the dancers who will perform the piece.

452
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,319
For the Sun Immortal's role, Kang Gyeong Ho.

453
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,589
For the Moon Immortal's role, Kim Yu Chan.

454
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,930
For the Stone Immortal's role, Kim Si Won.

455
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,309
For the Water Immortal's role, Park Jun Woo.

456
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,549
For the Crane Immortal's role, Shin Min Kwon.

457
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,920
For the Pine Immortal's role, Kim Tae Seok.

458
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,129
For the Deer Immortal's role, Jung Hye Seong.

459
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,759
A total of seven dancers have been cast.

460
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:31,098
Who will be the dancer...

461
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,598
to get a chance to show off his dance...

462
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,109
in the solo part?

463
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,979
The Final STF Showcase of Street Fighter,

464
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,609
"A Divine Pastime" of the STF Last Casting Mission...

465
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,509
will begin now.

466
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,450
First position.

467
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,589
Light.

468
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,059
Stage. Start.

469
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,089
What will it be?

470
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,799
We'll probably form teams.

471
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,528
Maybe it's another team mission...

472
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:02,630
like the K-Contents Mission.

473
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,069
Or...

474
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,970
(STF Last Casting Mission)

475
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:10,239
It's finally time to put an end to this.

476
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,778
I was wondering how I should show myself this time.

477
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,108
"All dancers."

478
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,578
"Process. Review the soundtrack and casting board..."

479
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,018
"of the showcased works,"

480
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,579
"then select the desired work."

481
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,249
"Within the selected work, there is a designated section..."

482
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,749
"for a solo dance performance."

483
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,490
"This section's soloist will be decided through voting."

484
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,328
We're all dancers and artists.

485
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:33,059
I believe the evaluation will be more precise.

486
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,869
It must depend on the music.

487
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,700
- What is this? - What?

488
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,170
(The first piece, "6P: M")

489
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,669
(The dancers carefully listen.)

490
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,910
- What? - What's this?

491
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,479
It totally sounds like ballet.

492
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,910
It sounds like ballet, doesn't it?

493
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,980
I'd be able to show people what I was good at.

494
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,679
(The second piece, "Neuro-Flux")

495
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,289
The genres are different.

496
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,420
That might be it.

497
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,019
This is a tough song.

498
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,930
I wanted to try something new.

499
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,629
It's a new type of music.

500
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,230
I liked this song.

501
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,669
(The third piece, "A Divine Pastime")

502
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,740
Yes, it's about time we did a Korean traditional music.

503
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,039
We should take this one.

504
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,838
As soon as I heard the beats of Korean traditional music,

505
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,839
I thought it was over.

506
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,640
Perhaps I should give people a taste of true Korean music.

507
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,209
(He chooses "A Divine Pastime" without much thinking.)

508
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,880
We need to go for Korean dance.

509
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,949
(Jun Woo, the Korean dancer, also chooses "A Divine Pastime.")

510
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,549
I think it'll be easier to come up with a sequence.

511
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,088
What will be our choice?

512
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,190
(Who are the dancers that chose "A Divine Pastime?")

513
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,089
(Revealing the casting board for "A Divine Pastime")

514
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,230
Gyeong Ho and Yu Chan?

515
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
("A Divine Pastime")

516
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:39,329
A lot of ballet dancers chose "A Divine Pastime."

517
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,230
There are types of music that are advantageous to ballerinos.

518
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,499
But I wondered why they chose Korean music.

519
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,068
I could have chosen a song...

520
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,709
in which I could showcase the techniques I was good at,

521
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,709
but I believed that I should keep challenging myself...

522
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,680
to become a type of dancer that I pursued.

523
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,009
They're going to regret it, though.

524
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,720
Let's judge them.

525
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,390
He actually looks like a Taoist immortal.

526
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,819
Here comes an immortal.

527
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,059
(A relaxed immortal)

528
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,430
(Impressed)

529
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,499
(Si Won's dance is relaxed and neat.)

530
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,559
That's nice.

531
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,029
(Turning)

532
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,099
(Amazed)

533
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,439
(Looking like an immortal)

534
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Nice and neat.

535
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:25,579
(Amazed)

536
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,308
The final pose sets the whole mood.

537
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,879
Like the Immortal of the Stone.

538
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,680
They responded favorably, so I reckon it'll go well.

539
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,879
(Let's check out the solo section...)

540
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,650
(by Park Jun Woo.)

541
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,990
- He's good. - Lovely.

542
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,359
- He came up with a great one. - He did.

543
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,759
His eyes have gone mad.

544
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,799
He looks so gentle.

545
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,329
(Exclaiming)

546
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,669
(All right.)

547
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,769
He's good.

548
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,869
(Jun Woo goes around the stage with gentle and light movements.)

549
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,710
(Ding)

550
00:28:57,711 --> 00:28:59,880
- And the sound at the end. - Even the sound.

551
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,380
I shouldn't turn into an audience, but that was pretty cool.

552
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,180
- He went totally old-school. - Yes.

553
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,019
Jun Woo might get the part.

554
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,920
There was no one but me who could have pulled off the solo part.

555
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,358
The two were Korean dancers,

556
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,159
so neither of them had the same vibe as mine.

557
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,559
So, I looked forward to winning.

558
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,558
How will he pull off Korean dance...

559
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,200
with the classical style of ballet?

560
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,369
Go.

561
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,369
(Amazed)

562
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:31,609
He's good.

563
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,039
(Impressed)

564
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,109
Yu Chan is good.

565
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,950
He understands Korean dance.

566
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,279
(Surprised)

567
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,150
(Facial acting)

568
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,990
(Finishing with a light turn)

569
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,789
He's even acting with his face.

570
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:53,160
- The famous spiteful Yu Chan. - I approve.

571
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,930
I was glad that they enjoyed it.

572
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,199
I can't tell who will win.

573
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,400
- They're all so good. - Yes.

574
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,700
How am I supposed to pick one?

575
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,069
It was such a close match. They were all entertaining.

576
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:06,808
(Gyeong Ho's powerful movements stood out.)

577
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,379
(Min Kwon naturally mixed ballet with Korean dance.)

578
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,879
(Hye Seong's quick movement changes and acting are impressive.)

579
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,949
(Tae Seok's shows off his unique and groovy composure.)

580
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,720
(The dancers interpreted the song in their own ways.)

581
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,758
- I can't tell who will win. - This is a tough call.

582
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,859
(Who will get the solo part in "A Divine Pastime?")

583
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,200
All right!

584
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,460
(Kim Yu Chan's solo section)

585
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,630
(Jo In Ho, choreographer of "A Divine Pastime")

586
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,419
The first piece of STF Last Casting Mission,

587
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,619
"A Divine Pastime." Thank you for the performance.

588
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,719
Dancers of three different genres performed...

589
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
to Korean traditional music and created an entertaining piece.

590
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,190
And the winner of the solo section in this song was Kim Yu Chan.

591
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,758
I'd like to ask what people thought about "A Divine Pastime."

592
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,629
Let's hear from Master Kim Joo Won first.

593
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,440
- Master Kim Joo Won. - Yes.

594
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:57,240
First of all, I enjoyed it very much. Well done, dancers.

595
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:04,009
I'd like to start with Yu Chan.

596
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,078
If it weren't for Stage Fighter,

597
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,749
I wouldn't have noticed such a beautiful dancer.

598
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,690
I'm truly sorry about that.

599
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,299
Yu Chan is a type of ballerino who makes me realize...

600
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,598
how a dancer with the basic skills of ballet...

601
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,010
can interpret a different genre with such a wide and flexible range.

602
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:31,509
While showing

603
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,109
such accurate and perfect movements of ballet,

604
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,018
he wonderfully portrays himself when mixed with a different genre...

605
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:43,049
using the fundamental skills of ballet...

606
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,519
and flexibly interpret that genre by embracing it as a whole.

607
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,090
Yu Chan is such an impressive ballerino.

608
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,229
I'm convinced that he's a dancer...

609
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,199
who can perform various genres from various places as a ballerino.

610
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,670
Thank you for the performance, Yu Chan. I enjoyed it.

611
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,369
Yes. And...

612
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,309
Gyeong Ho. What a charmer.

613
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,319
Gyeong Ho is a dancer...

614
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,820
who is packed with charms.

615
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,659
It's almost too difficult...

616
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,130
to define him as a dancer of a single genre.

617
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,729
He's a dancer...

618
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,670
who dances in his unique style.

619
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,738
From the beginning to now,

620
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:38,109
he's never failed to show his brilliant capacity,

621
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,110
charms, style,

622
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,320
technical sides, and artistic sides.

623
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,518
He's such an impressive dancer.

624
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,519
From when you were sitting...

625
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,089
to the energy you showed us as you pushed forward,

626
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,428
I believe you portrayed the strength and charms...

627
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:01,960
of this piece superbly.

628
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:04,769
Great work, Gyeong Ho.

629
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,869
And...

630
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,809
Hye Seong.

631
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,178
Hye Seong, did you know...

632
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:17,579
that I liked you a lot from the start? I bet you didn't.

633
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,789
From the time we had the Physical and Technique Audition,

634
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,519
I fell for you big time.

635
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:29,759
"Just where has this small giant or monster been..."

636
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,499
"all along?" I thought.

637
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,099
Then I absolutely fell in love.

638
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,098
In today's performance as well,

639
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,299
you showed monster-like movements and energy...

640
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,869
that were uniquely you.

641
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,439
No matter which stage you take...

642
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,179
or which situation you face in the future,

643
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,678
I hope you'll stay happy and give...

644
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,320
good performances...

645
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,889
while believing in your incredible talent.

646
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,250
I enjoyed your performance today.

647
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,960
Master Kim Joo Won, thank you for your kind words.

648
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,929
Coach Jung Bo Kyung,

649
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,500
what did you think of the performance?

650
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:10,729
Since it was the work of Choreographer Jo In Ho...

651
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,900
who specializes in the Korean dance and contemporary dance,

652
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,908
the performance had stylishness of the Korean dance...

653
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:17,809
as well as modernity of the contemporary dance.

654
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,539
It was really cool and amazing.

655
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,609
Firstly, I'll give a short review...

656
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,280
on Park Jun Woo.

657
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,019
You played the Water Immortal.

658
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,989
Yes. Jun Woo, your strength...

659
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,988
lies in the use of the Korean dance tempo...

660
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,489
for the energy of the dance.

661
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,299
Your biggest strength is...

662
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,500
that you preserve the Korean dance elements well.

663
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,570
In every mission,

664
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,769
you walked the fine line...

665
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:49,510
and showed your charms.

666
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,840
I'm very thankful you did that.

667
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,139
In today's performance, you had...

668
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,050
a solo part in the left side.

669
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,908
You showed the Korean dance that was very relaxed and stylish.

670
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,719
I really enjoyed it. Thank you.

671
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,090
Next comes...

672
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,230
Kim Si Won who played the Stone Immortal.

673
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,928
Si Won,

674
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,839
with your unique character, you left a strong impression...

675
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,239
in each episode.

676
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:27,879
Because of your intense character, I worried...

677
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,678
that you wouldn't be able to break free.

678
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,250
But in today's performance,

679
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,019
you controlled yourself...

680
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,190
while adding your character to the dance.

681
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:40,159
You shattered my worries...

682
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,888
through your performance.

683
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,360
I really enjoyed it. It was outstanding.

684
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,468
Next comes Kim Tae Seok. So far, you...

685
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,138
(Kim Tae Seok)

686
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:55,739
You have many fans.

687
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,210
So far,

688
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:01,309
you've always kept your place...

689
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,710
without a complaint.

690
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,920
Today, you used your ballet techniques.

691
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,519
When the choreography switched to the Korean dance,

692
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,089
you changed up the sensibility of your dance...

693
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,590
in an impressive manner.

694
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,130
It was very cool.

695
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,570
Shin Min Kwon, you played the Crane Immortal.

696
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,238
I was very surprised...

697
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,739
when you danced with Si Won in the middle.

698
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,138
You used to dance on your toes, but you lifted up your toes...

699
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,579
and perfectly pulled off the vibe of the Korean dance.

700
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,448
It was incredibly cool. Thank you.

701
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:41,419
(Shin Min Kwon)

702
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,949
Coach Jung Bo Kyung, thank you for your kind words.

703
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:46,260
I'll now reveal...

704
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,789
the "A Divine Pastime" dancers' STF Online Casting Voting results.

705
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,189
Among the dancers, the one who sold...

706
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,099
the most number of seats was...

707
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,570
Kang Gyeong Ho.

708
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,939
In only 18 minutes, Kang Gyeong Ho...

709
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,769
sold out VIP seats.

710
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,738
He sold out...

711
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,339
all VIP, S, and R seats...

712
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,750
and proved his unrivaled ability to sell tickets.

713
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:13,078
I'll now reveal the "A Divine Pastime" dancer...

714
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,649
who ranked at the bottom...

715
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,719
according to the STF Online Casting Voting results

716
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,859
Among the seven "A Divine Pastime" dancers,

717
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,960
the one who ranked at the bottom was...

718
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,500
Kim Tae Seok.

719
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,909
However, this result isn't the end.

720
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,480
Live Text Voting scores will get added...

721
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:42,439
to determine the members of STF Dance Company...

722
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,510
and the principal dancer.

723
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:46,349
The dancers who participated in "A Divine Pastime" were...

724
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,920
Kang Gyeong Ho, Kim Si Won, Kim Yu Chan,

725
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,650
Kim Tae Seok, Park Jun Woo, Shin Min Kwon,

726
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,189
and Jung Hye Seong. If there's a dancer you want to cast...

727
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,130
for STF Dance Company,

728
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,860
please write his full name...

729
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,099
and send the text to 0011.

730
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:05,629
"A Divine Pastime" caught our eyes with its upbeat movements.

731
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,869
Seven dancers, thank you for your hard work.

732
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,319
The first performance...

733
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,630
of the STF Last Casting Mission heated up the atmosphere.

734
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:31,988
I'll introduce the special stage...

735
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,929
that will enrich the final showcase.

736
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,570
This contemporary dance film became the talk of the town...

737
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,739
thanks to its intense dance moves and high quality.

738
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,669
The stage version of "Vampire Sonata..."

739
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,269
will be revealed for the first time.

740
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,439
The stage version will tell a dynamic story...

741
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,549
of an ambitious vampire that is played by Kim Hye Hyun...

742
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,448
who revolts to take away...

743
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,750
Count Vampire's power.

744
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,089
The stage version of the Contemporary Dance Film,

745
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,590
"Vampire Sonata" will begin now.

746
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,760
First position.

747
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,460
Light.

748
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,630
Stage. Start.

749
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,518
(An ambitious vampire tries to overthrow Count Vampire.)

750
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,920
(Will Count Vampire be able to avert the crisis?)

751
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,960
("Bones" by TAEMIN, produced by Czaer)

752
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:11,389
(Yang Seong Yun)

753
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,840
(I need Ryu Tae Young.)

754
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,099
(You can listen to the music in the Dance Film on various platforms.)

755
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:44,509
(We root for the dazzling future of the 24 contemporary dancers...)

756
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,619
(who filled the stage with their passion.)

757
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,828
We've enjoyed the stage version...

758
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:58,929
of the Contemporary Dance Film, "Vampire Sonata."

759
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,130
The performance was as charismatic and shocking as the dance film.

760
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,130
Lip J in the audience,

761
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,899
how was the stage version of "Vampire Sonata..."

762
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,400
by the contemporary dancers?

763
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,678
Firstly, I had only seen the dance through the dance film.

764
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,549
It was an honor...

765
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,279
to have a chance to watch...

766
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,018
the stage version.

767
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:26,288
And there was another touching thing about the performances...

768
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:28,388
of Stage Fighter.

769
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,988
When we watch contemporary dance...

770
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,629
- at a venue, - Yes.

771
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,259
- we have to watch quietly. - That's right.

772
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,829
But here, I couldn't help but exclaim.

773
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,570
I made such sounds.

774
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,738
I could react comfortably...

775
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:47,578
and give energy to the dancers.

776
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,379
I think that made the live performance touching.

777
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,879
I really enjoyed the performance.

778
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,420
Thank you for your kind words.

779
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,050
Monika, what did you think of the performance?

780
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,319
I was confused by the use...

781
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,429
of popular music at first.

782
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:07,928
But through the harmony of music and contemporary dance,

783
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:12,500
more people will be able to enjoy classical dance.

784
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:16,939
Such a special performance takes place only on Stage Fighter.

785
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,509
It reminded me how great this show was.

786
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,710
It was outstanding.

787
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,280
Monika, thank you for your review.

788
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,018
Now, let's continue on with the STF Last Casting Mission...

789
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:29,749
for the Final STF Showcase.

790
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,388
The synopsis and casting board...

791
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:33,289
for the next dance will be revealed first.

792
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,859
("6P: M (6 Pieces in Mind)")

793
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,558
The second dance of the STF Last Casting Mission,

794
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,299
"6P: M (6 Pieces in Mind),"

795
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,029
is about seeing oneself in someone else's eyes.

796
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,698
By doing so, one realizes his inauthentic nature...

797
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,038
and unleashes his hidden desire.

798
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,710
That way, the line between you and I becomes blurred.

799
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,919
(Jong Cheol, you're my star!)

800
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,678
(Yang KARINA, let's debut as a girl group member.)

801
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,420
The dancers of this performance will be revealed.

802
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:13,099
Yun Hyeok Jung as Invidia.

803
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:19,739
Kim Jong Cheol as Luxuria.

804
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,769
Kim Hyun Ho as Avaritia.

805
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,610
Jung Sung Wook as Acedia.

806
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:38,250
Kim Kyung Won as Superbia.

807
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,630
Yang Seong Yun as Ira.

808
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,360
A total of six dancers have been cast.

809
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,029
For this performance, which dancer was cast...

810
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,999
for the solo section?

811
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,509
It'll be revealed through the mission stage.

812
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,408
Now, let's check out...

813
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:01,980
"6P: M (6 Pieces in Mind)" for the STF Last Casting Mission.

814
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,980
First position.

815
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,179
Light.

816
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,920
Stage, start.

817
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:14,158
(What's the next performance for the Casting Audition?)

818
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,219
I'm nervous.

819
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,429
I'm more nervous since it's ballet.

820
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,260
(Classical music is the basis of "6P: M.")

821
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,199
But there are many contemporary dancers.

822
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:25,069
I wonder what Hyun Ho will do.

823
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,539
I think it'll be fun.

824
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:28,099
(Si Won, Hyun Ho, and Sung Wook)

825
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,169
(Sung Wook formed the ballet lovers' club.)

826
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,409
There's Seong Yun too.

827
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:31,709
We have to do this.

828
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,710
(A ballerino's pride)

829
00:49:32,711 --> 00:49:34,178
- Pointe. - Good luck.

830
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,210
Let's go.

831
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,409
Nice.

(Kim Hyun Ho's Solo Interpretative Choreography Section)

833
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,479
(It's electrifying.)

834
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,389
He's the icon of unexpected charms. He's insane.

835
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,019
Here comes the ballerino.

836

(Kim Kyung Won's Solo Interpretative Choreography Section)

840
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,369
Pointe.

841
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,099
He's a warrior.

842
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,940
(Impressed)

843
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,340
Was my interpretation wrong?

844
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,079
Why are all of them doing ballet?

845
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,379
On the other hand, I thought, "I'll be able to stand out..."

846
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,678
"if I do well."

847
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,179
I'll use it if you do really well.

848
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,579
I wrote "Good" on my fingers.

849

850
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,119

He's angry.

Good.

859
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:36,070
I made thorough preparations and did my best.

860
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:38,808
Hyeok Jung as Invidia or envy.

861
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,840
In the synopsis, my role was Invidia.

862
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,610
I wanted to show instability,

863
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,119
so I put a lot of effort into my face and expressions.

864
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,518
- Gosh, Hyeok Jung. - What?

865
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,919
You're dabbing makeup on your face prettily.

866
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,359
(He even wore makeup to bring out the expressions.)

867
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,630
How annoying.

868
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,729
There goes the middle-aged man.

870

(I love it.)

874

He's smiling.

875
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,050
He's like an actor.

876
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,050
(Almost touching)

877
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,649

879

He's cool.

880
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:29,218
Hyeok Jung's choreography was very innovative.

881
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,889
I thought that it'd change up the vibe of the performance.

882
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,900
I'm really looking forward to Sung Wook's choreography.

883
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,029
Finally, I'll be able...

884
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,768
to show the audience...

885
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:39,530
what I'm really good at.

886

901
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:17,369

00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,709
(The 6 dancers of "6P: M" showed 6 different charms.)

904
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,879
(Who will get picked for the solo section?)

905
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,678
Among the "6P: M" dancers, I picked Jung Sung Wook.

906
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,549
- Jung Sung Wook. - Sung Wook.

907
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,050
I voted for Sung Wook.

908
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:33,319
Since you voted for me, I'll give...

909
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,488
a tasteful ballet performance.

910
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,989
(Very excited)

911
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:38,989
I can't wait.

912
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,929
Since this is the last,

913
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,230
I'll practice diligently until my body gives out.

914
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:46,429
I'll do my absolute best.

915
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,339
I'll give a cool ending...

916
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,939
to this show.

917
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,570
(How will be the "6P: M" stage with the 6 dancers' charms?)

918
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,179
Let's go.

919
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,969
Let's go.

920
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:17,190
(Jung Sung Wook's solo choreography)

921
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,579
- Let's go. - There you go.

922
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,610
Let's go.

923
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,529
(Tiger Hyun)

924
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,468
(You can listen to the original song on various platforms.)

925
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:31,800
(Jong Cheol, you're my star!)

926
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,649
We've enjoyed "6P: M (6 Pieces in Mind)..."

927
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,388
of the STF Last Casting Mission.

928
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,689
The movements of the six dancers...

929
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:57,988
who represented envy, lust, greed,

930
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:00,129
sloth, pride, and wrath...

931
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,529
delivered the story perfectly...

932
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,268
in the impressive performance.

933
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:07,940
The Solo Choreography was given by Jung Sung Wook.

934
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,369
Rehearsal Director Matthew,

935
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:14,510
how did you feel about Jung Sung Wook's solo performance?

936
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:19,510
Sung Wook, I'm really happy to see your dancing this evening.

937
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,178
And to see you dancing with such confidence again.

938
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,250
It made me very happy and proud.

939
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,988
I've been very happy...

940
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:30,860
also to see your growth throughout this program...

941
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,598
to see where you started and where you finished.

942
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,928
It's very rewarding as a rehearsal director.

943
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:39,230
So, congratulations on your performance tonight.

944
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:44,139
He said he was glad to see his performance full of confidence...

945
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:47,439
and his progress through this program...

946
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,149
made him very happy as a rehearsal director.

947
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,210
Thank you.

948
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,848
Thanks for your comment, Matthew.

949
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:56,750
Then, Ryu Hoi Woong, how did you feel about it?

950
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,150
First, thanks for the performance.

951
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,090
Kim Hyun Ho,

952
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,659
you are a true dancer who can dance in any genre.

953
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,699
I'm looking forward to seeing your next move,

954
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,429
you the Chameleon.

955
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,069
(Kim Hyun Ho the Tiger, dash out!)

956
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,699
I could feel your passion for ballet.

957
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,769
That made me feel really happy.

958
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:20,309
Seong Yun,

959
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:24,150
you were the perfect role for expressing anger.

960
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,948
Using your long legs and arms,

961
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:28,750
you showed very agile and powerful movement.

962
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:33,389
Adding that, your acting using face was more than...

963
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:36,090
one can imagine.

964
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,590
You are the Black Hole!

965
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:43,329
Thanks for your work!

966
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:47,198
Ryu Hoi Woong, thanks for your comment.

967
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,768
(Kim Hyun Ho the Tiger)

968
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:51,538
(Kim Hyun Ho)

969
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:54,979
Among the six dancers who performed on the stage,

970
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,980
who'll be able to join STF?

971
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,320
And among those, will we see the next principal dancer?

972
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,618
So, we come back to Six Places in Mine.

973
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:06,049
Through the Seat Class Evaluation,

974
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,119
we announce the result of the STF Online Casting Voting.

975
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,658
Among the six dancers,

976
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:13,730
the one who got the majority in the voting were...

977
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:21,598
(Stage Fighter)

978
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,599
(Sung Wook's skills...)

979
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,868
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol...

980
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:26,409
(dominate the stage.)

981
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,920
and Yun Hyeok Jung.

982
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,558
Among the two who proved their power to attract the audience,

983
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,559
will we see the principal dancer?

984
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,159
The result will be announced shortly.

985
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,929
Next, we announce the dancers who remained in the lower rank.

986
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:55,639
The dancer who got the least vote for their Seat Class by ticketing...

987
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,340
is either Kim Kyung Won or Yang Seong Yun.

988
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,288
Among the two, will one be able to join the STF Dance Company?

989
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:13,760
Or both of them will fail to join?

990
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:16,360
The result is not set yet.

991
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,359
Among Kim Kyung Won, Kim Jong Cheol,

992
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,198
Kim Hyun Ho, Yang Seong Yun,

993
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:22,629
Yun Hyeok Jung, and Jung Sung Wook,

994
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,999
if you support one of them,

995
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,968
write down the dancer's full name...

996
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:30,199
and send a message via the number 0011.

997
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,908
Your message will decide...

998
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:34,480
who will join the STF Dance Company.

999
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,709
Thanks to all the dancers for showing...

1000
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,550
your delicate feelings on the stage.

1001
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:46,820
- Stage Fighter! - Stage Fighter!

1002
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:52,190
(Jong Cheol!)

1003
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,029
And the next stage continues!

1004
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:01,169
This stage went viral even before it was released on this program.

1005
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,738
It showed what's the beauty of Korean dance.

1006
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:05,038
It's the stage version of "The King's Wish: Reign of Peace..."

1007
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,280
from the Korean dance film.

1008
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,348
This stage version has a definitely different viewpoint...

1009
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,009
from the dance film version.

1010
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,118
Dancer Choi Ho Jong, who failed...

1011
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,888
to be a main lead role candidate...

1012
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:19,388
in the Dance Film Casting Audition,

1013
01:00:19,389 --> 01:00:22,158
becomes King Taejong, Sejong,

1014
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:24,489
and Ho Jong on this stage.

1015
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,499
How could he express the King of Joseon?

1016
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,859
The Korean dance film,

1017
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,368
the stage version of "The King's Wish: Reign of Peace..."

1018
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:33,000
begins now.

1019
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:35,500
First position.

1020
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:39,369
Lights.

1021
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,480
Stage, start.

1022
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,899
("The King's Wish: Reign of Peace")

1023
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,499
(Choreographers: Kim Jae Seung and Choi Ho Jong)

1024
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,099
(Performance directing: Jung Bo Kyung)

1025
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,590
(Kim Min Seok)

1026
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,570
(Ho Jong, let's conquer space!)

1027
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,550
(Ho Jong the Great)

1028
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,760
(Kim Si Won)

1029
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:28,940
(Kim Jong Cheol)

1030
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,529
(You can listen to the music...)

1031
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,329
(in the Dance Film on various platforms.)

1032
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:11,018
(We support the bright future of 24 dancers...)

1033
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:17,689
(who performed with fluent movement and line on the stage.)

1034
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:22,428
(Stage Fighter the Final)

1035
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:24,698
The Korean dance film, "The King's Wish: Reign of Peace."

1036
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:27,130
Thanks for your performance.

1037
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:28,669
We could see...

1038
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,669
what it means to be King Taejong, Sejong, and Ho Jong.

1039
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,840
Joo Won on the stage seat. Are you enjoying it today?

1040
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,979
I'm surely enjoying it today.

1041
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,049
Thanks.

1042
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:44,250
Which performance until now was your favorite?

1043
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:49,689
I guess the latest one was the best for me.

1044
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,129
I see. I hope you have a nice time here.

1045
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,130
- Thanks. - Thanks.

1046
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,829
Actor Lee Sang Yeob.

1047
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:58,399
You were fully absorbed in the stage.

1048
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,229
"The King's Wish: Reign of Peace."

1049
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,869
Did you like it?

1050
01:05:04,469 --> 01:05:07,340
From the very generous side of the king...

1051
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,110
to the fullness of anger,

1052
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,848
I could see the ideal king...

1053
01:05:12,849 --> 01:05:16,320
we all imagine at this stage.

1054
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:20,118
That made me really focused.

1055
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,618
Thanks for your words.

1056
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,860
I hope you enjoy the remaining performance too.

1057
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:29,230
Now we continue to the STF Last Casting Mission.

1058
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:37,039
Now we announce the 12th and 13th dancers...

1059
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:40,809
according to STF Online Casting Voting.

1060
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:45,250
The one who is very close to joining the STF Dance Company is...

1061
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,989
Dancer Park Jun Woo.

1062
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,300
The dancer ranked 13th is...

1063
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,969
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon.

1064
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:14,678
(Ho Jong Ping)

1065
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,579
Based on the result including Live Online Voting,

1066
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,980
will these two dancers be able to join STF Dance Company?

1067
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,849
Their fate will be determined...

1068
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,749
by the result of Live Text Voting.

1069
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,090
Please participate as much as you can.

1070
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:30,929
Let's continue...

1071
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:34,400
with STF Last Casting Mission.

1072
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:37,769
Here's the synopsis and casting board for the performance.

1073
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,268
Last Casting Mission, "Neuro-Flux" takes place in a world...

1074
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,779
where artificial intelligence is entangled with the human race.

1075
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,210
While the machine's reasoning and human instincts clash,

1076
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,550
the dancers try to find themselves.

1077
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,920
Here's the cast of seven dancers for this performance.

1078
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,530
Kim Hye Hyun playing Bicentennial Man.

1079
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:16,739
Choi Ho Jong playing AI Prometheus.

1080
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,309
Kim Young Woong playing Beast Machine.

1081
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:29,019
Kim Hyo Joon playing Twin AI.

1082
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:33,650
Kim Kyu Nyeon playing Twin AI.

1083
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,489
Jang June Hyuk playing RoboCop.

1084
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,570
Go Dong Hoon playing Human.

1085
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,439
In "Neuro-Flux," there are 2 dancers who had the 1st and 2nd...

1086
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,379
highest individual points during the last Class Movement.

1087
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,079
They're Kim Hye Hyun and Choi Ho Jong.

1088
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:05,518
As a result, the Casting Audition based on their solo sections was...

1089
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:07,619
more competitive than any other team.

1090
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,518
Which dancer...

1091
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:11,760
won the chance to show his dance?

1092
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,459
Now, Last Casting Mission,

1093
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,899
"Neuro-Flux" will start.

1094
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,199
First position.

1095
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:24,239
Lights.

1096
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:27,710
Stage, start.

1097
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:29,779
(When the mission was announced)

1098
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,680
(Synopsis: In a world where AI is entangled with the human race...)

1099
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,449
The music is very sticky.

1100
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:38,119
- I bet you'll do a good job. - Anything is fine with me.

1101
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:41,460
- Hyo Joon, the music suits you. - I like it.

1102
01:08:41,619 --> 01:08:44,229
It could be amazing if we make good use of the music.

1103
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,890
The music suits Ho Jong too.

1104
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,699
I like this music.

1105
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,670
I prefer this to the first one.

1106
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:54,068
("Neuro-Flux")

1107
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:55,840
(A total of 7 dancers picked "Neuro-Flux.")

1108
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,669
(The Casting Audition is in full swing.)

1109
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:58,769
My love, Kim Hyo Joon.

1110
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,770
It's the result of a clash between...

1111
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:03,010
reasoning and our feelings.

1112
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,809
It talks about the confusion that comes from it.

1113
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,078
With the whirlpool image by spinning on the knees,

1114
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,579
I created something fun.

1115
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,288
(Solo Interpretative Choreography Section)

1116
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:12,619
(Exclaiming)

1117
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,948
(In awe)

1118
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,020
That looks good.

1119
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:16,789
How can he move like that?

1120
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:20,829
(Hyo Joon's lethal weapon: Spinning on his knee)

1121
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,060
(Exclaiming)

1122
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:25,270
He stood on one knee.

1123
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:28,939
- That was good. - He's good.

1124
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:32,170
He has better technique than contemporary dancers.

1125
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,210
It's Young Woong.

1126
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:38,250
I wanted to add the vibe of weightlessness.

1127
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:41,778
While moving like a machine, I wanted to show human feelings.

1128
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:43,279
I wanted to show fluctuations.

1129
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,750
His acting improved so much.

1130
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,829
(Solo Interpretative Choreography Section)

1131
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:54,229
(Naturally immersed)

1132
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:59,698
(A strong ending)

1133
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:00,729
(Shocked)

1134
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,670
- It's impactful at the end. - He showed us at the end.

1135
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:06,239
That looked amazing.

1136
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,840
- You can do it. - I feel nervous.

1137
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,109
Should I do it or not?

1138
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,649
I'm really sorry.

1139
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:13,750
During the last mission,

1140
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,619
I ranked eighth.

1141
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,920
I was disappointed at myself.

1142
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:21,020
So far on the show,

1143
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,858
I never did my specialty, which is moving softly.

1144
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:27,158
I haven't moved...

1145
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,930
with my own groove.

1146
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,068
For this mission, I was determined...

1147
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:35,670
to show that I'm a capable dancer.

1148
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:37,299
(Kyu Nyeon prepared his solo section...)

1149
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,368
You can do it.

1150
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:39,569
(to show his own movements.)

1151
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:45,408
(Solo Interpretative Choreography Section)

1152
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,720
He included popping dance. He knows how to move.

1153
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:48,920
He's good at dancing in segments.

1154
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,250
(The highlight of his technique)

1155
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:54,220
(All eyes are on him.)

1156
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,819
His choreography looks great.

1157
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,859
(Smiling with satisfaction)

1158
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,859
I danced comfortably without feeling pressured after a long time.

1159
01:11:03,699 --> 01:11:04,729
(Exclaiming)

1160
01:11:04,829 --> 01:11:05,970
(He's quite good.)

1161
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:07,840
That was good.

1162
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:10,069
It was nice and neat.

1163
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,810
I enjoyed watching it, and I liked it.

1164
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,010
Ho Jong Ping.

1165
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:18,510
In order to move like a machine,

1166
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:22,250
I tried to move quickly and accurately while being rigid.

1167
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:25,149
I attempted to do something unrealistic.

1168
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,159
(His unrealistic movements start with the intro.)

1169
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:29,619
(Eyes full of anticipation)

1170
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,819
He's starting strong.

1171
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,859
(Solo Interpretative Choreography Section)

1172
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:36,500
He divided it into 20,000 segments again.

1173
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,299
- Gosh. - I knew it.

1174
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,869
He's so light. He doesn't make any sound.

1175
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:45,970
He really looks like a machine.

1176
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:52,479
(Ho Jong Machine looks more machine-like than a machine.)

1177
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:53,909
(Simply in awe)

1178
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,420
That's unbelievable.

1179
01:11:56,619 --> 01:11:57,649
He's fascinating.

1180
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:03,719
He's so flexible.

1181
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,729
(His Casting Audition ends as he stays in his character.)

1182
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,460
He's so amazing.

1183
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,060
Ho Jong was the AI itself.

1184
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:12,699
It's so difficult to pick in this team. What should we do?

1185
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,738
- I vote for Hyo Joon. - I voted for Young Woong.

1186
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:17,710
- For me, it's Ho Jong. - Kyu Nyeon's choreography.

1187
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,608
This team came up with machine-like choreography.

1188
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:22,639
- I can't choose. - All of them did well.

1189
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,710
(Which dancer will get the solo choreography section?)

1190
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,819
(It's revealed now.)

1191
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:02,108
(Choi Ho Jong's solo section)

1192
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:08,849
(Choi Ho Jong's solo section)

1193
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:14,389
(Choi Ho Jong's solo section)

1194
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:20,359
(Choi Ho Jong's solo section)

1195
01:15:08,539 --> 01:15:15,479
(Choi Ho Jong is GOAT.)

1196
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:18,649
(Seong Chang Yong, "Neuro-Flux" choreographer)

1197
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:21,889
- Hye Hyun! - Hye Hyun!

1198
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:25,489
- Hye Hyun! - Hye Hyun!

1199
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:27,159
- Hye Hyun! - Hye Hyun!

1200
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:29,529
Last Casting Mission,

1201
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,130
"Neuro-Flux." I enjoyed it.

1202
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,898
It was a special performance where various characters...

1203
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:36,939
became one onstage.

1204
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,408
As the result of the competitive Casting Audition,

1205
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:41,409
the dancer who won the solo section was...

1206
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,279
Choi Ho Jong.

1207
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,749
With his solo section,

1208
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:53,350
will Choi Ho Jong receive more votes from Live Text Voting?

1209
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,818
Regarding "Neuro-Flux,"

1210
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:58,460
let's hear from Master Kim Joo Won.

1211
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,789
Master Kim Joo Won?

1212
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:03,829
The seven dancers showed...

1213
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,270
an amazing performance today.

1214
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,938
I was...

1215
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:09,069
very touched,

1216
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:10,640
and especially...

1217
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:16,180
I'd like to talk about Choi Ho Jong.

1218
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:21,478
During the last rounds, I tried my best to evaluate...

1219
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:23,779
the dancers as objectively as possible.

1220
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:27,619
I also tried to evaluate...

1221
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:30,358
solely based on their performance on stage.

1222
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:33,988
Since today is the last round,

1223
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:38,130
I'd like to express my thoughts as Ho Jong's fan.

1224
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:43,800
Here's what I think.

1225
01:16:44,569 --> 01:16:49,439
Choi Ho Jong's dance is unique enough...

1226
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,750
to be a dance genre of its own.

1227
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:57,679
In the future, we may hear the term...

1228
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,188
"Choi Ho Jong's power."

1229
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:02,689
I'd like to say...

1230
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:08,100
that he's an artist with an amazing dancing style.

1231
01:17:08,529 --> 01:17:11,000
Ho Jong, thank you so much...

1232
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,728
for all your performances so far.

1233
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:16,369
I'll come to see your performance as a fan.

1234
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:18,010
Well done.

1235
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:21,010
Also,

1236
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:26,779
I haven't given much positive feedback on this dancer.

1237
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:32,220
I'd like to say something about him now.

1238
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,559
I've gotten very fond of this dancer.

1239
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,689
It's Kim Kyu Nyeon.

1240
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:46,329
I believe that he's a dancer with thousand faces.

1241
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:49,170
It's not just that his hair color changes every time,

1242
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,568
but he's also outstanding...

1243
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:54,908
when it comes to expressing various characters.

1244
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:57,579
There's something incomplete about him,

1245
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:01,619
but he has no limits.

1246
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,449
I find that he has infinite potential.

1247
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,519
I also like...

1248
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,630
Kyu Nyeon's sense of humor.

1249
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:16,229
It's rare for an artist to be serious about his style...

1250
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,300
while being witty at the same time.

1251
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,969
I believe that it could be a sign of genius.

1252
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:27,408
I look forward to watching Kim Kyu Nyeon's performance.

1253
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:30,380
I also enjoyed your performance today. Well done.

1254
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,350
Thank you for your words, Master Kim Joo Won.

1255
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:38,119
Coach Choi Soo Jin, tell us what you thought of the performance.

1256
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:41,688
After standing on your feet,

1257
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:44,259
you stood firmly on your hands...

1258
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:49,100
without trembling in the first scene, Kim Hye Hyun.

1259
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:54,869
Your performance is surprising every time.

1260
01:18:55,670 --> 01:19:00,438
You already proved that you're a professional dancer.

1261
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:04,679
From start to finish, your moves were neat.

1262
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,379
The depth of your dance is limitless.

1263
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,478
While watching you perform,

1264
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:13,420
I always wonder how far your expression will go.

1265
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,519
Every moment, your mastery on stage is...

1266
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,429
outstanding as a dancer.

1267
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,590
I really enjoyed it.

1268
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:26,169
I'm sure that all dancers worked...

1269
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:29,140
very hard to stand where you're now.

1270
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,809
From Under Class, you climbed up step by step...

1271
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:36,340
to get to the final round, June Hyuk.

1272
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:42,049
Truly...

1273
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:44,478
In this performance,

1274
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,448
you proved yourself once again and showed us...

1275
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,189
how could you make it all the way here.

1276
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:52,989
With other dancers,

1277
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:57,999
you filled the stage with amazing energy. Thank you.

1278
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,229
I enjoyed it.

1279
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:02,770
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

1280
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,608
I can't wait to find out the result...

1281
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:08,680
of Online Text Voting for Team "Neuro-Flux."

1282
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:11,549
Highly ranked dancers who were announced...

1283
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,549
during the last Class Movement have received a lot of support,

1284
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,149
so the anticipation is much higher.

1285
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:17,679
Among the seven dancers,

1286
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,920
which dancer ranked 1st and 2nd?

1287
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,390
Let's go!

1288
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:26,760
They're Choi Ho Jong and Kim Hye Hyun.

1289
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:32,999
VIP, R, and S seats for both dancers...

1290
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,728
have been sold out.

1291
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,169
VIP seats for Choi Ho Jong were sold out...

1292
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,340
within five minutes.

1293
01:20:39,409 --> 01:20:41,609
It was proof for his popularity.

1294
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,948
During the last Class Movement,

1295
01:20:44,949 --> 01:20:46,749
Kim Hye Hyun defeated Choi Ho Jong...

1296
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:50,020
and ranked first among all dancers. He's a dancer with potential.

1297
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,019
Between two dancers,

1298
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,358
who got more votes and sold more seats?

1299
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:57,390
Will one of them...

1300
01:20:57,789 --> 01:21:01,159
become the principal dancer of STF Dance Company?

1301
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:03,800
This time,

1302
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:07,068
I'll announce the dancer who ranked the lowest...

1303
01:21:07,069 --> 01:21:10,470
based on the result of Online Casting Voting.

1304
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,210
Among seven dancers,

1305
01:21:13,539 --> 01:21:15,239
based on the result of Online Casting Voting,

1306
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:19,979
who ranked the lowest?

1307
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:25,020
It's Jang June Hyuk.

1308
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:31,929
(Jang June Hyuk)

1309
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:34,629
Based on Live Text Voting,

1310
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:38,329
will Jang June Hyuk be able to join STF Dance Company?

1311
01:21:38,569 --> 01:21:41,769
This is just the result of Online Casting Voting.

1312
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:44,738
Live Text Voting that's continuing now...

1313
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:47,270
could change the result anytime.

1314
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:51,578
If there's a dancer you'd like to cast for STF Dance Company,

1315
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:55,449
among Kim Hye Hyun, Choi Ho Jong, Kim Young Woong, Kim Hyo Joon,

1316
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,148
Jang June Hyuk, Kim Kyu Nyeon, and Go Dong Hoon,

1317
01:21:59,149 --> 01:22:00,988
please write their first and last name.

1318
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:04,289
Send the text message to 0011.

1319
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:07,658
Dancers, you showed outstanding expressions of characters...

1320
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:10,460
and danced the choreography perfectly. Well done.

1321
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,979
(Hye Hyun)

1322
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:36,890
All performances for Last Casting Mission have been presented.

1323
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:41,659
While keeping up the vibe, we'll start the next special performance.

1324
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,499
It's the stage version of Ballet Dance Film,

1325
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,100
"Devil Swan."

1326
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:49,099
The film ended with Devil Swan Kang Gyeong Ho's perfect victory...

1327
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,608
as he tried to conquer Angel Swan Jung Sung Wook.

1328
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:56,108
Unlike Ballet Dance Film,

1329
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:58,379
there will be a twist at the end in the stage version.

1330
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,879
How will the stage version of "Devil Stage" turn out...

1331
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,189
with talented ballerinos? It will start now.

1332
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,619
First position.

1333
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:13,529
Lights.

1334
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:16,130
Stage, start.

1335
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:34,108
("Devil Swan" choreographed by Ryu Hoi Woong and Shin Min Kwon)

1336
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,550
(Devil Swan indoctrinates Angel Swan with a malicious ego...)

1337
01:23:36,819 --> 01:23:40,449
("Swan" by MIYEON of (G)I-DLE)

1338
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:21,390
(Kang Gyeong Ho)

1339
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,210
(Ballerino Min Kwon's boom is coming.)

1340
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,849
(You can listen to "Swan" by MIYEON of (G)I-DLE, )

1341
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,420
(the music in the Dance Film on various platforms.)

1342
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:40,068
(We wish a bright future for 16 ballet dancers...)

1343
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:45,510
(who made the stage shine with their elegant movements.)

1344
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:48,778
That was...

1345
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:50,939
the stage version of Ballet Dance Film, "Devil Swan."

1346
01:26:51,109 --> 01:26:53,849
The twist at the end that was different from the Dance Film...

1347
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:55,279
kept me on my toes while watching it.

1348
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,948
- Aiki in the audience. - Yes?

1349
01:26:57,949 --> 01:27:00,489
You seemed to enjoy watching the performance.

1350
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,619
Compared to the Dance Film,

1351
01:27:02,859 --> 01:27:05,189
which do you prefer?

1352
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,699
When I watched the video,

1353
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,699
I was very surprised.

1354
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:16,800
After watching the stage version of "Devil Swan,"

1355
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:20,368
I realized the effort they made for the viewers...

1356
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:24,810
to create another twist in the interpretation.

1357
01:27:24,909 --> 01:27:27,279
As an audience member, I'd like to thank you.

1358
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:29,478
I'm a dancer myself,

1359
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:32,789
but their dancing is more than physical.

1360
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:36,520
Interpreting with layers of muscles has...

1361
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,859
a different charm.

1362
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:43,329
Watching them provided me a fresh look on dance.

1363
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,228
Once again, you've worked hard.

1364
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:48,329
Thank you so much.

1365
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,199
Thank you for your kind words, Aiki.

1366
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:55,170
Actor Song Jin Ho, please tell us what you thought.

1367
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,909
How did it feel to watch ballerinos?

1368
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:01,478
They express themselves with their bodies...

1369
01:28:01,479 --> 01:28:03,250
as they dance.

1370
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,149
I'm an actor myself.

1371
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,618
Not only did they express themselves with their bodies,

1372
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:11,089
but also...

1373
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:13,759
with their faces and fingertips.

1374
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,759
As an actor, I should learn...

1375
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,269
their way of expressing.

1376
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:21,898
I was in awe as I watched them perform.

1377
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:24,000
- Yes. - I was very impressed.

1378
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,810
Thank you.

1379
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:29,339
Now, Stage Fighter last showcase special performances...

1380
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:33,109
and Last Casting Mission performances are over.

1381
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:37,720
Even now, Live Text Voting continues to take place.

1382
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:41,389
While many are cheering passionately for the 20 dancers,

1383
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:44,859
a close match is also happening.

1384
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,188
Soon, 12 dancers will be chosen...

1385
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:50,899
to join STF Global Dance Company.

1386
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,528
Based on your text voting,

1387
01:28:52,529 --> 01:28:55,269
the principal dancer will be determined.

1388
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:57,599
Please send us the dancer's name of your choice...

1389
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,109
to 0011.

1390
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:08,448
There's someone who visited...

1391
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:11,379
the practice room of dancers who made it to the final round.

1392
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,090
He even got a ballet lesson.

1393
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:17,818
Which star went to visit Stage Fighter dancers?

1394
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,489
It's coming up soon.

1395
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:25,028
The intense final round on Stage Fighter to determine...

1396
01:29:25,029 --> 01:29:26,869
dancers who will join STF Global Dance Company.

1397
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,600
Which dancers will have the honor to join the company?

1398
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:32,710
Who will be the principal dancer to lead the company?

1399
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:36,778
Live Text Voting will close soon.

1400
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:39,380
(Soon, Live Text Voting will close.)

1401
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:43,180
Live Text Voting will close now.

1402
01:29:43,649 --> 01:29:44,649
Five.

1403
01:29:45,649 --> 01:29:46,689
Four.

1404
01:29:47,689 --> 01:29:48,720
Three.

1405
01:29:49,689 --> 01:29:50,760
Two.

1406
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:52,689
One.

1407
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:56,930
(Live Text Voting is closed.)

1408
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:01,068
- One, two, three, four, - One, two, three, four,

1409
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:03,340
- five, six, seven, eight. - five, six, seven, eight.

1410

- One, two, three, four, - One, two, three, four,

1411
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:07,109
- five, six, seven, eight. - five, six, seven, eight.

1412
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,310
Should we wait a little longer?

1413
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,538
(Exclaiming)

1414
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:12,549
Hello.

1415
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:14,279
- Hello. - Dong Hoon...

1416
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:16,119
Who is it?

1417
01:30:16,449 --> 01:30:17,618
(Why is Joo Won here?)

1418
01:30:17,619 --> 01:30:19,188
- It's Joo Won. - Who's Joo Won?

1419
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:20,318
(Is it Joo Won that I know?)

1420
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:21,319
He was in "Bridal Mask."

1421
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,459
(Gasping)

1422
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,920
Hello.

1423
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:28,028
(Actor Joo Won appears everywhere...)

1424
01:30:28,029 --> 01:30:30,158
(including movies, drams, musicals, and variety shows.)

1425
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,529
- Hello. - Gosh.

1426
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:33,800
(Nice to meet you.)

1427
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:36,369
I was a huge fan of "Bridal Mask."

1428
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,139
It felt like a dream.

1429
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,269
A sculpted man came toward us.

1430
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:43,340
He was so handsome and tall. I was fascinated.

1431
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,109
His face is so small.

1432
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:48,078
I'm a huge fan of "Stage Fighter."

1433
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:49,818
(Feeling very grateful)

1434
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,819
I called them because I wanted to meet you.

1435
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:54,689
- That's fascinating. - Also to show my support,

1436
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:56,689
I came to visit.

1437
01:30:56,789 --> 01:30:57,789
(Again, it's nice to meet you.)

1438
01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:00,130
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1439
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:04,259
It was fascinating to find out that an actor was...

1440
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,770
watching the show.

1441
01:31:07,529 --> 01:31:09,140
Isn't it time for you to eat?

1442
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:10,969
- We need to eat. - I'm hungry.

1443
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:12,170
We were starving.

1444
01:31:12,609 --> 01:31:14,340
I brought you some snacks.

1445
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:17,039
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1446
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:19,109
I was very hungry,

1447
01:31:19,449 --> 01:31:20,948
and he brought us food.

1448
01:31:20,949 --> 01:31:23,119
He was so bright. I was very grateful.

1449
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,590
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

1450
01:31:27,619 --> 01:31:29,259
(Devouring)

1451
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:30,359
(Eating)

1452
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:31,890
(Chewing)

1453
01:31:31,891 --> 01:31:33,589
(Eating)

1454
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:36,228
(Watching them makes Joo Won feel full.)

1455
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:38,159
I have a question.

1456
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:41,600
Who's your favorite dancer on Stage Fighter?

1457
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:44,299
- My favorite? - That's so cruel.

1458
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,608
(Aren't you curious?)

1459
01:31:45,609 --> 01:31:48,839
I really like everyone.

1460
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,139
To be very honest...

1461
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:52,978
(Could it be me?)

1462
01:31:52,979 --> 01:31:54,349
(Looking at him with anticipation)

1463
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:55,549
(Curious)

1464
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:57,349
My favorite is Ho Jong the Great.

1465
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,579
(I love Ho Jong the Great.)

1466
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,789
- He's my favorite. - Thank you.

1467
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,259
I knew it.

1468
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,119
Mega Stage Mission?

1469
01:32:05,859 --> 01:32:06,988
(During Mega Stage Mission Casting Audition)

1470
01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:09,028
(Choi Ho Jong's choreography shocked everyone.)

1471
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:10,828
(Applauding)

1472
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:12,229
(Choi Ho Jong left a huge impact on his fellow dancers too.)

1473
01:32:12,529 --> 01:32:15,899
I stood up while watching him because I was amazed.

1474
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:17,569
(Oh, my)

1475
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,710
I felt very honored.

1476
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:21,010
I was a little disappointed,

1477
01:32:21,739 --> 01:32:22,739
but it's okay.

1478
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:23,739
(It's not okay at all.)

1479
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:25,038
Is there any performance...

1480
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:26,778
you remember or you enjoyed the most?

1481
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:28,350
Personally...

1482
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:29,978
(Could it be me this time?)

1483
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:31,779
I liked "SKY Castle."

1484
01:32:32,819 --> 01:32:35,389
(I'm the main lead in Team "Sky Castle" B.)

1485
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:36,560
He brought it up.

1486
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:39,358
- Between Team A and B, - Come on, Dong Hoon.

1487
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:40,559
Which did you prefer?

1488
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,060
(Anticipating)

1489
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,499
(Team B's main lead, Yun Hyeok Jung)

1490
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,169
(Team B's main supporting dancer, Kim Yu Chan, Jang June Hyuk)

1491
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,770
(Anticipating)

1492
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:51,470
I liked...

1493
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:52,470
(I'm counting on you.)

1494
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:55,639
Honestly, I prefered Yun Hyeok Jung.

1495
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,278
You don't have to say his name because he's here.

1496
01:32:57,279 --> 01:33:00,050
- Look at his shoulders. - His shoulders are going up.

1497
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,179
You don't have to say his name because he's here.

1498
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:05,479
He knew my name. I was happy to hear it.

1499
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,750
Thank you.

1500
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:11,988
Joo Won, is there a dance style that you'd like to learn?

1501
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,659
To correct my posture,

1502
01:33:14,029 --> 01:33:17,559
I wanted to learn ballet, but I kept postponing it.

1503
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,099
In the beginning, you did basic movements...

1504
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,399
at the barre.

1505
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:24,698
(Barre Technique Audition...)

1506
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,909
(to test their physical strength and foundation)

1507
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:28,769
The day after watching it,

1508
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,109
I signed up for ballet classes.

1509
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:34,849
Shouldn't we give him a lesson now that he's here?

1510
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,020
(Beginner ballerino feels shy.)

1511
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:39,090
From which dancer would you like to get private lessons?

1512
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:41,189
The teachers are one,

1513
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:43,090
two, three,

1514
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:45,289
four, five,

1515
01:33:45,859 --> 01:33:47,189
and six, Yu Chan.

1516
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:50,130
I'm really confident about teaching.

1517
01:33:50,359 --> 01:33:51,828
(STF ballet teachers have gathered.)

1518
01:33:51,829 --> 01:33:53,269
(Who will be picked as Joo Won's ballet teacher?)

1519
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:55,028
Tae Seok is sending him an intense look.

1520
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:56,800
(Please pick me.)

1521
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,510
Since the first episode, I have been cheering for him.

1522
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:03,938
(Cheering?)

1523
01:34:03,939 --> 01:34:05,139
(Anticipation by 200 percent)

1524
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,149
(Is it me?)

1525
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:08,579
It's Dancer Tae Seok.

1526
01:34:08,949 --> 01:34:11,318
(Congratulations on being picked.)

1527
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:12,648
(Putting his hands together with joy)

1528
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:14,050
- Tae Seok. - All right.

1529
01:34:14,689 --> 01:34:16,288
I was so happy.

1530
01:34:16,289 --> 01:34:19,560
I thought that the real recognized the real.

1531
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:23,199
I'm getting old, too.

1532
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:26,469
I don't know how old the dancers are.

1533
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:27,698
I'm quite old.

1534
01:34:27,699 --> 01:34:29,640
You seem older than others.

1535
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:32,339
(Kim Tae Seok showed his best as one of the older dancers.)

1536
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,368
(Kim Tae Seok showed his best as one of the older dancers.)

1537
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:36,238
(During the Class Movement)

1538
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:37,908
(Unfortunately, his prime is over.)

1539
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:41,350
(Kim Tae Seok was challenged by young dancers.)

1540
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,118
It's hard to be easy about it,

1541
01:34:44,119 --> 01:34:46,988
but he accepted it so cheerfully.

1542
01:34:46,989 --> 01:34:49,688
That's why I started to cheer for him.

1543
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:50,959
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1544
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,989
I felt like being rewarded for my hard work.

1545
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,500
I was very grateful.

1546
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,069
Shall we get up?

1547
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:03,269
Turns are the most difficult part for amateur dancers,

1548
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:04,670
but turns aren't hard to do.

1549
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,309
While turning...

1550
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:09,179
(Shooting turns)

1551
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,939
(That looks amazing.)

1552
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:14,409
(He turns into a human top.)

1553
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:15,779
(A clean finish)

1554
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,788
He never turned that many times.

1555
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:22,420
- He seems to be in a good mood. - Today...

1556
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,960
I could turn more easily than usual, so I was surprised too.

1557
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,659
- Without pressure, - Yes?

1558
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,170
Just get the feeling of the spin.

1559
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,269
That's it.

1560
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:36,339
(Did I do well?)

1561
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:38,399
- That was good. - He knows the position.

1562
01:35:38,569 --> 01:35:41,469
You're crouching a little because you're scared.

1563
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:45,310
That's not necessary. Just turn quickly.

1564
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:47,510
Quick.

1565
01:35:47,511 --> 01:35:48,979
That's it. Just like that.

1566
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,118
(Joo Won turns.)

1567
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,249
(Everyone is in awe.)

1568
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,149
The director of your ballet school will be surprised.

1569
01:35:55,149 --> 01:35:57,658
He'll say, "How can you turn..."

1570
01:35:57,659 --> 01:35:59,789
I'm not advanced enough to learn turns yet.

1571
01:36:00,329 --> 01:36:02,658
(Kim Tae Seok's ballet lesson is over.)

1572
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:05,559
I hope you don't get injured until the end.

1573
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,868
To many people, Stage Fighter...

1574
01:36:07,869 --> 01:36:09,438
Just know that this show is really giving lots of people strength.

1575
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:10,898
Don't forget that.

1576
01:36:10,899 --> 01:36:13,108
I'll be waiting for the final performance too.

1577
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:14,340
Anyway, thank you.

1578
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,479
- Thank you! - Thank you.

1579
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:18,079
(Actor Joo Won's surprise visit was a great success.)

1580
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:22,109
When we were preparing for the performance and becoming tired...

1581
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:25,749
It felt like he gave us the strength to let our passion burn.

1582
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:26,949
It felt good.

1583
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:30,319
In 1, 2, 3.

1584
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,529
(A page of their memories that will be a special moment to remember)

1585
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:35,029
(Stage Fighter and Joo Won, We'll cheer you guys on.)

1586
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:45,068
The class battle of dancers where they fight with their bodies.

1587
01:36:45,069 --> 01:36:48,408
Stage Fighter. All voting to cast the dancers...

1588
01:36:48,409 --> 01:36:51,478
who will join STF Global Dance Company have been closed.

1589
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:53,478
(Live broadcast text message voting is now closed.)

1590
01:36:53,479 --> 01:36:56,078
The total number of online casting votes...

1591
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:57,350
through Seat Class Evaluation...

1592
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,949
was 175,007 seats.

1593
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,560
The total number of votes via live broadcast text message voting...

1594
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:06,859
was 112,964 votes.

1595
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,259
Thank you to all of the viewers who participated.

1596
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:14,170
(Prince Shin Min Kwon, Teacher Jung Sung Wook is sexy!)

1597
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:16,669
The online casting vote, worth 30 percent,

1598
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,469
and the live broadcast text message votes, worth 70 percent...

1599
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:19,609
will be combined for the total result.

1600
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:21,709
The final 12 dancers to join...

1601
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,810
the STF Dance Company will be decided.

1602
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:26,078
Upon counting the online casting vote rankings...

1603
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:27,750
and the live broadcast text message votes,

1604
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:31,250
there have apparently been many changes in the dancers' rankings.

1605
01:37:31,649 --> 01:37:34,148
How have these dancers' fates changed?

1606
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:35,819
We will reveal it soon.

1607
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,988
Before revealing the final results,

1608
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:43,898
we'll hear from the coaches...

1609
01:37:43,899 --> 01:37:47,029
and rehearsal director who have been with us since the beginning.

1610
01:37:47,329 --> 01:37:48,729
First, Coach Jung Bo Kyung.

1611
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:52,170
All that's left now is to reveal the results.

1612
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:53,810
How do you feel?

1613
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,909
Actually, compared to the value that we possess,

1614
01:37:58,979 --> 01:38:01,310
dance has been...

1615
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:04,619
considered an unpopular genre of art.

1616
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:06,948
But through Stage Fighter,

1617
01:38:06,949 --> 01:38:09,420
we got to meet with the viewers and the public.

1618
01:38:09,689 --> 01:38:11,520
And we received so much love.

1619
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:14,689
I was truly grateful, and it was an honor.

1620
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:17,199
Also, our dancers, who I'm so proud of.

1621
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,130
Not just the 20 of you who are here now,

1622
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:23,869
but all 64 of you were...

1623
01:38:24,369 --> 01:38:25,399
First Class...

1624
01:38:26,569 --> 01:38:29,640
dancers. I really want to tell you that.

1625
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:34,550
Thank you for...

1626
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,079
Thank you.

1627
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,920
Thank you for making...

1628
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,750
Korean dance as an art form and its future shine.

1629
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:42,289
I'll cheer you on until the end.

1630
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:45,460
Thank you for your kind words, Coach Jung Bo Kyung.

1631
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:48,760
And sitting next to her, Rehearsal Director Matthew.

1632
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,158
I think this must've been a special experience for you too.

1633
01:38:51,159 --> 01:38:54,729
How was it to work with so many male dancers?

1634
01:38:57,399 --> 01:39:00,869
It makes me very emotional to be here in Korea with...

1635
01:39:01,239 --> 01:39:04,039
all 64 of these dancers and to...

1636
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:06,609
experience their journeys,

1637
01:39:06,949 --> 01:39:09,819
their work ethic, their passion,

1638
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,020
and their souls. And...

1639
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,220
they all make me very proud to be Korean.

1640
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:17,260
So, thank you.

1641
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,289
Yes.

1642
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:22,858
Coming to Korea and getting to work with...

1643
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:25,229
all 64 dancers,

1644
01:39:25,329 --> 01:39:27,368
joining them on their journey...

1645
01:39:27,369 --> 01:39:30,100
And getting to see their strong work ethic and passion...

1646
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:33,839
was a great honor, and I'm so proud of them.

1647
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,470
I'm proud to be Korean.

1648
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:38,310
Matthew, thank you...

1649
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,880
so much for your words.

1650
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:42,819
Now, Coach Choi Soo Jin.

1651
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,318
Do you have anything to say...

1652
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:47,119
to the dancers who have worked so hard until now?

1653
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:51,989
Everyone, you've worked so hard until now.

1654
01:39:52,359 --> 01:39:54,889
I believe that this is just the beginning.

1655
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,858
I will keep watching...

1656
01:39:56,859 --> 01:40:00,100
as you perform on even greater stages...

1657
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:02,499
and in many more places...

1658
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:05,539
and show off your amazing dance until the very end. Good job.

1659
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:09,310
Yes, Coach Choi Soo Jin. Thank you for your kind words.

1660
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:10,979
And Coach Ryu Hoi Woong.

1661
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:13,750
I think this must be a rush of emotions for you.

1662
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:15,079
How do you feel?

1663
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,220
Yes, I think...

1664
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:19,889
this was like life itself.

1665
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:22,819
You faced your limits, fell down, and got back up.

1666
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:24,720
Then, you'd do your jumps again.

1667
01:40:24,989 --> 01:40:28,090
All of that will become your foundation...

1668
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,359
so that you can show even more people a better performance...

1669
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,170
and how amazing you are.

1670
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:35,529
I hope you can deliver the power of art.

1671
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,369
You've worked so hard. Thank you.

1672
01:40:38,869 --> 01:40:41,339
Yes, we heard warm words of encouragement...

1673
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,510
from the masters, coaches, and rehearsal director.

1674
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,349
Then, we will hear from those...

1675
01:40:46,350 --> 01:40:48,679
who saw the performances of our dancers in person...

1676
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,550
in the Final STF Showcase.

1677
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,350
First, actor Joo Won.

1678
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:56,359
- Yes. - How was it to see our dancers?

1679
01:40:56,989 --> 01:41:00,289
I truly want to tell our dancers...

1680
01:41:00,989 --> 01:41:04,158
that it was such an honor to get to see you dance...

1681
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,199
with my own two eyes.

1682
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:09,840
I will keep rooting for your future careers,

1683
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,140
and I will continue to remember you. Thank you.

1684
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:14,439
Yes, thank you.

1685
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:18,079
And now, we'll hear from actor Lee Sang Yeob too.

1686
01:41:18,979 --> 01:41:21,180
All of you...

1687
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:23,779
told your stories through your movements.

1688
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:26,988
I was so happy to get to see it.

1689
01:41:26,989 --> 01:41:29,560
I will continue to look forward to and cheer for...

1690
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,460
your stories through your movements.

1691
01:41:33,029 --> 01:41:35,328
- Thank you. - Yes, thank you.

1692
01:41:35,329 --> 01:41:37,759
And Monika, who has watched...

1693
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,470
today's performance intently.

1694
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,538
I heard you really looked forward to the show...

1695
01:41:44,539 --> 01:41:46,738
and enjoyed it from the first performance.

1696
01:41:46,739 --> 01:41:48,539
How was it to see all of the performances today?

1697
01:41:49,609 --> 01:41:51,578
I felt all of the times...

1698
01:41:51,579 --> 01:41:53,809
that you must've worked so hard to master...

1699
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:56,648
where we couldn't see you.

1700
01:41:56,649 --> 01:41:58,380
It was so touching to me.

1701
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:02,318
"How many jumps did you do for that one jump on stage?"

1702
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:05,590
"How much did you contemplate just to stretch that arm out once?"

1703
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,059
Thinking about that as I watched made me get choked up.

1704
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:11,699
I respect you all so much. It was a great honor.

1705
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:13,999
Yes, thank you.

1706
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,470
And Lip J, who's sitting right next to her. Please say a word.

1707
01:42:17,069 --> 01:42:19,938
Yes, I still feel the same way...

1708
01:42:19,939 --> 01:42:22,369
as when I was interviewed earlier.

1709
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:25,380
Seeing your honorable faces...

1710
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:27,409
and your dance in person,

1711
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,849
I loved that I could send you my energy directly...

1712
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:31,979
as I shouted out.

1713
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:35,420
I really enjoyed your amazing performance.

1714
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:37,419
Thank you for your kind words.

1715
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:40,159
And next to her is Aiki. How did you watch...

1716
01:42:40,689 --> 01:42:43,899
the final performance of Stage Fighter?

1717
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:47,228
Actually, when I sat in this seat,

1718
01:42:47,229 --> 01:42:49,069
I noticed Joo Won in the seat next to me.

1719
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:52,539
I wondered if I could focus on the performance.

1720
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:55,339
I was actually pretty nervous.

1721
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:58,639
But I was able to truly focus on the performance,

1722
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:02,249
almost to the point where I didn't notice Joo Won at all.

1723
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:05,350
Thank you so much for showing us a great performance.

1724
01:43:05,779 --> 01:43:08,288
I hope you keep going for your dreams until the end...

1725
01:43:08,289 --> 01:43:09,719
as you think...

1726
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:13,289
that this is only the beginning.

1727
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:14,590
You can do it!

1728
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:17,859
Yes, thank you. And Coach Han Seong Woo.

1729
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:19,899
How did you watch the performance?

1730
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:23,538
First of all, I'm an active male dancer...

1731
01:43:23,539 --> 01:43:26,000
and will go back to my job once this show ends.

1732
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:28,938
From the same position as me,

1733
01:43:28,939 --> 01:43:31,409
you showed everything about the male dancer,

1734
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:34,749
including technique and stamina.

1735
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:38,220
I was so touched as I watched.

1736
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,250
I've been judging you until now,

1737
01:43:40,489 --> 01:43:42,250
but in my heart,

1738
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:45,359
I was clapping again and again every time.

1739
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:46,989
My hands have been worn away.

1740
01:43:47,229 --> 01:43:50,429
Thank you so much for showing us...

1741
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:53,429
great performances each time. Thank you.

1742
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:54,828
Thank you for your nice words.

1743
01:43:54,829 --> 01:43:56,840
And behind him, Coach Seong Chang Yong.

1744
01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:59,000
Could you cheer the finalists on with a statement?

1745
01:43:59,869 --> 01:44:02,270
Yes. Right now,

1746
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:04,738
you must be so tired...

1747
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:08,079
both physically and mentally. It must've been so hard.

1748
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:10,778
You've overcome all of that,

1749
01:44:10,779 --> 01:44:14,148
and you poured everything out on this stage.

1750
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:16,090
I was so touched to see that.

1751
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:18,818
I sincerely hope you become...

1752
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:22,060
even greater dancers in the future.

1753
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,159
Stage Fighter, let's go!

1754
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:27,698
Thank you for your kind words.

1755
01:44:27,699 --> 01:44:30,239
And choreographer Jo In Ho.

1756
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,770
How did you watch this performance?

1757
01:44:32,569 --> 01:44:34,438
I agree with...

1758
01:44:34,439 --> 01:44:36,840
what choreographer Jung Bo Kyung said earlier.

1759
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:39,809
In a way, dance has been a minor art form,

1760
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:42,810
and only those in the industry have been enjoying it.

1761
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:45,379
But through the great dancers...

1762
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:47,090
here on Stage Fighter,

1763
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:50,288
many people discovered the charm of ballet, Korean dance,

1764
01:44:50,289 --> 01:44:53,329
and contemporary dance, which I thought was great.

1765
01:44:53,489 --> 01:44:57,060
I want to clap for the dancers who have worked hard for that.

1766
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:58,460
Thank you.

1767
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,270
Thank you for your inspiring words.

1768
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,069
And choreographer Luda Lee. How did you enjoy the performance?

1769
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:06,840
Please give us a statement.

1770
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,269
Oh, yes.

1771
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:10,879
Today's performance was full of passion,

1772
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,250
and you put all of your body and soul in to it.

1773
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:18,520
Thank you for presenting such a moving performance for us.

1774
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:22,488
I hope you receive even more love in the future...

1775
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:27,089
and show even more people your amazing dance.

1776
01:45:27,090 --> 01:45:29,189
Good job. Thank you.

1777
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,130
Thank you for your kind words.

1778
01:45:32,529 --> 01:45:36,699
How about we hear from choreographer Kim Ju Bin as well?

1779
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:40,670
Yes, hello.

1780
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:45,078
As I watched from the side,

1781
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:47,310

he was known as the boss baby of Stage Fighter.

2140
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:46,119
Not only for his skills as a dancer, but in the Stage Choice by Public,

2141
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,789
he became the best director...

2142
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:51,029

2144
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:55,300

2145
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:05,079
Now that Kim Hye Hyun...

2152
02:14:26,829 --> 02:14:27,829

2155
02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:39,779
Kang Gyeong Ho is just touching.

2156
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:42,449
He's one of the top dancers in the country.

2157
02:14:43,579 --> 02:14:46,979

2158
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:50,818

02:15:58,260 --> 02:15:59,520
I'm Yoo In Chon.

2175
02:16:02,989 --> 02:16:04,590

2177
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:13,539

02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:18,310
I hope the viewers...

2179
02:16:18,609 --> 02:16:21,679

2180
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:24,810
give the dancers here...

2181
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:30,389
a lot of love for a long time.

2182
02:16:30,390 --> 02:16:31,519

(Yoo In Chon)

Thank you for your kind words.

2185
02:16:34,219 --> 02:16:36,828
I will continue to announce the dancers...

2186
02:16:36,829 --> 02:16:39,600
who will join the STF Global Dance Company.

2187
02:16:40,059 --> 02:16:42,299
Now, there are only two spots left.

2188
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:45,500
And they're only two dancers standing here.

2189
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,099
With the final result...

2190
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:49,808
combining 30 percent from the Online Casting Voting...

2191
02:16:49,809 --> 02:16:51,879
and 70 percent from the Live Text Voting,

2192
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:54,738
between Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho and Dancer Choi Ho Jong,

2193
02:16:54,739 --> 02:16:56,109
which will become the principal dancer?

2194
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:57,849
(Kang Gyeong Ho, Choi Ho Jong)

2195
02:16:57,850 --> 02:17:01,620
I will reveal the result of the Online Casting Voting first.

2196
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,988
Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho and Dancer Choi Ho Jong...

2197
02:17:03,989 --> 02:17:07,920
sold out all the VIP, R, and S seats.

2198
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:10,558
Especially, Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho sold out VIP seats...

2199
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:12,798
in 18 minutes after the show.

2200
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:16,200
And Dancer Choi Ho Jong did it in five minutes.

2201
02:17:17,870 --> 02:17:19,738
Therefore, the result of the Online Voting...

2202
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:22,469
was decided by unlimited A seats.

2203
02:17:22,569 --> 02:17:26,779
According to the result of the Online Casting Voting,

2204
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:30,209

02:17:37,219 --> 02:17:39,020
and received 300 points.

2208
02:17:40,989 --> 02:17:43,958
But it's too early for Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho to be disappointed.

2209
02:17:43,959 --> 02:17:46,058
The result of the Live Text Voting isn't announced yet.

2210
02:17:46,059 --> 02:17:47,099
Because the final result...

2211

2212
02:17:49,399 --> 02:17:51,898

2213
02:17:51,899 --> 02:17:54,799

2214
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,238
I will reveal the final result,

2215
02:17:57,239 --> 02:17:58,979
which includes the Live Text Voting results.

2216
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:08,519
Based on the final result combining...

2217
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,649
the Online Casting Voting and the Live Text Voting,

2218
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:13,759

2219
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:17,089
and joins the STF Dance Company as the principal dancer...

2220
02:18:17,090 --> 02:18:19,530

2221
02:18:21,930 --> 02:18:23,799
The Minister will announce the result.

2222
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:42,549

and 700 points from the Live Text Voting.

2232

02:19:23,729 --> 02:19:26,559

2235
02:19:30,069 --> 02:19:31,430
congratulations.

2236
02:19:44,909 --> 02:19:49,049
Dancer Choi Ho Jong, please tell us how you feel.

2237
02:19:58,129 --> 02:19:59,329
Hello.

2238
02:20:02,829 --> 02:20:05,500
It's an honor.

2239
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:10,440
Thank you for loving dance.

2240
02:20:13,079 --> 02:20:15,879
As you all know, I...

2241
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:17,909
am not the King of Dance.

2242
02:20:19,149 --> 02:20:21,818
I'm just one of many dancers...

2243
02:20:21,819 --> 02:20:25,520
who love dance.

2244
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:28,090
I think a dancer...

2245
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:32,260
is someone who has the courage to place their body and mind...

2246
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:35,798
on the anvil to be hammered and become stronger,

2247
02:20:35,799 --> 02:20:38,499
and the resolve...

2248
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:40,139
to strike and shatter.

2249
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:44,568
I will always strive...

2250
02:20:44,569 --> 02:20:46,979
to approach the ideal dancer I envision,

2251
02:20:48,850 --> 02:20:51,479
and I will continually move forward...

2252
02:20:52,049 --> 02:20:55,988
in the direction I believe is right...

2253
02:20:55,989 --> 02:20:57,620
for the dance I find beautiful today.

2254
02:20:58,659 --> 02:21:01,420
Thank you very much for your support.

2255
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:04,059
I'd also like to thank all the dancers in Stage Fighter...

2256
02:21:05,399 --> 02:21:08,059

2257
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:10,870
dance.

2258
02:21:12,639 --> 02:21:14,669
Dancer Choi Ho Jong, congratulations.

2259
02:21:14,670 --> 02:21:15,670
As Choi Ho Jong...

2260
02:21:15,671 --> 02:21:17,638

2261
02:21:17,639 --> 02:21:18,708

has been confirmed to join STF Dance Company in second place.

2263
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:25,878

2264
02:21:25,879 --> 02:21:28,949
(Kang Gyeong Ho is the 2nd-ranked dancer of the STF Dance Company.)

2265
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:30,019

2270
02:21:40,329 --> 02:21:42,930
Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho, how do you feel?

2271
02:21:43,870 --> 02:21:45,129
You're so handsome!

2272
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:51,610
Hello, I'm Kang Gyeong Ho.

2273
02:21:55,649 --> 02:21:57,750
Just a few months ago,

2274
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:02,219
I couldn't even imagine this will come to an end.

2275
02:22:03,219 --> 02:22:07,120
And I'm already holding the mic like this.

2276
02:22:10,129 --> 02:22:13,530
Those who made me come this far.

2277
02:22:14,799 --> 02:22:20,100
The Master, Coaches, and Director.

2278
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:26,209
Lastly,

2279
02:22:27,139 --> 02:22:28,409
my family.

2280
02:22:36,850 --> 02:22:37,889
Well...

2281
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:41,690
I love you.

2282
02:22:47,229 --> 02:22:49,429
I think happiness...

2283
02:22:49,430 --> 02:22:53,040
doesn't come easily.

2284
02:22:54,270 --> 02:22:57,610
But even if it's sometimes,

2285
02:22:58,510 --> 02:23:00,340
even if it lasts only for a moment,

2286
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:04,850
I believe the moment when happiness passes by surely comes.

2287
02:23:06,579 --> 02:23:10,719
For me, this is the moment.

2288
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:14,219
Wishing that moments of happiness...

2289
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:20,260
will frequently pass by...

2290
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:23,670
for me and everyone,

2291
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:28,809
I, as Kang Gyeong Ho in Stage Fighter...

2292
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:30,639
will now take my leave.

2293
02:23:33,010 --> 02:23:34,180
I was grateful...

2294
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:37,510
and loved it.

There are a total of 12 dancers. Congratulations, everyone.

2302
02:24:04,909 --> 02:24:06,509
Mr. Yoo,

2303
02:24:06,510 --> 02:24:09,610
please congratulate the dancers and give them a word of encouragement.

2304
02:24:11,049 --> 02:24:13,619
I think the 12 dancers here...

2305
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:17,149
have already become stars.

2306
02:24:17,420 --> 02:24:22,429
But I think the other dancers who have passed through this stage...

2307
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:27,499
also made it here...

2308
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:29,969
because of their tremendous efforts.

2309
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,000
The reason I'm here today...

2310
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:35,100
is because I wanted to support all of you...

2311
02:24:36,239 --> 02:24:37,440
who have chosen difficult paths in pure arts...

2312
02:24:38,139 --> 02:24:40,709
like ballet, contemporary dance, and Korean dance...

2313
02:24:41,340 --> 02:24:44,309
as your professions...

2314
02:24:44,510 --> 02:24:47,649
and have been working hard.

2315
02:24:48,379 --> 02:24:52,159
The more painfully you move,

2316
02:24:52,889 --> 02:24:55,760
the more people will feel happiness,

2317
02:24:56,129 --> 02:24:59,360
and the more you dance with joy,

2318
02:25:00,030 --> 02:25:02,500
the more people will fell sadness.

2319
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:04,870
Therefore, you can be said...

2320
02:25:05,469 --> 02:25:09,139
to be healers of the souls of our people,

2321
02:25:09,639 --> 02:25:12,979
expressing everything...

2322
02:25:13,739 --> 02:25:15,680
with your bodies.

2323
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:18,149
I hope you all take pride in...

2324
02:25:18,479 --> 02:25:21,318
and steadfastly follow...

2325
02:25:21,319 --> 02:25:24,790
the paths you have chosen.

2326
02:25:25,049 --> 02:25:27,020
Congratulations to you today. Thank you.

2327
02:25:27,559 --> 02:25:29,760
- Thank you, everyone. - Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

2328
02:25:30,530 --> 02:25:32,329
Please give him a round of applause.

2329
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,158
Dancer Choi Ho Jong, Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho,

2330
02:25:34,159 --> 02:25:37,069
please take a seat reserved for the STF Dance Company.

2331
02:25:39,770 --> 02:25:41,100
Yes. After the greeting.

2332
02:25:43,709 --> 02:25:45,539
Mr. Yoo, thank you for your kind words.

2333
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:48,949
Please give him a big hand again.

2334
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:49,979
Thank you.

2335
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:19,679
The journey for the dancers...

2336
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:23,010
who have joined STF Global Dance Company is starting right now.

2337
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:26,619
This coming December, a national tour gala show...

2338
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:29,148
featuring the 40 dancers on Stage Fighter...

2339
02:26:29,149 --> 02:26:31,888
performing various works that were previously revealed...

2340
02:26:31,889 --> 02:26:34,388
on the show will begin, where you can see their performances up close.

2341
02:26:34,389 --> 02:26:37,189
And today marks the beginning of the activities...

2342
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:39,100
of the newly formed STF Global Dance Company.

2343
02:26:39,329 --> 02:26:41,128
Alongside the album release,

2344
02:26:41,129 --> 02:26:43,169
they will kick off a national tour,

2345
02:26:43,170 --> 02:26:46,269
featuring the principal dancer and 11 other dancers.

2346
02:26:46,270 --> 02:26:49,639
Please show a lot of interest in their activities.

2347
02:26:49,969 --> 02:26:52,339
Right after the show, a community for the STF Global Dance Company...

2348
02:26:52,340 --> 02:26:55,479
will open on Plus Chat.

2349
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:58,249
You can enjoy various news and content...

2350
02:26:58,250 --> 02:27:00,879
about the STF Dance Company all in one place on Plus Chat,

2351
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:04,149
which is a communication space.

2352
02:27:05,389 --> 02:27:07,058
The class battle of dancers...

2353
02:27:07,059 --> 02:27:08,959
where they fight with their bodies. Stage Fighter.

2354
02:27:09,059 --> 02:27:12,458
Thank you to the 64 dancers from the genres...

2355
02:27:12,459 --> 02:27:15,200
of ballet, Korean dance, contemporary dance,

2356
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:18,968
as well as Master Kim Joo Won, the Coaches, Matthew,

2357
02:27:18,969 --> 02:27:22,170
and the choreographers.

2358
02:27:22,469 --> 02:27:23,908
The intense but beautiful dance battles...

2359
02:27:23,909 --> 02:27:26,439
have come to an end,

2360
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:29,909
but I ask for your continued interest and love...

2361
02:27:30,149 --> 02:27:34,079
for the 12 dancers of the STF Global Dance Company standing here,

2362
02:27:34,450 --> 02:27:37,148
for all dancers in Korea, and for the Korean dance community.

2363
02:27:37,149 --> 02:27:38,919
Now, I will take my leave.

2364
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:40,958
I'm Kang Daniel who was the MC of Stage Fighter.

2365
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:42,190
Thank you for watching.

2366
02:27:55,670 --> 02:27:57,670
(Stage Fighter)

2367
02:27:58,209 --> 02:28:03,208
(We support the dancers...)

2368
02:28:03,209 --> 02:28:09,089
(who will shine even brighter on stage...)

2369
02:28:09,090 --> 02:28:15,659
(as a result of their countless efforts and hard work.)

2370
02:28:50,629 --> 02:28:53,760
(Goodbye, Stage Fighter.)

2371
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:57,700
Four months have passed already.

2372
02:28:57,870 --> 02:29:00,569
I thought it really has come to an end.

2373
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:02,239
Thinking that it's over...

2374
02:29:02,670 --> 02:29:05,610
On one hand, I'm grateful. On the other hand, I resent it.

2375
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:07,908
The missions were extremely demanding.

2376
02:29:07,909 --> 02:29:09,449
(They were tired sometimes.)

2377
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:12,209
There were so many moments when I wanted to give up.

2378
02:29:12,879 --> 02:29:15,849
But my body moved...

2379
02:29:15,850 --> 02:29:17,619
because I wanted to dance.

2380
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:19,058
Let's cheer up, guys.

2381
02:29:19,059 --> 02:29:20,319
- Let's do it. - We got this!

2382
02:29:20,559 --> 02:29:23,058
I didn't know I could work this hard...

2383
02:29:23,059 --> 02:29:25,159
and do something with so much passion.

2384
02:29:25,389 --> 02:29:27,860
I improved at some point.

2385
02:29:28,129 --> 02:29:29,898
At first,

2386
02:29:29,899 --> 02:29:33,200
we were competing against one another with different goals.

2387
02:29:33,299 --> 02:29:36,639
When will 64 male dancers gather like this again?

2388
02:29:36,739 --> 02:29:39,039
I got to compete against them...

2389
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,939
and create something together.

2390
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:42,110
I got to enjoy it.

2391
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:45,048
Making up my mind that way paid off.

2392
02:29:45,049 --> 02:29:47,718
(The dancers enjoyed it and shined together on stage.)

2393
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:51,189
In the end, the result made by everyone itself...

2394
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:54,760
was a beautiful and meaningful attempt.

2395
02:29:55,389 --> 02:29:58,760
It's the beginning, not the end.

2396
02:29:59,459 --> 02:30:01,529
(The 64 dancers touched our hearts...)

2397
02:30:01,530 --> 02:30:03,529
(as they continued to improve and show us the new side.)

2398
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:05,029
I hope to become a dancer...

2399
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:07,468
who can even shine brighter in the future...

2400
02:30:07,469 --> 02:30:09,908
so that the time spent here was not in vain.

2401
02:30:09,909 --> 02:30:11,270
- The dancers who were waiting... - You worked hard.

2402
02:30:12,610 --> 02:30:14,978
(We'd like to thank the 64 dancers who made Stage Fighter shine.)

2403
02:30:14,979 --> 02:30:17,450
I was truly happy during that time.

2404
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:20,478
Every moment on Stage Fighter...

2405
02:30:20,479 --> 02:30:23,290
is very precious to me.
