(Stage Fighter)

2
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:20,169
What's going to happen today?

3
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:21,809
- What's that? - Hold on.

4
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:23,678
What's that?

5
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:25,779
It's a pyramid.

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,979
What an indisputable class system.

7
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,717
Being in Under Class itself is upsetting.

8
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:31,778
Can't we get rid of this whole thing?

9
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:32,787
(Should I knock it over?)

10
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:34,788
How does it feel to be in Under Class?

11
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,958
Why are you there, Gyeong Ho?

12
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,519
I took his position.

13
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:39,927
A pyramid

14
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:41,328
Do you think there will be a top class?

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,458
It'll be me.

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,658
(I don't think he's joking.)

17
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,699
One dancer gets to go inside the middle.

19
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,737
(The new mission after the class rearrangement begins.)

(Mega Stage Mission with 64 dancers from all genres)

21
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:54,137
(More competitive)

22
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,138
(More intense)

00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,217
(by lead roles to make them shine?)

(Chattering)

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,718
(Those three are masters of sub lead roles.)

30
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:10,819
(What is the result of the Mega Stage Casting Audition?)

31
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:12,988
It's starting.

32
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,588
"Mega Stage Mission"?

33
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:15,597
(2nd Class Locker Room)

34
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:16,929
The mission is written over there.

35
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:18,998
"Mega Stage Mission."

36
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:20,628
The next mission is...

37
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:24,838
the Mega Stage Mission, where all 64 dancers...

38
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,568
work on one piece.

39
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:27,669
"Mega Stage Mission."

40
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:29,509
It'll become much more competitive.

41
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,208
Until now, 16 dancers fought against each other.

42
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,708
But 64 dancers won't be easy.

43
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,449
Honestly, I got excited.

44
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,819
"Can I let loose now?"

45
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,449
"You're all dead," is my mindset right now.

46
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:42,518
Of course, the Mega Stage Mission...

47
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,919
has a casting audition for each class's main roles.

48
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:47,959
Korean dance, contemporary dance, and ballet.

49
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:51,799
The dancers of the three genres will battle for the classes.

50
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:53,668
Korean dance will get first place.

51
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,167
We have different sentiments.

52
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:58,668
It's a genre that you need to be seasoned with experience.

53
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,708
Can the Korean dance vibe be expressed?

54
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,437
When three genres mix,

55
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:03,838
contemporary dance has the advantage.

56
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:07,549
Contemporary dance has a lot of moves on the floor and in the air.

57
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,377
Balance-wise, we're close to a hexagon.

58
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,748
Ballet will catch people's eyes.

59
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,917
I believe ballet is the hardest...

60
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,448
among the three genres.

61
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:18,418
You can somehow follow the dance moves...

62
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,389
of contemporary or Korean dance.

63
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:21,859
But it's impossible in ballet.

64
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,559
Dancers, please do your best.

65
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:27,727
- Now that the genres are together, - Yes?

66
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:28,997
I can't guess what it'll be.

67
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:30,138
- You're right. - Right?

68
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,869
Everyone will have different dance styles.

69
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,739
I'm scared right now.

70
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,007
(It's here.)

71
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:37,179
The synopsis.

72
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,078
(Wihonmu: Dance Consoling Death)

73
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,179
The choreographer is Choi Soo Jin.

74
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,179
It's Choi Soo Jin.

75
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,818
She can do both contemporary dance and ballet.

76
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,418
I'm having a bad feeling.

77
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:50,059
We all need to dance the ballet-based choreography.

78
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:54,928
"The one opposing death, the one fearing death,"

79
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:56,628
"and the one consoling death."

80
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:58,829
- Three dancers. - Three main lead roles.

81
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,097
I always want to obtain the main lead role.

82
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,167
As someone who had the main lead role,

83
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:07,138
the main lead role was treated amazingly.

84
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,038
So I want to become the main lead role again.

85
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:12,448
There was disappointment in being a sub lead role.

86
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,309
I must become the main lead role this time.

87
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:17,179
(Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,119
I have no idea what it'll be.

89
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:20,688
I'm scared.

90
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,917
(1st Round: Fixed Choreography Section Audition)

91
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,459
A sub lead role who will make you shine.

92
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,059
Do we have to choose three each?

93
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,227
(2nd Round: Interpretative Choreography Section Audition)

94
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,758
We need to make an interpretative choreography.

95
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:33,299
(Only dancers who pass the 1st round can participate.)

96
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:36,598
Choosing three sub lead roles means...

97
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:39,769
we need to pick among us, right?

98
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:43,408
We're First Class from each genre.

99
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:45,778
The arrangement can be very dangerous.

100
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,477
Rather than me shining,

101
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,248
the sub lead roles could shine.

102
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,548
Even if the lead role dances in the front,

103
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,747
if any of the three sub lead roles dance better...

104
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,718
and stand out more...

105
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,787
If the three sub lead roles dance better,

106
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,529
I might not outshine them.

107
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:02,629
I must choose those I can conquer.

108
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:05,928
Someone who won't stand out but look weak.

109
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:09,639
I want to select people who don't have the strong points I have...

110
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:11,368
for my strong points to stand out more.

111
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,408
From what I see, everyone in First Class is smart.

112
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:17,279
I must come up with a good plan.

113
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,848
(A fierce strategic battle is expected in the First Class.)

114
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,009
The supporting roles must also have it tough.

115
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:24,178
(Startled)

116
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:25,988
- What? Already? - What is it?

117
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,589
- There are six. - Six main supporting roles.

118
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,288
The main supporting roles...

119
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,958
had about five times more parts than the sub supporting roles.

120
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,288
Main supporting role, no matter what.

121
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,529
What will the audition be?

(Main and Sub-Genre Technique Choreography Audition)

127
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,038
After copying your partner perfectly,

128
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,579
the two dancers are evaluated together.

129
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,249
One does Section A, the other does Section B, and then it's combined.

130
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,319
A team of two dancers exchange choreographies.

131
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,657
I have to make a challenging choreography to survive...

132
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:04,689
so my partner can't copy it.

133
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,889
This is so cruel.

134
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:10,259
I need to make a choreography to eliminate my partner.

135
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,699
It won't be easy.

136
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:15,628
We're competing against a different genre.

137
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,598
I can't predict what techniques they will use.

138
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,167
Turning, jumping, and rolling. Everyone will go wild.

139
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,839
- Everyone here is amazing. - Right?

140
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,339
Ballet...

141
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:27,509
(What?)

142
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:29,048
Can you do ballet?

143
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:30,618
Can you?

144
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:32,418
(Flustered)

145
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:33,749
I got frightened.

146
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,819
Ballet isn't something I can just copy.

147
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:41,189
Ballerino's techniques are out of this world.

148
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,428
The lethal moves of ballet...

149
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,968
can't be mastered overnight.

150
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,298
Let's avoid ballet.

151
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,728
Ballet was my last option.

152
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:50,738
I'll use all techniques possible.

153
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,968
- Showing off my lines. - Keep turning.

154
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,308
Turning 16 times in Section A.

155
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:58,607
They think that contemporary dance...

156
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,878
can be done easily.

157
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,209
But they'll realize it through the mission.

158
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,118
Are jumps and floor the only techniques?

159
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:06,848
The other dancers...

160
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,157
can't possibly copy the challenging...

161
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:11,118
Korean dance's unique circular breathing.

162
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:13,788
I should win by adding in the peculiar taste of Korean dance.

163
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:16,227
- We have the jwawusae technique. - The jwa technique?

164
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:18,258
- The jwa technique. - The jwa technique is good.

165
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,399
I'll use eotmori beat.

166
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:21,368
(Even he finds it funny.)

167
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,167
- I'll go with dongsalpuri. - Are you? Teobeollim for me.

(What are the interpretative technique choreographies...)

169
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:26,569
(by the three genres?)

170
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,407
The lead roles and supporting roles would have similar auditions.

171
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:30,879
But what about the Under Class?

172
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,848
- Under Class doesn't have one. - They don't have one.

173
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,209
That was me.

174
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:38,149
(Under Class Locker Room)

175
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,149
(The casting board is up.)

(Mega Stage Casting Board, Ensemble)

177
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:43,218
- We're spirits. - What? We already have parts?

178
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:44,658
Do we have no roles?

179
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,987
We have no roles.

180
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,058
(The ensemble has no roles.)

181
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,098
We have various spirits from 1 to 40.

(Touched by the 40 options)

183
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,298
Forty spirits?

184
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,639
I had mixed feelings because I was one of the 40 spirits.

185
00:06:58,238 --> 00:06:59,607
As the three genres have combined,

186
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:02,808
I expected a main group dance.

187
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:04,608
But nothing changed for the Under Class.

(Group Dance Casting Audition)

189
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:08,279
(Doubting their eyes)

190
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,249
- We do have something. - Is there a casting audition?

191
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,048
I bet there isn't one.

192
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,189
Really? After getting our hopes up?

193
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:17,417
(There really is one.)

194
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:18,487
It's here.

195
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:19,488
(Choreography Formation Interpretative Audition)

196
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:20,528
(Your group dance formation will be evaluated.)

197
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,728
We have to make a formation for the audition section.

198
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:24,727
(Choreography Formation Interpretative Audition)

199
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,399
"Only the cast genre group dance can get on stage with the lead roles."

200
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,807
- It's a battle between genres. - This is a genre fight.

201
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,038
We have to work as a team.

202
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:38,439
If Korean dance techniques are in the audition, you're all dead.

203
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,009
It's a battle between Korean dance, ballet, and contemporary dance.

204
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,449
It'll be fun.

205
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:44,578
- Hey, guys. - Jong In!

206
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,417
- Jong In! - Let's win!

207
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:48,348
We're in it, too. We should win.

208
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,019
Hey, we can't lose to them. Gather around.

209
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,058
I'll give it my everything.

210
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,857
With me, you can do it. I'll turn the tables around.

211
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:59,499
This is a matter of our genre's pride.

212
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,168
- It'll surely become bloody. - It'll be a dirty fight.

213
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,738
We're an ensemble, either way, so let's become the main one.

214
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,709
It has to be us.

215
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:08,608
The main group dance is Korean dance.

216
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,738
We'll be the ensemble with what we're good at.

217
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:14,648
We have Leader Choi Jong In, who led...

218
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,948
the group dance well in the Film Dance.

219
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:20,448

(The power of group dance, the united Korean dance)

221
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:26,157
It's ours, period. I got a hunch.

222
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:29,058
I'm confident in interpretative dance and formation.

223

00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:37,037
Won't there be favorable elements if we change the choreography...

00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,239

(The practice room with all three genre ensembles)

232
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,157
Turn, down.

233

(The Korean dance ensemble has the choreography down.)

234
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:02,288
- I made a mistake. - Let's do it in formation.

235
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:05,558
- Our moves are fast. That's it. - Dominate them with force.

236
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,068
It's confusing. Gosh.

237
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:09,298
We're in trouble.

238
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:11,499
I can't memorize the contemporary dance moves.

239
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,769
It's challenging. I can't memorize them.

240
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:16,907
As contemporary dance...

241
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:20,078
is new to ballet,

242
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,979
I expected us to face extreme difficulties.

243
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,947
How do I move my arms?

244
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:29,249
Min Kwon. I'm still in the beginning.

245
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,288

(The ballet ensemble is stuck.)

247
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,389
It's hard.

248
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,457
They're still memorizing the moves.

249
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,928
- We're done memorizing. - We did, too.

250
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,499
Ballet was moving quite slowly.

251
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:42,328
It was embarrassing. And very at that.

252
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:44,798
They must've looked down on us.

253
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,269
The ballet ensemble is weak.

254
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,908
We should keep the song playing.

255
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,508
I practiced countless times to get...

256
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:55,678
the choreography down.

257
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,048
I can do it. Let's try until the end.

258
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,448
We're doing great.

259
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:03,158

262
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,958
Contemporary dance indeed had eye-catching moves.

263
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:16,398
Creating a unique yet charming choreography...

264
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,139
is contemporary dance's strong point.

265
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:21,408
I was sure the contemporary dance ensemble was getting the benefit.

For the first time in Stage Fighter,

278

all 64 dancers from the 3 genres, from Korean dance...

279
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,577
and contemporary dance to ballet,

280
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,249
will work together for the Mega Stage.

281

All three genres working on one piece...

283
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:15,058
- are very novel. - I was pumped up.

284
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:18,529
Our genre's pride was on the line.

285
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:19,698
We must win.

286
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,969
Please get the main roles...

287
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:25,668
by going beyond the limit of the genres.

288
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,038
I wanted to be the main lead role again.

289
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,708
I can become the main supporting role.

290
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:33,479
I wanted to show ballet wasn't a genre that should be looked down on.

291
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,148
Mega Stage Casting Audition will begin.

292
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:41,219

The Group Dance Casting Audition...

294
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:47,458
for the Mega Stage piece "Wihonmu" will begin first.

295
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,698
I wasn't anxious. I believed in our chemistry.

296
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,698
The main group dance is Korean dance.

297
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,269
I wanted to get the group dance casting.

298
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:58,538
The Korean Group Dance Casting Audition...

299
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:01,139
will begin first.

300
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,009
We'll show them what we've got.

301
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:04,509
We'll prove that it's ours.

302
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:07,678
- Let's go! - Good luck, Korean dance!

303
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,408
Come on! Show them!

304
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:12,078
(Korean dance ensemble appears.)

305
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,548
Choi Jong In.

306
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:16,519
Were you once again the leader?

307
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:19,158
If that's the title to be called,

308
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,057
I did fulfill my duty.

309
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:22,729
(How did he lead the ensemble?)

310
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,859
(I did some deep thinking.)

311
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:26,869
(The leader proceeds with the formation discussion.)

312
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:29,328
(Like this.)

313
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:32,068
(Choi Jong In organizes the formation as he planned.)

314
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,568
(Thinking)

315
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,779
The lead dancer is left alone.

316
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,609
Is there a part where we embrace the lead dancer?

317
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,948
(A part we embrace him?)

318
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,177
("Comforting embrace")

319
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:44,678
(An important evaluation point)

320
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:48,118
I thought we shouldn't leave out the "comforting embrace" part.

321
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,389
It wasn't suited for the concept...

322
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:51,719
of "comforting embrace."

323
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,228
Jong In. We should encircle the lead dancer near the end.

324
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:57,827
- It was in the instructions. - The "comforting embrace."

325
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,099
A semi-circle isn't bad.

326
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:00,869
This isn't what I was thinking.

327
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:04,438
Salpuri's jungjoongdong. That was what I was after.

328
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,407
We can't ignore the embracing part.

329
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:10,739
The ensemble is dancing right in front of the judges.

330
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:13,379
Forming a circle didn't seem...

331
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:15,149
like a good idea.

332
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,318
I have the most experience in choreography, after all.

333
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:20,219
I sort of ruled with an iron hand.

334
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:23,318
So, I think...

335
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:26,558
we should form two lines after this.

336
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,029
I thought, "Is this okay?"

337
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:31,298
I was willing to listen to Jong In,

338
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:34,869
but I wished he would listen to other teammates at the same time.

339
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,868
When forming such formations,

340
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:39,098
it's important to create harmony...

341
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:41,469
by accepting everyone's ideas.

342
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:44,178
- Can I give an opinion too? - Sure.

343
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,478
- Min Suk. - I thought about it earlier,

344
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,278
and we could form a circle...

345
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,508
with 7 people inside and 7 people outside.

346
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,248
I think it can make it look...

347
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,989
like we're being embraced.

348
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,248
Let's stand at our spots first.

349
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:57,457
Then, we can connect the dots. They're different parts, so...

350
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,588
We need to lead and move at the same time.

351
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:01,658
Let's try yours first.

352
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,698
The inner circle and the outer circle.

353
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:04,898
This will be the front.

354
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,057
(Min Suk and Seong Hyun lead the team for the new directions.)

355
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,029
The inner circle looks inward.

356
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:10,667
But I want you to face different sides.

357
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:12,868
(Meanwhile, Jong In seems to be in thought.)

358
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,338
We have too many people voicing their opinions right now,

359
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,238
and it's going...

360
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,279
the opposite direction of my intention.

361
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,279
I thought, "I shouldn't let them think that I was weak."

362
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:23,878
"I need to lead this team."

363
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,417
- But... - It's going to be dynamic too.

364
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:27,587
I'm really sorry, but I don't think we can do it this way.

365
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:29,349
(That was so sudden.)

366
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:30,818
I thought hard about it.

367
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,518
But I can only see your butts.

368
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,488
Exactly. We're in the process of making it.

369
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,057
The ones who step back create the outer circle, right?

370
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:38,899
Then, we can turn around.

371
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,228
We need to try it out to move on to the next one,

372
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:43,268
but if you keep saying no to everything,

373
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:44,298
we don't make any progress.

374
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,407
Let's try mine just once.

375
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,068
(A deep sigh)

376
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,437
I think we all have different opinions.

377
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:53,749
- So, let's try things out, and... - You see,

378
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,508
what makes me mad is...

379
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,048
that we're changing it without even trying it.

380
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:59,478
I hate having to listen to only one person's idea.

381
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,119
A circle does seem better, though.

382
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:04,558
I was certain that it was wrong.

383
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:07,729
My anger was at its climax at that moment.

384
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:11,098
I would have looked past it if it helped the performance,

385
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,399
but it was lowering the quality.

386
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:14,499
They were all sensitive.

387
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:17,538
There was a strange air.

388
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:20,937
There were a lot of people with different tendencies,

389
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:23,739
so I thought that we might crumble.

390
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,577
Why don't we listen to the music and keep going?

391
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:27,878
I need the ones in the front to get lower.

392
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,879
We should gather to be seen better.

393
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:32,648
(The group dancers get tired in the subtly strange air.)

394
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,219
Doung Woo, did anything seem weird?

395
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:35,588
The whole thing is weird.

396
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,219
Do you have a lot on your mind?

397
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,889
In the end, he's making the decisions on his own.

398
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,928
This is going to blow up at one point.

399
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:42,688
So frustrating.

400
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,328
(He behaves oddly due to frustration.)

401
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,369
(Hitting his head)

402
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,229
(Will their audition go well?)

403
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:52,739
Have you ever wondered...

404
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:57,307
if the other group dancers would find your strong energy...

405
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:58,808
too burdensome?

406
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,879
Have you ever thought about that?

407
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,978
(Exchanging looks)

408
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,177
(An awkward smile)

409
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:06,078
(Thinking)

410
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,047
I'm doing my best to embrace them...

411
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,418
like a next-door neighbor or an uncle.

412
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:12,958
(Holding his laughter)

413
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,128
(Reading the room)

414
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:15,628
(What's going on?)

415
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,258
Their faces tell me that he's wrong.

416
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,327
(He just smiles.)

417
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:19,359
Is it?

418
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:21,927
(Raising his hand)

419
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:24,768
(What is it?)

420
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,067
While we were preparing for the group dance with Jong In,

421
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:30,207
everyone, including me,

422
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,779
relied on him a lot, but...

423
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,177
(But?)

424
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:35,307
But when it comes to creating the choreography,

425
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,978
I believe that we can yield a better outcome...

426
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,088
if we collect everyone's opinions.

427
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,019
I thought, "What? That wasn't our atmosphere."

428
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,488
I hope that we can accept various opinions...

429
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,128
from everyone.

430
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,759
All right.

431
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,128
I guess something happened.

432
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:51,659
They couldn't accept everyone's opinions.

433
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,728
But if things work out well and the performance looks good,

434
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:56,798
things will get better.

435
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,969
If this performance goes well, that is.

436
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,169
If not,

437
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,239
they'll be anxious.

438
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:04,409
First position.

439
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,749
It's looking mysterious.

440
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:08,449
Let's go!

441
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,779
(Admiring)

442
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:12,779
Music, start.

443
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:15,489
(Let's check out the performance by the Korean group dancers.)

444
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:19,459
Three, two, one. Go.

445
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:24,828
They're so in sync.

446
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:26,867
(Focused)

447
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:27,868
(Perfect angles)

448
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,098
(Neat movements)

449
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,409
(Let's switch formations.)

450
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,338
(Cheering)

451
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:39,878
(Drawn into it)

452
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:42,749
(The second formation change)

453
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,587
(Staying in sync until the last moment)

454
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:50,287
(The Korean Group Dance Casting Audition ends.)

455
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:51,888
(Praising them)

456
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:54,558
I believe...

457
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,628
that you managed to create neat formations...

458
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,228
with stability and nice lines.

459
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:03,798
That was the most impressive part.

460
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:05,499
However...

461
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,509
(Surprised)

462
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:09,008
The stability didn't...

463
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,378
really add any novelty.

464
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,148
It's a huge bummer.

465
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:15,779
His fear got in the way of trying new things.

466
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,249
Copying contemporary dance.

467
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:22,689
You were supposed to show us your distinct qualities,

468
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,689
but you must have failed to consider that.

469
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:29,659
I think we can add a Korean dance move.

470
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,858
Let's sit at first.

471
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:35,729
(Frustrated)

472
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,198
(The judges point out the parts that Jong In overlooked.)

473
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,608
Jong In.

474
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:47,278
Did you have to be at the center during the group dance?

475
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,708
I was wondering about that.

476
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,877
I ended up in the middle because I was trying...

477
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:55,249
to move as little as possible.

478
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:58,288
I believe that the dancer in the center...

479
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:02,087
must be someone who can perfectly execute the movements.

480
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:05,228
That way, the whole group is energized.

481
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,728
But it looked like you weren't...

482
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,699
able to execute the dance 100 percent.

483
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,409
I thought, "Was I that bad?"

484
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:15,837
Thank you.

485
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:16,909
(The Korean dance ensemble didn't get such a good review.)

486
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,078
We mostly followed Jong In's lead,

487
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,648
and it felt bad to get such an evaluation.

488
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,548
- Good work, Jong In. - No. I'm sorry.

489
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:27,148
(Sighing)

490
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:30,088
Leading the Korean dance ensemble,

491
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:32,588
I realized some parts that needed work.

492
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,588
It gave me an opportunity to grind harder.

493
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,298
Next,

494
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:40,568
we'll watch the ballet group dance.

495
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:43,397
- Good luck. - Ballet dancers, step forward.

496
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,537
Let's go!

497
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:45,938
You've got this!

498
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,709
(Let's go, ballet.)

499
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,238
Who do you think was the leader...

500
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:55,147
in the stage production?

501
00:19:55,148 --> 00:20:00,188
I did create the overall outline.

502
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:01,718
And the other dancers...

503
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,188
gave me ideas regarding the details,

504
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:06,189
which I collected and added to the performance.

505
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,797
That must mean that Min Chan is the ensemble leader.

506
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,028
Which dancer would you say...

507
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,769
you could rely on the most?

508
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:19,699
The ballet ensemble is one mind,

509
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:21,668
so I'm afraid I can't pick one.

510
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,138
Then, on the contrary,

511
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:25,508
which dancer gave you a hard time?

512
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:26,537
(Put on a spot)

513
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:28,148
(Like watching fire)

514
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:31,018
- It'd be cool if he said, "Me." - I...

515
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:32,547
wasn't good enough, so...

516
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:33,647
(Oh, he's cool.)

517
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:35,748
I'm the worst dancer here.

518
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:36,759
(That's a textbook answer.)

519
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,387
I can imagine that these transitions...

520
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:43,598
and this movement quality is new for ballerinas.

521
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:46,498
I just would like to understand how you navigated...

522
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:49,268
and how you worked on...

523
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:52,269
these new qualities in such a short amount of time.

524
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:56,208
Ballet is a genre that requires us...

525
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,637
to practice certain movements every day.

526
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:03,377
Forming the directions and formations by ourselves,

527
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:04,877
there were some hardships.

528
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:06,377
It was so hard.

529
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,648
I feel like we wasted too much time on the transitions.

530
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:12,019
(When they were preparing for Group Dance Casting Audition)

531
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,219
First off...

532
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,258
We're passive dancers...

533
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,529
who have never experienced the pain of creating.

534
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:23,198
Coming up with those transitions in such a short amount of time...

535
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,498
can be really challenging.

536
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,337
(His brain stops working.)

537
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:30,279
Would we be able to do it like contemporary and Korean dancers...

538
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:32,178
who constantly create dance moves?

539
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,878
I was so worried.

540
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:35,448
Who has any ideas?

541
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:36,678
- Me. - Yes.

542
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,948
The topic is "spirit," right?

543
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:42,188
Maybe we can express the embrace...

544
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:44,588
by starting in a circle.

545
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:46,689
- As a whole group? - Yes, in a circle.

546
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:48,787
I think we can portray the embrace.

547
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:51,898
Ha Nel was pretty good at this stuff.

548
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,999
- Can I say my idea too? - Yes.

549
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,769
To be honest, I have a desire to create.

550
00:21:57,898 --> 00:21:59,469
For instance, if there are three...

551
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:02,107
I want to try this and that.

552
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:03,239
I have a lot of ideas.

553
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,637
We could create some height differences...

554
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:07,578
because the lead roles must also have stories of their own.

555
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:09,807
You certainly have a lot of ideas.

556
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,279
What do you think?

557
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,678
I was thankful.

558
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,817
That's when I came to my senses...

559
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,518
and decided to give it a try.

560
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,758
Let's raise our arms.

561
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,988
One, two, three. We all raise are arms,

562
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,288
put them down on four, and go like this.

563
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:24,658
From the top, guys.

564
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,499
Kyu Tae did a good job of memorizing the choreography...

565
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:30,538
and taught us.

566
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:34,867
Min Woo did such a good job as the middleman.

567
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:37,708
He gave everyone tips individually.

568
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,739
We were all enthusiastic.

569
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:41,408
Watching that,

570
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:43,778
I thought that we might have a shot.

571
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,519
One, two, three, four.

572
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,118
We worked so hard.

573
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:49,519
We'll show you...

574
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:52,117
a group dance that's perfectly in sync.

575
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:53,857
(Everyone's effort and passion came together...)

576
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:56,229
(to complete the ballet ensemble's formation.)

577
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,728
All right, then. We will now begin...

578
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:01,897
the Casting Audition of the ten ballet group dancers.

579
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:03,797
- Okay. - Be confident, guys.

580
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:04,798
- Let's go. - All right.

581
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,968
- Lively facial expressions, guys. - Okay.

582
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,508
- In 1, 2, 3. - Let's go!

583
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:08,509
(Let's go, ballet.)

584
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:09,509
(They're cute.)

585
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,038
First position.

586
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:14,749
(Nervous)

587
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:15,909
Music,

588
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:17,949
start.

589
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:21,348
Five, four, three,

590
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,358
two, one. Go.

591
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:29,928
(The ballet ensemble starts off powerfully.)

592
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:31,229
(Nodding)

593
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,229
(Late)

594
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:34,999
Oh, no.

595
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:37,769
(Si On is slightly off-sync.)

596
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,038
(They switch formations and create a circle.)

597
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:49,948
(They portray the embrace...)

598
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:52,577
(by coming together from a circle.)

599
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,688
(The Ballet Group Dance Casting Audition ends.)

600
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:56,488
(Applauding)

601
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:57,857
(Reading the judges' faces)

602
00:23:57,858 --> 00:24:00,287
The mistake was critical.

603
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:02,229
- Too bad. - Right.

604
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:04,498
But it was quite powerful at the end there.

605
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:05,828
- They tried. - Yes.

606
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:08,169
It wasn't a neat finish.

607
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:10,439
I was relieved as ballet dancers performed.

608
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:13,439
Like, "Thanks for being worse than us."

609
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:17,137
In terms of transitions,

610
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,979
I'd like to compliment you for portraying...

611
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,618
the topic, "A comforting embrace."

612
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:25,519
However,

613
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,948
I think that the energy must create...

614
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:30,989
synergy in a group dance.

615
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:34,827
You must have executed the movements...

616
00:24:34,828 --> 00:24:37,397
with that purpose in mind.

617
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:40,769
I'd like to ask Si On.

618
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:44,337
Are you aware that you're one step slower?

619
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:45,338
(Flustered)

620
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:49,938
(His movements have been slower than others.)

621
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:51,607
From an intuitive perspective,

622
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:55,949
it needed more work in terms of synching up.

623
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:57,317
I felt bad.

624
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:00,888
I made the whole group look like they were off-sync.

625
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:02,949
I felt bad for the team.

626
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,387
It felt like it came to this...

627
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:08,058
because I wasn't a good leader.

628
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:11,029
I was ashamed, embarrassed, and apologetic.

629
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,328
It was a shame.

630
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:15,597
I also think there's a lot of different, varied levels...

631
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,469
in this group of dancers.

632
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:19,067
And I think it's important that,

633
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:21,668
if we continue to work with inner styles...

634
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:23,168
in ensemble settings,

635
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,078
we all match the same level and quality.

636
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,847
(Their performance ended with room for improvement.)

637
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:30,078
Thank you for your performance.

638
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,749
We did our best.

639
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,547
Though it's disappointing, but what can we do?

640
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:38,088
We'll have to improve.

641
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,587
The Casting Audition...

642
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:42,858
for the contemporary dance ensemble will begin now.

643
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,199
Good luck!

644
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:45,598
Let's go!

645
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,368
Who was the leader of the contemporary ensemble?

646
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:50,797
It was me, after all.

647
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:51,998
"After all."

648
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,468
I wonder if you had any difficulties...

649
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,808
while preparing for this group dance.

650
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:58,577
There were so many different dancers.

651
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:00,908
As the saying, "Too many cooks spoil the broth,"

652
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:04,018
we lost our way for some time, so that was tough.

653
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:05,877
(There was trouble in the contemporary ensemble too?)

654
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:07,918
(How did their practice go?)

655
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,948
Should we start our meeting?

656
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:09,949
- Let's have a meeting! - Good.

657
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,617
I'm pretty confident...

658
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:13,887
in creating choreographies and stage productions.

659
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,558
I had a feeling that we'd advance.

660
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:19,758
I can't come up with how to start.

661
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,769
- I actually have an idea. - Okay.

662
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:24,397
I was thinking of a duet.

663
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:25,637
- A duet? - How would you do that?

664
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:27,669
It said, "A comforting embrace."

665
00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:29,739
We can support each other like this.

666
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:32,239
I was thinking of doing that.

667
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,648
- Then, why don't we... - Let's start, then.

668
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:35,948
(Jin Ho thinks of the duet dance with Yo Han.)

669
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:36,949
And then...

670
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,618
- I'll hold the head from the right. - Okay.

671
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:39,978
- Then... - Swing it back.

672
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:41,387
And cover your eyes.

673
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:43,147
Then, I place my hand on your back...

674
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,259
- Here? - Then, we look at each other.

675
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:46,689
This is nice.

676
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:48,887
- Nice. - It's not bad.

677
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:52,499
Jin Ho came up with a brilliant idea,

678
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:55,529
so I accepted it and went with it.

679
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:57,097
Let's decide on the formations first.

680
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,367
We'll get to small details later.

681
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,909
We're supposed to spin, right? When we spin,

682
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:03,337
we can go like this and stop.

683
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,778
Then, we set a direction and go that way together.

684
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:08,178
And one, and transition.

685
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,847
(They swiftly move to the sides as Dong Hoon asks.)

686
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:11,278
Dong Hoon demonstrated and said,

687
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,647
"What do you think about this?"

688
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:15,489
We all said, "That's good," and the practice went on.

689
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:17,759
Can we try it out and scrap it if it's bad?

690
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:19,087
(What do you mean?)

691
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:21,188
After the spin, we can all walk...

692
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,128
like in a contemporary dance performance.

693
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:24,897
It was either moving to the sides...

694
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:28,268
all staying together as Do Hyun suggested.

695
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:30,198
One, two, three, four, five, six,

696
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,337
seven, eight, and we arrive.

697
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:32,398
Seven, eight.

698
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:35,469
- Oh, man. - Two, three, four,

699
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,509
five, six, seven, eight.

700
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:40,137
- This is a problem. - I thought, "What do we do?"

701
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,148
"We're going to miss the benefit at this rate."

702
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:43,209
(Making up his mind)

703
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:45,748
Do Hyun, I don't think this will work.

704
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,189
Can we move it to a closer spot?

705
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:50,489
What Do Hyun attempted was all nice,

706
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,688
but we were only given such a short time.

707
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,287
I didn't think it'd work.

708
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:56,459
Do Hyun, can we just move to the sides?

709
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:59,028
- Do you want that? - It takes too much time.

710
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:01,198
I knew that, but I got greedy.

711
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:03,127
We were going to be left with nothing at that rate.

712
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:05,337
I was hoping that there would be someone...

713
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,338
who would mediate the confusion.

714
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:10,478
That's why I had them move to the sides.

715
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,779
Now that we've practiced both, let's take a vote.

716
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:14,308
A vote?

717
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,048
Nice timing.

718
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,989
Who likes Do Hyun's?

719
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,719
One, two, three, four, five.

720
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,317
(Disappointed)

721
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:27,788
So, the rest of you want to go with mine?

722
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,189
- Let's continue, then. - Dong Hoon's transition.

723
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:31,558
Get into positions.

724
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,098
- Let's start practicing. - Okay.

725
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,868
Can we get back to this formation?

726
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,939
- What time is it now? - It's 4:20am.

727
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:40,199
We don't have much time.

728
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:43,037
One and two.

729
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:44,137
Find your spots.

730
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:45,138
And...

731
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:50,179
And down. And diagonal.

732
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:52,948
- In 1, 2, 3. - Go!

733
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:54,087
(Let's go, contemporary dance.)

734
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:55,088
First position.

735
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,358
Music, start.

736
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,218
(The contemporary ensemble gets into the duet formation...)

737
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,659
(according to the countdown.)

738
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:04,398
Three, two, one. Go.

739
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,498
(Perfect harmony)

740
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,638
(A duet performance made by Jin Ho)

741
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:14,269
Nice.

742
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,137
I didn't know you could perform a duet as a group.

743
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:18,279
That surprised me.

744
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:22,509
(Flawless angles)

745
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,847
(It's a neat transition just like Dong Hoon's idea.)

746
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:30,617
(That was fantastic.)

747
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:32,189
They're certainly different.

748
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,979
(Finishing with an ending that lingers in people's memories)

749
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:55,208
(The Contemporary Group Dance Casting Audition ends.)

750
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:56,209
Nice!

751
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:57,779
Even the ending!

752
00:29:58,148 --> 00:29:59,617
(Cheering)

753
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:02,388
One, two, three, four,

754
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:05,288
five, six, seven, eight.

755
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:08,729
- Bravo! - How would we beat that?

756
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:10,627
(That was fabulous.)

757
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:12,898
- I loved the ending. - Yes, the ending.

758
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:15,627
They did such a good job with the highlights.

759
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:18,868
I can tell that they have experience in this, indeed.

760
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:21,709
You genuinely surprised me.

761
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:23,978
I did not imagine...

762
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:27,038
that you would start it with a duet performance.

763
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:30,449
(Jin Ho added a duet dance in a group dance.)

764
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:33,949
You gave me a new inspiration.

765
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,348
But if I'm being honest,

766
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:38,358
you weren't exactly in sync.

767
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:39,489
(Feeling bad)

768
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,958
The biggest weakness of contemporary dance is...

769
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,499
group dance in my opinion.

770
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:48,067
But because of your ideas,

771
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:51,199
transitions, and stage production,

772
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:54,307
you pulled off the topic...

773
00:30:54,308 --> 00:30:57,478
of embracing and comforting someone.

774
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,878
The contrasting structure of up and down,

775
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:01,708
and the way you split to the sides...

776
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:04,317
and still managed to be seen with the lead role in the middle.

777
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:07,248
Then, the energy of the ensemble was condensed once again...

778
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:10,288
by coming together in the end. I loved the whole picture.

779
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:12,358
Thank you so much for the performance.

780
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,729
Who gave the most ideas?

781
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,127
Jin Ho, Dong Hoon,

782
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:21,429
and Do Hyun gave their ideas, and I only added the details.

783
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:25,368
Whose idea was disregarded, then?

784
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:27,067
(They all look at one person.)

785
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,108
"I..."

786
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:30,938
"I wanted to voice my opinion, but..."

787
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:34,378
My blood, sweat, and tears...

788
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:36,608
went to waste for a moment, but I believe...

789
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:38,478
they came through in the end...

790
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,689
and enabled me to give the best performance.

791
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:42,888
I believe it worked out for the better.

792
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:45,158
(That was a great ending.)

793
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,788
(You're my best bro.)

794
00:31:48,729 --> 00:31:51,058
It's lovely to see you admit to your fault.

795
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,658
(Upset)

796
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:56,127
We all worked hard. We did so well.

797
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:58,338
We were motivated even more.

798
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:01,509
(A short break before the result announcement)

799
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:05,479
We can use this chance...

800
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:06,978
to mentally arm ourselves.

801
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:09,478
We'll look at it in a positive light.

802
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:12,617
It feels like we're in denial to expect a good outcome now.

803
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:14,788
Let's just humbly accept the result.

804
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:16,518
Everyone but Si On did well.

805
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:19,057
(Hurt)

806
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:20,788
(The princes are harmonious, even in the time of ordeal.)

807
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:25,729
We will now announce the result of the Group Dance Casting Audition.

808
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:30,097
We believe that we gave everything we had to offer,

809
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:31,298
so I don't regret it.

810
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,439
I was slightly anxious...

811
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:35,239
but confident as well.

812
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,107
It's not over until it's over.

813
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:39,979
(Patting him)

814
00:32:40,378 --> 00:32:44,348
I will announce the ensemble...

815
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:47,848
to present its stage directions in the Mega Stage Mission.

816
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:50,347
(The ballet ensemble was slightly off-sync.)

817
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:51,358
(Oh, no.)

818
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:55,429
(And a critical mistake)

819
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:59,999
(The Korean ensemble had a conflict of opinions.)

820
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,298
(But they got a favorable comment for their neat transitions.)

821
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:05,968
(The contemporary ensemble gave a novel performance...)

822
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:07,938
(and fancy transitions.)

823
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:09,607
(They're certainly different.)

824
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:10,709
(Even the dancers of other genres had to acknowledge it.)

825
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:15,278
I will now announce...

826
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,878
the result of the Group Dance Casting Audition.

827
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,249
(Nervous)

828
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,348
Among ballet, contemporary dance,

829
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,219
and Korean dance,

830
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:26,588
(Which genre will get chosen in the Group Dance Casting Audition?)

831
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:29,658
we'll choose the contemporary group dance.

832
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:31,499
(The contemporary group dance got chosen.)

833
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,199
(Well done.)

834
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,628
We did it.

835
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,529
(Genuinely happy)

836
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:37,769
(Moved)

837
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:40,239
I can't believe I got the benefit.

838
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:43,239
Nervousness left my body. I thought, "I did it."

839
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:46,038
- Well done. - Yes.

840
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,079
There's a reason why we chose the contemporary group dance.

841
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,849
For the concept of comforting embrace,

842
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,989
they showed variations of diverse ideas.

843
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,588
The team did the best of expressing the concept.

844
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:03,628
All three genres were great.

845
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:07,699
But the contemporary dancers seemed to be the most aware...

846
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,869
of the center of the group dance,

847
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:13,199
when the group should stand out, and when the group should fade.

848
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:14,868
So I thought...

849
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:17,708
the contemporary group dance was the best.

850
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:21,247
Thank you so much for your effort. Well done.

851
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:23,849
(Well done.)

852
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:27,349
(Contemporary group dancers acquire the benefit.)

853
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:30,688
(Main Supporting Role Casting Audition begins.)

854
00:34:31,088 --> 00:34:33,588
(The dancers need to pull off techniques of other genres.)

855
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:35,088
(They're exchanging attacks.)

856
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,159
(It's Korean dance versus ballet.)

857
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,829
(He's waiting to shove a knife in someone's back.)

858
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,029
(And the long-waited Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

859
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,029
(Be careful not to get eaten up.)

860
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,139
(The dancers' pride is on the line, so the fight becomes fiercer.)

861
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,369
(What will be the result of the 64 dancers' Mega Stage?)

862
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,139
(The night of the Casting Audition deepens.)

863
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:52,079
(Main Supporting Role Casting Audition continues.)

864
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:56,309
(Second Class, let's go.)

865
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:58,478
For the Main Supporting Role Casting Audition,

866
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:01,818
everyone will be judged by the Technique Choreography.

867
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:03,849
Technique Choreography?

868
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,358
This audition will be intense.

869
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,358
For this audition, two dancers of different genres...

870
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:12,498
will make a team.

871
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,898
(The choreography is divided into Section A and Section B.)

872
00:35:15,728 --> 00:35:17,699
(A bit worried)

873
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,837
You'll take Section B, and I'll take Section A.

874
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:21,809
- A, B. - Yes.

875
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,308
You must copy...

876
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:26,338
each other's Technique Choreography.

877
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:30,079
The two dancers will be judged at once.

878
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:33,248
We're bound to get compared, so I need to do well.

879
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,817
How well you pull off...

880
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:37,818
the techniques of both genres...

881
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,929
will be the most important part of the judgment.

882
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:43,628
Judging by the mission, Second Class has it the hardest.

883
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,128
- I can't wait to see it. - It'll be fun.

884
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:50,029
- The main roles will be divided. - How many people?

885
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,767
(Mega Stage Casting Board, Supporting Roles)

886
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:52,838
Six.

887
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,108
Two from each genre?

888
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:57,338
One genre might dominate.

889
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,978
Will it be okay if we dominate?

890
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:00,707
Will you be able to do ballet?

891
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,248
The ballet techniques are impossible to copy.

892
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:05,678
Ballet isn't a genre you can copy in a day or two.

893
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,648
Many techniques involve jumping up in the air.

894
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:12,058
If I do ballet, I might make a fool out of myself.

895
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:14,458
It might be a public execution.

896
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:17,529
- Please don't let it be ballet. - Anything but ballet.

897
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:20,529
I don't think I can do apjipgi.

898
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:23,068
I want to avoid Korean dance...

899
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:26,298
because it'll be hard to copy the depth and movements.

900
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:29,568
I think I'll be able to copy the contemporary dance.

901
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:32,179
It'll be much easier than ballet.

902
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,679
Go ahead and try.

903
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:35,409
See if it's hard or easy.

904
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,079
Even within the Second Class,

905
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:41,219
there'll be a rivalry between the genres.

906
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,218
(Main Supporting Role Casting Audition, Group 1)

907
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:46,219
(Kim Tae Seok)

908
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,829
(It's ballet from the start!)

909
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:50,059
(It's me.)

910
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:51,898
How will I do ballet?

911
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:53,728
I really don't want to do ballet.

912
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:57,528
They know by looking at my past experience...

913
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:58,898
that I'm not an easy target.

914
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:00,969
I must be a scary dancer they're wary of.

915
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,639
(Yang Seong Yun)

916
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,978
(It's a match between Kim Tae Seok and Yang Seong Yun.)

917
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,207
(Will it be okay?)

918
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,748
- Gosh. - Will you be okay with ballet?

919
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:09,779
(Lifting)

920
00:37:10,048 --> 00:37:12,318
Your pointe is great. I'm in trouble.

921
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:15,348
To be honest, I was happy since I loved ballet.

922
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:16,349
(He thinks it's a good match.)

923
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,358
I'll add ten forward rolls.

924
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:20,017
I'll add all the techniques.

925
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:21,059
(I refuse to lose.)

926
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,188
(Kim Si Won)

927
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,699
My goodness.

928
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,998
- Hold on. - Cool Kim.

929
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:30,829
He's a talented dancer who is full of passion.

930
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:32,768
I think it'll be ballet.

931
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:35,469
I think it'll be Jang June Hyuk or Kim Young Woong.

932
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,509
(Jung Hye Seong)

933
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:40,478
(Totally startled)

934
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,849
- It was unexpected. - That's intense.

935
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,849
Si Won and Hye Seong...

936
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,748
always show a confident attitude.

937
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,989
Si Won is someone who competes with passion.

938
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:54,529
Don't you think their match will be cutthroat?

939
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:56,329
Do well.

940
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:59,298
(Ki Moo Gan)

941
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:00,728
(It's a big match.)

942
00:38:01,398 --> 00:38:02,429
Who will it be?

943
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,738
- The one who was the main lead? - That'll be interesting.

944
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:05,837
I have a hunch.

945
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:07,909
- If it's Gyeong Ho... - It'll be unsurprising.

946
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:11,208
(Will the main leads contend against each other?)

947
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:13,108
They wouldn't go with such an obvious choice.

948
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:14,779
(Kim Young Woong)

949
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:17,179
- What? - That's a strong one.

950
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,218
Young Woong and Moo Gan have a strong image.

951
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:22,418
They'll smell like strong men.

952
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,558
What kind of a dancer is he? I'm curious.

953
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,119
He was impactful.

954
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:28,458
He seemed like a strong dancer.

955
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:30,159
I wondered if I should be wary.

956
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,668
He seemed to be very charismatic and expressive.

957
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,398
I was both confident and nervous.

958
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:40,438
(The remaining dancers wait with bated breath.)

959
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,369
I think two teams remain.

960
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,768
Will it be Gyeong Ho or Hye Hyun?

961
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:46,708
A talented ballerino who was in the First Class.

962
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:49,108
My goodness. Did someone get 20 out of 20 points?

963
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:51,949
I didn't want to contend against a ballerino.

964
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,849
I'll add ciseaux and other techniques.

965
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,159
(Kang Gyeong Ho versus Kim Kyu Nyeon)

966
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,417
(One stays calm while the other becomes devastated.)

967
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:01,929
Come on. Let's show everyone.

968
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:04,188
He's a talented dancer.

969
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,498
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

970
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:09,528
The Korean dance techniques make my heart heavy.

971
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:11,938
I know that they'll be hard. I'll grit my teeth and do them.

972
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,369
(List of matches for the Main Supporting Role Casting Audition)

973
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:16,969
(The supporting dancers begin to choreograph.)

974
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:19,009
I thought, "Let's do my best."

975
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,449
I'll get a main supporting role no matter what.

976
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,079
(Staring)

977
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,948
It looked like Kyung Won would make...

978
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,088
a choreography that looks simple, but is actually impossible to copy.

979
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:32,488
I added the basic moves...

980
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:35,187
and the techniques dancers of other genres couldn't do.

981
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:36,858
- My goodness. - Gosh.

982
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:38,559
He's good.

983
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:40,958
That was my strategy for victory.

984
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:43,268
- Yours will be impossible to copy. - Seriously.

985
00:39:43,628 --> 00:39:45,239
It'll be impossible.

986
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:46,998
It was a competition, right?

987
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,608
Let's go down together.

988
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:52,208
He can do whatever he wants. I'll add all the techniques.

989
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,779
He's excited. Sang Gil is excited.

990
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:56,009
(The dancers are working hard in another practice room.)

991
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:58,949
Gyeong Ho's choreography won't be easy.

992
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:01,418
You should go easy on me.

993
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:03,789
I'm ruined.

994
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:07,317
- Gosh. - Gosh, I'm ruined.

995
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:09,059
Will I be able to do that?

996
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:11,259
How am I supposed to do that? I can't even do the pointe.

997
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:15,369
Ballet dancers might feel awkward on the floor,

998
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,068
so I focused...

999
00:40:18,438 --> 00:40:19,568
on the floor movements.

1000
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,167
Since ballet is a dance you do while standing up,

1001
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,509
ballet dancers are really bad at the floor movements.

1002
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,009
I was very worried.

1003
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,719
I thought about how to bring out the sense of rhythm.

1004
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:38,659
I thought, "Let's add one impactful technique."

1005
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,088
It'll be like a killer move.

1006
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,329
(Kim Young Woong is absorbed in the Technique Choreography.)

1007
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:46,298
My part is a continuation of three techniques.

1008
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,529
My goodness.

1009
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:48,898
Good luck.

1010
00:40:49,398 --> 00:40:51,997
I've practiced these techniques every day for six years.

1011
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:54,068
I have confidence when it comes to the quality.

1012
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:59,309
(Which dancers will take the main supporting roles?)

1013
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:04,248
Group One's Kim Si Won of Korean dance...

1014
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:07,218
and Jung Hye Seong of contemporary dance,

1015
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:08,648
please come on out.

1016
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:10,917
(Expectant)

1017
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,119
Let's go.

1018
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:14,958
This match will be fun since both of them are good.

1019
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:16,659
This match will be fierce.

1020
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:20,227
Please tell us which section you choreographed...

1021
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,227
for the other to copy.

1022
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:23,728
Which section do you want?

1023
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,538
I think Section A will be better.

1024
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:28,667
When I heard the music,

1025
00:41:28,668 --> 00:41:30,568
one movement came to my mind.

1026
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,478
So I decided to start off with that movement.

1027
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:35,079
(What's the starting movement Si Won thought of right away?)

1028
00:41:35,248 --> 00:41:36,809
(Whistling)

1029
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:40,619
(Is he whistling?)

1030
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,448
This is wihonmu.

1031
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:45,317
You need to call the spirit in order to console it.

1032
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:48,029
There was a lore about how whistling brings ghosts,

1033
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:51,298
so I decided to begin with a whistle sound.

1034
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,529
I became absorbed in the choreography,

1035
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,127
so I added the techniques...

1036
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:59,699
my rival could pull off.

1037
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:01,338
(Meanwhile, Jung Hye Seong)

1038
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:04,139
I added the techniques that required flexibility...

1039
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:05,579
in order to torment my rival.

1040
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,679
This is a survival show.

1041
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:10,107
(Dancing lightly)

1042
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:14,018
(Jung Hye Seong didn't show the techniques during practice.)

1043
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:17,248
Since we were practicing in the same room,

1044
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,989
I thought that he might see and copy my choreography.

1045
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,829
So I didn't show everything as a strategy.

1046
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:25,358
This is a survival show.

1047
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:28,297
(The main supporting candidates gather around...)

1048
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:29,898
(to reveal the Technique Choreography.)

1049
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:31,498
Let's begin with Section A.

1050
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:33,239
(Kim Si Won's Technique Choreography for Section A)

1051
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:34,469
(Whistling)

1052
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,039
(Turning)

1053
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,509
(Focused)

1054
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:45,449
(He wraps up with a technique.)

1055
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:47,079
(He did well.)

1056
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:51,619
It felt like he was being too considerate of me...

1057
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,889
because there wasn't much.

1058
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:55,628
He only added one technique toward the end.

1059
00:42:57,728 --> 00:42:59,228
(He copies it perfectly.)

1060
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:01,998
(Jung Hye Seong copies Kim Si Won's technique right away.)

1061
00:43:02,798 --> 00:43:03,869
(He's good.)

1062
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:05,239
He copied it right away.

1063
00:43:05,998 --> 00:43:06,998
Let's go.

1064
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:09,338
Should I have made it harder?

1065
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:12,608
(Jung Hye Seong's Technique Choreography for Section B)

1066
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,248
(Laser-focused)

1067
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:17,608
(Stretching)

1068
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:22,048
(Laughing)

1069
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:24,418
(Jung Hye Seong's choreography contains difficult techniques.)

1070
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:26,389
He made a choreography I couldn't copy.

1071
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,357
The first technique was gumbi.

1072
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,699
It's a technique only acrobats can pull off.

1073
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,328
And he wrapped up by twisting his back...

1074
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:35,898
and lifting a leg like a scorpion.

1075
00:43:36,228 --> 00:43:38,398
I wasn't sure if I could do that.

1076
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:41,038
Do I do it like this?

1077
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,408
- Yes. - Like this?

1078
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:44,877
- Yes. - Gosh, it hurts so much.

1079
00:43:44,878 --> 00:43:47,808
The muscles I use to lift the butt must be weak.

1080
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:50,349
The movement required a lot of flexibility,

1081
00:43:50,449 --> 00:43:52,147
so I got a muscle cramp.

1082
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:54,518
There was a dance move that looked like a scorpion.

1083
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:57,489
- Move it to the side. - Like this?

1084
00:43:57,548 --> 00:43:59,517
This foot needs to carry the weight.

1085
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:00,957
Open the pelvis.

1086
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,159
How? Like this?

1087
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:03,587
It wasn't easy.

1088
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:06,328
But I practiced diligently to better my chance of winning...

1089
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:08,168
by copying the choreography no matter what.

1090
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:13,038
We will now begin the Main Supporting Role Casting Audition...

1091
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,168
for Group One.

1092
00:44:15,668 --> 00:44:17,009
This match will be fierce.

1093
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:18,679
I think they'll do well.

1094
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:20,079
I can't wait.

1095
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,909
I'll get a main supporting role no matter what.

1096
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:24,449
I'll be a main supporting dancer no matter what.

1097
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,318
First position.

1098
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:28,248
Music, start.

1099
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:30,718
Three, two,

1100
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,687
- one. Go. - It's so cool.

1101
00:44:32,688 --> 00:44:36,558
(Technique Choreography Section A)

1102
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:37,929
They're good.

1103
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,529
(Watching carefully)

1104
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,798
He's copying it well.

1105
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,298
What's up with the rhythm?

1106
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:50,239
He's copying it so well.

1107
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:56,678
(Technique Choreography Section B)

1108
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:58,679
(This is interesting.)

1109
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:05,219
(The scorpion ending)

1110
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:08,488
(A round of applause)

1111
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:10,228
(Kim Si Won versus Jung Hye Seong, the Casting Audition ends.)

1112
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:11,727
- It's hard to predict the result. - It was insane.

1113
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:12,759
It was insane.

1114
00:45:13,398 --> 00:45:14,929
(His foot goes up in the air.)

1115
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:16,598
(Clapping)

1116
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,338
Hye Seong did infinitely better.

1117
00:45:18,568 --> 00:45:19,998
Si Won wasn't half bad.

1118
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:22,608
Both of them might get picked.

1119
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:25,938
We'll announce the casting result...

1120
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:28,779
for Kim Si Won and Jung Hye Seong.

1121
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:32,348
First, we'll announce the result...

1122
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:34,989
for Jung Hye Seong.

1123
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:36,818
Give me a main supporting role or death.

1124
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:39,818
Contemporary Dancer Jung Hye Seong...

1125
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:41,989
for a main supporting role.

1126
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:44,659
You've been cast.

1127
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:46,797
(Jung Hye Seong gets cast for a main supporting role.)

1128
00:45:46,798 --> 00:45:47,958
(Bowing)

1129
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:50,328
- Nice. - Nice.

1130
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,068
I did it. I was happy.

1131
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:54,968
So that I don't do the mission a disservice,

1132
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:57,139
I'll do my absolute best.

1133
00:45:57,568 --> 00:46:00,508
Now, we'll announce the result...

1134
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,648
for Kim Si Won.

1135
00:46:03,148 --> 00:46:04,248
Will both of them get cast?

1136
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,679
Si Won fully copied the choreography too.

1137
00:46:06,978 --> 00:46:10,188
Will both of us become a main supporting dancers?

1138
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:13,259
Dancer Kim Si Won...

1139
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,587
for a main supporting role.

1140
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:16,759
(What will be the result for Kim Si Won?)

1141
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,199
You haven't been cast.

1142
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:23,628
(Kim Si Won fails to become a main supporting dancer.)

1143
00:46:23,728 --> 00:46:28,238
I think Kim Si Won wasn't clever when he came up...

1144
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,079
with the choreography for Section A.

1145
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,248
In my opinion, Jung Hye Seong copied it nearly perfectly.

1146
00:46:37,179 --> 00:46:38,949
It wasn't difficult to copy.

1147
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:40,548
There weren't any hard techniques.

1148
00:46:40,918 --> 00:46:44,488
On the other hand, Jung Hye Seong added the moves...

1149
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:47,119
which required flexibility...

1150
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:50,059
and Kim Si Won couldn't execute them well.

1151
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:53,099
As for the very last pose in particular,

1152
00:46:53,398 --> 00:46:56,067
Jung Hye Seong lifted up his head completely...

1153
00:46:56,068 --> 00:46:59,469
and spread his arms when he put one leg up.

1154
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,368
But Kim Si Won...

1155
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:04,239
couldn't execute it well.

1156
00:47:04,608 --> 00:47:07,079
If you look closely, there is clear quality difference.

1157
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,009
Copying the choreography well is really important.

1158
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:12,349
Dancers, thank you for your hard work.

1159
00:47:12,648 --> 00:47:15,647
Had I added the Korean dance techniques,

1160
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:17,248
he wouldn't have been able to copy them.

1161
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:20,417
I had a strong realization that I didn't need to be...

1162
00:47:20,418 --> 00:47:21,759
too considerate.

1163
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:25,658
We'll proceed with the next Main Supporting Role Casting Audition.

1164
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:27,998
It's that group.

1165
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:29,497
(Here they come.)

1166
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:31,798
- Here come the big shots. - How scary.

1167
00:47:31,998 --> 00:47:33,498
It's a group from the netherworld.

1168
00:47:33,798 --> 00:47:36,738
Kim Young Woong of contemporary dance...

1169
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:39,539
versus Ki Moo Gan of Korean dance.

1170
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:41,207
Both of them have charismatic looks.

1171
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,279
They have an evil vibe.

1172
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:43,509
It became chilly in here.

1173
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,817
- I bet Young Woong will do well. - He's good.

1174
00:47:46,818 --> 00:47:48,719
I saw how he did at a competition. It was insane.

1175
00:47:48,818 --> 00:47:51,688
He keeps competing even after he wins gold.

1176
00:47:51,818 --> 00:47:53,358
It's hard to beat someone who won at a competition.

1177
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:56,088
Moo Gan doesn't use many techniques.

1178
00:47:56,188 --> 00:47:58,829
But he was born with insane talent.

1179
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:02,227
For the technique he was confident in,

1180
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:05,168
Ki Moo Gan wrote, "The fish."

1181
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:07,797
Kim Young Woong wrote...

1182
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:09,409
His technique is a bit stronger.

1183
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:12,477
"The modified fish with a jump."

1184
00:48:12,478 --> 00:48:13,607
(Embarrassed)

1185
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:15,378
It's the upgraded fish.

1186
00:48:15,409 --> 00:48:16,779
He'll dive.

1187
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:18,378
He'll dive into the water.

1188
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:20,978
It'll be regular fish versus live fish.

1189
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:24,688
Did both of you add the fish to the choreography?

1190
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:26,489
Yes.

1191
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:29,128
There's a jump Young Woong swears by.

1192
00:48:29,588 --> 00:48:32,028
He used the modified fish,

1193
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:34,458
but I'll show that it's just the fish.

1194
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,868
Moo Gan...

1195
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:37,969
will force a contemporary dancer to do the floor techniques.

1196
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:40,837
Between the two, who will become the king of fish...

1197
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,869
and earn the title of the carp king?

1198
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:45,378
It won't be easy.

1199
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:47,778
(He warms up in an unusual way.)

1200
00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:48,978
Young Woong's choreography is insane.

1201
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,748
It's very intense.

1202
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,619
His eyes tell us that it'll be the netherworld.

1203
00:48:53,648 --> 00:48:55,448
I combined the three techniques...

1204
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:57,518
I used the most at a competition.

1205
00:48:58,119 --> 00:48:59,318
It'll be scary.

1206
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:02,289
(Kim Young Woong's Technique Choreography for Section A)

1207
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:04,958
(Watching)

1208
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:07,059
I think he'll find it hard.

1209
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:08,498
My killer move is the fish.

1210
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:10,529
(This is how you do the fish.)

1211
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:14,398
I followed up with a back roll to handstand.

1212
00:49:15,338 --> 00:49:16,567
(That's insane.)

1213
00:49:16,568 --> 00:49:18,139
- Come on. - Let's go.

1214
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,039
- How will he copy that? - That was insane.

1215
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:22,608
I used all of my killer moves.

1216
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:24,748
He showed no mercy.

1217
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,349
I'm glad he isn't my rival.

1218
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:29,718
- He goes high up in the air. - I know.

1219
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:31,048
He almost levitates.

1220
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:32,687
(Chuckling)

1221
00:49:32,688 --> 00:49:33,989
What do you want me to do?

1222
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:35,858
(Good luck.)

1223
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:37,328
I'll give it a go.

1224
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:39,128
I was worried about his killer moves.

1225
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,297
But my movements require...

1226
00:49:41,298 --> 00:49:43,167
the right texture.

1227
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:46,369
It'll take time to pull them off.

1228
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:47,797
Moo Gan, let's go.

1229
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:48,909
King's techniques.

1230
00:49:49,768 --> 00:49:51,779
(Ki Moo Gan's Technique Choreography for Section B)

1231
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:53,207
(The charisma of the king)

1232
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,509
(Watching like a hawk)

1233
00:49:56,478 --> 00:49:57,949
- It's different. - It's charming, right?

1234
00:49:58,179 --> 00:49:59,418
(Impressed)

1235
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:02,688
What's up with the rhythm?

1236
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:06,088
I added an impactful technique, go down, at the end.

1237
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:08,187
- Bravo. - He's cool.

1238
00:50:08,188 --> 00:50:09,889
Moo Gan needs to do his thing.

1239
00:50:10,228 --> 00:50:11,489
I thought it was cool.

1240
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:13,099
I also thought that I could copy it well...

1241
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:14,498
with enough practice.

1242
00:50:14,998 --> 00:50:17,267
It'll be great to perform together.

1243
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:18,368
After that choreography?

1244
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:19,998
- You punk. - There was no consideration.

1245
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:22,868
(He attempts Kim Young Woong's fish.)

1246
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:23,909
(My goodness)

1247
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:25,738
The way he went up in the air told me...

1248
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,239
that he had years of experience.

1249
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:29,409
His pelvis was above the head.

1250
00:50:29,478 --> 00:50:30,608
It was like falling.

1251
00:50:31,048 --> 00:50:33,317
"Should I go with his vibe?"

1252
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:36,747
"I think it'll be better to do it in my own style."

1253
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:38,219
I thought about that a lot.

1254
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,759
Young Woong's choreography...

1255
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:42,328
I can't get the same height.

1256
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:44,128
I'm going to slip like this.

1257
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:45,627
(This is Moo Gan's fish.)

1258
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:46,898
It's neater.

1259
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,227
I jump high,

1260
00:50:50,228 --> 00:50:52,338
so I have confidence when it comes to quality.

1261
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:56,509
Now, the Casting Audition will begin.

1262
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:58,478
First position.

1263
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,739
Music, start.

1264
00:51:01,378 --> 00:51:02,408
Go.

1265
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:05,977
(Technique Choreography Section A)

1266
00:51:05,978 --> 00:51:06,978
Look at his facial expression.

1267
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:10,018
They have different vibes.

1268
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:14,658
I think my fish catches the eyes because of the height.

1269
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:15,789
(The height is insane.)

1270
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,458
Let's do it with confidence.

1271
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:20,357
(I can't choose one.)

1272
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:21,428
(Did you see that?)

1273
00:51:21,429 --> 00:51:24,998
(To be continued)

1274
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:29,039
Now, the Casting Audition will begin.

1275
00:51:29,938 --> 00:51:31,068
First position.

1276
00:51:31,469 --> 00:51:33,309
Music, start.

1277
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:34,908
Go.

1278
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:38,377
(Technique Choreography Section A)

1279
00:51:38,378 --> 00:51:39,518
Look at his facial expression.

1280
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,818
They have different vibes.

1281
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:48,929
(Young Woong, a live fish)

1282
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:50,289
(It was electrifying.)

1283
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:52,128
(Moo Gan showed a textbook example of the fish.)

1284
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:53,798
(Cheering)

1285
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:01,167
This is Moo Gan's choreography.

1286
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:03,167
(Technique Choreography Section B)

1287
00:52:03,168 --> 00:52:04,309
How is it so cool?

1288
00:52:05,938 --> 00:52:07,208
Young Woong looks angry.

1289
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:09,548
It's insane.

1290
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:12,278
(Their dopamine level is...)

1291
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:13,279
(at its max.)

1292
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,348
(100 percent focused)

1293
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:18,349
(Technique Choreography Section B)

1294
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:26,598
Both of them literally throw their bodies.

1295
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:27,928
(Kim Young Woong versus Ki Moo Gan Casting Audition ends.)

1296
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:28,998
It's very difficult.

1297
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:31,297
It's hard to tell. Both of them did well.

1298
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:32,438
They looked like live fish.

1299
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:35,199
I'd have been in trouble if I had joined Second Class.

1300
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:37,639
He was up incredibly high.

1301
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:39,509
He dropped from his chest.

1302
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:42,148
I can't believe that Moo Gan can do the fish.

1303
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:43,708
Ironically,

1304
00:52:43,978 --> 00:52:45,948
Ki Moo Gan danced Section A...

1305
00:52:45,949 --> 00:52:48,817
more charmingly than Kim Young Woong.

1306
00:52:48,818 --> 00:52:51,289
I felt that Kim Young Woong danced...

1307
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:54,259
Section B much better.

1308
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,228
They must be compatible.

1309
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:58,559
Young Woong is good at Korean dance.

1310
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:00,099
- I think... - What did you think?

1311
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:01,628
I'm sure of it.

1312
00:53:01,629 --> 00:53:03,067
(They cast the two dancers after some hard thinking.)

1313
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:04,598
I will announce...

1314
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,138
the casting result for Kim Young Woong and Ki Moo Gan.

1315
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:08,398
Will both of them make it?

1316
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:10,009
I think they'll both make it.

1317
00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:13,679
First, I'll announce the result for Kim Young Woong.

1318
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:17,548
Contemporary Dancer Kim Young Woong for the main supporting role.

1319
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:22,389
You've been cast.

1320
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:24,349
Thank you.

1321
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,658
Kim Young Woong did the particular hand movements...

1322
00:53:29,659 --> 00:53:31,289
in Korean dance very well.

1323
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:34,398
That's what caught my attention.

1324
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:36,528
You showed us good technique...

1325
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:40,668
as well as your powerful energy.

1326
00:53:40,938 --> 00:53:43,239
I was so happy. I felt proud of myself.

1327
00:53:43,909 --> 00:53:48,139
Next, I'll announce the result for Ki Moo Gan.

1328
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:52,718
Korean Dancer Ki Moo Gan for the main supporting role.

1329
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:54,118
(Jung Bo Kyung)

1330
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:56,119
- He's worth it. - "You've been cast?"

1331
00:53:56,748 --> 00:53:57,789
"You've been cast."

1332
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:00,018
You have not been cast.

1333
00:54:00,518 --> 00:54:01,889
What?

1334
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:04,329
- This is... - This is a lie.

1335
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:09,298
Moo Gan did the contemporary dance in his own style, but...

1336
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:10,668
It was lacking.

1337
00:54:11,768 --> 00:54:13,067
It's a right of technique.

1338
00:54:13,068 --> 00:54:15,337
Technique seems more important than the quality of dance.

1339
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:17,009
It seems more important.

1340
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:20,178
I felt that I didn't show as much as I prepared,

1341
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:21,308
so it was disappointing.

1342
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:25,449
(It was disappointing.)

1343
00:54:26,418 --> 00:54:29,489
Next is Main Supporting Role Casting Audition for Group Three.

1344
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:32,358
Ballerino Kim Kyung Won.

1345
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:36,288
Korean Dancer Kim Sang Gil, please come out.

1346
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:37,688
- All right. - Yes!

1347
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:39,997
Let's go.

1348
00:54:39,998 --> 00:54:41,098
It's Korean Dancer versus ballet.

1349
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,628
What will it be like? This is fascinating.

1350
00:54:42,768 --> 00:54:44,869
I feel intense competition between them.

1351
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:46,869
They have a different vibe from others.

1352
00:54:47,298 --> 00:54:49,909
I heard that there was a war between them.

1353
00:54:50,068 --> 00:54:51,567
- Wasn't it a war? - Yes.

1354
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:52,708
Everyone knows about it.

1355
00:54:53,478 --> 00:54:55,508
(While creating Technique Choreography)

1356
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:59,719
At first, I wasn't thinking about adding difficult technique.

1357
00:54:59,918 --> 00:55:02,747
I tried my best to include movements...

1358
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:04,719
that he could fake.

1359
00:55:05,048 --> 00:55:06,088
However...

1360
00:55:06,688 --> 00:55:08,728
(Kim Sang Gil who's busy choreographing)

1361
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:10,159
(Flipping)

1362
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:13,358
(Kim Sang Gil adds a back handspring in his choreography.)

1363
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:15,298
(Forcing a laugh)

1364
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:18,498
He did a back handspring.

1365
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,938
You have to make it so that the other can't do it.

1366
00:55:21,168 --> 00:55:22,309
I should make it difficult.

1367
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:24,768
Really? Then bring it on.

1368
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:26,608
(Demonstrating tour en l'air)

1369
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:28,978
(Kim Kyung Won takes on with ballet jump technique.)

1370
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:33,679
That's crazy. I'm in trouble.

1371
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:36,188
Then let's die together.

1372
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:38,588
(1 back handspring)

1373
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:39,758
(2 back handsprings)

1374
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:42,389
(He does back handsprings in a row.)

1375
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:46,397
Sang Gil, let's take it as far as we can.

1376
00:55:46,398 --> 00:55:47,398
(Raging)

1377
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:49,898
(I'll also add ciseaux.)

1378
00:55:50,068 --> 00:55:51,167
(Kim Kyung Won adds his secret weapon technique...)

1379
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:52,838
(that he's confident about.)

1380
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:54,699
(Forcing a laugh)

1381
00:55:55,338 --> 00:55:57,337
(Dropping to the floor)

1382
00:55:57,338 --> 00:55:58,707
What? He's in the air.

1383
00:55:58,708 --> 00:55:59,978
(Adding tour en l'air)

1384
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:01,608
Do whatever you want.

1385
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:04,708
I'll add all my possible technique moves.

1386
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:07,547
(Their Technique Choreography is revealed.)

1387
00:56:07,548 --> 00:56:09,289
(Kim Kyung Won shows his Section A Technique Choreography.)

1388
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,389
That's so harsh.

1389
00:56:16,188 --> 00:56:17,188
(Light)

1390
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:18,728
(Shock and fear)

1391
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:21,498
(Kim Kyung Won finishes showing his Technique Choreography.)

1392
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,469
(Unbelievable, clapping)

1393
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:25,698
He was flying. He was staying in the air,

1394
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:26,869
and I couldn't copy that.

1395
00:56:26,998 --> 00:56:28,699
I was quite worried.

1396
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:30,707
(Kim Sang Gil's Section B Technique Choreography is revealed.)

1397
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:33,978
(I won't be defeated.)

1398
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:35,338
It won't be easy.

1399
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:40,248
(Ending with a back flip)

1400
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:42,618
(Laughing)

1401
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:47,417
That movement seemed to require a very advanced technique.

1402
00:56:47,418 --> 00:56:49,789
I thought that it will be very difficult.

1403
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:51,889
I know what I did, but yours isn't any better.

1404
00:56:52,398 --> 00:56:53,559
You're so harsh.

1405
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,329
Neither of them will be able to handle it.

1406
00:56:56,128 --> 00:56:58,997
(The two dancers start to practice.)

1407
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,039
After this, the leg comes this way.

1408
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:05,338
The leg comes in, and then...

1409
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:06,638
Okay.

1410
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:07,937
I got the gist of it.

1411
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:09,578
Sang Gil, watch me do it.

1412
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:10,579
Okay.

1413
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:12,248
(Swinging)

1414
00:57:13,219 --> 00:57:14,219
(Swinging)

1415
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:15,849
(Sliding)

1416
00:57:17,289 --> 00:57:19,658
(Watch me slip.)

1417
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:21,658
(Okay, I saw it.)

1418
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:25,028
(A huge failure)

1419
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:27,528
(Gosh, I can't do it.)

1420
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:30,298
I thought that it won't be easy.

1421
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:31,928
There is no compromise.

1422
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:33,568
I really can't wait to see this.

1423
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:34,898
It will be so much fun.

1424
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:36,768
First position.

1425
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,009
Music, start.

1426
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:43,448
(Everyone is looking forward to it. Who will be the winner?)

1427
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:48,148
(Ballerino Kim Kyung Won, Technique Choreography Section A)

1428
00:57:49,389 --> 00:57:52,788
(From the start, Sang Gil missed the beat and the movement.)

1429
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:53,789
Goodness.

1430
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:55,318
(Feeling sorry)

1431
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,627
(Soon, ciseaux, an advanced ballet move is coming up.)

1433
00:58:01,498 --> 00:58:02,869
He did a knee kick instead.

(Korean Dancer Kim Sang Gil, Technique Choreography Section B)

1437
00:58:10,108 --> 00:58:11,268
This is impossible.

(Korean Dancer Kim Sang Gil, Technique Choreography Section B)

1439
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:16,647
(Their movements are starting to differ.)

1440
00:58:16,648 --> 00:58:18,508
(Kim Kyung Won versus Kim Sang Gil Casting Audition ends.)

1441
00:58:18,509 --> 00:58:21,948
(Both of them worked hard.)

1442
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:24,288
(Clapping of encouragement)

1443
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:26,789
(Exclaiming)

1444
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,127

1445
00:58:29,128 --> 00:58:30,128
(It's a bummer.)

1446
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:31,358
(The looks on the coaches' faces are hard to tell.)

1447
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:32,829
They tried to make it.

1448
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:34,298
They did their best.

1449
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:37,029
The techniques you used to destroy...

1450
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:39,699
yourself and the other paid off.

1451
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:42,509
Kim Sang Gil couldn't do the ciseaux at all.

1452
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:46,608
Kim Kyung Won couldn't do the back handspring at all either.

1453
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:51,449
Both of you included techniques that are so difficult...

1454
00:58:51,648 --> 00:58:54,817
that I felt bad for you. It was disappointing.

1455
00:58:54,818 --> 00:58:56,218
(Kyung Won and Sang Gil received disappointed feedback.)

1456
00:58:56,219 --> 00:58:57,849
I will announce it right away.

1457
00:58:58,088 --> 00:59:01,358
None of you have been cast.

1458
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:02,857
Good work.

1459
00:59:02,858 --> 00:59:03,957
(Kim Kyung Won and Kim Sang Gil failed to be cast.)

1460
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,958
I couldn't do the choreography,

1461
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:09,628
so I expected such a result.

1462
00:59:09,998 --> 00:59:12,268
I'm sorry, Kyung Won. I really am.

1463
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:16,908
Next is Group Five, Ballerino Kang Yun Gu...

1464
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:19,708
and Contemporary Dancer Jang June Hyuk.

1465
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:22,039
He's wearing ballet shoes.

1466
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:23,648
He's wearing ballet shoes.

1467
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:26,179
Did he bring ballet shoes with him?

1468
00:59:26,378 --> 00:59:28,147
Is June Hyuk also wearing a dance belt?

1469
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,488
(Getting a head start)

1470
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:30,489
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1471
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:32,588
He might walk on top of his feet.

1472
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:34,889
Why does he look ill?

1473
00:59:35,688 --> 00:59:37,128
Doesn't Yun Gu seem sick?

1474
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:39,599
He doesn't seem to have energy.

1475
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:43,268
Dancer Kang Yun Gu.

1476
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:44,869
Yes.

1477
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:46,298
How are you feeling?

1478
00:59:46,898 --> 00:59:49,238
This morning,

1479
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:53,038
while coming up with the choreography,

1480
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,679
I injured myself.

1481
00:59:56,748 --> 00:59:57,748
(Worried)

1482
00:59:57,749 --> 00:59:59,548
Oh, no.

1483
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:04,388
I won't be able to dance for this mission today,

1484
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:06,358
so I'd like to apologize.

1485
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:07,988
- Goodness. - It's okay.

1486
01:00:07,989 --> 01:00:09,028
(It's okay.)

1487
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:10,659
He should take care of himself.

1488
01:00:11,128 --> 01:00:12,458
Yun Gu must be bummed out.

1489
01:00:13,858 --> 01:00:15,029
This part is reckless.

1490
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:17,628
- I can't wait to see June Hyuk. - I'm curious.

1491
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:19,567
His shoulders look incredible.

1492
01:00:19,568 --> 01:00:20,798
That's his technique.

1493
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,809
Deltoids technique.

1494
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:25,567
I thought that...

1495
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:28,009
the floor technique would be unfamiliar to ballet dancers.

1496
01:00:28,978 --> 01:00:31,679
(Jang June Hyuk demonstrates his Section B Technique Choreography.)

1497
01:00:31,949 --> 01:00:32,978
(Watching carefully and focused)

1498
01:00:33,418 --> 01:00:35,047
He won't be able to do the rainbow...

1499
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,849
from the floor perfectly.

1500
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:40,417
(From the start to finish, Jang June Hyuk mostly included...)

1501
01:00:40,418 --> 01:00:41,889
(the floor technique in his choreography.)

1502
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:43,958
He even added a lingering movement.

1503
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:45,259
Bravo.

1504
01:00:46,529 --> 01:00:47,828
He used the music until the end.

1505
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:49,869
He divided into the smallest units.

1506
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:52,868
(Kang Yun Gu reveals his Technique Choreography.)

1507
01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:54,398
It's a fight between the sky and the ground.

1508
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:56,369
I'm so glad that my opponent isn't a ballerino.

1509
01:00:58,068 --> 01:01:00,279
Ballet dancers look amazing when they're standing.

1510
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:02,139
(Observing him closely)

01:01:02,748 --> 01:01:04,808
(Kang Yun Gu shows Section A Technique Choreography.)

1512
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:06,678
(Turning in the air with one foot on the knee)

1513
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:08,579
- As expected, ballet is... - It looks amazing.

1514
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:09,789
(Nervous)

1515
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:11,587
(It's followed by pirouettes.)

1516
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:12,588
(Losing his balance)

1517
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:16,159
(Kang Yun Gu keeps making mistakes during his demonstration.)

1518
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:19,559
- He's late on the music. - That's a bummer.

1519
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:22,099
(That's odd.)

1520

(Kang Yun Gu and Jang June Hyuk)

1521
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:24,868
(They finish showing their Technique Choreography.)

1522
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:27,898
The pain got so severe that my mind went blank.

1523
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:30,937
While coming up with the choreography,

1524
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,638
I must have done something wrong with my body.

1525
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,909
There was a severe pain from the back to the ribs.

1526
01:01:37,048 --> 01:01:38,848
I said that I'll just do it,

1527
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:40,179
but they told me to go to the hospital.

1528
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:41,848
You should go, but...

1529
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:43,489
(Yun Gu stopped practicing and went to the hospital.)

1530
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,158
(Jang June Hyuk had to practice the ballet technique alone.)

1531
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,857
I wasn't confident about ballet, and I had to practice it alone.

1532
01:01:48,858 --> 01:01:50,058
Will I be able to do it?

1533
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:51,628
I thought that I was in trouble.

1534
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:55,558
I got the flow,

1535
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:57,429
but it's hard to make it look clean.

1536
01:01:57,699 --> 01:01:58,928
I was worried about everything.

1537
01:01:58,929 --> 01:02:01,397
My fingers and toes. Even the arms...

1538
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:02,969
looked awkward.

1539
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:07,139
Whenever the arms are straight, make them look long.

1540
01:02:07,378 --> 01:02:09,448
- It shouldn't twist like this. - I see.

1541
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:11,207
Imagine your shoulders are part of your arms.

1542
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,349
- The shoulders? - Yes.

1543
01:02:12,849 --> 01:02:14,678
I analyzed it a lot...

1544
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:15,949
to find out how to make it better.

1545
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:18,548
I wanted to perform it well.

1546
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:21,418
June Hyuk has his ballet shoes on.

1547
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:24,529
- He's trying. - Yes. It's the pirouette, maybe.

1548
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:26,998
His opponent, Jang June Hyuk,

1549
01:02:27,298 --> 01:02:30,798
you have to dance both Section A and B alone.

1550
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:32,968
I'll do it with force and confidence.

1551
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:34,239
- Gosh. - That's amazing.

1552
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:36,539
This is contemporary. Yes.

1553
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,838
Shoe June Hyuk, you're beautiful.

1554

(He notices something.)

1555
01:02:40,478 --> 01:02:42,579
- He's posing for ballet. - It looks like ballet.

1556
01:02:42,978 --> 01:02:46,048
- Section A must be ballet. - He should do it with force.

1557

(How will Jang June Hyuk's Casting Audition turn out?)

1558
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:51,719

Good work.

Thank you.

1596
01:04:12,898 --> 01:04:15,038
His ballet technique was weak, wasn't it?

1597
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,438
His ballet technique wasn't precise at all.

1598

01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:42,969
When you were dancing Section B,

1609
01:04:43,068 --> 01:04:46,068
you seemed determined to make it.

1610
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:49,568
It's probably because there was no opponent.

1611
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:52,509
Yes.

1612
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:55,337
Yun Gu encouraged me a lot,

1613
01:04:55,338 --> 01:04:57,648
and he coached me too. I'm grateful to him.

1614
01:04:58,009 --> 01:05:00,548
- Can I dance with confidence? - Of course.

1615
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:05,048
Without adding unnecessary moves, try to lose tension.

1616
01:05:05,389 --> 01:05:08,489
You should do it with confidence.

1617
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,358
I'm not just saying this.

1618
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:13,128
(Kang Yun Gu encouraged June Hyuk endlessly.)

1619
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:15,728
You must feel uncomfortable.

1620
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,128
I feel really sorry.

1621
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:23,539
I'll announce the result for Jang June Hyuk.

1622
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:27,279
Contemporary Dancer Jang June Hyuk as the main supporting role.

1623
01:05:28,009 --> 01:05:30,108
(He danced without his opponent. What will be the result?)

1624
01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:32,208
You have not been cast.

1625
01:05:33,148 --> 01:05:35,349
(Jang June Hyuk fails to be cast.)

1626
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:36,619
Good job.

1627
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:39,219
- You did well. - That's a bummer.

1628
01:05:39,818 --> 01:05:42,219
Getting the main supporting role seems harder.

1629
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:44,389
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1630
01:05:47,298 --> 01:05:48,598
Next is Group Eight,

1631
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:51,468
Korean Dancer Park Jun Woo...

1632
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:54,798
and Contemporary Dancer Kim Hye Hyun, please come out.

1633
01:05:55,068 --> 01:05:56,838
Jun Woo, smash it.

1634
01:05:57,309 --> 01:06:00,179
- Smash it. - The African prince is here.

1635
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:02,679
Isn't his technique amazing too?

1636
01:06:02,779 --> 01:06:05,949
As a contemporary dancer with that body, he can do any technique.

1637
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:08,718
Dancers, could you tell us...

1638
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,789
what kind of technique you included?

1639
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:13,418
In order to defeat an all-round...

1640
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:17,059
contemporary dancer with a perfect physical score,

1641
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,288
I thought that I needed hand and feet movement...

1642
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:22,829
that are particular to Korean dance.

1643
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:25,228
- That's what I included. - Good job.

1644
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:29,369
- He's such a bully. - Do you mean Jun Woo?

1645
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:31,068
How will he pull this off?

1646
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:33,679
(What kind of Technique Choreography did they create?)

1647
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:37,309
You'll be able to do this. You have to spin fast.

1648
01:06:37,509 --> 01:06:39,008
(Spinning attack)

1649
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:40,048
Okay.

1650
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:42,279
(Kim Hye Hyun copies his technique as soon as he sees it.)

1651
01:06:42,818 --> 01:06:43,889
I think I can do it.

1652
01:06:44,148 --> 01:06:45,587
(Kim Hye Hyun continues to show exceptional technique skills.)

1653
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:48,389
Hye Hyun is a great dancer.

1654
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:49,558
I was scared.

1655
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:53,159
I don't think that I had to be considerate.

1656
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:55,758
(Park Jun Woo choreographs with Korean movements.)

1657
01:06:55,759 --> 01:06:58,498
Gosh, Hye Hyun is in trouble.

1658
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:01,168
You're determined to make Hye Hyun a Korean dancer.

1659
01:07:01,398 --> 01:07:03,668
You're determined to make Hye Hyun a Korean dancer.

1660
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:06,908
Right.

1661
01:07:06,909 --> 01:07:08,409
(Inhaling)

1662
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:10,548
In order to win,

1663
01:07:10,648 --> 01:07:13,418
I had to include the style particular to Korean dance.

1664
01:07:13,548 --> 01:07:14,949
That's how I will win.

1665
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:16,648
Standby.

1666
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:21,458
(Focused)

1667
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:23,227
(Stepping lightly)

1668
01:07:23,228 --> 01:07:24,259
Let's go.

1669
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:26,428
(Making a face)

1670
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:28,457
(Ending with jaban that they agreed on)

1671
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:29,969
He made a traditional Korean dance.

1672
01:07:30,398 --> 01:07:32,227
Will I be able to do...

1673
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:34,397
Korean dance arm movements and steps?

1674
01:07:34,398 --> 01:07:35,699
I was a little worried.

1675
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:38,337
- This will be hard. - This is difficult.

1676
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:40,279
- Having that rhythm is difficult. - It's really hard.

1677
01:07:40,378 --> 01:07:42,378
- You can't do it so quickly. - Right.

1678
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,679
(Kim Hye Hyun's choreography starts with jaban.)

1679
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:48,219
(Surprised)

1680
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:49,489
(Nervous)

1681
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:52,789
(Ending with technique)

1682
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:54,259
(Hye Hyun's choreography is made with personality and technique.)

1683
01:07:54,588 --> 01:07:57,159
In my opinion, Hye Hyun was being considerate of him.

1684
01:07:57,789 --> 01:07:58,828
It's easy.

1685
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:00,699
(Flustered)

1686
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:04,068
I didn't think that it was particularly difficult.

1687
01:08:04,299 --> 01:08:06,467
He added a back handspring,

1688
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:07,999
and I thought that it was doable.

1689
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:10,708
(After revealing their choreography)

1690
01:08:10,709 --> 01:08:12,539
I should ask people to teach me Korean dance.

1691
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:15,178
In Korean dance, you have to use your wrists well.

1692
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:17,978
Half of Korean dance is arm sawi.

1693
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:20,879
(Kim Hye Hyun returns to the practice room.)

1694
01:08:21,678 --> 01:08:22,989
(He starts practicing the arm sawi.)

1695
01:08:23,218 --> 01:08:25,049
(Korean dance is about arm sawi.)

1696
01:08:25,388 --> 01:08:27,518
(Training himself seriously)

1697
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:30,228
- What are you doing? - I'll keeping practicing this.

1698
01:08:31,928 --> 01:08:32,959
Intense practicing.

1699
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:35,058
Is this right?

1700
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:37,227
Relax this part.

1701
01:08:37,228 --> 01:08:40,038
Instead of using the entire arm, use the wrist.

1702
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:41,298
Think of rolling the wrist.

1703
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:42,369
(He feels his wrist with his eyes closed.)

1704
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:43,669
It's so difficult.

1705
01:08:44,669 --> 01:08:47,409
You must go down at this beat. Deo dung.

1706
01:08:47,879 --> 01:08:50,177
- It's so hard. - Twist with the head straight.

1707
01:08:50,178 --> 01:08:51,248
This is it.

1708
01:08:51,249 --> 01:08:54,347
I practiced the Korean dance arm movements a lot.

1709
01:08:54,348 --> 01:08:56,918
I tried hard to move...

1710
01:08:56,919 --> 01:08:59,148
like a Korean dancer.

1711
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:01,688
(After some intense training, he takes a break.)

1712
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,228
(Automatic reflex at the sound of music)

1713
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:06,829
(What will be the result for Kim Hye Hyun's Casting Audition?)

1714
01:09:07,558 --> 01:09:08,928
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun.

1715
01:09:09,129 --> 01:09:11,029
Have you done Korean dance before?

1716
01:09:11,598 --> 01:09:13,369
Once a week during high school...

1717
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:15,239
for an hour and a half.

1718
01:09:15,339 --> 01:09:16,539
(He's so funny.)

1719
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,768
A minor at the arts high school.

1720
01:09:18,138 --> 01:09:19,977
- An hour and a half is a must. - He's so cute.

1721
01:09:19,978 --> 01:09:21,409
(The contemporary dancers find him adorable.)

1722
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:24,378
Group Eight's Main Supporting Role...

1723
01:09:24,379 --> 01:09:26,579
Casting Audition will start.

1724
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:28,119
First position.

1725
01:09:28,318 --> 01:09:30,789
I will get the main role no matter what.

1726
01:09:31,648 --> 01:09:33,458
If I do a good job on Section A,

1727
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:35,659
I'll definitely get the main supporting role.

1728
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:38,358
- Music, start. - Go.

1729
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,727
(Korean Dancer Park Jun Woo Technique Choreography Section A)

1730
01:09:41,728 --> 01:09:43,528
- He's good. - That looks good.

1731

(Korean Dancer Park Jun Woo Technique Choreography Section A)

1732
01:09:47,968 --> 01:09:50,007

(Korean Dancer Park Jun Woo Technique Choreography Section A)

1734
01:09:51,468 --> 01:09:52,468
He's good.

(Korean Dancer Park Jun Woo Technique Choreography Section A)

1736
01:09:54,339 --> 01:09:56,177
- Gosh. - All right!

1737
01:09:56,178 --> 01:09:57,347
He did it.

1738
01:09:57,348 --> 01:09:58,878
(Korean Dancer Park Jun Woo Technique Choreography Section A)

1739
01:09:58,879 --> 01:09:59,879
He's following him well.

1740
01:10:00,348 --> 01:10:01,348
Jun Woo's lethal move.

1741
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:03,388
(Jun Woo loses his balance and doesn't get up in time.)

1742
01:10:03,518 --> 01:10:05,847
- What? - Hye Hyun waited for him.

(Shocked)

1749
01:10:15,228 --> 01:10:16,699
His jaban is perfect.

1750

(Kim Hye Hyun's Section B starts right after jaban.)

1751

(Contemporary Dancer Kim Hye Hyun Technique Choreography Section B)

1754
01:10:38,718 --> 01:10:40,089
Nice.

1755
01:10:40,188 --> 01:10:42,858
Hye Hyun is good.

1756
01:10:43,058 --> 01:10:44,887
Why is he also good at Korean dance?

1757
01:10:44,888 --> 01:10:46,258
He jumps really high.

1758
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:47,397
(Squeaking)

1759
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:48,558
How do they do that?

1760
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,598
- You do this. - And push.

1761
01:10:51,129 --> 01:10:52,129
Goodness.

1762
01:10:52,428 --> 01:10:53,699
I can't do it.

1763
01:10:54,068 --> 01:10:55,869
Hye Hyun didn't add anything really difficult.

1764
01:10:56,369 --> 01:10:58,608
He didn't include the Aoya. He always does that.

1765
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:02,477
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun, you must have practiced Korean dance...

1766
01:11:02,478 --> 01:11:05,178
very hard once a week in high school.

1767
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:06,518
Yes, I worked hard.

1768
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:09,848
The turning of your hand was beautiful.

1769
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:11,119
(Embarrassed)

1770
01:11:11,648 --> 01:11:14,318
(Kim Hye Hyun's turning of the hand was as good as a Korean dancer.)

1771
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:15,688
Turning.

1772
01:11:16,529 --> 01:11:17,529
He's better than me.

1773
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:20,128
During Section A, I noticed...

1774
01:11:20,129 --> 01:11:23,129
Kim Hye Hyun much more than Park Jun Woo.

1775
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:26,098
I think that your tactics failed.

1776
01:11:26,468 --> 01:11:30,039
I failed to differentiate myself with my own weapons.

1777
01:11:30,308 --> 01:11:32,808
It was very damaging.

1778
01:11:33,138 --> 01:11:35,779
In my opinion,

1779
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:38,147
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun danced the choreography...

1780
01:11:38,148 --> 01:11:40,749
like it was his own from Section A to B.

1781
01:11:40,848 --> 01:11:43,448
While dancing his opponent's section,

1782
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:45,448
he waited for Park Jun Woo...

1783
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:47,057
before moving onto the next move.

1784
01:11:47,058 --> 01:11:50,829
I felt that Hye Hyun was more comfortable with the choreography.

1785
01:11:51,758 --> 01:11:53,898
I will announce the result.

1786
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:56,727
Contemporary Dancer Kim Hye Hyun...

1787
01:11:56,728 --> 01:11:58,829
for the main supporting role.

1788
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:02,039
"You've been cast."

1789
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,468
You've been cast.

1790
01:12:04,568 --> 01:12:06,909
(Dancer Kim Hye Hyun is cast for the main supporting role.)

1791
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:08,738
It was very worthwhile.

1792
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:09,749
(Laughing)

1793
01:12:10,249 --> 01:12:12,279
Next, Korean Dancer...

1794
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:14,779
Park Jun Woo...

1795
01:12:15,148 --> 01:12:16,489
I hope that he'll get it.

1796
01:12:16,549 --> 01:12:18,419
The ball was in his court in the beginning.

1797
01:12:18,718 --> 01:12:20,258
For the main supporting role.

1798
01:12:22,188 --> 01:12:24,129
You have not been cast.

1799
01:12:24,589 --> 01:12:25,858
(Dancer Park Jun Woo fails to be cast.)

1800
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:28,357
It was me who didn't do a good job,

1801
01:12:28,358 --> 01:12:30,728
so I was very angry at myself.

1802
01:12:30,768 --> 01:12:31,829
I was really disappointed.

1803
01:12:32,329 --> 01:12:36,169
We'll continue with the Main Supporting Role Casting Audition.

1804
01:12:36,608 --> 01:12:39,038
Ballerino Kim Tae Seok.

1805
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:40,477
(Ballerino Kim Tae Seok)

1806
01:12:40,478 --> 01:12:43,978
Contemporary Dancer Yang Seong Yun.

1807
01:12:44,249 --> 01:12:45,478
(All right!)

1808
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:46,817
(Contemporary dancers' cheering with enthusiasm)

1809
01:12:46,818 --> 01:12:47,848
You can do it.

1810
01:12:47,879 --> 01:12:49,618
Uhm Tae Goo in contemporary dance.

1811
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:50,687
He's Karina.

1812
01:12:50,688 --> 01:12:51,888
He's the ensemble's Karina.

1813
01:12:52,148 --> 01:12:54,918
- Good luck, Newlywed. - You can do it, Newlywed.

1814
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:56,258
Go, Sold Out Man.

1815
01:12:57,089 --> 01:12:59,388
- Ballet technique is too hard. - Right.

1816
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:01,757
If I had to do ballet, I couldn't have done it.

1817
01:13:01,758 --> 01:13:02,758
(Everyone wanted to avoid competing against a ballet dancer.)

1818
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:04,869
(Really?)

1819
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,468
To be honest, I was glad that it was ballet.

1820
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:11,909
I prefer ballet to Korean dance.

1821
01:13:12,438 --> 01:13:13,608
- That was good. - Really?

1822
01:13:13,779 --> 01:13:15,438
(Spinning)

1823
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:18,408
(Kim Tae Seok warms up before revealing his choreography.)

1824
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:19,477
(In awe)

1825
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:20,518
(Way to go, ballet.)

1826
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:25,818
(But I can do it, too.)

1827
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:28,217
(Look at him.)

1828
01:13:28,218 --> 01:13:29,789
He doesn't get discouraged.

1829
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,388
It's a tug of war.

1830
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:33,659
- It's fun already. - He's good.

1831
01:13:34,799 --> 01:13:37,329
Since it's ballet, it will be a good opportunity.

1832
01:13:38,129 --> 01:13:39,968
I wasn't particularly worried.

1833
01:13:40,768 --> 01:13:42,369
(Yang Seong Yun and Kim Tae Seok reveal Technique Choreography.)

1834
01:13:42,638 --> 01:13:44,138
(Starting with Yang Seong Yun's Technique Choreography Section A)

1835
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:46,709
He had powerful energy.

1836
01:13:46,938 --> 01:13:50,409
(His choreography has powerful movements in a row.)

1837
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:52,007
(Ending with his hair display)

1838
01:13:52,008 --> 01:13:53,008
(He clears his hair in a hurry.)

1839
01:13:53,009 --> 01:13:55,119
- His hair made it good. - It's better with his hair down.

1840
01:13:56,888 --> 01:13:58,387
(The impact of long hair)

1841
01:13:58,388 --> 01:13:59,718
Other than his long hair,

1842
01:13:59,818 --> 01:14:02,089
I thought that I had a good chance.

1843
01:14:02,858 --> 01:14:04,058
(Followed by Kim Tae Seok's Technique Choreography Section B)

1844
01:14:04,228 --> 01:14:05,228
(Up)

1845
01:14:05,928 --> 01:14:07,357
(Overpowering him with a jump from the start)

1846
01:14:07,358 --> 01:14:08,398
How will he do that?

1847
01:14:09,799 --> 01:14:11,468
(While doing a pirouette, he loses his balance.)

1848
01:14:11,728 --> 01:14:13,128
(Kim Tae Seok grabs his ankle and can't get up.)

1849
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:14,169
Are you okay?

1850
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:15,768
I think that he really fell.

1851
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,038
(What's going on?)

1852
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:19,938
- Isn't it swollen? - It looks very swollen.

1853
01:14:19,978 --> 01:14:21,177
It's so swollen.

1854
01:14:21,178 --> 01:14:22,739
I felt a sudden pain.

1855
01:14:22,978 --> 01:14:25,007
Will I be able to overcome it?

1856
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:27,147
The worry swept over me,

1857
01:14:27,148 --> 01:14:28,619
so I felt extremely angry.

1858
01:14:28,749 --> 01:14:30,317
(After revealing Technique Choreography)

1859
01:14:30,318 --> 01:14:32,147
(The pain in his ankle continues.)

1860
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:34,589
However, I didn't want to give up.

1861
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:36,289
(Limping)

1862
01:14:36,558 --> 01:14:38,528
Instead of worrying about tomorrow,

1863
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:40,598
I wanted to move even for 30 seconds...

1864
01:14:41,129 --> 01:14:42,428
if possible.

1865
01:14:43,268 --> 01:14:45,829
(Kim Tae Seok resumes practicing with his injured ankle.)

1866
01:14:46,598 --> 01:14:48,137
(Kim Tae Seok is onstage without giving up.)

1867
01:14:48,138 --> 01:14:50,209
Will you be able to audition?

1868
01:14:51,608 --> 01:14:53,779
Actually, my ankle isn't doing well.

1869
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:56,709
However, I have my right leg.

1870
01:14:57,178 --> 01:14:58,308
You're amazing.

1871
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:01,017
- You're amazing. - You can do it.

1872
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:02,078
(Encouraging applause)

1873
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:03,489
(I can do it!)

1874
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:04,848
First position.

1875
01:15:06,148 --> 01:15:07,989
Music, start.

1876
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:10,928
(Kim Tae Seok versus Yang Seong Yun, how will their audition go?)

1877
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:12,588
Go.

1878
01:15:12,589 --> 01:15:14,959
(Contemporary Dancer Yang Seong Yun Technique Choreography Section A)

1879
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:17,098
He looks like a wild animal.

1880
01:15:17,228 --> 01:15:20,199
(The power of a wild animal)

1881
01:15:22,839 --> 01:15:23,968
Gosh, he's good.

1882
01:15:24,308 --> 01:15:25,508
They look exactly the same.

1883
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:28,839
(The dancers move exactly the same.)

1884
01:15:29,008 --> 01:15:30,209
Look at Seong Yun's strength.

1885
01:15:31,478 --> 01:15:32,508
That's crazy.

1886
01:15:33,818 --> 01:15:34,818
(Agile)

1887
01:15:35,818 --> 01:15:37,348
(Exclaiming)

1888
01:15:38,718 --> 01:15:39,989
(Due to his ankle injury, Kim Tae Seok modified the move.)

1889
01:15:40,419 --> 01:15:41,518
That's too hard.

1890
01:15:41,659 --> 01:15:43,119
(Thinking)

1891
01:15:48,258 --> 01:15:49,398
(Ballet Kim Tae Seok Technique Choreography Section B)

1892
01:15:49,968 --> 01:15:50,968
Ballet.

1893
01:15:50,969 --> 01:15:52,529
You can do it, Tae Seok.

1894
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,468
Ballet.

1895
01:15:56,669 --> 01:15:57,839
He's really good.

1896
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:01,339
(Eyes widening)

1897
01:16:03,648 --> 01:16:04,977
(Yang Seong Yun shows powerful pirouettes.)

1898
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:06,007
(Explosive cheering)

1899
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:07,148
Let's go.

1900
01:16:10,888 --> 01:16:12,647
(Their neck and neck battle of turns)

1901
01:16:12,648 --> 01:16:14,619
(The ending pose)

1902
01:16:16,388 --> 01:16:17,388
Goodness.

1903
01:16:17,388 --> 01:16:18,388
(He gets right back up after falling at the end.)

1904
01:16:18,589 --> 01:16:20,358
(Good, that looked natural.)

1905
01:16:20,928 --> 01:16:22,258
(Pleasure)

1906
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:24,398
(That was good.)

1907
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:27,938
(Standing ovation)

1908
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:30,869
That was really good.

1909
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:32,268
You're amazing.

1910
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:33,739
Oh, no.

1911
01:16:33,938 --> 01:16:35,338
(His heart breaks.)

1912
01:16:35,339 --> 01:16:37,078
For both Section A and B,

1913
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:38,978
Dancer Yang Seong Yun stood out more.

1914
01:16:39,148 --> 01:16:40,477
There was ballet technique,

1915
01:16:40,478 --> 01:16:43,178
but why did Yang Seong Yun...

1916
01:16:43,718 --> 01:16:44,818
Is it because of the injury?

1917
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:48,789
I couldn't stand on that leg at all.

1918
01:16:48,959 --> 01:16:51,459
It was disappointing, but I did it until the end.

1919
01:16:51,589 --> 01:16:52,758
I have no regrets.

1920
01:16:52,959 --> 01:16:54,558
Your fighting spirit despite the injury was insane.

1921
01:16:54,728 --> 01:16:56,058
You did a great job.

1922
01:16:56,459 --> 01:17:00,397
You had to execute the technique outside of your dance genre.

1923
01:17:00,398 --> 01:17:03,298
Dancer Kim Tae Seok,

1924
01:17:03,299 --> 01:17:04,938
you couldn't execute...

1925
01:17:05,608 --> 01:17:08,409
the rainbow at all.

1926
01:17:09,008 --> 01:17:11,409
On the other hand, Dancer Yang Seong Yun.

1927
01:17:12,209 --> 01:17:15,717
Maybe it's because of the injury, but you did more pirouettes...

1928
01:17:15,718 --> 01:17:18,289
than Kim Tae Seok.

1929
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:19,549
He turned three times, right?

1930
01:17:20,318 --> 01:17:21,658
(Seong Yun did ballet techniques better than Kim Tae Seok.)

1931
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:25,057
Regarding your modified double saut de basque,

1932
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,727
as a ballerino,

1933
01:17:26,728 --> 01:17:29,659
I'd say that you executed it very well.

1934
01:17:30,329 --> 01:17:31,428
Good job.

1935
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:33,267
(Feeling bitter)

1936
01:17:33,268 --> 01:17:34,437
He really did well.

1937
01:17:34,438 --> 01:17:35,468
(Giving him credit)

1938
01:17:35,869 --> 01:17:39,169
I'll announce the result for Main Supporting Role Casting.

1939
01:17:39,339 --> 01:17:43,648
First, Dancer Kim Tae Seok for the main supporting role.

1940
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,107
(Smiling)

1941
01:17:45,108 --> 01:17:46,648
You have not been cast.

1942
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,018
(Nodding)

1943
01:17:48,148 --> 01:17:49,148
(Dancer Kim Tae Seok fails to be cast.)

1944
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:52,188
Next, Yang Seong Yun...

1945
01:17:53,318 --> 01:17:54,659
for the main supporting role.

1946
01:17:55,318 --> 01:17:57,329
"You've been cast."

1947
01:17:57,928 --> 01:18:00,358
I did another dance genre well,

1948
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:02,228
so I felt confident.

1949
01:18:04,398 --> 01:18:05,669
You've been cast.

1950
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:09,338
(Dancer Yang Seong Yun is cast for the main supporting role.)

1951
01:18:09,339 --> 01:18:10,369
(Yes)

1952
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:13,478
(Contemporary dancers are proud.)

1953
01:18:13,638 --> 01:18:14,938
His hard work paid off.

1954
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,348
It was a huge bummer,

1955
01:18:17,508 --> 01:18:19,648
but I was glad and proud of doing it until the end...

1956
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:21,119
without giving up.

1957
01:18:21,318 --> 01:18:24,049
We will continue with...

1958
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:25,518
the Main Supporting Role Casting Audition.

1959
01:18:25,589 --> 01:18:28,089
Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho.

1960
01:18:28,188 --> 01:18:29,518
(Let's go, Gyeong Ho.)

1961
01:18:29,589 --> 01:18:30,629
Gyeong Ho!

1962
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:32,058
He's our hope.

1963
01:18:32,129 --> 01:18:36,058
Korean Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon, please come out.

1964
01:18:36,558 --> 01:18:38,298
- Let's go. - You can do it, Kyu Nyeon.

1965
01:18:38,299 --> 01:18:39,629
You can do it, Kyu Nyeon.

1966
01:18:39,898 --> 01:18:40,968
Kyu Nyeon.

1967
01:18:41,339 --> 01:18:43,298
This combination is the most interesting.

1968
01:18:43,299 --> 01:18:44,539
Ballet and Korean dance.

1969
01:18:44,938 --> 01:18:47,209
Oh, no. Kyu Nyeon is bad at ballet.

1970
01:18:47,339 --> 01:18:48,677
He's bad at ballet.

1971
01:18:48,678 --> 01:18:50,079
You're so honest.

1972
01:18:50,409 --> 01:18:51,978
(Is Kyu Nyeon's teacher worried about him?)

1973
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:54,978
I didn't want to compete against a ballerino.

1974
01:18:55,249 --> 01:18:56,249
I felt anxious.

1975
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:59,147
Will you hit me if I add something like this?

1976
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:00,318
What?

1977
01:19:00,388 --> 01:19:02,017
Turning and splitting.

1978
01:19:02,018 --> 01:19:03,217
Of course.

1979
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:05,128
If I twist my legs in the air.

1980
01:19:05,129 --> 01:19:07,058
Then I'll add something more difficult.

1981
01:19:07,299 --> 01:19:10,227
In ballet, you don't dance down on the floor.

1982
01:19:10,228 --> 01:19:12,567
I thought that it'd be awkward for him.

1983
01:19:12,568 --> 01:19:14,739
My focus was dancing on the floor.

1984
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:17,369
(Kim Kyu Nyeon choreographs by using the floor.)

1985
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:20,108
(Kyu Nyeon never gets up from the floor.)

1986
01:19:20,209 --> 01:19:21,638
(Sighing)

1987
01:19:22,808 --> 01:19:24,278
I'm terrible at the floor technique.

1988
01:19:24,279 --> 01:19:25,647
But this is very easy.

1989
01:19:25,648 --> 01:19:26,748
(That's easy?)

1990
01:19:26,749 --> 01:19:29,477
In ballet, you dance while standing up.

1991
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,817
As soon as your head gets lower than your buttocks,

1992
01:19:31,818 --> 01:19:33,419
you get so awkward.

1993
01:19:33,959 --> 01:19:36,258
How will ballerinos torment other dancers?

1994
01:19:36,419 --> 01:19:37,628
I know.

1995
01:19:37,629 --> 01:19:38,629
(He plans to torment with this.)

1996
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,959
What the...

1997
01:19:40,659 --> 01:19:42,159
I almost cursed.

1998
01:19:45,129 --> 01:19:46,329
(Trying not to laugh)

1999
01:19:46,468 --> 01:19:48,038
Dancing in the air.

2000
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:51,168
No matter how hard you try to imitate it,

2001
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:53,468
it won't have the same quality at all.

2002
01:19:54,638 --> 01:19:56,779
(On this side, he's rolling on the floor.)

2003
01:19:57,379 --> 01:19:58,449
(Turning)

2004
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:01,218
(On that side, he's busy jumping.)

2005
01:20:01,449 --> 01:20:03,919
(Who will get the last laugh?)

2006
01:20:04,289 --> 01:20:05,918
Now,

2007
01:20:05,919 --> 01:20:08,758
Main Supporting Role Casting Audition will start.

2008
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:13,459
(Before starting, Kang Gyeong Ho starts warming up lightly.)

2009
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:15,428
Look at his jumps.

2010
01:20:15,629 --> 01:20:16,829
He jumps really high.

2011
01:20:16,968 --> 01:20:18,029
He stays in the air.

2012
01:20:18,428 --> 01:20:19,629
He doesn't come down.

2013
01:20:19,768 --> 01:20:21,039
This will be fun too.

2014
01:20:21,268 --> 01:20:23,299
It's a fight between the sky and the ground.

2015
01:20:23,938 --> 01:20:25,068
First position.

2016
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,108
- You can do it. - Good luck.

2017
01:20:27,178 --> 01:20:28,178
Let's go.

2018
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:29,409
Good luck.

2019
01:20:29,808 --> 01:20:31,749
Music, start.

2020
01:20:32,549 --> 01:20:36,249
Three, two, one. Go.

2021
01:20:37,388 --> 01:20:42,088
(Ballet Kang Gyeong Ho Technique Choreography Section A)

2022
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:44,028
(Kim Kyu Nyeon executes ballet moves with control.)

2023
01:20:44,029 --> 01:20:45,488
Are they both ballerinos or what?

2024
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:49,258
(Ballet Kang Gyeong Ho Technique Choreography Section A)

2025
01:20:49,459 --> 01:20:50,529
(Tour en l'air that he's been waiting for)

2026
01:20:51,898 --> 01:20:53,668
He's so good.

2027
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:54,799
It looks clean.

2028
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:58,739
(Kang Gyeong Ho's Section A ends with tour en l'air.)

2029
01:20:59,169 --> 01:21:00,839
(Kim Kyu Nyeon's Section B starts right away.)

2030
01:21:01,438 --> 01:21:02,438
(Kim Kyu Nyeon misses the movement.)

2031
01:21:03,079 --> 01:21:04,249
He forgot the combination.

2032
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:08,718
He made a mistake.

2033
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:10,788
(I can't watch this.)

2034
01:21:10,789 --> 01:21:11,818
(The Korean dancers feel terrible.)

2035
01:21:12,848 --> 01:21:15,419
(Kang Gyeong Ho has to execute the floor technique.)

2036
01:21:15,858 --> 01:21:17,089
Gyeong Ho is good.

2037
01:21:25,629 --> 01:21:27,198
(The perfect ending)

2038
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:28,199
He did well.

2039
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:31,239
- Isn't his floor technique good? - How is he so good?

2040
01:21:31,268 --> 01:21:32,408
He made a mistake.

2041
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:33,409
(Kim Kyu Nyeon missed the moves in his choreography.)

2042
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:34,739
He got his own choreography wrong.

2043
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:36,608
He did ballet so well, but...

2044
01:21:36,879 --> 01:21:38,847
He forgot the combination, right?

2045
01:21:38,848 --> 01:21:40,148
Kyu Nyeon forgot.

2046
01:21:40,318 --> 01:21:44,517
Kim Kyu Nyeon's moves were a bit shabby.

2047
01:21:44,518 --> 01:21:45,548
- Right. - That means...

2048
01:21:45,549 --> 01:21:47,317
Gyeong Ho did much better.

2049
01:21:47,318 --> 01:21:49,089
Yes, he did much better.

2050
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:53,629
First, I'll announce the result for Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2051
01:21:53,699 --> 01:21:57,398
Korean Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon for the main supporting role.

2052
01:21:57,728 --> 01:21:59,669
You've not been cast.

2053
01:21:59,829 --> 01:22:02,669
(Kim Kyu Nyeon fails to be cast for the main supporting role.)

2054
01:22:02,768 --> 01:22:04,208
I didn't show them anything.

2055
01:22:04,209 --> 01:22:06,108
The result was expected.

2056
01:22:06,209 --> 01:22:07,978
I just wanted to hide myself.

2057
01:22:09,339 --> 01:22:10,909
(Sullen Ho Jong)

2058
01:22:11,308 --> 01:22:13,278
Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho...

2059
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:14,779
for a main supporting role.

2060
01:22:15,049 --> 01:22:16,119
Please...

2061
01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:18,549
You've been cast.

2062
01:22:19,549 --> 01:22:20,558
Thank you.

2063
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:26,058
I have a question for you, Gyeong Ho.

2064
01:22:26,459 --> 01:22:30,029
From what I could see, the movements that you included...

2065
01:22:30,299 --> 01:22:35,138
weren't really ballet techniques.

2066
01:22:37,508 --> 01:22:39,708
(Gyeong Ho's choreography section barely included...)

2067
01:22:39,709 --> 01:22:42,279
(any ballet techniques.)

2068
01:22:42,478 --> 01:22:45,708
I was wondering if you were being considerate of Kyu Nyeon...

2069
01:22:45,709 --> 01:22:47,677
being considerate of Kyu Nyeon...

2070
01:22:47,678 --> 01:22:51,018
as you lowered the difficulty of the techniques you used.

2071
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,557
It wasn't exactly consideration...

2072
01:22:55,558 --> 01:22:57,159
(What happened to these two?)

2073
01:22:57,358 --> 01:22:59,187
Kyu Nyeon, are there any ballet techniques you can do?

2074
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:01,357
Me? Like jumps or turns?

2075
01:23:01,358 --> 01:23:02,358
Yes.

2076
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:05,029
Like two turns in the air, or a pirouette...

2077
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:06,999
You can't do something like a ciseaux, right?

2078
01:23:07,239 --> 01:23:09,498
Right. That's... I'm turning off my mic.

2079
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:11,007
(See me with our mics off.)

2080
01:23:11,008 --> 01:23:12,308
Kyu Nyeon, can you do this much?

2081
01:23:13,138 --> 01:23:14,178
Two turns.

2082
01:23:15,209 --> 01:23:16,308
Tour en l'air.

2083
01:23:16,808 --> 01:23:18,249
- Time out. - Can't you do that?

2084
01:23:19,449 --> 01:23:20,678
I think I could do it if you teach me.

2085
01:23:21,178 --> 01:23:22,217
(Contemplating)

2086
01:23:22,218 --> 01:23:25,188
I had to check which techniques I could add.

2087
01:23:25,648 --> 01:23:28,919
If I did a pirouette in front, I heard groans from the back.

2088
01:23:29,218 --> 01:23:30,529
I just saw something weird.

2089
01:23:30,888 --> 01:23:32,558
I think that really got to me, actually.

2090
01:23:33,089 --> 01:23:34,557
(Gyeong Ho choreographs his part...)

2091
01:23:34,558 --> 01:23:35,898
(as he considers the difficulty of the dance.)

2092
01:23:36,228 --> 01:23:37,598
Is this too hard?

2093
01:23:38,068 --> 01:23:39,129
Could he do a cabriole?

2094
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:40,968
No, take that out.

2095
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:44,108
I mean, I could do it, but my partner couldn't.

2096
01:23:45,138 --> 01:23:46,338
(Gyeong Ho adjusted the difficulty of the techniques...)

2097
01:23:46,339 --> 01:23:47,507
(for his partner who wasn't used to ballet techniques.)

2098
01:23:47,508 --> 01:23:48,739
Gyeong Ho just danced.

2099
01:23:49,209 --> 01:23:51,177
But the fact that we named this audition...

2100
01:23:51,178 --> 01:23:55,448
the Technique Choreography Audition...

2101
01:23:55,449 --> 01:23:58,249
meant that we wanted to see the techniques that you could do best.

2102
01:23:58,489 --> 01:24:03,318
We have to know which movements you can do best...

2103
01:24:03,718 --> 01:24:05,558
for me to include it in my piece.

2104
01:24:05,789 --> 01:24:10,798
So, could you show us what kind of techniques...

2105
01:24:10,799 --> 01:24:13,199
you consider to be your best, Gyeong Ho?

2106
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:14,839
Yes, I will...

2107
01:24:15,098 --> 01:24:16,968
- Go, Gyeong Ho! - You can do it!

2108
01:24:17,339 --> 01:24:18,668
(He's ready to go.)

2109
01:24:18,669 --> 01:24:20,478
- Let's show them. - Two, one.

2110
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:21,978
Go.

2111
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,308
Is he going to go straight into a ciseaux?

2112
01:24:25,579 --> 01:24:26,708
(1 ciseaux)

2113
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:27,748
(So thrilling)

2114
01:24:27,749 --> 01:24:28,919
No way.

2115
01:24:30,549 --> 01:24:31,549
(2 ciseaux)

2116
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:33,548
How long can he stay in the air?

2117
01:24:33,549 --> 01:24:35,119
He's ridiculously good.

2118
01:24:36,688 --> 01:24:37,688
(A cabriole followed by the ciseaux)

2119
01:24:38,228 --> 01:24:40,129
Yes, that's what ballet is about.

2120
01:24:44,228 --> 01:24:45,467
(3 ciseaux)

2121
01:24:45,468 --> 01:24:46,568
(Impressed)

2122
01:24:47,098 --> 01:24:48,738
(Standing up during his performance)

2123
01:24:48,739 --> 01:24:49,768
Three ciseaux.

2124
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:52,068
(After showing off consecutive ciseaux, )

2125
01:24:52,808 --> 01:24:54,838
(he finishes with a 4th ciseaux.)

2126
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,038
(He's good, indeed.)

2127
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:57,079
Come on.

2128
01:24:57,409 --> 01:24:58,477
That was insane.

2129
01:24:58,478 --> 01:24:59,978
How many ciseaux did he do?

2130
01:25:00,148 --> 01:25:02,249
He has great jumping techniques.

2131
01:25:02,579 --> 01:25:04,249
- That was incredible. - Why didn't he include jumps?

2132
01:25:04,549 --> 01:25:08,489
I haven't seen jumps like that from any other dancer.

2133
01:25:08,718 --> 01:25:12,188
We could've missed out on such a huge opportunity.

2134
01:25:12,688 --> 01:25:13,728
Thank you.

2135
01:25:14,598 --> 01:25:17,097
Let's try hard so I can be well suited for this position.

2136
01:25:17,098 --> 01:25:18,199
So I won't feel embarrassed.

2137
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:22,368
Next, Korean dancer Baek Sang Ha,

2138
01:25:22,369 --> 01:25:26,008
and contemporary dancer Lee Jin Woo, please come forward.

2139
01:25:26,108 --> 01:25:27,839
- Let's go! - Let's go.

2140
01:25:28,379 --> 01:25:29,379
Let's go!

2141
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:33,147
We will begin the casting audition for the main supporting role.

2142
01:25:33,148 --> 01:25:36,718
Three, two, one. Go.

2143
01:25:36,749 --> 01:25:38,017
(Korean dance Baek Sang Ha, Technique Choreography Section A)

2144
01:25:38,018 --> 01:25:39,018
(Oh, what's this?)

2145
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:40,187
That's so cool.

2146
01:25:40,188 --> 01:25:44,757
(Korean dance Baek Sang Ha, Technique Choreography Section A)

2147
01:25:44,758 --> 01:25:45,758
Oh, they're good.

2148
01:25:45,758 --> 01:25:46,758
(Not sure about something)

2149
01:25:46,759 --> 01:25:50,427
(Korean dance Baek Sang Ha, Technique Choreography Section A)

2150
01:25:50,428 --> 01:25:51,428
(Watching with eyes like a hawk)

2151
01:25:52,068 --> 01:25:53,097
They're good.

2152
01:25:53,098 --> 01:25:55,597
(Contemporary dance Lee Jin Woo, Technique Choreography Section B)

2153
01:25:55,598 --> 01:25:56,839
Sang Ha is good.

2154
01:26:03,108 --> 01:26:04,108
(Impressed)

2155
01:26:05,449 --> 01:26:06,449
Nice.

2156
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:07,648
(Baek Sang Ha versus Lee Jin Woo, the Casting Audition ends.)

2157
01:26:07,818 --> 01:26:08,818
(They finished well.)

2158
01:26:08,818 --> 01:26:09,818
(Clapping)

2159
01:26:09,818 --> 01:26:10,818
(Feeling rather disappointed)

2160
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:13,388
(What will their results be like as they pull off the choreography?)

2161
01:26:13,848 --> 01:26:15,459
Weren't the movements too easy?

2162
01:26:15,989 --> 01:26:18,728
I think it was a big minus.

2163
01:26:18,989 --> 01:26:23,199
We will not cast Baek Sang Ha or Lee Jin Woo.

2164
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:26,029
Both of you have worked hard.

2165
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:30,138
We've seen all of the auditions up to Group Eight.

2166
01:26:30,669 --> 01:26:33,239
Are they only casting six?

2167
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:34,709
They're not done yet.

2168
01:26:35,839 --> 01:26:37,238
There's one spot left, right?

2169
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:38,678
- Yes, there's a spot left. - There's one spot left.

2170
01:26:39,148 --> 01:26:42,317
The dancers who have been cast as the main supporting roles are...

2171
01:26:42,318 --> 01:26:45,049
contemporary dancer Yang Seong Yun,

2172
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:46,888
Jung Hye Seong,

2173
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:48,818
Kim Young Woong,

2174
01:26:49,058 --> 01:26:51,588
ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho,

2175
01:26:51,589 --> 01:26:54,558
and lastly, Kim Hye Hyun.

2176
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,669
There is only one spot remaining for the main supporting role.

2177
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:01,238
To cast the remaining main supporting dancer,

2178
01:27:01,239 --> 01:27:03,538
we will hold an extra audition.

2179
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:05,137
Please wait a moment.

2180
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:06,238
(Suddenly standing up)

2181
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:07,308
(Glancing over)

2182
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:09,678
I was getting ready so that my body didn't stiffen up.

2183
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:11,608
I should bring up my energy level.

2184
01:27:12,279 --> 01:27:13,579
My competitive drive is on fire.

2185
01:27:13,709 --> 01:27:15,879
Please, just give me one more chance.

2186
01:27:15,978 --> 01:27:17,488
I don't think they'll call me.

2187
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:20,419
I think they'll call someone good from Korean dance.

2188
01:27:20,589 --> 01:27:22,119
I think it'll be Jang June Hyuk and Ki Moo Gan.

2189
01:27:22,919 --> 01:27:24,758
We'll proceed with the extra audition.

2190
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:27,329
The dancers to take part in the extra audition are...

2191
01:27:27,558 --> 01:27:28,659
Korean dancer...

2192
01:27:29,299 --> 01:27:30,698
Ki Moo Gan...

2193
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:32,597
(Participant in the extra audition: Korean dancer Ki Moo Gan)

2194
01:27:32,598 --> 01:27:36,168
And Park Jun Woo.

2195
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:37,339
(Participant in the extra audition: Korean dancer Park Jun Woo)

2196
01:27:38,508 --> 01:27:40,608
- It's 1 of the 2? - Oh, it's just those 2?

2197
01:27:41,539 --> 01:27:42,779
It's a family feud.

2198
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:44,848
Then...

2199
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:46,808
The one I felt was a close call...

2200
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:50,379
Moo Gan was good at handling other genres.

2201
01:27:50,518 --> 01:27:52,687
I think we should see Ki Moo Gan.

2202
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:54,387
And he showed us good techniques...

2203
01:27:54,388 --> 01:27:56,887
in contemporary dance. Park Jun Woo.

2204
01:27:56,888 --> 01:27:58,158
Park Jun Woo was a close call.

2205
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:00,427
I think Jun Woo had good reviews.

2206
01:28:00,428 --> 01:28:02,459
I couldn't believe I had this kind of opportunity.

2207
01:28:02,829 --> 01:28:04,029
Let's make up for it now.

2208
01:28:04,129 --> 01:28:06,098
If I do well, I could be chosen.

2209
01:28:06,568 --> 01:28:10,869
I think it would be good if you showed us your best techniques.

2210
01:28:11,209 --> 01:28:14,307
Then, it'd be meaningless to show Korean dance techniques.

2211
01:28:14,308 --> 01:28:15,708
We'll see your performance after you warm up.

2212
01:28:15,709 --> 01:28:17,108
It's really a battle of techniques.

2213
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:19,148
The person with one lethal move will win.

2214
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:21,018
Will they show us?

2215
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:25,619
This is a competition for the one remaining spot.

2216
01:28:26,018 --> 01:28:29,018
Don't be considerate of each other, and show us a good competition.

2217
01:28:29,659 --> 01:28:30,659
Yes, ma'am.

2218
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:33,959
I wasn't nervous. I felt like I'd get cast.

2219
01:28:34,428 --> 01:28:36,199
I should win the spot, no matter what.

2220
01:28:36,699 --> 01:28:38,699
This will be fun. Which techniques will they do?

2221
01:28:38,928 --> 01:28:41,039
Do a freestyle improvised dance?

2222
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:43,768
Oh, I should win this, no matter what.

2223
01:28:43,938 --> 01:28:46,368
Since Moo Gan has good floor techniques...

2224
01:28:46,369 --> 01:28:48,039
In order to win...

2225
01:28:48,608 --> 01:28:50,539
- He's so light on his feet. - I bet he adds a jaban.

2226
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:52,079
Let's show them my lethal move.

2227
01:28:52,879 --> 01:28:56,579
From now on, we will begin the extra casting audition.

2228
01:28:56,949 --> 01:28:57,988
Let's go!

2229
01:28:57,989 --> 01:28:59,418
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2230
01:28:59,419 --> 01:29:01,518
This is really my last chance.

2231
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:03,057
First position.

2232
01:29:03,058 --> 01:29:05,058
Music, start.

2233
01:29:05,329 --> 01:29:06,628
(Park Jun Woo goes first as he tries to win the main supporting role.)

2234
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:07,898
He's facing off with his opponent.

2235
01:29:07,999 --> 01:29:10,659
(Park Jun Woo starts in a position where he's facing Ki Moo Gan.)

2236
01:29:14,369 --> 01:29:15,799
(Park Jun Woo draws people in with his unique breath and lines.)

2237
01:29:16,369 --> 01:29:17,438
He's relaxed too.

2238
01:29:19,409 --> 01:29:20,409
(Impressed)

2239
01:29:20,879 --> 01:29:21,879
(He's pretty good.)

2240
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:23,279
(Park Jun Woo actively utilizes the floor as well.)

2241
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:24,978
Why are his arms and legs so long?

2242
01:29:25,249 --> 01:29:26,508
He has really refreshing lines.

2243
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:31,089
(Impressed)

2244
01:29:31,249 --> 01:29:32,249
Nice.

2245
01:29:32,718 --> 01:29:35,289
(Park Jun Woo nails his lethal move, the jaban.)

2246
01:29:38,388 --> 01:29:40,688
He was really good. Should I be wary of him?

2247
01:29:41,129 --> 01:29:42,329
(Totally immersed)

2248
01:29:45,799 --> 01:29:47,169
There you go. You have to do the helicopter.

2249
01:29:47,468 --> 01:29:49,068
(Here comes the helicopter.)

2250
01:29:52,108 --> 01:29:53,909
(He doesn't miss the foot detail.)

2251
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:57,209
(The ending fairy with a daring hand gesture.)

2252
01:29:57,848 --> 01:29:58,848
(A standing ovation)

2253
01:29:58,849 --> 01:30:00,307
(The adorable dancer made everyone laugh.)

2254
01:30:00,308 --> 01:30:01,348
Nice fan service.

2255
01:30:01,419 --> 01:30:04,079
He's "The Great Gatsby."

2256
01:30:04,388 --> 01:30:06,448
(Everyone keeps copying his ending pose.)

2257
01:30:06,449 --> 01:30:08,419
- He put together a good dance. - He's so cute.

2258
01:30:09,459 --> 01:30:10,688
That's what I call technique.

2259
01:30:11,029 --> 01:30:13,258
(The only guy who can't smile in the meantime)

2260
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:14,858
Moo Gan.

2261
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:16,629
I think Moo Gan will be cast.

2262
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:18,528
I hope we can tell for certain.

2263
01:30:18,529 --> 01:30:19,668
- I hope it's not a hard choice. - Right.

2264
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:20,999
I wish it'll be easy to tell.

2265
01:30:21,869 --> 01:30:23,898
- Then, we'll get started. - I'll give it a go.

2266
01:30:24,098 --> 01:30:25,138
First position.

2267
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:28,338
I think I just really want to do well.

2268
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:29,339
Music,

2269
01:30:30,308 --> 01:30:31,308
start.

2270
01:30:31,879 --> 01:30:33,049
(Calming down his racing heart)

2271
01:30:33,308 --> 01:30:35,779
Three, two, one. Go.

2272
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:39,688
Good.

2273
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:41,557
(Eyes widening)

2274
01:30:41,558 --> 01:30:42,857
(Goodness)

2275
01:30:42,858 --> 01:30:44,858
(Ki Moo Gan shows off his floor techniques from the beginning.)

2276
01:30:46,459 --> 01:30:47,459
(Watching closely)

2277
01:30:52,129 --> 01:30:53,129
That's a bit of a shame.

2278
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,638
(His moves mostly consist of floor techniques.)

2279
01:30:55,068 --> 01:30:56,068
(Wondering)

2280
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:58,169
You have to do more.

2281
01:30:59,268 --> 01:31:02,079
You have to do more.

2282
01:31:03,478 --> 01:31:04,478
(Hesitating)

2283
01:31:04,478 --> 01:31:05,478
Oh, he's a bit...

2284
01:31:06,178 --> 01:31:07,848
He was getting tangled up.

2285
01:31:09,348 --> 01:31:10,549
Don't give up.

2286
01:31:13,049 --> 01:31:14,358
(Ki Moo Gan versus Park Jun Woo, the Extra Casting Audition ends.)

2287
01:31:15,018 --> 01:31:16,058
Goodness.

2288
01:31:16,459 --> 01:31:17,558
It wasn't easy.

2289
01:31:18,358 --> 01:31:19,488
(Disappointed)

2290
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:20,489
He made a mistake.

2291
01:31:21,029 --> 01:31:22,659
- He got tangled up. - He lost his flow.

2292
01:31:22,699 --> 01:31:24,927
- He got a bit tangled up, right? - Yes, a bit.

2293
01:31:24,928 --> 01:31:27,299
- He was thinking too much. - Yes, he missed his flow.

2294
01:31:28,169 --> 01:31:31,238
I think you had a lot on your mind, Moo Gan.

2295
01:31:31,239 --> 01:31:33,568
Right? How was it?

2296
01:31:34,108 --> 01:31:35,938
I had my moves planned out...

2297
01:31:37,308 --> 01:31:39,107
(Ki Moo Gan can't continue speaking out of disappointment.)

2298
01:31:39,108 --> 01:31:42,249
Moo Gan, I think the greatest strength you have...

2299
01:31:42,449 --> 01:31:44,489
is how natural you are.

2300
01:31:45,089 --> 01:31:47,248
But you started out...

2301
01:31:47,249 --> 01:31:50,218
with what you were going to do already set in mind.

2302
01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:53,089
That was why you totally lost your flow.

2303
01:31:53,659 --> 01:31:54,928
- Yes, that's right. - Right?

2304
01:31:55,999 --> 01:31:57,098
It was a shame.

2305
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:00,629
I felt like such a fool.

2306
01:32:01,369 --> 01:32:03,339
There must be so many who were dying for a chance.

2307
01:32:03,499 --> 01:32:04,968
How could I mess this up?

2308
01:32:05,568 --> 01:32:08,538
On the other hand, Park Jun Woo...

2309
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:11,749
seemed to know exactly what Ki Moo Gan was good at.

2310
01:32:12,678 --> 01:32:15,379
"I bet Ki Moo Gan will do these moves."

2311
01:32:15,478 --> 01:32:17,177
"I will make my moves..."

2312
01:32:17,178 --> 01:32:19,588
"a bit bigger and flashier." I could tell...

2313
01:32:19,589 --> 01:32:21,419
that you came up with your choreography with that in mind.

2314
01:32:21,518 --> 01:32:24,959
And I think your strategy was right on the spot.

2315
01:32:25,659 --> 01:32:26,728
Good work.

2316
01:32:27,699 --> 01:32:29,298
We will now announce the dancer...

2317
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:31,598
who will be cast in the final main supporting role.

2318
01:32:33,169 --> 01:32:35,339
Korean dancer Park Jun Woo...

2319
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:37,268
for a main supporting role.

2320
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,739
- Jun Woo, you should get it. - He'll get it.

2321
01:32:41,839 --> 01:32:42,938
You've been cast.

2322
01:32:43,608 --> 01:32:46,749
(A big bow)

2323
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:52,817
Jun Woo managed to do well in the opportunity he was given.

2324
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:56,017
As a result, Korean dancer Ki Moo Gan has not been cast...

2325
01:32:56,018 --> 01:32:58,489
in the main supporting role.

2326
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:01,459
Oh, no. Moo Gan.

2327
01:33:02,329 --> 01:33:04,699
- Why did you get so tangled up? - I know.

2328
01:33:05,529 --> 01:33:07,268
You worked so hard.

2329
01:33:07,468 --> 01:33:10,268
No matter which position I'm in, I can just do well.

2330
01:33:11,638 --> 01:33:13,108
- Good job. - Good work, Jun Woo.

2331
01:33:14,209 --> 01:33:17,848
I was just grateful throughout this entire audition.

2332
01:33:18,178 --> 01:33:19,579
I felt like I was going to cry.

2333
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,647
The Mega Stage Mission, Wihonmu.

2334
01:33:22,648 --> 01:33:25,549
The main supporting role auditions are all finished.

2335
01:33:25,789 --> 01:33:28,659
Congratulations to all of the dancers who have been cast.

2336
01:33:28,758 --> 01:33:30,018
(That was a great competition.)

2337
01:33:30,459 --> 01:33:33,188
(Mega Stage Mission Main Supporting Role Casting Results)

2338
01:33:33,459 --> 01:33:36,959
(The First Class' Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

2339
01:33:37,228 --> 01:33:39,228
(A fierce dance battle with each genre's pride on the line)

2340
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:40,299
(Getting goosebumps)

2341
01:33:40,568 --> 01:33:41,768
(The dancer in the sub lead role...)

2342
01:33:42,068 --> 01:33:43,199
(is Choi Ho Jong.)

2343
01:33:43,299 --> 01:33:44,339
(Is this for real?)

2344
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:45,568
(I will go with sub lead role candidate...)

2345
01:33:45,808 --> 01:33:47,468
(Choi Ho Jong.)

2346
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:48,938
(Sub lead role candidate number 3)

2347
01:33:49,138 --> 01:33:50,177
(Choi Ho Jong)

2348
01:33:50,178 --> 01:33:52,448
(Choi Ho Jong was called as the sub lead role several times.)

2349
01:33:52,449 --> 01:33:54,449
(I was really frustrated that I couldn't show...)

2350
01:33:54,518 --> 01:33:55,579
(what I could do.)

2351
01:33:56,379 --> 01:33:58,248
Stage Fighter. We will proceed with...

2352
01:33:58,249 --> 01:34:00,188
the Main Lead Role Casting Audition.

2353
01:34:01,089 --> 01:34:04,358
We will now explain how the Main Lead Role Casting Auditions will go.

2354
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:06,088
Among the eight lead dancers,

2355
01:34:06,089 --> 01:34:09,629
only three of you can get the main lead roles.

2356
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:11,329
Oh, that's tough.

2357
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:13,568
Three is a perfect number.

2358
01:34:14,098 --> 01:34:16,039
Well, I think I'll be safe.

2359
01:34:16,299 --> 01:34:18,039
I could make it in without much difficulty.

2360
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:21,339
I didn't think three spots were too few.

2361
01:34:21,438 --> 01:34:22,909
But I did think the competition would be fierce.

2362
01:34:23,308 --> 01:34:26,949
In the Mega Stage performance, Wihonmu, the main lead roles are...

2363
01:34:27,209 --> 01:34:30,078
the one opposing death, the one fearing death,

2364
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:32,018
and the one consoling death.

2365
01:34:32,718 --> 01:34:35,817
The candidates for main lead roles must choose three dancers...

2366
01:34:35,818 --> 01:34:39,489
who they think will be good sub lead dancers to make them shine.

2367
01:34:39,728 --> 01:34:42,629
They will be performing the audition piece together.

2368
01:34:42,799 --> 01:34:45,597
Among the sub dancers in the background,

2369
01:34:45,598 --> 01:34:47,968
they must not be overwhelmed...

2370
01:34:48,169 --> 01:34:50,098
and shine brightest on stage.

2371
01:34:50,799 --> 01:34:54,307
I thought who I choose as my sub lead dancers...

2372
01:34:54,308 --> 01:34:56,608
would be important.

2373
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:59,977
If the dancers behind me do too well,

2374
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:02,419
I could seem overwhelmed by them.

2375
01:35:02,848 --> 01:35:04,618
Those who will make me shine.

2376
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:07,789
Everyone will choose the dancers who aren't as good as them.

2377
01:35:08,089 --> 01:35:11,129
If I choose the right dancers behind me, I could shine even brighter.

2378
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,927
Seven, eight.

2379
01:35:15,928 --> 01:35:16,928
(The lead dancers start practicing the audition piece.)

2380
01:35:17,029 --> 01:35:19,829
I should memorize it quickly and work on the details.

2381
01:35:20,398 --> 01:35:22,638
In the process of memorizing and practicing the audition piece,

2382
01:35:22,869 --> 01:35:24,468
I should choose those who are doing well.

2383
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:27,739
- I'll turn up the music here. - Okay.

2384
01:35:28,039 --> 01:35:31,378
I was hoping that I'd get a chance to observe and figure out...

2385
01:35:31,379 --> 01:35:34,848
the other dancers sooner. That's why I played the music.

2386
01:35:36,579 --> 01:35:39,749
(Choi Ho Jong led the group practice to figure out the dancers' skills.)

2387
01:35:40,148 --> 01:35:42,517
(And outside of the group practice, )

2388
01:35:42,518 --> 01:35:44,758
(one dancer is focused on doing his own thing.)

2389
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:48,329
Kim Hyun Ho kept grabbing my attention.

2390
01:35:48,558 --> 01:35:50,499
Kim Hyun Ho seemed to have...

2391
01:35:50,598 --> 01:35:52,728
a very unique style.

2392
01:35:53,169 --> 01:35:54,329
It would be hard to dance with him.

2393
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:56,699
Hyun Ho had a very strong energy.

2394
01:35:56,799 --> 01:35:58,869
So, in a way, he could stand out too much.

2395
01:35:58,968 --> 01:36:02,308
Would this style work for the audition?

2396
01:36:02,438 --> 01:36:03,839
I was contemplating it a lot.

2397
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,378
This is who I am. But will you guys...

2398
01:36:07,379 --> 01:36:08,648
be able to use me as a sub dancer?

2399
01:36:09,749 --> 01:36:10,818
Do you want to dance to the music together?

2400
01:36:11,549 --> 01:36:12,618
- To the music? - Yes.

2401
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:15,258
- I don't have it memorized yet. - I'm a little confused too.

2402
01:36:15,388 --> 01:36:17,058
I don't get this part. The arm movement.

2403
01:36:17,258 --> 01:36:19,289
I think I should learn the Korean dance port de bras.

2404
01:36:19,728 --> 01:36:21,028
There were Korean dance-like movements...

2405
01:36:21,029 --> 01:36:23,529
in between the other segments.

2406
01:36:24,329 --> 01:36:26,669
Even as I was practicing, it was really difficult.

2407
01:36:26,928 --> 01:36:27,999
(Is this right?)

2408
01:36:28,968 --> 01:36:32,438
I could tell that the ballerinos were pretty confused.

2409
01:36:32,539 --> 01:36:36,039
Every time I looked at him, Kim Yu Chan...

2410
01:36:36,279 --> 01:36:40,008
was never practicing properly.

2411
01:36:40,308 --> 01:36:41,379
Will he do well?

2412
01:36:41,478 --> 01:36:43,518
I'm only saying this now, but I pretended like I was struggling.

2413
01:36:44,218 --> 01:36:45,988
I think I just wanted to observe...

2414
01:36:45,989 --> 01:36:48,188
how these people get through this dance.

2415
01:36:48,789 --> 01:36:50,959
I think I calculated...

2416
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:54,329
what other people couldn't do or parts that I thought...

2417
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,459
I could show off more.

2418
01:36:56,558 --> 01:36:59,398
I practiced as I watched how the others were dancing.

2419
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:01,597
The pirouette is going the other way.

2420
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:04,169
- It's so hard to balance. - Oh, this...

2421
01:37:04,839 --> 01:37:05,839
(Meanwhile, the dancers are struggling with the pirouette.)

2422
01:37:05,839 --> 01:37:06,839
Oh, wait.

2423
01:37:07,638 --> 01:37:09,808
(They all practice the pirouette together.)

2424
01:37:13,209 --> 01:37:14,408
(This technique makes them groan automatically.)

2425
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:15,419
It's hard.

2426
01:37:15,978 --> 01:37:18,148
Gosh, the pirouette is the biggest hurdle.

2427
01:37:19,188 --> 01:37:21,358
- Since we're in a rush, - Right.

2428
01:37:21,659 --> 01:37:23,018
I end up spinning haphazardly.

2429
01:37:23,489 --> 01:37:25,488
I'm just spinning on my whole foot.

2430
01:37:25,489 --> 01:37:27,058
Of course. I do that too.

2431
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:28,758
We're Korean dancers.

2432
01:37:29,459 --> 01:37:30,597
It was pretty hard.

2433
01:37:30,598 --> 01:37:33,498
"How can I pull off a pirouette..."

2434
01:37:33,499 --> 01:37:36,669
"in a short amount of time?" That was what I was thinking about.

2435
01:37:37,339 --> 01:37:39,138
After the practice session was over,

2436
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:40,838
we each took turns to perform.

2437
01:37:40,839 --> 01:37:43,808
(Choi Ho Jong performed the dance first.)

2438
01:37:43,938 --> 01:37:44,948
Goodness.

2439
01:37:44,949 --> 01:37:45,949
(Focused)

2440
01:37:46,508 --> 01:37:47,808
This is the thought I had.

2441
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:51,017
"Is he going easy now so he can do better later?"

2442
01:37:51,018 --> 01:37:52,549
I honestly had that thought.

2443
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:55,588
Honestly, in this audition piece,

2444
01:37:55,589 --> 01:37:57,919
I'd stand out more even if they try to beat me.

2445
01:37:58,459 --> 01:38:01,598
(Next, Ryu Tae Young performs the dance.)

2446
01:38:01,999 --> 01:38:03,058
(What?)

2447
01:38:06,499 --> 01:38:09,138
(Ryu Tae Young stops dancing midway as he doesn't know it yet.)

2448
01:38:09,299 --> 01:38:10,299
I'm sorry.

2449
01:38:12,138 --> 01:38:14,739
If we dance together, I would stand out.

2450
01:38:15,709 --> 01:38:17,709
With Ryu Tae Young,

2451
01:38:17,808 --> 01:38:19,709
I observed him the whole time during practice.

2452
01:38:20,108 --> 01:38:21,209
If I have him stand behind me,

2453
01:38:21,749 --> 01:38:24,218
and I dance with a different vibe,

2454
01:38:24,478 --> 01:38:26,619
I could stand out.

2455
01:38:27,749 --> 01:38:29,089
I'm in big trouble.

2456
01:38:30,789 --> 01:38:32,159
(Slinking down)

2457
01:38:32,258 --> 01:38:35,098
I made a mistake, and I showed them that I wasn't doing well.

2458
01:38:35,358 --> 01:38:37,629
If I get called as a sub lead dancer several times,

2459
01:38:38,068 --> 01:38:40,068
I should try to beat the main lead dancer.

2460
01:38:40,928 --> 01:38:43,369
(Kim Yu Chan performs the dance next.)

2461
01:38:44,438 --> 01:38:45,438
(Wary of him)

2462
01:38:46,938 --> 01:38:47,967
(Impressed)

2463
01:38:47,968 --> 01:38:49,608
- Goodness. - Nice.

2464
01:38:49,839 --> 01:38:51,978
It was very neat and stable.

2465
01:38:52,178 --> 01:38:53,178
I think it was good.

2466
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:56,249
I didn't feel anxious as I watched you.

2467
01:38:56,648 --> 01:39:00,249
I thought he danced with a similar vibe as me.

2468
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,918
I should choose three people who I think...

2469
01:39:03,919 --> 01:39:07,028
will be a good fit with me. And then, I should...

2470
01:39:07,029 --> 01:39:10,459
outshine them during the audition.

2471
01:39:10,699 --> 01:39:13,699
I should choose people different from me and those I can easily beat.

2472
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:16,538
Let's put people who are good at each genre...

2473
01:39:16,539 --> 01:39:18,709
on either side of me.

2474
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:22,308
I thought I wouldn't perform with people who might outshine me.

2475
01:39:23,108 --> 01:39:24,608
The person I had in mind...

2476
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:26,607
The sub lead dancers I chose...

2477
01:39:26,608 --> 01:39:28,848
My first sub lead dancer candidate is...

2478
01:39:29,318 --> 01:39:31,488
The dancer I had in mind...

2479
01:39:31,489 --> 01:39:33,789
for the first candidate in the sub lead role is...

2480
01:39:34,489 --> 01:39:38,159
The first dancer in the Main Lead Role Casting Audition is...

2481
01:39:38,589 --> 01:39:41,699
Kim Hyun Ho.

2482
01:39:42,529 --> 01:39:44,258
- Yes! - Go!

2483
01:39:44,499 --> 01:39:46,199
(Here comes the tiger.)

2484
01:39:46,568 --> 01:39:47,568
Do-rag Man!

2485
01:39:48,369 --> 01:39:51,567
The first dancer I had in mind as the candidate...

2486
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:53,839
for the sub lead role is...

2487
01:39:54,438 --> 01:39:56,608
- Is it me? - Who is it?

2488
01:39:57,508 --> 01:39:58,779
The first dancer is...

2489
01:39:59,108 --> 01:40:01,079
Choi Ho Jong.

2490
01:40:01,749 --> 01:40:05,489
(Sub lead dancer 1, Choi Ho Jong)

2491
01:40:05,789 --> 01:40:07,018
(The crowd is mumbling.)

2492
01:40:07,489 --> 01:40:10,358
- Choi Ho Jong as a sub dancer? - It won't be easy.

2493
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:13,728
This isn't a picture you can see every day.

2494
01:40:13,928 --> 01:40:17,097
I think he had me wrong as he chose me.

2495
01:40:17,098 --> 01:40:19,029
I think he will regret his choice time and time again.

2496
01:40:19,669 --> 01:40:21,398
My second candidate for the sub lead role is...

2497
01:40:22,169 --> 01:40:23,738
Yun Hyeok Jung.

2498
01:40:23,739 --> 01:40:25,808
(Sub lead dancer 2, Yun Hyeok Jung)

2499
01:40:25,968 --> 01:40:26,968
(This will be so fun!)

2500
01:40:26,969 --> 01:40:28,209
(Contemporary dance family feud from the get-go)

2501
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:30,137
I think Hyun Ho and I...

2502
01:40:30,138 --> 01:40:32,348
have opposite styles of dancing.

2503
01:40:32,549 --> 01:40:35,317
So, I may be behind him, but I could stand out more.

2504
01:40:35,318 --> 01:40:37,249
This could be an opportunity for me.

2505
01:40:37,348 --> 01:40:39,518
My third candidate for the sub lead role is...

2506
01:40:39,718 --> 01:40:41,818
Jung Sung Wook.

2507
01:40:42,718 --> 01:40:43,959
(Highly expectant)

2508
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:46,428
- They're all from different genres. - I know.

2509
01:40:46,589 --> 01:40:48,428
He made an interesting choice.

2510
01:40:49,299 --> 01:40:51,529
- He really might get overwhelmed. - I know.

2511
01:40:51,699 --> 01:40:54,567
Hyun Ho is a man's man, for sure.

2512
01:40:54,568 --> 01:40:55,938
You were supposed to choose sub lead dancers...

2513
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:58,038
who could make you shine.

2514
01:40:58,039 --> 01:41:00,839
I'm wondering what your interpretation was...

2515
01:41:01,239 --> 01:41:02,709
of who could make you shine.

2516
01:41:03,008 --> 01:41:06,148
I thought I wouldn't be beaten even if I chose these guys.

2517
01:41:06,249 --> 01:41:07,307
Yes, man!

2518
01:41:07,308 --> 01:41:08,648
(Strong cheers)

2519
01:41:09,419 --> 01:41:10,478
It's another family's feud.

2520
01:41:10,919 --> 01:41:12,289
My strategy was to...

2521
01:41:12,388 --> 01:41:15,089
put people who are good at each genre behind me.

2522
01:41:15,188 --> 01:41:16,988
First of all, after my turn,

2523
01:41:16,989 --> 01:41:18,857
I really focused on observing people.

2524
01:41:18,858 --> 01:41:21,857
I watched Ho Jong's hand movements a lot.

2525
01:41:21,858 --> 01:41:25,298
And Hyeok Jung had great details in creating beautiful lines.

2526
01:41:25,299 --> 01:41:28,968
And I watched how ballerinos did their pirouettes.

2527
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,369
And my strong point is...

2528
01:41:31,468 --> 01:41:34,268
my intense energy. I should bring out my inner tiger.

2529
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:36,678
I'll dominate the First Class with my energy.

2530
01:41:37,379 --> 01:41:39,608
I thought of it as attributes.

2531
01:41:39,808 --> 01:41:41,348
(Attributes, all of a sudden?)

2532
01:41:41,619 --> 01:41:43,449
First of all, my attribute is fire.

2533
01:41:43,549 --> 01:41:45,148
(Like Pokemon types? Bursting into laughter)

2534
01:41:45,449 --> 01:41:46,848
He's the ground type.

2535
01:41:47,848 --> 01:41:50,159
And these guys are water and wind.

2536
01:41:50,318 --> 01:41:52,187
- Blow wind, blow! - Wind Jung Sung Wook!

2537
01:41:52,188 --> 01:41:53,357
(Wind Sung Wook seems rather embarrassed.)

2538
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:54,388
Wind Sung Wook.

2539
01:41:55,858 --> 01:41:59,067
When I breathe, I will bring Ho Jong's energy.

2540
01:41:59,068 --> 01:42:01,868
I will bring Hyeok Jung's energy for contemporary dance.

2541
01:42:01,869 --> 01:42:05,239
And I wanted to bring Sung Wook's energy when doing ballet.

2542
01:42:05,339 --> 01:42:06,637
That was why I chose these guys.

2543
01:42:06,638 --> 01:42:09,039
(Fire Hyun Ho's ambition to burn strongly with the energy he absorbs)

2544
01:42:09,678 --> 01:42:11,209
- I like it. Fire type. - I know.

2545
01:42:11,409 --> 01:42:13,508
I had no intention of being the ground type.

2546
01:42:13,709 --> 01:42:16,549
The wind, water, and ground will come after me now.

2547
01:42:16,848 --> 01:42:19,748
We'll now begin the Casting Audition.

2548
01:42:19,749 --> 01:42:20,949
First positions.

2549
01:42:21,348 --> 01:42:22,488
I feel confident.

2550
01:42:22,489 --> 01:42:25,289
This went beyond confidence. He was rather reckless.

2551
01:42:25,489 --> 01:42:28,299
He made a mistake by selecting me.

2552
01:42:28,799 --> 01:42:31,358
Music, start.

2553
01:42:31,499 --> 01:42:35,168
(Will Kim Hyun Ho's strategy work?)

2554
01:42:35,169 --> 01:42:36,169
Go.

2555
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:37,299
(Glaring)

2556
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:43,709
(Nice start!)

2557
01:42:44,438 --> 01:42:48,448
(Sub lead roles begin the choreography in their ways.)

2558
01:42:48,449 --> 01:42:49,879
(They're all very good.)

2559
01:42:52,018 --> 01:42:53,589
Ho Jong is amazing.

2560
01:42:54,449 --> 01:42:55,589
Nice.

2561
01:42:57,589 --> 01:42:59,857
(Kim Hyun Ho fights with his intense energy.)

2562
01:42:59,858 --> 01:43:00,958
(Tilting)

2563
01:43:00,959 --> 01:43:04,258
(4 people presented their own movements.)

2564
01:43:08,129 --> 01:43:09,239
(Glaring)

2565
01:43:09,468 --> 01:43:10,998
(Thinking)

2566
01:43:10,999 --> 01:43:12,008
(Averting)

2567
01:43:12,608 --> 01:43:13,967
(Jung Sung Wook uses the line to draw attention.)

2568
01:43:13,968 --> 01:43:14,978
That's cool.

2569
01:43:16,938 --> 01:43:17,977
(The master of detailed gesture)

2570
01:43:17,978 --> 01:43:19,348
(Exclaiming)

2571
01:43:20,449 --> 01:43:23,748
(Yun Hyeok Jung with high jumps)

2572
01:43:23,749 --> 01:43:25,619
(Surprised)

2573
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:30,159
(Main Lead Role Candidate Kim Hyun Ho's Casting Audition ends.)

2574
01:43:30,489 --> 01:43:32,289
(She can't hide the regrets.)

2575
01:43:32,358 --> 01:43:33,629
He chose wrong.

2576
01:43:33,989 --> 01:43:36,129
- Ho Jong keeps stealing attention. - Yes.

2577
01:43:36,529 --> 01:43:37,798
Ho Jong's good.

2578
01:43:37,799 --> 01:43:39,869
The ballerino was amazing.

2579
01:43:40,829 --> 01:43:41,937
Who do you choose?

2580
01:43:41,938 --> 01:43:43,398
The contemporary dancer in the back.

2581
01:43:45,308 --> 01:43:47,438
(Kim Hyun Ho didn't stand out on stage.)

2582
01:43:47,468 --> 01:43:49,208
I have a question for you.

2583
01:43:49,209 --> 01:43:52,308
What do you think your strongest qualities are?

2584
01:43:53,049 --> 01:43:56,818
I think it's my strong power.

2585
01:43:57,449 --> 01:44:00,317
It's interesting because I think the selection of dancers...

2586
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:02,817
that you have chosen...

2587
01:44:02,818 --> 01:44:04,817
But you added a bit of disadvantage...

2588
01:44:04,818 --> 01:44:06,958
because you blended technically...

2589
01:44:06,959 --> 01:44:08,629
and in movement quality wise.

2590
01:44:08,898 --> 01:44:10,029
It's miscast.

2591
01:44:10,258 --> 01:44:12,028
You said you were going to receive energy...

2592
01:44:12,029 --> 01:44:13,728
from other elements.

2593
01:44:14,228 --> 01:44:17,437
But all I remember is your eyes looking forward...

2594
01:44:17,438 --> 01:44:21,238
as if you were going to eat up the judges...

2595
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:23,178
while dancing.

2596
01:44:23,608 --> 01:44:26,448
Honestly, it didn't feel like...

2597
01:44:26,449 --> 01:44:29,018
you were receiving energy from them.

2598
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:31,049
There are only criticisms.

2599
01:44:31,478 --> 01:44:33,449
Thank you for your work, everyone.

2600
01:44:33,949 --> 01:44:35,817
(Kim Hyun Ho's performance only received regrettable criticisms.)

2601
01:44:35,818 --> 01:44:37,857
(Kim Hyun Ho's face is stiffened by harsh feedback.)

2602
01:44:37,858 --> 01:44:39,129
(Exchanging looks)

2603
01:44:39,228 --> 01:44:40,228
Good job.

2604
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:41,927
You placed first in my heart.

2605
01:44:41,928 --> 01:44:43,199
(Young Woong the tough guy makes him feel better.)

2606
01:44:43,329 --> 01:44:46,428
We'll now begin Ryu Tae Young's Casting Audition.

2607
01:44:46,869 --> 01:44:48,437
- Good luck. - You can do it.

2608
01:44:48,438 --> 01:44:49,438
(Nice legs)

2609
01:44:49,539 --> 01:44:50,539
Look at his legs.

2610
01:44:51,098 --> 01:44:52,209
Oh, my gosh.

2611
01:44:53,138 --> 01:44:54,709
They're long.

2612
01:44:54,869 --> 01:44:57,039
His waist is there just to be polite.

2613
01:44:57,339 --> 01:44:58,549
(Laughing)

2614
01:44:58,579 --> 01:45:00,749
Look at how tall he is. He's so pale.

2615
01:45:00,978 --> 01:45:03,418
Ryu Tae Young,

2616
01:45:03,419 --> 01:45:05,618
say three sub lead roles who will make you shine in your opinion...

2617
01:45:05,619 --> 01:45:07,518
with their position numbers.

2618
01:45:07,549 --> 01:45:10,358
Will they make him shine or shine together?

2619
01:45:12,029 --> 01:45:14,258
Or only others will shine alone without him?

2620
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:17,458
The first sub lead role candidate is...

2621
01:45:17,459 --> 01:45:18,869
Yun Hyeok Jung.

2622
01:45:20,699 --> 01:45:23,298
The second sub lead role candidate is Kim Yu Chan.

2623
01:45:23,299 --> 01:45:25,968
The third candidate is Kim Jong Cheol.

2624
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:28,508
- Let's go. - Show him, Jong Cheol.

2625
01:45:29,008 --> 01:45:30,108
This is fun.

2626
01:45:30,608 --> 01:45:32,449
Another trio.

2627
01:45:32,608 --> 01:45:34,007
He has broad shoulders.

2628
01:45:34,008 --> 01:45:35,717
He has bombs in his shoulders.

2629
01:45:35,718 --> 01:45:38,517
He loves Hyeok Jung so much after the Dance Film.

2630
01:45:38,518 --> 01:45:39,919
(Cheerful)

2631
01:45:40,148 --> 01:45:41,958
Since the mission was told,

2632
01:45:41,959 --> 01:45:45,228
I had Hyeok Jung in my mind.

2633
01:45:45,258 --> 01:45:46,688
When we were working on the Dance Film,

2634
01:45:46,789 --> 01:45:48,289
I was better than him.

2635
01:45:48,558 --> 01:45:50,258
(Yun Hyeok Jung and Ryu Tae Young worked as main supporting roles.)

2636
01:45:50,459 --> 01:45:51,558
(Was that Tae Young?)

2637
01:45:52,299 --> 01:45:55,739
(Ryu Tae Young stood out more than Yun Hyeok Jung.)

2638
01:45:56,968 --> 01:46:00,307
Hyeok Jung has very strong energy,

2639
01:46:00,308 --> 01:46:02,538
but I'm just as energetic...

2640
01:46:02,539 --> 01:46:04,709
when I show my energy.

2641
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:06,278
(For the other two candidates, )

2642
01:46:06,279 --> 01:46:07,307
(he chooses Kim Jong Cheol...)

2643
01:46:07,308 --> 01:46:08,879
(and Kim Yu Chan.)

2644
01:46:08,978 --> 01:46:10,618
I chose...

2645
01:46:10,619 --> 01:46:13,448
people with the similar energy for the other two.

2646
01:46:13,449 --> 01:46:15,257
"I'll show more of my energy..."

2647
01:46:15,258 --> 01:46:17,458
"to stand out in the audition."

2648
01:46:17,459 --> 01:46:18,489
That was my goal.

2649
01:46:18,688 --> 01:46:21,588
(Monitoring their practice)

2650
01:46:21,589 --> 01:46:24,357
When I practiced with the three,

2651
01:46:24,358 --> 01:46:26,329
I thought it'd be okay for the audition.

2652
01:46:26,829 --> 01:46:28,098
I'll be able to pull it off.

2653
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:30,839
I'll have to stand out among the four.

2654
01:46:32,339 --> 01:46:33,409
Why did he do that?

2655
01:46:33,709 --> 01:46:34,839
He doesn't know what he's doing.

2656
01:46:35,409 --> 01:46:37,879
It was his mistake for keeping me next to him.

2657
01:46:37,938 --> 01:46:40,678
I can't help but stand out in this.

2658
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:43,478
First position.

2659
01:46:44,249 --> 01:46:46,289
Music, start.

2660
01:46:46,789 --> 01:46:47,988
(Concentrating)

2661
01:46:47,989 --> 01:46:50,458
(Will Ryu Tae Young's strategy work?)

2662
01:46:50,459 --> 01:46:51,459
Go.

2663
01:47:04,268 --> 01:47:05,268
(Exclaiming)

2664
01:47:07,638 --> 01:47:08,678
That was neat.

2665
01:47:09,638 --> 01:47:10,909
Hyeok Jung stands out so much.

2666
01:47:16,518 --> 01:47:17,619
They're good.

2667
01:47:26,329 --> 01:47:28,628
(Main lead role candidate Ryu Tae Young's Casting Audition ends.)

2668
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:29,928
(Applauding)

2669
01:47:30,829 --> 01:47:32,598
I see Tae Young.

2670
01:47:32,669 --> 01:47:33,768
Really?

2671
01:47:33,799 --> 01:47:35,898
Hyeok Jung was amazing on the side.

2672
01:47:38,468 --> 01:47:41,138
While watching it, I found something regrettable.

2673
01:47:41,239 --> 01:47:42,239
When it began,

2674
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,778
the person in the center was the center of the movement.

2675
01:47:44,779 --> 01:47:47,278
So while I was watching you,

2676
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:49,317
the moment I saw your right,

2677
01:47:49,318 --> 01:47:52,048
I couldn't take my eyes off...

2678
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:55,017
of Yun Hyeok Jung's turn and techniques.

2679
01:47:55,018 --> 01:47:57,958
Among the four of you,

2680
01:47:57,959 --> 01:48:01,687
Hyeok Jung had the highest quality and accuracy.

2681
01:48:01,688 --> 01:48:05,467
It was your mistake to place him there.

2682
01:48:05,468 --> 01:48:06,468
(Nodding in regret)

2683
01:48:06,469 --> 01:48:08,299
Was I wrong about my decision?

2684
01:48:08,869 --> 01:48:11,268
I thought I had a chance to win.

2685
01:48:11,499 --> 01:48:14,607
But even if I was given a second chance,

2686
01:48:14,608 --> 01:48:16,339
I'd pick Hyeok Jung again.

2687
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:21,449
Next. Yun Hyeok Jung.

2688
01:48:21,549 --> 01:48:23,178
Please get ready for the audition.

2689
01:48:24,379 --> 01:48:26,789
- Three times in a row. - How's he going to do it?

2690
01:48:27,249 --> 01:48:29,357
(Yun Hyeok Jung's turn after joining...)

2691
01:48:29,358 --> 01:48:31,659
(Kim Hyun Ho and Ryu Tae Young's auditions.)

2692
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:33,427
It won't be easy to dance three times in a row.

2693
01:48:33,428 --> 01:48:35,228
Hyeok Jung's arms are pumped up.

2694
01:48:35,699 --> 01:48:37,357
Yun Hyeok Jung,

2695
01:48:37,358 --> 01:48:40,198
say three sub lead roles who will make you shine...

2696
01:48:40,199 --> 01:48:41,529
in your opinion.

2697
01:48:42,039 --> 01:48:45,199
No matter what, I'm taking the main lead role this time.

2698
01:48:45,268 --> 01:48:47,268
That's why I selected them.

2699
01:48:47,808 --> 01:48:50,608
The sub lead role candidate is Kim Jong Cheol.

2700
01:48:51,949 --> 01:48:52,949
Again?

2701
01:48:53,348 --> 01:48:54,478
Jong Cheol again.

2702
01:48:54,808 --> 01:48:55,949
Is he good?

2703
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:59,418
He looked weak.

2704
01:48:59,419 --> 01:49:01,449
I thought I'd stand out.

2705
01:49:01,518 --> 01:49:04,518
The sub lead role candidate is Ryu Tae Young.

2706
01:49:04,888 --> 01:49:08,258
(Ryu Tae Young was criticized after comparing to Yun Hyeok Jung.)

2707
01:49:08,489 --> 01:49:10,058
He'll be perfect next to me.

2708
01:49:10,558 --> 01:49:13,699
I became a sub lead role because I lacked.

2709
01:49:13,728 --> 01:49:15,268
I was upset at myself.

2710
01:49:15,638 --> 01:49:17,699
I should do my best to improve.

2711
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,637
And the sub lead role candidate...

2712
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:21,808
(Who is Yun Hyeok Jung's last sub lead role?)

2713
01:49:22,178 --> 01:49:23,978
is Choi Ho Jong.

2714
01:49:24,909 --> 01:49:26,449
(Confident)

2715
01:49:27,508 --> 01:49:28,718
(Eyes focused)

2716
01:49:30,949 --> 01:49:31,949
He's confident.

2717
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:34,647
The way he dances is different from mine.

2718
01:49:34,648 --> 01:49:38,089
In terms of the fixed choreography, I'd do better.

2719
01:49:38,258 --> 01:49:41,488
(During the fixed choreography self-evaluation)

2720
01:49:41,489 --> 01:49:42,998
(Contemplating)

2721
01:49:42,999 --> 01:49:45,698
If you give off your energy more,

2722
01:49:45,699 --> 01:49:46,928
you'd stand out even more.

2723
01:49:47,029 --> 01:49:50,999
I got the feeling that you were hiding your breathing.

2724
01:49:51,068 --> 01:49:54,108
You should've done something to change people's attention...

2725
01:49:54,608 --> 01:49:56,878
I decided...

2726
01:49:56,879 --> 01:49:59,778
not to show all my strategy.

2727
01:49:59,779 --> 01:50:02,049
I forgot the order.

2728
01:50:03,249 --> 01:50:06,488
Why waste my energy there?

2729
01:50:06,489 --> 01:50:08,887
Even if more people choose me for that reason,

2730
01:50:08,888 --> 01:50:10,688
I feel confident in outdoing them.

2731
01:50:12,789 --> 01:50:14,888
I have a good chance of winning.

2732
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:18,659
He didn't know me better than choosing me.

2733
01:50:18,768 --> 01:50:20,768
I should teach him a lesson.

2734
01:50:22,098 --> 01:50:24,339
Music, start.

2735
01:50:25,539 --> 01:50:27,568
(How's Yun Hyeok Jung's audition?)

2736
01:50:33,108 --> 01:50:34,108
(Eyes open wide)

2737
01:50:40,489 --> 01:50:42,757
His line is crazy. Nice line.

2738
01:50:42,758 --> 01:50:43,789
(Nice line)

2739
01:50:47,329 --> 01:50:49,029
(Neat)

2740
01:50:53,999 --> 01:50:56,098
Ho Jong and Hyeok Jung are very neat.

2741
01:50:58,068 --> 01:50:59,169
Hyeok Jung is awesome.

2742
01:51:00,808 --> 01:51:01,808
Nice.

2743
01:51:02,909 --> 01:51:03,938
(Nice)

2744
01:51:04,779 --> 01:51:05,978
Hyeok Jung is amazing.

2745
01:51:06,108 --> 01:51:07,108
Nice.

2746
01:51:07,608 --> 01:51:08,648
That was wonderful.

2747
01:51:08,949 --> 01:51:10,078
Hyeok Jung has unique energy.

2748
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:11,779
He has a nice line.

2749
01:51:12,089 --> 01:51:13,749
He picked the right sub roles.

2750
01:51:14,148 --> 01:51:15,958
Yun Hyeok Jung, you've made...

2751
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:20,058
a clever choice of selecting main sub roles.

2752
01:51:21,459 --> 01:51:23,658
The line of your dance or your energy...

2753
01:51:23,659 --> 01:51:25,927
stretching out to the end of your fingers and toes...

2754
01:51:25,928 --> 01:51:29,038
clearly stood out...

2755
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:30,498
more than the three people in the back.

2756
01:51:30,499 --> 01:51:31,799
- Right. - He stood out.

2757
01:51:32,739 --> 01:51:35,169
You had a lot of strong eye focus.

2758
01:51:36,008 --> 01:51:37,008
(Intense)

2759
01:51:37,008 --> 01:51:38,008
(Like)

2760
01:51:38,209 --> 01:51:39,848
So, well done.

2761
01:51:40,209 --> 01:51:42,318
- Thank you. - Way to go.

2762
01:51:44,848 --> 01:51:46,388
All I saw was Hyeok Jung.

2763
01:51:46,419 --> 01:51:48,918
How can he not stand out when he has a good build?

2764
01:51:48,919 --> 01:51:49,959
That's true.

2765
01:51:50,388 --> 01:51:52,018
Isn't that enough...

2766
01:51:52,589 --> 01:51:53,858
to get me the main lead role?

2767
01:51:54,388 --> 01:51:55,427
I think I got it.

2768
01:51:55,428 --> 01:51:57,499
Kim Hyo Joon.

2769
01:51:57,928 --> 01:51:59,767
Please get ready for the audition.

2770
01:51:59,768 --> 01:52:01,868
- Kim Hyo Joon, - Show them what you've got.

2771
01:52:01,869 --> 01:52:04,567
Say three sub lead roles who will make you shine...

2772
01:52:04,568 --> 01:52:05,938
in your opinion.

2773
01:52:06,339 --> 01:52:09,579
The first sub lead role candidate is...

2774
01:52:10,108 --> 01:52:11,808
Kim Jong Cheol.

2775
01:52:12,579 --> 01:52:16,818
The second candidate is Ryu Tae Young.

2776
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:20,888
The third sub lead role candidate is Choi Ho Jong.

2777
01:52:22,119 --> 01:52:23,788
(It'll be fun to watch this combination.)

2778
01:52:23,789 --> 01:52:25,018
He called Ho Jong?

2779
01:52:25,188 --> 01:52:26,358
It's the family match.

2780
01:52:26,959 --> 01:52:28,258
Right. It's the family match.

2781
01:52:28,529 --> 01:52:31,628
I must choose Ho Jong and Jong Cheol.

2782
01:52:31,629 --> 01:52:33,598
We have the same dance style, and they're good,

2783
01:52:33,799 --> 01:52:36,898
but I feel confident to stand out among them.

2784
01:52:37,068 --> 01:52:39,307
(When the main lead role audition choreography was revealed)

2785
01:52:39,308 --> 01:52:41,807
When I watched the choreography,

2786
01:52:41,808 --> 01:52:43,379
there was no move I didn't feel confident about.

2787
01:52:44,308 --> 01:52:45,779
(From the liberal movements of the Contemporary Dance, )

2788
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:47,749
(pirouette in ballet, )

2789
01:52:48,608 --> 01:52:50,217
(and jaban in Korean Dance, he mastered them all.)

2790
01:52:50,218 --> 01:52:51,548
(Unbelievable)

2791
01:52:51,549 --> 01:52:53,048
(Confident)

2792
01:52:53,049 --> 01:52:55,558
So I plan to have good dancers in the back.

2793
01:52:56,388 --> 01:52:58,928
If I dance in front with good dancers in the back,

2794
01:52:59,058 --> 01:53:02,029
it'll look the best.

2795
01:53:02,228 --> 01:53:06,728
But what if Ho Jong and Jong Cheol do anything that stands out?

2796
01:53:06,869 --> 01:53:07,999
I wouldn't like that.

2797
01:53:08,228 --> 01:53:10,767
So when I placed them,

2798
01:53:10,768 --> 01:53:14,637
I placed Jong Cheol to cover his energetic move,

2799
01:53:14,638 --> 01:53:18,278
and Ho Jong to cover his good move.

2800
01:53:18,279 --> 01:53:21,308
I thought about how to hide them even more.

2801
01:53:21,608 --> 01:53:22,749
Good luck, Hyo Joon.

2802
01:53:22,848 --> 01:53:24,549
- Good luck. - You got this.

2803
01:53:25,518 --> 01:53:26,518
First position.

2804
01:53:28,818 --> 01:53:31,218
Music, start.

2805
01:53:31,518 --> 01:53:33,788
I feel confident about winning.

2806
01:53:33,789 --> 01:53:34,858
Because I'm competent.

2807
01:53:35,489 --> 01:53:36,959
Five, four,

2808
01:53:37,499 --> 01:53:39,898
three, two, one.

2809
01:53:40,598 --> 01:53:41,598
Go.

2810
01:53:45,268 --> 01:53:47,437
(Presenting chaines as they move diagonally)

2811
01:53:47,438 --> 01:53:48,438
Good job.

2812
01:53:49,539 --> 01:53:52,308
Place Jong Cheol to cover his good move.

2813
01:53:53,579 --> 01:53:54,579
(Swing)

2814
01:53:54,949 --> 01:53:55,949
(Followed by neat and accurate technique)

2815
01:53:56,978 --> 01:53:57,978
Very good.

2816
01:53:58,178 --> 01:53:59,289
(Exclaiming)

2817
01:54:00,848 --> 01:54:02,458
(Kim Hyo Joon moves half a beat faster.)

2818
01:54:02,459 --> 01:54:03,989
(Exclaiming)

2819
01:54:05,058 --> 01:54:06,658
(He uses the beat longer to stand out.)

2820
01:54:06,659 --> 01:54:10,199
Place Ho Jong to cover his good move.

2821
01:54:10,858 --> 01:54:11,898
Nice.

2822
01:54:12,869 --> 01:54:14,368
(Jaban finale)

2823
01:54:14,369 --> 01:54:16,699
(Exclaiming)

2824
01:54:18,199 --> 01:54:19,908
(Perfect ending)

2825
01:54:19,909 --> 01:54:21,107
(Main lead role candidate Kim Hyo Joon's Casting Audition ends.)

2826
01:54:21,108 --> 01:54:22,709
Hyo Joon's jump was amazing.

2827
01:54:23,508 --> 01:54:25,278
How can they jump all at the same time?

2828
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:26,848
- I know. - That was insane.

2829
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:28,607
He's always been good at jaban.

2830
01:54:28,608 --> 01:54:30,147
They did it the way I wanted it to be...

2831
01:54:30,148 --> 01:54:32,789
in the beginning.

2832
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:34,548
Really? The way the choreographer wanted it to be?

2833
01:54:34,549 --> 01:54:35,988
That means they were very good.

2834
01:54:35,989 --> 01:54:38,718
Kim Hyo Joon, I was impressed.

2835
01:54:38,818 --> 01:54:39,828
(Exclaiming)

2836
01:54:39,829 --> 01:54:41,057
You presented...

2837
01:54:41,058 --> 01:54:44,328
what I expected from a Korean dancer...

2838
01:54:44,329 --> 01:54:47,498
in the beginning.

2839
01:54:47,499 --> 01:54:48,967
And you were smart enough...

2840
01:54:48,968 --> 01:54:53,208
to place the dancers from the same genre.

2841
01:54:53,209 --> 01:54:55,169
It made you stand out even more.

2842
01:54:55,209 --> 01:54:56,209
Thank you.

2843
01:54:56,608 --> 01:55:00,808
Kim Hyo Joon was the only one who used the beat differently.

2844
01:55:00,949 --> 01:55:02,078
Was it intended?

2845
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:03,147
(Use the beat differently?)

2846
01:55:03,148 --> 01:55:06,119
I knew people on each side were on accurate beat.

2847
01:55:06,318 --> 01:55:10,119
I decided to make use of the parts that I could extend.

2848
01:55:10,558 --> 01:55:13,427
(Kim Hyo Joon used the beat longer than others.)

2849
01:55:13,428 --> 01:55:15,629
(He also dragged the last move.)

2850
01:55:15,858 --> 01:55:17,257
Since I was the main lead role,

2851
01:55:17,258 --> 01:55:19,199
I should show my face more.

2852
01:55:19,428 --> 01:55:20,467
(Exclaiming)

2853
01:55:20,468 --> 01:55:22,498
You were smart enough to extend the beat...

2854
01:55:22,499 --> 01:55:24,999
with three people in the back.

2855
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,607
Your performance was very unexpected.

2856
01:55:27,608 --> 01:55:29,538
What I really enjoyed about you...

2857
01:55:29,539 --> 01:55:32,647
is that you had technicality like a contemporary dancer,

2858
01:55:32,648 --> 01:55:33,977
but you had a refinement...

2859
01:55:33,978 --> 01:55:37,678
and calm sophistication like a ballet dancer.

2860
01:55:37,879 --> 01:55:41,148
But you had the energy of a Korean traditional dancer.

2861
01:55:41,489 --> 01:55:43,518
- What a compliment. - He had all three elements.

2862
01:55:43,789 --> 01:55:48,258
You were encompassing all these different genres naturally.

2863
01:55:48,688 --> 01:55:52,159
So, well done. Very well done.

2864
01:55:52,699 --> 01:55:53,727
Thank you.

2865
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,767
(Bowing)

2866
01:55:54,768 --> 01:55:58,339
It felt like I was approved. It felt great.

2867
01:55:58,768 --> 01:56:01,267
Kim Yu Chan, please get ready.

2868
01:56:01,268 --> 01:56:03,007
- Go, Kim Yu Chan. - Good luck.

2869
01:56:03,008 --> 01:56:04,079
Kim Yu Chan!

2870
01:56:04,638 --> 01:56:06,909
- I'm counting on you. - The first sub lead role is...

2871
01:56:07,379 --> 01:56:10,418
Kim Hyo Joon.

2872
01:56:10,419 --> 01:56:11,419
(Rushing)

2873
01:56:13,449 --> 01:56:14,518
Next is...

2874
01:56:15,289 --> 01:56:16,818
Ryu Tae Young.

2875
01:56:17,459 --> 01:56:19,089
- Good luck. - You can do it.

2876
01:56:19,829 --> 01:56:21,029
They're placing each other in the back.

2877
01:56:23,058 --> 01:56:27,698
(Ryu Tae Young picked Kim Yu Chan for the sub supporting role.)

2878
01:56:27,699 --> 01:56:32,438
(Kim Yu Chan)

2879
01:56:32,608 --> 01:56:33,807
(Despite your tall height, )

2880
01:56:33,808 --> 01:56:36,378
(Kim Yu Chan drew my attention more.)

2881
01:56:36,379 --> 01:56:38,578
(Ryu Tae Young had criticism in front of Kim Yu Chan.)

2882
01:56:38,579 --> 01:56:40,647
(And he's given a second chance.)

2883
01:56:40,648 --> 01:56:42,918
I can beat him in the back.

2884
01:56:42,919 --> 01:56:44,678
I'll have to prove myself.

2885
01:56:45,148 --> 01:56:47,018
The third sub lead role is...

2886
01:56:47,619 --> 01:56:49,588
Kim Hyun Ho.

2887
01:56:49,589 --> 01:56:50,918
- Me? - Good luck.

2888
01:56:50,919 --> 01:56:52,188
(Sub lead role 3 is Kim Hyun Ho.)

2889
01:56:52,888 --> 01:56:55,228
- It's a strange combination. - Very strange.

2890
01:56:55,358 --> 01:56:57,028
This is unexpected.

2891
01:56:57,029 --> 01:56:58,499
He's the opposite of Yu Chan.

2892
01:56:58,758 --> 01:57:00,669
- He's very smart. - I know.

2893
01:57:00,928 --> 01:57:02,738
Kim Yu Chan, why did you choose...

2894
01:57:02,739 --> 01:57:06,339
these three people for your sub lead roles?

2895
01:57:06,938 --> 01:57:09,278
I believe these three people...

2896
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:12,709
are unique in their own ways.

2897
01:57:13,049 --> 01:57:17,378
I believe I have what they have.

2898
01:57:17,379 --> 01:57:18,518
(What makes him so confident?)

2899
01:57:19,348 --> 01:57:20,388
Go, Kim Yu Chan.

2900
01:57:21,188 --> 01:57:22,188
So intense.

2901
01:57:22,189 --> 01:57:23,289
- Good one. - Okay.

2902
01:57:23,619 --> 01:57:24,688
So cool.

2903
01:57:25,058 --> 01:57:26,928
- Is that true? - Yes.

2904
01:57:27,728 --> 01:57:29,857
I've tried all three genres.

2905
01:57:29,858 --> 01:57:32,057
I majored in Korean Dance.

2906
01:57:32,058 --> 01:57:34,298
The choreographer probably expects...

2907
01:57:34,299 --> 01:57:37,897
how dancers from other genres will do the Korean Dance.

2908
01:57:37,898 --> 01:57:39,408
But it'd benefit me more...

2909
01:57:39,409 --> 01:57:41,908
if I break out of her expectations and pull it off.

2910
01:57:41,909 --> 01:57:45,807
And I wanted to make it look more like ballet to show my uniqueness.

2911
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:47,307
Because it's so fast,

2912
01:57:47,308 --> 01:57:50,548
other dancers can't turn more than 2 or 3 times.

2913
01:57:50,549 --> 01:57:53,749
So I planned to turn more.

2914
01:57:54,049 --> 01:57:57,357
Because I believe I'm more unique than they are.

2915
01:57:57,358 --> 01:57:58,758
I feel confident not to be buried by them.

2916
01:57:59,188 --> 01:58:02,159
Then now, we will begin the Casting Audition.

2917
01:58:02,699 --> 01:58:03,728
First position.

2918
01:58:04,398 --> 01:58:06,999
Be awakened and dance like a lunatic.

2919
01:58:07,529 --> 01:58:08,529
Music,

2920
01:58:09,169 --> 01:58:10,199
start.

2921
01:58:10,398 --> 01:58:13,068
(How will the strategist Kim Yu Chan do?)

2922
01:58:13,409 --> 01:58:14,608
(Change in his look)

2923
01:58:18,608 --> 01:58:19,608
I like it.

2924
01:58:19,879 --> 01:58:21,709
(Kim Yu Chan puts on a unique line.)

2925
01:58:22,478 --> 01:58:23,779
That's neat.

2926
01:58:24,818 --> 01:58:26,648
He stretches the beat all the way.

2927
01:58:32,419 --> 01:58:33,459
He's good.

2928
01:58:34,789 --> 01:58:36,028
(I like it.)

2929
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:39,768
And I wanted to make it look more like ballet to show my uniqueness.

2930
01:58:43,699 --> 01:58:44,739
(Like)

2931
01:58:46,568 --> 01:58:47,568
Nice.

2932
01:58:49,779 --> 01:58:51,378
(The standard example of pirouette)

2933
01:58:51,379 --> 01:58:52,977
(Goosebumps)

2934
01:58:52,978 --> 01:58:54,177
(That's crazy.)

2935
01:58:54,178 --> 01:58:55,278
(Falling for Yu Chan)

2936
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:57,018
(When everyone turns twice...)

2937
01:58:58,619 --> 01:59:00,388
Three turns is out of their league.

2938
01:59:06,228 --> 01:59:07,489
Kim Yu Chan!

2939
01:59:07,629 --> 01:59:08,829
Awesome!

2940
01:59:09,159 --> 01:59:10,159
You did it!

2941
01:59:10,659 --> 01:59:12,727
(Approved)

2942
01:59:12,728 --> 01:59:14,799
- That was wonderful. - Yes.

2943
01:59:14,928 --> 01:59:16,299
(Nodding)

2944
01:59:17,138 --> 01:59:18,138
Wonderful.

2945
01:59:19,268 --> 01:59:20,408
(Say GOAT Yu Chan.)

2946
01:59:20,409 --> 01:59:21,739
Kim Yu Chan!

2947
01:59:22,409 --> 01:59:23,778
- That was awesome. - No wonder he's a ballet dancer.

2948
01:59:23,779 --> 01:59:24,779
That was totally ballet.

2949
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:25,908
He's the winner.

2950
01:59:25,909 --> 01:59:27,549
- He nailed it. - I know.

2951
01:59:28,779 --> 01:59:30,048
(It won't be easy.)

2952
01:59:30,049 --> 01:59:31,919
- Bravo. - I'm getting the chills.

2953
01:59:32,989 --> 01:59:34,717
It was interesting...

2954
01:59:34,718 --> 01:59:38,388
because I expected certain moves from Korean dancers.

2955
01:59:38,818 --> 01:59:41,989
But you were the first person to show them.

2956
01:59:46,129 --> 01:59:47,169
(This is it.)

2957
01:59:48,629 --> 01:59:49,698
(She loves it.)

2958
01:59:49,699 --> 01:59:52,539
It was made for Korean dancers,

2959
01:59:52,768 --> 01:59:54,308
- but he pulled it off the best. - Yes.

2960
01:59:55,169 --> 01:59:58,138
- The way he moved his hand... - It was cool.

2961
01:59:58,638 --> 02:00:01,248
Kim Yu Chan, you selected very well...

2962
02:00:01,249 --> 02:00:04,778
because they have a very homogenous energy amongst them.

2963
02:00:04,779 --> 02:00:08,088
So actually they became the background.

2964
02:00:08,089 --> 02:00:10,788
And I was able to see you and your qualities.

2965
02:00:10,789 --> 02:00:11,789
Thank you.

2966
02:00:13,529 --> 02:00:14,728
Thank you for that.

2967
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:18,829
You showed your best ballet lines,

2968
02:00:19,398 --> 02:00:23,937
yet you pulled it off. I want to give you credit for that.

2969
02:00:23,938 --> 02:00:24,938
Thank you.

2970
02:00:24,939 --> 02:00:26,937
(Kim Yu Chan is complimented by the judges.)

2971
02:00:26,938 --> 02:00:28,239
Way to go, Kim Yu Chan.

2972
02:00:28,468 --> 02:00:30,778
Okay. I may have failed with the group dancers,

2973
02:00:30,779 --> 02:00:32,039
but I'll still get the lead role.

2974
02:00:32,339 --> 02:00:33,749
It felt great.

2975
02:00:34,178 --> 02:00:37,017
Someone will become a sub lead role here,

2976
02:00:37,018 --> 02:00:38,648
but that won't be me.

2977
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:42,217
Kim Jong Cheol, please get ready.

2978
02:00:42,218 --> 02:00:43,258
Let's go.

2979
02:00:43,758 --> 02:00:46,488
Say three sub lead roles...

2980
02:00:46,489 --> 02:00:49,799
who will make you shine in your opinion.

2981
02:00:50,098 --> 02:00:54,329
The first sub lead role is...

2982
02:00:55,029 --> 02:00:56,539
Kim Hyun Ho.

2983
02:00:56,839 --> 02:01:01,008
The second sub lead role is Yun Hyeok Jung.

2984
02:01:01,638 --> 02:01:04,779
The third sub lead role is Kim Hyo Joon.

2985
02:01:06,049 --> 02:01:07,249
One more, Hyo Joon.

2986
02:01:07,648 --> 02:01:08,678
What's going on?

2987
02:01:09,779 --> 02:01:11,779
- Did it change? - Yes, it was supposed to be me.

2988
02:01:12,718 --> 02:01:15,218
I switched to Plan B.

2989
02:01:15,318 --> 02:01:16,959
So I changed everything.

2990
02:01:16,989 --> 02:01:18,317
(When choosing the sub lead roles for the 1st time)

2991
02:01:18,318 --> 02:01:21,159
The first sub lead role is...

2992
02:01:21,459 --> 02:01:22,958
Ryu Tae Young.

2993
02:01:22,959 --> 02:01:24,928
Next is Choi Ho Jong.

2994
02:01:25,058 --> 02:01:27,398
Next, it's Kim Hyun Ho.

2995
02:01:28,768 --> 02:01:33,108
They don't express their energy in a diverse way.

2996
02:01:33,369 --> 02:01:35,808
I'd eat them up.

2997
02:01:36,779 --> 02:01:39,108
(The 4 practice together after the sub lead role selection.)

2998
02:01:40,508 --> 02:01:42,779
(Monitoring the video)

2999
02:01:43,518 --> 02:01:45,017
(Kim Jong Cheol looks serious.)

3000
02:01:45,018 --> 02:01:46,419
Why does it look so weird?

3001
02:01:47,348 --> 02:01:48,688
It was serious.

3002
02:01:49,249 --> 02:01:50,858
I thought I'd eat them up.

3003
02:01:51,159 --> 02:01:54,688
But I was rather buried by their soft energy.

3004
02:01:54,959 --> 02:01:57,598
This is bad. I made a wrong choice.

3005
02:01:57,959 --> 02:01:59,258
I had a mental breakdown.

3006
02:02:00,529 --> 02:02:02,739
(Kim Jong Cheol's in contemplation.)

3007
02:02:02,869 --> 02:02:04,097
I think I should change it.

3008
02:02:04,098 --> 02:02:05,098
(What? Change it?)

3009
02:02:05,099 --> 02:02:07,239
To people with strong energy.

3010
02:02:07,468 --> 02:02:10,177
I decided to choose three people with strong energy...

3011
02:02:10,178 --> 02:02:12,007
Let's harmonize our mutual energy.

3012
02:02:12,008 --> 02:02:13,808
Let's harmonize our mutual energy.

3013
02:02:13,909 --> 02:02:16,848
"If I also succeed in creating a delicate move among them,"

3014
02:02:17,318 --> 02:02:19,448
"we may have a chance."

3015
02:02:19,449 --> 02:02:21,518
That's what I thought.

3016
02:02:21,749 --> 02:02:23,817
Does that mean your energy...

3017
02:02:23,818 --> 02:02:26,058
will be able to overwhelm others?

3018
02:02:26,258 --> 02:02:29,029
That's why I chose them.

3019
02:02:29,388 --> 02:02:30,699
(Let's see if you can make it.)

3020
02:02:30,959 --> 02:02:33,598
As I get one more chance,

3021
02:02:33,699 --> 02:02:35,169
I want to be the main lead role.

3022
02:02:35,268 --> 02:02:36,967
I can't wait to see the performance.

3023
02:02:36,968 --> 02:02:37,999
First position.

3024
02:02:40,169 --> 02:02:42,039
Music, start.

3025
02:02:42,978 --> 02:02:46,608
Three, two, one. Go.

3026
02:02:46,879 --> 02:02:47,978
(Kim Jong Cheol's audition starts.)

3027
02:02:50,379 --> 02:02:51,449
(Astonished)

3028
02:02:51,848 --> 02:02:52,848
(Eyes opening)

3029
02:02:53,188 --> 02:02:54,188
(As well as simple and smooth turning, )

3030
02:02:55,589 --> 02:02:57,257
(they show a powerful energy.)

3031
02:02:57,258 --> 02:02:59,118
He is so different from performing sub before.

3032
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:00,188
- Look at Dancer Jong Cheol. - He's totally changed.

3033
02:03:00,428 --> 02:03:01,688
Jong Cheol is doing so well!

3034
02:03:02,529 --> 02:03:04,799
(Kim Jong Cheol's delicate movement catches all eyes.)

3035
02:03:06,999 --> 02:03:08,067
(Powerful energy)

3036
02:03:08,068 --> 02:03:09,129
He's so different now!

3037
02:03:09,999 --> 02:03:12,339
Look at him! He was not that powerful before.

3038
02:03:15,068 --> 02:03:17,279
He's so talented!

3039
02:03:19,949 --> 02:03:21,508
- What was that? - Oh, my!

3040
02:03:22,449 --> 02:03:25,318
(He moved to the center after the last jump.)

3041
02:03:25,518 --> 02:03:26,989
- He's in the center now. - He's right in the middle!

3042
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:29,348
(Satisfied)

3043
02:03:29,919 --> 02:03:30,959
He went to the center.

3044
02:03:32,358 --> 02:03:33,489
Even the formation has been changed.

3045
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:35,659
Jong Cheol's performance is as good as that of Hyo Joon.

3046
02:03:36,228 --> 02:03:37,358
"It wasn't bad."

3047
02:03:38,029 --> 02:03:39,129
Generally,

3048
02:03:39,228 --> 02:03:41,869
I could feel the energy.

3049
02:03:42,228 --> 02:03:45,498
And the movement based on the technique was...

3050
02:03:45,499 --> 02:03:49,008
very concise and clean.

3051
02:03:49,068 --> 02:03:50,079
Thank you.

3052
02:03:50,478 --> 02:03:53,378
I was really impressed with the way you use your upper body,

3053
02:03:53,379 --> 02:03:56,348
the way you use your legs, and also your performance quality.

3054
02:03:57,049 --> 02:03:59,687
And I also think you chose your subs very well.

3055
02:03:59,688 --> 02:04:02,388
Because they have a similar energy to you.

3056
02:04:02,648 --> 02:04:04,517
But you made a point...

3057
02:04:04,518 --> 02:04:06,588
to stand out amongst the energy.

3058
02:04:06,589 --> 02:04:07,728
So, congratulations.

3059
02:04:08,728 --> 02:04:09,799
Thanks.

3060
02:04:10,358 --> 02:04:12,799
I feel quite strange.

3061
02:04:12,898 --> 02:04:15,427
You performed as a sub...

3062
02:04:15,428 --> 02:04:17,768
- for the last three times, right? - Yes.

3063
02:04:18,299 --> 02:04:19,438
But your performance back then didn't catch my eye.

3064
02:04:20,209 --> 02:04:21,209
In the rehearsal,

3065
02:04:22,169 --> 02:04:24,108
I was nominated by five other dancers.

3066
02:04:24,308 --> 02:04:25,378
(During the Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

3067
02:04:25,379 --> 02:04:28,278
(He performed as a sub for Dancer Kim Yu Chan, )

3068
02:04:28,279 --> 02:04:29,778
(Choi Ho Jong, Kim Hyo Joon, )

3069
02:04:29,779 --> 02:04:31,419
(Yun Hyeok Jung, )

3070
02:04:31,648 --> 02:04:33,249
(and Ryu Tae Young.)

3071
02:04:33,449 --> 02:04:36,489
As I spent too much energy in the rehearsal...

3072
02:04:37,159 --> 02:04:39,588
- Oh, it hurts. - Jong Cheol!

3073
02:04:39,589 --> 02:04:41,528
I even had a cramp in my legs.

3074
02:04:41,529 --> 02:04:44,499
"What if I underperform in my stage?"

3075
02:04:44,598 --> 02:04:46,829
"Because I should do well for it too."

3076
02:04:47,129 --> 02:04:50,499
With all due respect, I had to save my energy.

3077
02:04:50,699 --> 02:04:53,138
- You are smart. - Thanks for your effort.

3078
02:04:53,268 --> 02:04:54,339
- Thanks. - Okay.

3079
02:04:55,638 --> 02:04:56,879
(Everyone clapping)

3080
02:04:57,138 --> 02:04:59,379
Korean Dance's doing well.

3081
02:04:59,678 --> 02:05:01,779
"Jong Cheol, you've done well, not being so thrilled."

3082
02:05:03,879 --> 02:05:06,989
Next, Choi Ho Jong. Please be ready for your dance.

3083
02:05:07,188 --> 02:05:08,619
(Everyone cheering)

3084
02:05:08,718 --> 02:05:09,789
(Expecting his performance)

3085
02:05:09,888 --> 02:05:12,119
- Finally, the final boss. - I'm so excited.

3086
02:05:12,459 --> 02:05:15,129
Dancer Choi Ho Jong, please choose the three subs

3087
02:05:15,228 --> 02:05:17,928
that will shine your dance.

3088
02:05:18,029 --> 02:05:19,098
I'm so curious to know.

3089
02:05:20,268 --> 02:05:22,228
As soon as I saw what the mission was,

3090
02:05:22,329 --> 02:05:24,999
I drew up Plan A and Plan B.

3091
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:26,098
(Carefully observing)

3092
02:05:26,308 --> 02:05:29,567
My Plan A was with Kim Yu Chan and Jung Sung Wook from Ballet.

3093
02:05:29,568 --> 02:05:33,048
Hyeok Jung from Contemporary Dance as his movement is very concise.

3094
02:05:33,049 --> 02:05:35,507
I will put them behind me.

3095
02:05:35,508 --> 02:05:38,818
And I thought if I outperform them, it will catch the judges' eyes.

3096
02:05:39,718 --> 02:05:40,789
My Plan B is...

3097
02:05:40,888 --> 02:05:43,758
to put some dancers from Korean Dance...

3098
02:05:44,018 --> 02:05:46,057
and choose Dancer Ryu Tae Young,

3099
02:05:46,058 --> 02:05:49,488
who has similar movements.

3100
02:05:49,489 --> 02:05:51,799
I was confident that I would outperform them.

3101
02:05:51,898 --> 02:05:53,598
And I hoped it would catch the eyes.

3102
02:05:53,869 --> 02:05:55,098
I had to choose between two plans.

3103
02:05:55,598 --> 02:05:57,699
"What would be the right choice for me?"

3104
02:05:58,768 --> 02:06:02,409
(Between Plan A and Plan B, what would be his choice?)

3105
02:06:03,138 --> 02:06:05,608
My sub is Dancer Kim Hyo Joon.

3106
02:06:05,709 --> 02:06:08,449
Dancer Ryu Tae Young and Kim Jong Cheol.

3107
02:06:08,549 --> 02:06:10,517
(He chose Plan B.)

3108
02:06:10,518 --> 02:06:11,578
He chose three from Korean Dance.

3109
02:06:11,579 --> 02:06:13,148
I guess it's a good choice.

3110
02:06:13,249 --> 02:06:15,489
Plan A. Why did you not go with that?

3111
02:06:16,148 --> 02:06:17,317
(During the Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

3112
02:06:17,318 --> 02:06:18,989
(Dancer Kim Yu Chan performed his perfect turning.)

3113
02:06:19,058 --> 02:06:20,529
Oh, my! Turning three times!

3114
02:06:20,959 --> 02:06:22,629
(Yun Hyeok Jung's delicate movement catches the eyes.)

3115
02:06:23,499 --> 02:06:24,699
He's so good.

3116
02:06:25,459 --> 02:06:27,228
(He agonizes.)

3117
02:06:27,398 --> 02:06:29,267
Ballet Dancers look so cool too.

3118
02:06:29,268 --> 02:06:30,638
So, at first,

3119
02:06:30,968 --> 02:06:32,839
I wanted to choose only from Ballet.

3120
02:06:33,438 --> 02:06:34,468
After the rehearsal,

3121
02:06:34,768 --> 02:06:36,539
I thought it'd be go big or go home.

3122
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:39,008
- It's too risky. - I agree.

3123
02:06:39,209 --> 02:06:42,779
Even if I outperform others,

3124
02:06:43,178 --> 02:06:46,119
I don't know how the coaches would feel about it.

3125
02:06:46,218 --> 02:06:48,289
So, I felt it would not be advantageous to me.

3126
02:06:48,589 --> 02:06:50,318
And also in the Dance Film,

3127
02:06:50,619 --> 02:06:53,129
I had some resentment as a sub.

3128
02:06:53,228 --> 02:06:56,959
So, this time, to be the main lead role,

3129
02:06:57,058 --> 02:06:58,529
I needed to choose a concrete way.

3130
02:06:58,999 --> 02:07:01,398
That's why I chose Plan B.

3131
02:07:02,268 --> 02:07:03,338
First position.

3132
02:07:03,339 --> 02:07:04,898
(What will be Choi Ho Jong's performance?)

3133
02:07:05,539 --> 02:07:07,669
Music, start.

3134
02:07:08,138 --> 02:07:11,239
Three, two, one. Go.

3135
02:07:14,379 --> 02:07:15,409
Nice!

3136
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:17,579
Look at him stretching his body.

3137
02:07:22,218 --> 02:07:23,358
(Oh, my!)

3138
02:07:24,089 --> 02:07:25,159
(The smoothly connected turning)

3139
02:07:25,388 --> 02:07:26,558
(The delicate touching at the end of the finger)

3140
02:07:32,699 --> 02:07:33,968
Oh, nice!

3141
02:07:36,539 --> 02:07:37,568
(Captivated)

3142
02:07:38,869 --> 02:07:39,869
Why is so clean?

3143
02:07:41,839 --> 02:07:42,909
(Everyone shouting out)

3144
02:07:43,079 --> 02:07:44,138
(Amazing)

3145
02:07:46,648 --> 02:07:48,148
(Even his last movement catches all the eyes.)

3146
02:07:48,209 --> 02:07:49,678
Very good.

3147
02:07:49,779 --> 02:07:51,318
(The perfect ending)

3148
02:07:52,249 --> 02:07:53,589
It was so clean.

3149
02:07:54,449 --> 02:07:56,959
- Nice! - Choi Ho Jong outperformed all.

3150
02:07:57,688 --> 02:08:00,489
(How would they estimate his performance?)

3151
02:08:00,589 --> 02:08:02,989
As I saw Ho Jong's dance,

3152
02:08:03,398 --> 02:08:05,658
I could feel both strong...

3153
02:08:05,659 --> 02:08:08,268
and delicate movements.

3154
02:08:08,369 --> 02:08:11,568
I believe a kind of dancer like you...

3155
02:08:11,669 --> 02:08:14,539
would be a perfect fit for choreographers.

3156
02:08:14,739 --> 02:08:15,808
Thanks.

3157
02:08:17,608 --> 02:08:18,678
She praises highly.

3158
02:08:18,879 --> 02:08:22,508
I think you made an excellent choice, Ho Jong.

3159
02:08:22,879 --> 02:08:24,348
You made yourself stand out...

3160
02:08:24,648 --> 02:08:26,888
and showed us...

3161
02:08:27,188 --> 02:08:29,218
what you can do best as much as you like.

3162
02:08:29,919 --> 02:08:36,159
(His smooth movement surely stood out.)

3163
02:08:36,598 --> 02:08:38,459
- Thanks for your work. - Thanks.

3164
02:08:39,428 --> 02:08:40,468
I made the right decision.

3165
02:08:40,968 --> 02:08:42,029
My cuties.

3166
02:08:43,568 --> 02:08:45,597
He's so skilled and knows how to use them.

3167
02:08:45,598 --> 02:08:48,467
His performance was surely based on his experience.

3168
02:08:48,468 --> 02:08:50,008
He knows how we can stand out.

3169
02:08:51,239 --> 02:08:54,408
Next, Jung Sung Wook. Please be ready.

3170
02:08:54,409 --> 02:08:55,478
(It's a main lead role candidate, Jung Sung Wook's turn.)

3171
02:08:56,079 --> 02:08:57,578
- Let's go, Sung Wook! - You got this!

3172
02:08:57,579 --> 02:08:59,988
- Let's go! - You can do it.

3173
02:08:59,989 --> 02:09:00,989
Let's go!

3174
02:09:01,489 --> 02:09:03,918
Dancer Jung Sung Wook, please choose the three subs...

3175
02:09:03,919 --> 02:09:05,258
that will shine your dance.

3176
02:09:05,489 --> 02:09:06,927
(Jong Cheol, Hyo Joon, and Tae Young take sits.)

3177
02:09:06,928 --> 02:09:09,088
Jong Cheol, you may need to be ready for another dance.

3178
02:09:09,089 --> 02:09:10,098
- It's me? - I'm not sure.

3179
02:09:10,299 --> 02:09:13,928
My sub number one is...

3180
02:09:14,228 --> 02:09:15,468
(Who will be?)

3181
02:09:15,728 --> 02:09:16,839
(No way. It's me?)

3182
02:09:17,098 --> 02:09:18,369
I would get a cramp.

3183
02:09:19,369 --> 02:09:20,437
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol.

3184
02:09:20,438 --> 02:09:21,508
Oh, my.

3185
02:09:22,169 --> 02:09:25,178
- He'd be dog-tired. - It'd be very exhausting.

3186
02:09:25,739 --> 02:09:26,749
He's the most popular.

3187
02:09:27,108 --> 02:09:30,718
My sub number two is...

3188
02:09:31,049 --> 02:09:32,817
Dancer Ryu Tae Young.

3189
02:09:32,818 --> 02:09:33,818
(Sighing deeply)

3190
02:09:34,489 --> 02:09:36,218
- He's in trouble. - It drives me crazy.

3191
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:39,757
- His legs may be more thinner. - Thinner again.

3192
02:09:39,758 --> 02:09:41,529
What a jackpot!

3193
02:09:41,989 --> 02:09:44,999
My sub number three is...

3194
02:09:45,329 --> 02:09:46,329
Kim Hyo Joon?

3195
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:47,398
(I'm not feeling good with this.)

3196
02:09:47,598 --> 02:09:49,568
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon.

3197
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:51,039
(The hard worker Kim Hyo Joon, He's rechecking his nametag.)

3198
02:09:51,669 --> 02:09:52,938
(Even Kim Hyo Joon is selected as a sub again.)

3199
02:09:53,308 --> 02:09:54,339
That must be so tiring!

3200
02:09:54,669 --> 02:09:56,239
The three sub pros.

3201
02:09:56,438 --> 02:09:57,709
They perform too often.

3202
02:09:58,209 --> 02:10:00,909
We saw the same subs pretty often.

3203
02:10:01,249 --> 02:10:04,318
I guess I saw Kim Jong Cheol five times as a sub.

3204
02:10:05,478 --> 02:10:06,949
(Kim Jong Cheol was called on as a sub the last five times.)

3205
02:10:07,089 --> 02:10:09,289
Ryu Tae Young, you called on five times too, right?

3206
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:11,518
(Ryu Tae Young is also called on five times as a sub.)

3207
02:10:11,758 --> 02:10:12,789
I guessed it right.

3208
02:10:13,388 --> 02:10:15,159
The most popular picks!

3209
02:10:15,258 --> 02:10:16,258
(Oh, my)

3210
02:10:16,928 --> 02:10:19,299
As I was called on very often from the practicing...

3211
02:10:19,699 --> 02:10:21,727
- My sub-dancer is... - My choice is...

3212
02:10:21,728 --> 02:10:23,368
- Kim Jong Cheol! - Kim Jong Cheol!

3213
02:10:23,369 --> 02:10:24,838
(He was called on many times as a sub supporting role.)

3214
02:10:24,839 --> 02:10:26,068
It's Dancer Kim Jong Cheol!

3215
02:10:27,108 --> 02:10:28,169
I worked the most.

3216
02:10:28,768 --> 02:10:32,709
(He worked on 6 out of 8 times of filming.)

3217
02:10:36,978 --> 02:10:38,049
It was very tiring.

3218
02:10:40,049 --> 02:10:42,289
But I believe doing my best in my position...

3219
02:10:43,688 --> 02:10:46,489
is the best I can do.

3220
02:10:50,299 --> 02:10:52,598
(Whenever called on, he did his best.)

3221
02:10:55,169 --> 02:10:56,869
Honestly, it was very tiring.

3222
02:10:57,299 --> 02:10:59,739
It was very tiring, and I felt hurt.

3223
02:11:00,138 --> 02:11:03,039
But I was also glad that I could stand on the stage.

3224
02:11:04,638 --> 02:11:06,209
He doesn't have any more stamina.

3225
02:11:06,678 --> 02:11:08,808
Dancer Jung Sung Wook,

3226
02:11:08,909 --> 02:11:11,579
I'd like to know the ground of your choice.

3227
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:13,079
Korean Dance and Contemporary Dance.

3228
02:11:14,188 --> 02:11:15,847
I chose Dancer Kim Jong Cheol...

3229
02:11:15,848 --> 02:11:18,789
and Kim Hyo Joon like a carriage and pair.

3230
02:11:18,919 --> 02:11:20,257
(A carriage and pair?)

3231
02:11:20,258 --> 02:11:22,829
He said "a carriage and pair."

3232
02:11:22,959 --> 02:11:24,857
What a line.

3233
02:11:24,858 --> 02:11:26,058
- Seriously. - It's funny how he expresses.

3234
02:11:27,068 --> 02:11:29,999
I guess he saw a chance to stand out next to the Korean Dancers.

3235
02:11:30,199 --> 02:11:32,739
He has a good plan.

3236
02:11:33,339 --> 02:11:36,138
"When I put different dancers together,"

3237
02:11:36,209 --> 02:11:38,538
"I would catch their eyes."

3238
02:11:38,539 --> 02:11:39,938
That's why I chose the three.

3239
02:11:40,449 --> 02:11:42,808
Surely, his ballet performance will stand out.

3240
02:11:43,279 --> 02:11:44,318
It was a nice choice.

3241
02:11:44,818 --> 02:11:48,147
The Casting Audition for Jung Sung Wook,

3242
02:11:48,148 --> 02:11:50,258
a main lead role candidate, starts.

3243
02:11:50,589 --> 02:11:52,119
- I'm so excited. - Me as well.

3244
02:11:52,459 --> 02:11:54,887
- Sung Wook, you got this! - Let's go!

3245
02:11:54,888 --> 02:11:55,888
Why are you angrily shouting?

3246
02:11:58,398 --> 02:12:01,129
I really want to take this main lead role.

3247
02:12:01,228 --> 02:12:03,198
To get this role and honor the Ballet group...

3248
02:12:03,199 --> 02:12:06,199
and make history, that's my wish.

3249
02:12:06,598 --> 02:12:07,839
First position.

3250
02:12:08,268 --> 02:12:10,209
Music, start.

3251
02:12:10,938 --> 02:12:14,678
Three, two, one. Go.

3252
02:12:16,409 --> 02:12:18,147
(Completely changing)

3253
02:12:18,148 --> 02:12:20,018
(Surprised)

3254
02:12:23,089 --> 02:12:24,758
(Clean turns)

3255
02:12:27,289 --> 02:12:28,489
He does it differently.

3256
02:12:29,789 --> 02:12:30,959
(Watching closely)

3257
02:12:32,799 --> 02:12:34,799
Sung Wook is expressing it in his own way.

3258
02:12:39,598 --> 02:12:40,938
Hyo Joon is tired.

3259
02:12:41,508 --> 02:12:42,539
(Graceful)

3260
02:12:43,239 --> 02:12:44,438
He did a plie to turn.

3261
02:12:46,209 --> 02:12:47,209
(Oh, well...)

3262
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:48,579
(Ryu Tae Young made a mistake and missed the beat.)

3263
02:12:52,119 --> 02:12:53,589
(The Audition for Jung Sung Wook, a main lead role candidate, ends.)

3264
02:12:54,789 --> 02:12:55,847
Bravo.

3265
02:12:55,848 --> 02:12:56,958
(Clapping)

3266
02:12:56,959 --> 02:12:58,119
(Looking attentively)

3267
02:12:59,489 --> 02:13:00,758
It feels new.

3268
02:13:01,089 --> 02:13:04,557
Sung Wook has his own graceful movements.

3269
02:13:04,558 --> 02:13:06,158
All three of them got tired at the end.

3270
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:07,398
They were very tired.

3271
02:13:07,728 --> 02:13:09,228
The three must be so tired.

3272
02:13:12,339 --> 02:13:14,868
There's a captivating edge of the dance.

3273
02:13:14,869 --> 02:13:17,137
I'd like to give a high score...

3274
02:13:17,138 --> 02:13:19,379
for expressing it in a ballet style.

3275
02:13:19,879 --> 02:13:21,647
But I was quite disappointed...

3276
02:13:21,648 --> 02:13:22,978
(Nervous)

3277
02:13:23,008 --> 02:13:26,177
because the three dancers who appeared the most...

3278
02:13:26,178 --> 02:13:28,148
lost almost all their energy.

3279
02:13:29,449 --> 02:13:31,988
Your delicate portrayal...

3280
02:13:31,989 --> 02:13:33,727
of the dance...

3281
02:13:33,728 --> 02:13:36,387
would've stood out more if it had supported...

3282
02:13:36,388 --> 02:13:37,858
the energetic dance...

3283
02:13:37,898 --> 02:13:39,728
of the male dancers in the back.

3284
02:13:39,758 --> 02:13:41,328
(Agreeing)

3285
02:13:41,329 --> 02:13:43,169
- It made them look all weak. - Yes.

3286
02:13:43,968 --> 02:13:47,968
Because Sung Wook's moves were subdued.

3287
02:13:48,539 --> 02:13:52,307
It's a little disappointing...

3288
02:13:52,308 --> 02:13:54,308
that you made their moves rather weak.

3289
02:13:54,879 --> 02:13:55,879
I wish I could do better.

3290
02:13:55,909 --> 02:13:58,578
I should've expected that a lot of them...

3291
02:13:58,579 --> 02:14:00,079
would be picked as the sub lead dancers.

3292
02:14:00,289 --> 02:14:01,818
I made a wrong judgment.

3293
02:14:02,018 --> 02:14:04,358
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3294
02:14:05,159 --> 02:14:08,289
- I'm sorry. - Don't say that. You did well.

3295
02:14:09,728 --> 02:14:12,658
The Fixed Choreography Audition...

3296
02:14:12,659 --> 02:14:16,169
for the eight main lead role candidates has ended.

3297
02:14:17,598 --> 02:14:20,508
The result will be announced later.

3298
02:14:21,339 --> 02:14:23,368
(The coaches and the rehearsal director start discussing.)

3299
02:14:23,369 --> 02:14:24,778
I've already decided.

3300
02:14:24,779 --> 02:14:25,879
Like this?

3301
02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:27,249
Me too.

3302
02:14:27,648 --> 02:14:29,709
- Is it the same? - It's exactly the same.

3303
02:14:29,779 --> 02:14:31,548
- Same for me. I had the same... - It's the same...

3304
02:14:31,549 --> 02:14:32,817
- Yes. We already... - Really?

3305
02:14:32,818 --> 02:14:34,289
These five.

3306
02:14:34,718 --> 02:14:36,718
- It's unanimous. - Right.

3307
02:14:37,318 --> 02:14:38,459
That was easy.

3308
02:14:39,289 --> 02:14:43,057
First, I'm going to announce the sub lead dancers...

3309
02:14:43,058 --> 02:14:45,959
who weren't cast as the main lead dancers for the Mega Stage.

3310
02:14:46,499 --> 02:14:48,898
Someone will be confirmed as a sub lead dancer.

3311
02:14:48,928 --> 02:14:50,598
But that won't be me.

3312
02:14:50,938 --> 02:14:53,808
I'll become the main lead dancer rather than the sub.

3313
02:14:54,068 --> 02:14:57,438
I'm not the person who would just perform the sub lead role.

3314
02:14:58,438 --> 02:15:01,448
The dancers who aren't cast as the main lead dancers...

3315
02:15:01,449 --> 02:15:04,419
and are confirmed as sub lead dancers are...

3316
02:15:04,718 --> 02:15:05,818
Who would it be?

3317
02:15:05,949 --> 02:15:07,289
The sub lead role is still good.

3318
02:15:07,888 --> 02:15:09,717
Dancer Kim Hyun Ho.

3319
02:15:09,718 --> 02:15:12,289
(Kim Hyun Ho is cast for the sub lead role.)

3320
02:15:12,919 --> 02:15:13,988
Dancer Kim Hyun Ho.

3321
02:15:13,989 --> 02:15:16,329
It was a little unfavorable to him this time.

3322
02:15:16,589 --> 02:15:20,368
(The strategy of having a skilled sub lead dancer behind him...)

3323
02:15:20,369 --> 02:15:21,598
(backfired on him.)

3324
02:15:22,598 --> 02:15:24,538
Actually, this is how I feel.

3325
02:15:24,539 --> 02:15:26,098
Even though I lost, I fought well.

3326
02:15:26,739 --> 02:15:27,739
And...

3327
02:15:28,108 --> 02:15:30,409
Dancer Ryu Tae Young.

3328
02:15:31,079 --> 02:15:33,578
(Ryu Tae Young didn't stand out as he was overshadowed...)

3329
02:15:33,579 --> 02:15:36,108
(by the sub lead dancer Yun Hyeok Jung he had chosen.)

3330
02:15:37,079 --> 02:15:38,278
Two contemporary dancers.

3331
02:15:38,279 --> 02:15:39,978
After working so hard.

3332
02:15:40,289 --> 02:15:41,289
You can't make a choreography...

3333
02:15:41,290 --> 02:15:42,388
- if you're eliminated here, right? - Right.

3334
02:15:42,949 --> 02:15:44,358
It hurt my heart.

3335
02:15:44,419 --> 02:15:47,958
I was angry at myself for not seizing the opportunity...

3336
02:15:47,959 --> 02:15:50,659
to show my choreography.

3337
02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:55,097
And Dancer Jung Sung Wook.

3338
02:15:55,098 --> 02:15:56,398
(Jung Sung Wook is cast for the sub lead role.)

3339
02:15:57,468 --> 02:15:58,598
He danced too late.

3340
02:15:59,169 --> 02:16:02,368
(Jung Sung Wook made a mistake in choosing sub lead dancers...)

3341
02:16:02,369 --> 02:16:04,108
(and couldn't show his best side.)

3342
02:16:04,839 --> 02:16:08,478
I doubted myself a lot.

3343
02:16:08,579 --> 02:16:12,279
"Can't I go any higher and only do this much?"

3344
02:16:12,678 --> 02:16:16,587
Dancers Kim Hyun Ho, Ryu Tae Young, and Jung Sung Wook...

3345
02:16:16,588 --> 02:16:18,688
will perform sub lead roles.

3346
02:16:18,758 --> 02:16:21,757
The select three main lead dancers...

3347
02:16:21,758 --> 02:16:23,657
from the five dancers,

3348
02:16:23,658 --> 02:16:26,757
we will evaluate you based on your own creative...

3349
02:16:26,758 --> 02:16:28,869
interpretative dance inspired by the theme "the one opposing death."

3350
02:16:29,029 --> 02:16:32,639
Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung, please stand by first.

3351
02:16:33,299 --> 02:16:35,667
- You got this. - You got this.

3352
02:16:35,668 --> 02:16:37,338
(You got this, Hyeok Jung!)

3353
02:16:37,508 --> 02:16:39,407
(Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung will perform first.)

3354
02:16:39,408 --> 02:16:40,408
Hyeok Jung.

3355
02:16:40,578 --> 02:16:41,649
Good luck.

3356
02:16:43,819 --> 02:16:46,747
I made the choreography, thinking about confronting...

3357
02:16:46,748 --> 02:16:49,889
and breaking through death upon its arrival.

3358
02:16:50,719 --> 02:16:51,959
I was confident.

3359
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:54,658
There were three main lead roles. I thought it was enough...

3360
02:16:55,188 --> 02:16:56,258
for me to be cast.

3361
02:16:58,129 --> 02:16:59,399
First position.

3362
02:16:59,699 --> 02:17:01,928
Music, start.

3363
02:17:03,199 --> 02:17:05,039
- He must be so nervous. - Good luck.

3364
02:17:05,238 --> 02:17:06,498
(How will he interpret the one opposing death?)

3365
02:17:10,508 --> 02:17:11,508
What?

3366
02:17:13,438 --> 02:17:14,479
(An amazing split)

3367
02:17:17,049 --> 02:17:18,949
- Sexy Hyeok Jung. - It's smooth.

3368
02:17:23,789 --> 02:17:25,088
(Getting into it)

3369
02:17:30,059 --> 02:17:31,129
It should be more powerful.

3370
02:17:31,559 --> 02:17:33,698
(The performance of Yun Hyeok Jung ended.)

3371
02:17:33,699 --> 02:17:35,699
That's how he finishes.

3372
02:17:35,799 --> 02:17:37,167
Bravo.

3373
02:17:37,168 --> 02:17:38,198
(Impressed)

3374
02:17:38,199 --> 02:17:39,569
His legs were beautiful.

3375
02:17:40,508 --> 02:17:41,639
- The top of his feet. - Yes.

3376
02:17:41,969 --> 02:17:43,039
He's good.

3377
02:17:43,238 --> 02:17:45,108
- He's so good. - He's great.

3378
02:17:45,809 --> 02:17:48,809
He brought the music to life. I like his interpretation.

3379
02:17:50,248 --> 02:17:53,688
After finishing, I thought I would make it.

3380
02:17:53,889 --> 02:17:56,289
I thought I would take the main lead role.

3381
02:17:56,988 --> 02:17:59,818
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon, please get ready.

3382
02:17:59,819 --> 02:18:01,988
(Interpretative Choreography Evaluation)

3383
02:18:02,629 --> 02:18:05,728
"The one opposing death."

3384
02:18:05,729 --> 02:18:07,597
I wondered if I could adequately showcase the dance...

3385
02:18:07,598 --> 02:18:09,928
that fits the role and the concept.

3386
02:18:10,498 --> 02:18:14,068
Then I wanted to show...

3387
02:18:14,069 --> 02:18:15,268
a person being pulled down by death.

3388
02:18:16,738 --> 02:18:17,879
First position.

3389
02:18:19,238 --> 02:18:22,008
Music, start.

3390
02:18:22,279 --> 02:18:24,319
(How will Kim Hyo Joon express the one opposing death?)

3391
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:25,719
(He got into the character who is opposing death.)

3392
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:28,319
Two, one. Go.

3393
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:30,219
(His eyes completely change.)

3394
02:18:31,688 --> 02:18:33,158
(Surprised)

3395
02:18:35,988 --> 02:18:36,988
His eyes are crazy.

3396
02:18:38,399 --> 02:18:39,399
(Focused)

3397
02:18:42,369 --> 02:18:43,529
(What is he doing?)

3398
02:18:44,899 --> 02:18:46,768
(His expressiveness steals the show.)

3399
02:18:50,809 --> 02:18:53,038
(He can show techniques as well.)

3400
02:18:53,039 --> 02:18:54,078
(Headbanging)

3401
02:18:55,949 --> 02:18:57,008
(He killed it.)

3402
02:18:59,119 --> 02:19:00,788
(Kim Hyo Joon showed powerful facial expressions until the end.)

3403
02:19:00,789 --> 02:19:01,918
- It was crazy. - Bravo!

3404
02:19:02,289 --> 02:19:03,688
What did I see?

3405
02:19:03,758 --> 02:19:04,918
So this is the dancer in the First Class?

3406
02:19:05,389 --> 02:19:06,418
(Clapping)

3407
02:19:07,088 --> 02:19:08,158
He did well.

3408
02:19:08,889 --> 02:19:09,988
It was good.

3409
02:19:10,998 --> 02:19:12,257
He's good.

3410
02:19:12,258 --> 02:19:13,899
(Kim Hyo Joon's interpretive dance left a strong impact.)

3411
02:19:14,428 --> 02:19:15,699
He's incredible.

3412
02:19:16,168 --> 02:19:17,369
He's so good.

3413
02:19:18,168 --> 02:19:19,298
Excellent.

3414
02:19:19,299 --> 02:19:22,107
What does the first position...

3415
02:19:22,108 --> 02:19:23,308
symbolize?

3416
02:19:23,309 --> 02:19:26,038
I thought it was a moment to face death...

3417
02:19:26,039 --> 02:19:28,548
as if I encountered the Grim Reaper.

3418
02:19:28,549 --> 02:19:30,719
So I felt a sense of emptiness.

3419
02:19:31,049 --> 02:19:34,247
Despite that,

3420
02:19:34,248 --> 02:19:36,848
I decided to fight in the beginning.

3421
02:19:37,688 --> 02:19:40,559
I thought it was very cool.

3422
02:19:40,688 --> 02:19:43,798
The message you wanted to convey...

3423
02:19:43,799 --> 02:19:45,898
through your dance...

3424
02:19:45,899 --> 02:19:49,028
was delivered to me, who was watching in front,

3425
02:19:49,029 --> 02:19:50,568
straightforwardly and clearly, as if it was written in words.

3426
02:19:50,569 --> 02:19:51,699
It was amazing.

3427
02:19:52,299 --> 02:19:54,238
Their comments were very positive.

3428
02:19:54,268 --> 02:19:56,767
So I'm confident...

3429
02:19:56,768 --> 02:19:57,838
I will become the main lead dancer.

3430
02:19:58,338 --> 02:20:01,379
Dancer Kim Yu Chan, please get ready.

3431
02:20:01,809 --> 02:20:05,948
If I were to oppose death,

3432
02:20:05,949 --> 02:20:08,517
I wanted to show the power...

3433
02:20:08,518 --> 02:20:11,858
to stand against it.

3434
02:20:11,918 --> 02:20:15,658
I incorporated a lot of contemporary floor movements...

3435
02:20:15,688 --> 02:20:20,498
and wanted to showcase delicate yet powerful expressions.

3436
02:20:20,828 --> 02:20:21,969
First position.

3437
02:20:23,268 --> 02:20:25,369
Music, start.

3438
02:20:26,369 --> 02:20:28,469
(How will Kim Yu Chan express the one opposing death?)

3439
02:20:28,768 --> 02:20:30,578
One. Go.

3440
02:20:31,979 --> 02:20:32,979
(Stretching)

3441
02:20:32,980 --> 02:20:34,048
(Impressed)

3442
02:20:34,049 --> 02:20:35,348
(He really killed it.)

3443
02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:39,847
(His presence dominates the stage from the intro.)

3444
02:20:39,848 --> 02:20:41,418
(Concentrating fiercely)

3445
02:20:42,688 --> 02:20:44,389
(Kim Yu Chan is moving swiftly across the floor.)

3446
02:20:46,819 --> 02:20:47,827
(Welcome)

3447
02:20:47,828 --> 02:20:48,828
(It's right up her alley.)

3448
02:20:48,829 --> 02:20:49,858
(He's so expressive.)

3449
02:20:56,069 --> 02:20:57,069
(Bang)

3450
02:20:58,069 --> 02:20:59,069
(A dopamine rush)

3451
02:20:59,069 --> 02:21:00,069
(Did you see that?)

3452
02:21:01,168 --> 02:21:03,638
(He killed it even at the end.)

3453
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:04,908
(Impressed)

3454
02:21:05,678 --> 02:21:07,508
- He moved in sync with the music. - Only he can do that.

3455
02:21:08,248 --> 02:21:09,979
He's crazy.

3456
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:11,578
He's my rival indeed.

3457
02:21:12,049 --> 02:21:13,178
He's good.

3458
02:21:14,748 --> 02:21:17,188
Dancer Kim Yu Chan, I enjoyed your dance.

3459
02:21:17,258 --> 02:21:19,917
I could feel that you wanted to portray...

3460
02:21:19,918 --> 02:21:22,128
"the one opposing death..."

3461
02:21:22,129 --> 02:21:23,997
through the many techniques you showcased.

3462
02:21:23,998 --> 02:21:26,628
- Am I right? - Yes, you're right.

3463
02:21:26,629 --> 02:21:28,497
I also want to thank you...

3464
02:21:28,498 --> 02:21:30,568
because I feel like I got to know...

3465
02:21:30,569 --> 02:21:32,639
a new side of your personality.

3466
02:21:32,899 --> 02:21:37,108
So I hope that this is not the only time that I get to see it.

3467
02:21:37,979 --> 02:21:39,078
Thank you.

3468
02:21:39,908 --> 02:21:41,178
You worked hard.

3469
02:21:41,848 --> 02:21:43,007
He's eloquent too.

3470
02:21:43,008 --> 02:21:44,018
(Yu Chan is so cool.)

3471
02:21:44,578 --> 02:21:48,789
I certainly think I showed a new side of me.

3472
02:21:48,848 --> 02:21:50,987
It raised my hope...

3473
02:21:50,988 --> 02:21:53,358
to become the main lead dancer.

3474
02:21:53,619 --> 02:21:56,389
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol, please get ready.

3475
02:21:56,629 --> 02:21:57,928
- You got this. - You got this.

3476
02:21:58,629 --> 02:22:00,098
(Another Korean dancer comes out after Kim Hyo Joon.)

3477
02:22:01,268 --> 02:22:02,799
I think the interpretive dance of all Korean dancers will be good.

3478
02:22:03,699 --> 02:22:04,799
They know how to show it.

3479
02:22:04,899 --> 02:22:06,369
They really do.

3480
02:22:06,699 --> 02:22:08,168
(Kim Hyo Joon set the bar high.)

3481
02:22:08,569 --> 02:22:10,368
Instead of focusing on the story,

3482
02:22:10,369 --> 02:22:12,279
I thought about creating visually striking images.

3483
02:22:12,879 --> 02:22:14,247
I felt that creating choreography that complemented the music...

3484
02:22:14,248 --> 02:22:18,149
and had impactful moments was more crucial.

3485
02:22:19,119 --> 02:22:20,719
I need to deliver a powerful impact.

3486
02:22:21,088 --> 02:22:22,188
First position.

3487
02:22:23,918 --> 02:22:25,018
I think he'll do a good job.

3488
02:22:25,319 --> 02:22:26,719
Music, start.

3489
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:28,487
(What's his interpretive dance with a powerful impact?)

3490
02:22:28,488 --> 02:22:29,488
(Looking closely)

3491
02:22:29,688 --> 02:22:33,129
Three, two, one. Go.

3492
02:22:33,328 --> 02:22:34,328
(Let me see.)

3493
02:22:41,268 --> 02:22:42,308
(Exclaiming)

3494
02:22:42,309 --> 02:22:43,469
His turns are so good.

3495
02:22:52,518 --> 02:22:53,518
(Thinking)

3496
02:22:55,049 --> 02:22:56,819
(The main Lead Role Casting Audition for Kim Jong Cheol ends.)

3497
02:22:57,719 --> 02:22:59,819
(The judges are nodding quietly after the performance.)

3498
02:23:00,059 --> 02:23:02,357
It could've been better in terms of character.

3499
02:23:02,358 --> 02:23:04,399
I wish there were something impactful.

3500
02:23:05,098 --> 02:23:06,958
(Upset)

3501
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:08,128
(Kim Jong Cheol seems to be disappointed.)

3502
02:23:08,129 --> 02:23:09,268
He's disappointed.

3503
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:11,838
- Dancer Kim Jong Cheol. - Yes.

3504
02:23:12,168 --> 02:23:13,338
Are you disappointed?

3505
02:23:14,938 --> 02:23:18,908
I forgot the moves in the later part.

3506
02:23:19,738 --> 02:23:20,748
(During the Interpretive Choreography Audition just now)

3507
02:23:22,649 --> 02:23:24,979
I looked confused many times.

3508
02:23:25,918 --> 02:23:26,979
So I'm very disappointed.

3509
02:23:27,819 --> 02:23:29,918
- Oh, no. - He did well, though.

3510
02:23:31,258 --> 02:23:35,657
Honestly, I didn't notice you forgot the moves at all.

3511
02:23:35,658 --> 02:23:38,128
It means you made up for it.

3512
02:23:38,129 --> 02:23:40,558
But it seems you completely lost your focus...

3513
02:23:40,559 --> 02:23:42,498
at the moment you made a mistake.

3514
02:23:43,098 --> 02:23:46,069
From that moment on, your movements lacked quality.

3515
02:23:46,969 --> 02:23:48,039
Okay. Thank you.

3516
02:23:49,008 --> 02:23:50,468
(You still did a good job.)

3517
02:23:50,469 --> 02:23:51,508
He must be disappointed.

3518
02:23:52,279 --> 02:23:54,809
I was upset, and it hurt my pride.

3519
02:23:54,949 --> 02:23:56,608
I was angry at myself.

3520
02:23:56,949 --> 02:24:00,078
Next is Dancer Choi Ho Jong. Please get ready.

3521
02:24:02,289 --> 02:24:04,088
He's the last one.

3522
02:24:04,819 --> 02:24:05,959
The big shot is here.

3523
02:24:06,559 --> 02:24:07,889
How great will he be again?

3524
02:24:08,588 --> 02:24:09,658
Seriously.

3525
02:24:10,459 --> 02:24:11,758
I really like Ho Jong's choreography.

3526
02:24:11,928 --> 02:24:13,059
- You do? - It's interesting.

3527
02:24:14,428 --> 02:24:16,898
I wanted to portray the character's vulnerability and strength,

3528
02:24:16,899 --> 02:24:20,498
while facing a dilemma in the presence of death.

3529
02:24:20,969 --> 02:24:24,809
I considered this part to be the climax while preparing.

3530
02:24:25,639 --> 02:24:26,809
First position.

3531
02:24:28,649 --> 02:24:30,408
Music, start.

3532
02:24:31,078 --> 02:24:33,747
(What's his choreography that will become the climax?)

3533
02:24:33,748 --> 02:24:35,587
Three, two.

3534
02:24:35,588 --> 02:24:37,289
- Here he comes. - One. Go.

3535
02:24:42,828 --> 02:24:43,828
(Covering their mouths)

3536
02:24:44,328 --> 02:24:45,328
(Exclaiming)

3537
02:24:49,369 --> 02:24:50,428
It's choreographed well.

3538
02:24:50,598 --> 02:24:52,098
- What? - How is it so clean?

3539
02:24:58,438 --> 02:25:01,548
(Everyone cheers.)

3540
02:25:01,549 --> 02:25:02,608
I got goosebumps.

3541
02:25:10,549 --> 02:25:11,719
This is what I'm talking about.

3542
02:25:14,328 --> 02:25:17,658
(Choi Ho Jong's performance ended leaving a strong impact.)

3543
02:25:18,059 --> 02:25:19,328
He did a great job.

3544
02:25:20,029 --> 02:25:21,399
That was the best choreography.

3545
02:25:22,328 --> 02:25:23,629
(Jaw-dropping)

3546
02:25:23,869 --> 02:25:24,899
(It was insane, wasn't it?)

3547
02:25:25,738 --> 02:25:26,937
(They stand up in awe.)

3548
02:25:26,938 --> 02:25:27,969
It's crazy.

3549
02:25:28,408 --> 02:25:29,709
I surrender.

3550
02:25:30,108 --> 02:25:32,378
He's a monster.

3551
02:25:32,379 --> 02:25:33,778
(A dance monster)

3552
02:25:33,779 --> 02:25:35,847

3553
02:25:35,848 --> 02:25:38,677
the choreography could be used...

3554
02:25:38,678 --> 02:25:41,517
without any modifications.

3555
02:25:41,518 --> 02:25:45,488
It captured the appropriate expression and energy...

3556
02:25:45,789 --> 02:25:48,228
of a person opposing death.

3557
02:25:48,229 --> 02:25:49,959
- I really enjoyed it. - Thank you.

3558
02:25:51,699 --> 02:25:53,029
While watching,

3559
02:25:54,299 --> 02:25:56,629
I was mind-blown. I was like, "How can he do that?"

3560
02:25:57,098 --> 02:26:00,538
It seems you know what the audience likes.

3561
02:26:00,539 --> 02:26:03,908
A huge jump could impress the audience too,

3562
02:26:04,008 --> 02:26:06,539
but just by stomping your feet,

3563
02:26:09,908 --> 02:26:12,248
I could tell what you were trying to deliver.

3564
02:26:13,279 --> 02:26:14,818
It was just incredible.

3565
02:26:14,819 --> 02:26:17,087
As a fellow dancer, I'd like to thank you...

3566
02:26:17,088 --> 02:26:19,059
for showing a choreography like this.

3567
02:26:19,188 --> 02:26:20,188
Thank you.

3568
02:26:20,189 --> 02:26:21,288
(His choreography received high praises from the judges.)

3569
02:26:21,289 --> 02:26:22,828
- It was legendary. - Bravo.

3570
02:26:23,658 --> 02:26:24,699
Bravo!

3571
02:26:25,328 --> 02:26:28,529
Everyone enjoyed my risky interpretation.

3572
02:26:28,828 --> 02:26:30,268
I finally did a successful job.

3573
02:26:30,598 --> 02:26:32,899
I was 100 percent sure I'd become the main lead dancer.

3574
02:26:34,039 --> 02:26:37,469
Okay. This is a little bit more difficult.

3575
02:26:37,738 --> 02:26:41,108
I'll announce the result of the casting audition.

3576
02:26:41,549 --> 02:26:45,549
Only 3 of the 5 remaining main lead role candidates...

3577
02:26:45,779 --> 02:26:48,588
can become the main lead dancers for the Mega Stage Mission.

3578
02:26:49,289 --> 02:26:53,619
I'll announce the result for Dancer Choi Ho Jong first.

3579
02:26:54,289 --> 02:26:56,828
- He'll make it. - He'll be selected right away.

3580
02:26:57,699 --> 02:26:58,799
I'm confident.

3581
02:27:00,328 --> 02:27:01,469
He did such a great job.

3582
02:27:02,098 --> 02:27:03,098
(What?)

3583
02:27:03,098 --> 02:27:04,098
(What?)

3584
02:27:04,099 --> 02:27:06,167
(Nervous)

3585
02:27:06,168 --> 02:27:08,709
Dancer Choi Ho Jong...

3586
02:27:09,738 --> 02:27:11,108
is cast...

3587
02:27:12,238 --> 02:27:13,539
for the main lead role.

3588
02:27:14,578 --> 02:27:18,677
(Dancer Choi Ho Jong is cast for the main lead role.)

3589
02:27:18,678 --> 02:27:19,678
I knew it!

3590
02:27:19,679 --> 02:27:21,948
(It was as expected.)

3591
02:27:21,949 --> 02:27:23,719
The reason we cast you...

3592
02:27:24,418 --> 02:27:28,188
is because you simply dominated the others.

3593
02:27:28,559 --> 02:27:31,358
Thank you for showing a wonderful performance.

3594
02:27:31,758 --> 02:27:34,369
I was happy as I would be able to show something amazing.

3595
02:27:35,199 --> 02:27:39,699
Next, I'll announce the result for Dancer Kim Jong Cheol.

3596
02:27:40,268 --> 02:27:41,639
I think he'll make it.

3597
02:27:41,908 --> 02:27:43,738
I want to take the main lead role.

3598
02:27:44,338 --> 02:27:47,539
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol...

3599
02:27:48,848 --> 02:27:49,908
is...

3600
02:27:50,779 --> 02:27:52,018
He might be cast.

3601
02:27:52,149 --> 02:27:53,748
(Please)

3602
02:27:54,078 --> 02:27:57,488
not cast for the main lead role.

3603
02:27:57,658 --> 02:27:58,958
(Dancer Kim Jong Cheol isn't cast for the main lead role.)

3604
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:00,017
(Disappointed)

3605
02:28:00,018 --> 02:28:01,988
The reason we didn't cast you...

3606
02:28:02,459 --> 02:28:05,157
is you obviously weren't confident...

3607
02:28:05,158 --> 02:28:07,199
in your moves.

3608
02:28:07,498 --> 02:28:08,667
Automatically, Dancer Kim Jong Cheol...

3609
02:28:08,668 --> 02:28:11,299
will take the sub main role.

3610
02:28:11,668 --> 02:28:13,938
I was very upset.

3611
02:28:14,569 --> 02:28:18,108
I'll announce the result for Dancer Kim Yu Chan.

3612
02:28:18,408 --> 02:28:19,738
I should become the main lead dancer.

3613
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:21,508
I think he'll be cast.

3614
02:28:22,108 --> 02:28:23,608
Dancer Kim Yu Chan...

3615
02:28:24,848 --> 02:28:26,049
is...

3616
02:28:26,578 --> 02:28:27,719
Please.

3617
02:28:28,248 --> 02:28:29,448
Cast for the main lead role.

3618
02:28:29,449 --> 02:28:32,558
(Ballerino Kim Yu Chan is cast for the main lead role.)

3619
02:28:32,559 --> 02:28:35,588
(The ballerinos are cheering.)

3620
02:28:35,889 --> 02:28:37,059
(You're so cool, Prince.)

3621
02:28:37,289 --> 02:28:38,698
Dancer Kim Yu Chan,

3622
02:28:38,699 --> 02:28:41,928
your techniques and expressive power stood out.

3623
02:28:42,069 --> 02:28:44,167
We believe you can effectively portray...

3624
02:28:44,168 --> 02:28:46,598
the character opposing death, which is why we made the decision.

3625
02:28:46,969 --> 02:28:49,708
It felt great...

3626
02:28:49,709 --> 02:28:51,008
as I thought I made the ballet dancers proud.

3627
02:28:51,908 --> 02:28:56,008
Now, there's only one who can take the main lead role.

3628
02:28:56,779 --> 02:28:59,518
Among Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung and Dancer Kim Hyo Joon,

3629
02:28:59,719 --> 02:29:01,788
one of them will become the main lead dancer,

3630
02:29:01,789 --> 02:29:03,949
and the other will become the sub main dancer.

3631
02:29:04,488 --> 02:29:06,157
Hyo Joon was very good, though.

3632
02:29:06,158 --> 02:29:07,459
- Hyo Joon left a strong impact. - Yes.

3633
02:29:07,688 --> 02:29:10,358
I think I'll be very upset if I don't become the main lead dancer.

3634
02:29:10,688 --> 02:29:12,658
- It could be Hyeok Jung too. - It's possible.

3635
02:29:13,129 --> 02:29:15,629
I should take the main lead role.

3636
02:29:16,328 --> 02:29:17,838
I'll announce the result.

3637
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:19,899
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon.

3638
02:29:20,738 --> 02:29:22,039
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon...

3639
02:29:24,069 --> 02:29:25,309
is...

3640
02:29:26,938 --> 02:29:30,908
(Which dancer will be the last one to take the main lead role?)

3641
02:29:31,418 --> 02:29:33,119
I'll announce the result.

3642
02:29:33,518 --> 02:29:35,018
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon.

3643
02:29:35,819 --> 02:29:37,049
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon...

3644
02:29:38,418 --> 02:29:39,658
is...

3645
02:29:41,488 --> 02:29:42,629
cast for the main lead role.

3646
02:29:43,129 --> 02:29:44,657
(Dancer Kim Hyo Joon is cast for the main lead role.)

3647
02:29:44,658 --> 02:29:46,757
(Relieved)

3648
02:29:46,758 --> 02:29:48,968
(Congratulations on taking the main lead role.)

3649
02:29:48,969 --> 02:29:50,767
(It's a good news for the Korean dancers.)

3650
02:29:50,768 --> 02:29:52,038
(Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung is cast for the sub lead role.)

3651
02:29:52,039 --> 02:29:54,437
(Disappointed)

3652
02:29:54,438 --> 02:29:57,268
The reason Dancer Kim Hyo Joon was cast for the main lead role is...

3653
02:29:57,608 --> 02:30:00,077
that he showed an exceptional ability to interpret...

3654
02:30:00,078 --> 02:30:03,709
and perform the choreography in a unique way.

3655
02:30:04,108 --> 02:30:05,219
I was just so happy.

3656
02:30:05,348 --> 02:30:08,319
I'm so happy to be cast for the main lead role.

3657
02:30:09,119 --> 02:30:10,789
I should accept the result.

3658
02:30:11,158 --> 02:30:13,559
It's not easy to become the main lead dancer.

3659
02:30:14,059 --> 02:30:18,398
We'll assign roles to the three main lead dancers who were cast.

3660
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:21,069
The one opposing death is Dancer Kim Hyo Joon.

3661
02:30:21,299 --> 02:30:24,268
The one fearing death is Dancer Kim Yu Chan.

3662
02:30:24,369 --> 02:30:27,498
The one consoling death is Dancer Choi Ho Jong.

3663
02:30:27,699 --> 02:30:30,209
I must perform exceptionally well to earn recognition from others.

3664
02:30:30,408 --> 02:30:33,738
As I was given the main lead role, I'll do better than anyone.

3665
02:30:34,008 --> 02:30:37,779
I want to show a performance I can be satisfied with.

3666
02:30:38,578 --> 02:30:41,077
(The results of the main lead role casting)

3667
02:30:41,078 --> 02:30:43,588
(The Mega Stage's grand reveal is next week.)
