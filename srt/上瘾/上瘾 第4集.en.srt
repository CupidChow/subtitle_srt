[Episode 4]

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,720
Actually, Gu Hai is quite nice to you.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
Nice?

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,520
Are you kidding me?

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,280
How can you know that?

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,520
For example, he bought you breakfast this morning.

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,600
It's easier to get bread and cake.

23
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,600
But...

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,600
for Baozi, Chinese hamburgers, omelettes and pancakes,

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,200
you have to buy them from different stores.

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,400
Maybe you can buy them in one store.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Have you ever seen such a diversified breakfast store before?

28
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,160
I wouldn't have that patience

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,880
if I were him.

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,240
I don't understand.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,680
Why do you always have trouble with Gu Hai?

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,200
Me?

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
He doesn't like me at all.

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,000
He always gets me in trouble.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,920
I will be so grateful

36
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,400
if someone can make him ignore me.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,520
Oh, come on.

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,800
I think he likes you anyway.

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,040
Every time I turn around in class,

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I can see him staring at you.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,240
Why does he always stare at you?

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
He is a man.

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,960
How would I know? Maybe he's up to something.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,240
But I saw love in his eyes.

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,120
I think he likes you anyway.

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,040
Every time I turn around in class,

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,080
I can see him staring at you.

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,680
Why are you staring at me?

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,160
Your head is spinning like a steering wheel.

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,079
I have to keep an eye on you.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,760
I think the atmosphere here is too depressing.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,800
You're almost asleep.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,720
How about that?

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
I an going to invite someone to sing an English song.

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Who will volunteer?

56
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,920
Bai Luoyin.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
Okay. Bai Luoyin.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,000
You are such a versatile person.

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
You have all the good things in you.

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
I wish I could have one advantage.

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,120
Here, grandma.

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,180
Yinzi.

63
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,920
That girl is calling you again.

64
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
Dad, you can hang it up.

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,720
This...

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,840
Forget it. Give the phone to me.

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,760
Silly boy.

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,360
He is out to answers the phone.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,600
Are you so fed up with me?

70
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,520
Don't call me again.

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,520
No! No way!

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,920
I will harass your dad all the time if you do that.

73
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,520
That's it.

74
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,320
Have you finished?

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,400
Who is that girl?

76
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
You don't know her.

77
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,960
Right.

78
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,920
How much money do you have in your phone card?

79
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
Less than 20 yuan.

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
I will buy you a new one.

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,050
What?

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,120
All the contact information is in there.

83
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,960
All gone.

84
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
No one's been calling you all day anyway.

85
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
You can abandon that phone card.

86
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
Grandma, have some meat.

87
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Yinzi.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
You said you have mouth ulcers the other day. Have you got better?

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,120
It's better now.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,720
The unguent you gave me was good.

91
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah?

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,520
Where is that unguent?

93
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,240
I put it in the drawer in the room.

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,920
- Okay, I'll get it. - The yellow one.

95
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,650
Okay.

96
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,400
Mouth ulcers. Let's eat.

97
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,000
This is hemorrhoids ointment. Not this one.

98
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
Dad, where is it?

99
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,040
Isn't it in that drawer?

100
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,760
I can't find it.

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,000
Let me help you.

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Here it is.

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,480
I got mouth ulcers.

104
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,760
This is hemorrhoids ointment.

105
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
What's wrong?

106
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
Your grandma got beriberi last time.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,880
That's how I cured her.

108
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,320
It's not the same between mouth ulcers and beriberi.

109
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,800
And the glue can be used on the plastics and shoes.

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
Whatever it is,

111
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
it's an effective prescription

112
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,159
if you are cured.

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,440
See? You got better.

114
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
Come on. Are you cured?

115
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
Don't push me.

116
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,360
The character, the site and the time.

117
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,040
So you have to pay attention to it

118
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
when you do the reading comprehension.

119
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,640
Bai Luoyin.

120
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,960
When was the Royal Shell established?

121
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
In February, 1907.

122
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Good. Sit down.

123
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,760
He can listen to the class while sleeping.

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,440
Okay. Let's move to the second question.

125
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,040
What's going on with it?

126
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
Please give me a bottle of sleeping pills.

127
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,960
What are you gonna do with it?

128
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
It's none of your business. Hurry up!

129
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Our school has regulations.

130
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
I can't just give you sleeping pills.

131
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,520
I can't fall asleep.

132
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,560
I only can give you two tablets.

133
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,050
Hand in your homework.

134
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,120
Hand in your homework.

135
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,040
What homework?

136
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,960
The mathematic assignment.

137
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,160
You are not the representative of maths lesson.

138
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
What are you doing?

139
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
The representative said he had something to do.

140
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
And asked me to help him.

141
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Had something to do?

142
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
He must went to meet girls in the woods.

143
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Just hand in your homework.

144
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,000
No.

145
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
I only will hand in my mathematic assignment

146
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,160
to the representative of maths lesson.

147
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,000
You...

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,840
Fine. Fine.

149
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
Coward.

150
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Yinzi, it's time to hand in you mathematic assignment.

151
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Wake up, Yinzi.

152
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,360
It's time to hand in you mathematic assignment.

153
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,440
The teacher is coming. The teacher is coming.

154
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,440
His face is so pale.

155
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
Yinzi. Yinzi.

156
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,600
- Yinzi. Yinzi. - Yinzi.

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,720
He is fainted.

158
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,640
Hurry up! Take him to the medical room.

159
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,920
You are so weak.

160
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,920
Shut up!

161
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,560
Go away. Leave it to me.

162
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
Let's go. Hurry up!

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,960
Hurry up!

164
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,880
Doctor! Where's the doctor?

165
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,940
- Doctor! - Hurry up! Come and see how he is doing.

166
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,360
Why are you here again?

167
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,660
- Yinzi. - Do you know him?

168
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
Are you You Qi?

169
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,120
You are the most handsome boy in this school.

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,720
