With the two intersecting lines...

AC and BD are parallel to A'B'C'D'.

A'B' and C'D' are parallel.

159
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,540
So the ABCD of the plane...

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,930
...is parallel to the A'B', C'D' of the plane.

...is parallel to the A'C'B'D' of the plane.

163
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,880
According to the theorem stating that lines parallel to a plane are parallel to each other,

164
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,380
we can conclude that both intersecting lines AC and BD

Someone just told me the teacher had fainted.

175
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,130
Why can't I open the door?

176
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,310
Open it now!

177
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,650
I can't open it either, Director.

178
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,420
-Open it quickly. -Let me try.

[Bai Luoyin's patent]

You're Bai Luoyin?

181
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,640
Come to my office.

182
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,600
To put it mildly, you've vandalized public property.

183
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,370
To put it more seriously, you've shown a significant issue with your moral compass.

184
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,270
We can't dial a false distress call.

185
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,780
We can't change any door lock as we wish.

186
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,430
You're not a child anymore. Why did you do something so stupid?

187
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,590
You have to compensate for the locks that you damaged.

Hand in 100 yuan tomorrow.

189
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,980
Why? Both the locks are not broken.

190
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,750
-I can fix them now. -You've tampered with them.

191
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,150
You have to pay for it. It's the rule.

192
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,140
My family is poor.

193
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,470
-I have no money. -Then why did you do it in the first place?

194
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,240
And you even made a patent?

195
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,510
You're not paying? Fine. Give me your dad's phone number.

196
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,260
I'll ask him for it.

197
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,470
-It's more difficult to ask him for money. - Cut your crap.

198

The number!

186-8888-2901.

200
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I'm the Guidance Director of your son's school.

201
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,900
Your son vandalized two door locks in school.

202
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,230
I asked him to compensate for it.

203
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,810
His response was, "My family is poor."

204
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,800
I'm curious to know how poor your family is

205
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,940
that you can't afford to pay for the things your child breaks?

206
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,710
Listen.

207
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Our locks have been broken for nearly five years, and we haven't fixed them.

208
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,110
During these five years, not a single thief has entered.

209
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,540
How poor do you think we are?

210
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,030
Get out! Get out!

211
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,200
The rain is heavy. I'll drive you home today.

212
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,620
Okay.

213
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,940
Hai, the General said today is his wife's birthday.

214
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,140
He wants you to go home for the dinner.

215
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,370
Go back to my place.

216
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,090
-Hai... -You heard me.

217
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,710
-Follow him. -Hai...

218
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,730
Why don't we give him a ride?

219

-Take them inside! -Mrs. Zou, dad.

220
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,800
-Here you are. You're wet. -Give me a hand.

221
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,790

-Hai, shall we go to help them? -No.

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,270

How do you know I skipped breakfast?

231
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,940
Wait!

232
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,900
Do you regret it so soon?

233
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,520
-You didn't buy them, did you? -What?

234
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,510
Throw them away if you don't want them.

235
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,260
But never give them away as a gift.

236
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,530
So you bought them.

237
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,410
Why didn't you say it earlier?

238
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,760
If I had known that you bought these, I wouldn't eat them even if I were starving.

239
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,090
-But you already did. -That's because you put them on my desk.

If you feel sorry about it, you can pay me.

241

It's 32 yuan in total. You can just pay me 30.

Does your family run a breakfast-stall?

243
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,010
Is this your bad idea to improve its business?

244
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,290
Yes, my family does run a breakfast-stall.
