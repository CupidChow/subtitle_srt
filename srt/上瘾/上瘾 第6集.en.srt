♫A bike was cycling along the sidewalk♫

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,950
♫There was beautiful handwriting on the blackboard♫

[Episode 6]

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,840
Are you for real? It's just a fish.

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
If I didn't bring it out of water,

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
you will never talk to me again.

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,880
It's not like that at all.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,200
Since we are here to fish,

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,320
then let's just focus on fishing.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,320
Unlike you, always looking at your phone and not paying attention.

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,920
I've already turned it off.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
See? It's off.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,360
Oops, I forgot to take it out when I got into the water.

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
After catching so many fish,

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,480
you should invite me to your house for dinner tonight, right?

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,440
Once I've stewed them, I'll bring two over to your place.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,160
Just wait at home.

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
Why can't I have a meal at your place?

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,079
To be honest, you should invite me over.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
You are so thoughtless.

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,320
No, I'm not.

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,560
If you want some, just wait at home.

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,280
Or you can just forget about it.

37
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,180
We are back.

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,240
Sir.

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,280
Hai.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
What happened to your pants?

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
Just go inside and get a new one.

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,920
Dad, we have no spare dry clothes.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,000
We have.

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,840
I just bought a new one the other day.

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,400
Sir, can I take a shower here?

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
You see, I've got mud all over my clothing.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,160
And I don't want to soil your new clothes.

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,120
Don't be so pretentious!

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course you can! Do you know to use the shower head?

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,320
Just ask Yin to take a shower with you if you don't.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
That would be great.

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,920
No way!

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
Dad, our toilet door is broken,

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,400
and the water spray nozzle is clogged.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,240
How can he take a shower there?

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
Of course I can!

57
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
My toilet doesn't even have a shed.

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,640
What?

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
In the summer, we just use tap water to shower.

60
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,280
We don't even have hot water.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,120
We have hot water. Just help yourself.

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,560
Okay, I will.

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
Dad, what are you doing?

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,640
It's just a shower.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Why does he have to take a shower here?

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,040
Bai Luoyin, how do you turn on the hot water?

67
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Just go and help him.

68
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,980
No. I'm not going to.

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
You should be polite to your guest.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
Here. Let me help you.

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,960
Hurry up! Go!

72
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,840
Just go.

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,720
If you don't even know how to turn on the hot water,

74
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,800
why are you in such a hurry to take your clothes off?

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,960
How about we take a shower together?

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,200
Look at you, you're sweating.

77
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,320
No thanks.

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,840
Bai Luoyin, you are so nasty.

79
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Your reaction is quite quick.

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,190
Hi.

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,800
You bought some fish today.

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,120
They went to fish today.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,280
Fishing?

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,159
Auntie, just take some home.

85
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,120
Or you can help us cook them.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,200
My dad doesn't know how to cook fish.

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
Your dad is good at cooking fish.

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
His cooking skill is improving recently.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,440
You haven't had a chance to taste it yet.

90
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Okay, I'll take the fish back and stew them.

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,280
I'll bring them over to you when they're ready.

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,430
-Thank you, auntie. -It's not a big deal.

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,680
It's quite embarrassing.

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,760
Why do you say so?

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,720
Yeah.

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,860
Dad.

97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,020
Listen to me.

98
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,520
Later, if Gu Hai says he wants to stay for dinner,

99
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,480
just turn him down.

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,920
Just tell him that you are not good at cooking.

101
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,560
Why?

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,400
Mrs. Zou is good at cooking.

103
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
You went to fish together.

104
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,240
Why aren't you sharing the fish with him?

105
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,920
It's not like that.

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
I just want to send the fish to his place.

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,280
His place is not far from ours, right?

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Okay. Whatever you say.

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,290
-Have you finished? -Yeah.

110
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,320
How do you feel?

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,120
I feel quite good.

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,440
Sir.

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,159
I want to stay for dinner.

114
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,800
Of course. Even you want to leave, I won't let you.

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
-Just have dinner here tonight. Help yourself. -Okay.

116
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,290
-Let's go. -Let's go.

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,210
Dad.

118
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,720
Come on!

119
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,480
Hai.

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,600
Come to my house often when you are free.

121
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,159
Okay.

122
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,080
Yin, say goodbye to your classmate.

123
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

124
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,680
Sir, just go back inside.

125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,520
-Take care. -I will.

126
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,900
-Dad, just go back inside. -Okay. See you!

127
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,590
How far is your home from here?

128
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,880
Why? Do you want to come to my place?

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
Nope. I just want to accompany you home.

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
We're both guys. Don't bother.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,720
Just go back inside. It's getting cold outside.

132
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,600
It only takes me 10 minutes to get home by bike.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,520
Let's go.

134
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Why did you write your name in artistic font?

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
That was designed by my girlfriend,

136
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,920
and she insisted I learn to write like that.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
Later on, I got used to it

138
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
and couldn't change back.

139
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,920
That's not a good habit.

140
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
Yes, sir.

141
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,080
Do you like dogs?

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Normally, fierce dogs will become docile

143
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
when they see me.

144
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,960
I will give you one as a gift

145
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,240
if you like.

146
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,840
You can't afford to buy one.

147
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,600
Why does it take so long to get to you home?

148
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,440
Of course. Pushing the bicycle would definitely take longer.

149
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
I will get home soon if I ride the bike.

150
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
Fine. You should head back now.

151
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,760
See you!

152
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,520
-Are you leaving? -See you!

153
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Sir, my bicycle fell to your place.

154
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,960
Can I go down and pick it up?

155
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,200
Okay.

156
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
How did it fall from up there?

157
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Were you riding your bike on the wall?

158
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,680
I will throw it back here when I pick it up.

159
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,640
I won't bring inconvenience to you.

160
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,360
Alright.

161
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,080
It doesn't matter.

162
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,800
You can push it out from this doorway.

163
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
There you go, that's exactly what I want.

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,920
Okay.

165
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
See you, sir.

166
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,360
What a nice young man.

167
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
Such a pity that he's a fool.

168
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,800
Are you waiting for me?

169
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,400
In your dream.

170
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,720
Are you okay? Let me take your turn.

171
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,280
We're almost there.

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,640
It's unnecessary to say so.

173
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,200
Wait. Slow down.

174
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,200
Then we'll be late.

175
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,640
I feel like the person riding the bike behind us looks so much like Hai.

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,840
He does look like him.

177
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,000
I think it's him.

178
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
It's impossible.

179
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,760
That's a poor boy. How could it be him?

180
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Besides, Hai has several cars.

181
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,080
He doesn't need to ride a bike.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,360
Where is Hai?

183
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,120
[Class 27 Senior 2]

184
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,660
Excuse me.

185
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Is Gu Hai in this class?

186
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,280
Gu Hai, someone is looking for you.

187
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,160
What brings you here?

188
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,880
What do you think?

189
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,960
It's been two days, and you haven't been answering your phone.

190
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I was afraid you got kidnapped

191
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,000
or something.

192
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm fine.

193
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
My phone's dead because it fell into the water.

194
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,360
I can't afford a new one.

195
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,160
That's why I couldn't get in touch with you.

196
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,320
What's this?

197
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,920
How could your dad do this?

198
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,120
Even if he kicked you out, he shouldn't...

199
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,080
Keep it down. They can hear you.

200
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
What did he do to you?

201
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,520
What happened to you?

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Don't! You'll break it.

203
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Okay. Stop.

204
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,520
I'll take you back home after school at noon.

205
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm not leaving. I asked for three days off.

206
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,480
You took three days off, but I didn't.

207
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,320
Are you going to spend three days here alone?

208
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,520
Can't you skip class?

209
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,640
You used to skip class a lot.

210
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,720
I didn't sleep all night and came here to find you.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Can't you just skip one class for me?

212
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,520
Stop it! I have no time for you.

213
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,560
I know.

214
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,640
You have a girlfriend here, don't you?

215
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
Just leave if you say that again.

216
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,960
I have to figure things out before I leave.

217
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
If you feel like I haven't spent enough time with you,

218
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,760
I'll go ask the teacher for leave right now.

219
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,000
Do whatever you want when we are back,

220
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,320
but not here.

221
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Why?

222
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Do you want a reason for everything?

223
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,600
I want you to be honest with me.

224
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,520
I'm not that bossy.

225
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
If you really have a girlfriend here,

226
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,320
I would leave even if you didn't ask me.

227
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,060
Just go.

228
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,040
Did you understand the lesson our teacher taught in this class?

229
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,720
I couldn't understand at all.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,840
Me too.

231
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
You know what? I know fortune-telling.

232
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,800
Here. Let me have a look.

233
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,320
It says...

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
No, thank you. I need to use the toilet.

235
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,680
Have you finished your homework?

236
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
There are too much.

237
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
I heard that there's a handsome guy who just transferred to our school.

238
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,600
I think his name is Lin Sai, according to the gossips.

239
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,200
Was that your little brother?

240
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
Screw you!

241
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,800
Then who's that?

242

What are you doing?

244
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,000
It looks like someone is fighting.

245
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,840
It sounds like Shan Xiaoxuan.

246
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
What's wrong?

247
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,360
What's wrong?

248
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,320
Dare to steal my boyfriend? I'll teach you a lesson!

249
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,800
I didn't do that.

250
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,080
How dare you!

251
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,440
I didn't do that.

You are with him every day.

Yes, you are.

What's wrong?

267

It's not like you are not in a relationship.

268

There's no need to be so sensitive.

Tell me what you want to do.

270

Are you ashamed of me?

Alright, since you've already started to dislike me,

I'll make sure you dislike me more and more.

281

You don't like me showing up at your classroom door, right?

Well, I'll come here every week from now on,

Okay. I promise you.

Go ahead.

292

You must treat me as a poor guy here.

Remember. I'm poor.

Don't mention my family background in front of my classmates.

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,280
I was in the army for so many years.

337
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
The environment there isn't better than here,

338
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
but I've managed to settle down.

339
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
But it's too horrible here.

340
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,000
The houses in this area are all the same.

341
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,920
Do you have to live in this neighborhood?

342
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,440
There aren't any good houses in this area.

343
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,080
I like it here.

344
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Why?

345
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,680
It's quiet here.

346
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,640
Is it because your dad stopped giving you pocket money?

347
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
You can tell me if you run out of money.

348
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,280
Plus, you can also ask help from Li Shuo and Hu.

349
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,120
Perhaps we can't come up with hundreds of thousands right away,

350
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
but tens of thousands should be manageable, right?

351
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,440
You can choose a better accommodation.

352
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,600
Just treat yourself better.

353
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,280
Moreover, the camel may be skinny, but it's still larger than a horse.

354
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,000
Even if your dad isn't giving you an allowance,

355
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
you must have some savings, right?

356
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I just want to live in here.

357
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
It has nothing to do with money.

358
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,800
Oh my god. Are you using this phone to contact me?

359
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,200
Yes.

360
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,760
I was wondering why there was so much noises.

361
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,800
And the signal was not good either.

362
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,200
Why did you cross out the name I designed for you?

363
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,080
Come here. Let me show you something.

364
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,320
See?

365
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,720
Do you think these two fonts look alike?

366
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,280
No, not at all.

367
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,800
Look closely.

368
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
Don't they look similar at all?

369
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,240
Don't focus on their outlines.

370
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
You need to focus on their fonts.

371
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,400
I don't think they look similar to me.

372
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,240
Auntie.

373
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,560
I would like to have one set, too.

374
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,520
Okay.

375
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,360
Why didn't you wait for me?

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,280
How did I know you were coming?

377
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I eat breakfast here every day.

378
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,760
You weren't here the other day.

379
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,840
What's wrong? Do you miss me?

380
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,720
Are you kidding?

381
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,760
Where is your girlfriend?

382
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,680
Finally, she is gone.

383
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Thank you, ma'am.

384
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,000
Hey, don't act like that.

385
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,840
Your girlfriend asked me to keep an eye on you.

386
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,760
Look at you now.

387
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,520
It seems like it's impossible.

388
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
You can't trust her.

389
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,880
We've been together for three years.

390
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,760
And she's been paranoid all the time.

391
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,960
In fact,

392
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,840
I've never flirted with any other girls.

393
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,240
Of course she's insecure, according to her looks.

394
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
Shut up!

395
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Shan Xiaoxuan was beaten for no reason.

396
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,440
I didn't flirt with her.

397
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,520
She's the one who pestered me.

398
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,440
Don't you have any feelings for her?

399
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,520
Shan Xiaoxuan is better than your girlfriend anyway.

400
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,400
She is not my type.

401
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,480
I like someone with strong characters, and more straightforward.

402
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,200
I will feel sick

403
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
when a girl like her standing next to me.

404
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,640
What kind of girls do you like?

405
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,600
You are the opposite of me.

406
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,880
I like sexy girls.

407
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,840
Then why did you run away so fast

408
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,800
every time when Shan Xiaoxuan came to me?

409
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm sick of touching her.

410
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,000
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

411
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,560
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

412
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,550
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

413
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,690
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

414
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,080
♫You held my hand that had been wavering♫

415
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,990
♫Slowly moving forward♫

416
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,790
♫Slowly moving forward with me♫

417
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,120
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

418
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,990
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

419
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,620
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

420
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,930
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

421
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,310
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

422
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,070
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

423
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:37,250
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

424
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,850
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

425
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,750
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

426
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,660
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

427
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,910
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

428
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,230
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

429
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,140
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

430
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:09,110
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

431
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,400
♫Please, don't go♫
