[Episode Ten]

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,000
Gu Hai, come here.

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,850
What?

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,400
Did you arrange my father's promotion?

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,990
Your father's what?

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,950
Stop pretending.

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,110
Who allowed you to make the decision on you own,

23
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,280
and transfer my father to that company.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
What do you mean?

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,890
Providing relief to us?

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,280
Or you only feel comfortable by giving us something in return

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
just because we bought you a phone?

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,760
Bai Luoyin, I don't want to hear you say something like this.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,889
What do you mean by providing relief to your family?

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
Is anything wrong with your family?

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
What can I provide as the relief?

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,200
I just see Mr. Bai

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,890
working so hard every day to support this family.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
I can't bear to see that.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,470
He is your father.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,320
You can't let your father work in that factory,

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,100
suffering so much pain,

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,460
just because of your pride.

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,190
Don't you mind the business of my family.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,540
Say that again.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,170
It's the same no matter how many times I say.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,090
Don't you mind the business of my family.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,570
You think I won't beat you?

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Right.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,980
I should have consulted with you in advance.

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,280
But I was afraid of your stubbornness.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,000
You would deny my idea if I told you in advance.

48
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,430
Yinzi, I don't have other intentions.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
The company I arranged for Mr. Bai is very formal.

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,140
He won't just sit there, reading newspaper and drinking tea every day.

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,100
Employees have to have real skills there.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,580
I always felt that Mr. Bai is a competent man.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,660
Otherwise, he won't have

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,520
such a clever son.

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,010
I just want to give Mr. Bai an opportunity

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
so that he could make full use of

57
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,160
his capability that was wasted over the first half of his life.

58
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,950
Afterwards, in front of the landlady, Mrs Zou,

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,050
he can be more confident, right?

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,240
When I helped Mrs Zou the other day,

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,760
You didn't say anything.

62
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,820
Why it comes to your father,

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,490
you can't accept it?

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,800
It is different.

65
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
What is the difference?

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,760
This is how the society works.

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,200
Working depends on social relations.

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,960
I have so many good social relations that you can use.

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
What a good thing.

70
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,000
Why you are so stubborn?

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,930
It's not because I'm stubborn.

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,200
I also have many buddies.

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,360
I'll ask them for help if necessary.

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,000
But when it comes to you,

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
Why it is so different?

76
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,800
Yinzi, Yinzi,

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,730
So be it.

78
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,480
Hai,

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,050
The luckiest thing

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
in Yinzi's life is

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,310
making friends with you.

82
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,260
I am really grateful to you.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Thank you for being so kind to Yinzi.

84
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,390
Cheers.

85
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,040
Cheers.

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,840
Hai,

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,620
I also think of you.

88
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,000
Today, when I just got my salary,

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,680
I went to the furniture market at once.

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,690
And bought a bed for you.

91
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,060
Sorry that we didn't give you better living conditions.

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,550
And let you sleep with Yinzi on one bed.

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,240
Now, it's great.

94
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,480
You guys can sleep on your own bed.

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
Neither of you will feel crowded.

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,500
Sir, how about returning the bed?

97
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,820
I sleep very well

98
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,660
when Yinzi and I sleep on one bed.

99
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,640
That is not proper.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,980
Since you have lived in our house,

101
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,340
I can't treat you badly.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,140
Don't be shy.

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,360
I was kind of short of money a few days ago.

104
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,659
In fact, I should have bought it for you before.

105
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,680
So the moment I got the salary today,

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,800
I went to the furniture market immediately.

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,740
Sir, let me tell you,

108
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,490
I won't live for long in your house.

109
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,390
Maybe one day, I will move back.

110
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,240
So the money you speed on the bed is

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,780
a waste, right, sir?

112
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,270
Gu Hai, since my father has bought it for you,

113
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,180
don't refuse it any more.

114
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
Yes. Cheers.

115
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,770
The room is so small.

116
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,130
Now another bed is put here.

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,070
There is no space for walking.

118
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,680
Without any place for walking,

119
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,560
how can you come in?

120
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,010
Fly?

121
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,230
It's so good that I can sleep alone.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,950
You will have a cold tomorrow morning.

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,100
I don't care that.

124
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,090
Fine. Turn off the light and go to bed.

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,520
Go away.

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,580
What are you doing? Go away.

127
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,960
Is it necessary to be so cruel?

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,980
We cuddled up every night before.

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,640
And you slept so well.

130
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,940
Sometimes if I got my hands off you,

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,630
you would come to my arms yourself.

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,730
Come here again?

133
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,960
Come here again?

134
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,640
If you come here again, I will change the room with my father.

135
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,460
I won't come.

A cactus died in the yard.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Aren't you afraid that you will sleep on it?

You are so ruthless.

Help me pluck the thrones.

158
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,940
So many thrones. How can I sleep?

159
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,570
Help me pluck the thrones.

160
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,390
Why you wear so less?

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,910
I always wear like that.

162
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Then when you sleep with me,

163
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,210
Why do you wear so much?

164
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,360
Find out the reasons by yourself. Turn around.

165

What are you doing? What are you doing?

166

It aches.

167
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,650
Do you believe that I will kick you out?

168
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,460
Let the thrones prick you.

169
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,460
Damn it.

170
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,740
Why you sleep on my bed again?

171
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,850
Who sleeps on your bed?

172
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,740
Have a close look.

173
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,190
I sleep on my own bed.

174
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,050
How come?

175
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,660
Why I can't separate them?

176
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
The beds are glued together with your hemorrhoids ointment.

177
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,960
Don't you say your hemorrhoids ointment is omnipotent?

178
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
Yinzi, Yinzi, Yinzi,

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,720
when I went back home at the weekend,

180
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,470
I saw Gu Hai's girlfriend

181
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,610
staying with another man.

182
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,850
They seemed very close.

183
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,120
I don't dare to tell Gu Hai.

184
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
You tell this thing to him.

185
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,780
Give the note to me.

186
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,490
Why should I give it to you?

187
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,950
You Qi gives it to me.

188
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,210
Let me see it.

189
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Let me see it.

190
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,220
Give it to me.

191
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,820
Give the note to me.

192
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,020
Bai Luoyin, give the note to me.

193
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,080
Jin Lulu, we haven't broken up yet.

194
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,800
We are still couples.

195
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
Why I can't feel it?

196
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,720
I just don't like you.

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,760
Why you disgust me by such behaviors?

198
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm disgusting?

199
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,930
Right. I'm disgusting.

200
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Then let me tell you, Gu Hai,

201
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,040
I have done so many disgusting things.

202
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,490
I have slept with him long before.

203
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,100
You think you got some benefits.

204
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm telling you,

205
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,440
Before I had relationship with you,

206
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,830
I hadn't been a virgin already.

207
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,610
We are done.

208
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,050
Hai, don't leave. Don't leave.

209
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,960
You misunderstand me.

210
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,470
I just want you to be jealous.

211
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,650
Let you have a sense of crisis.

212
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,870
We are just pretending to have an affair.

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,340
He doesn't love me at all.

214
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,250
And I don't love him.

215
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,960
We are just acting in front of you, Hai.

216
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
Trust me, Hai.

217
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,660
Go back to the bed.

218
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,980
You wear too little.

219
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,840
Don't get a cold.

220
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,320
Hai,

221
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,290
Hai,

222
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,920
Hello?

223
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,760
Will you come back?

224
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,020
I lost my girlfriend.

225
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,730
Can't you comfort me?

226
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,480
I found them sleeping together in the hotel.

227
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,060
Are you angry, cuckold?

228
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,020
You don't comfort me.

229
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,180
And instead, laugh at me, huh?

230
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
Why should I comfort you?

231
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,920
I don't find you feeling sad.

232
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,900
How can I not feel sad?

233
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,870
Three years.

234
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,240
Don't scare yourself by using the time.

235
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,410
To tell the truth in all conscience,

236
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,270
are you sad or heartbroken?

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,320
I am indeed very sad.

238
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,670
I hear that.

239
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,120
Your conscience is abusing you.

240
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,720
Tomorrow Mrs Zoe's restaurant will be open.

241
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,220
It is so fast.

242
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,000
Are they ready?

243
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,890
Almost.

244
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,880
Let's go there together tomorrow.

245
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,040
Not tomorrow. How about now?

246
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,119
The day breaks. Let's go.

247
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,010
What are you doing here?

248
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
I am telling you,

249
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,880
it's impossible that that woman will treat you sincerely.

250
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,160
She treats you kindly because she is intentional.

251
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,690
Human mind is very complicated now.

252
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,400
What intention?

253
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,390
Intention to take our money? Do we have that?

254
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,860
Intention to take our power? Do we have that?

255
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,340
If she is just to get my father,

256
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,820
then that is enough for me to accept her.

257
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
Why you can accept your father's remarriage,

258
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,100
but you can't accept mine?

259
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,380
Don't I have the right to choose my happiness?

260
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,790
Or you think all the happy women

261
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,810
should be narrow-minded as she is.

262
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,600
I don't say I don't accept it.

263
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,270
When did I say that?

264
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,790
Number five, your wonton is ready.

265
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,840
Number seven, your steamed dumplings are ready.

266
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,890
Mrs Zou, where is Yinzi?

267
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,260
He has just been here.

268
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,860
It seems that someone comes to see him and he goes out.

269
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,280
I go to have a look.

270
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760
OK. Go and see what happens.

271
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,970
Because we are not the same sort of people.

272
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,010
What are you doing here?

273
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Why are you talking to her? Let's go.

274
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,320
You know her.

275
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,880
She is the new wife my father marries.

276
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,160
I have told you.

277
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,120
After failing to persuading me,

278
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,520
she comes to persuade you.

279
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,840
Ignore her. Let's go.

280
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,520
Wait.

281
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,170
You guys know each other.

282
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,300
That's great. Great.

283
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,150
You haven't realized it yet, right?

284
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,890
This is my son

285
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,850
who I often mentioned to you.

286
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,270
I know that you guys have the same temper.

287
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,710
You must get long very well.

288
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,570
Great.

289
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,270
Son, where are you going?

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,690
Nothing,

291
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
Dad, I am going out for a while.

292
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,850
Where are you going?

293
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,680
I am going back to bring something.

294
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,680
I will be back soon.

295
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Yinzi, Yinzi,

296
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,800
Bai Luoyin,

297
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,330
don't you hear me?

298
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,520
I hear you.

299
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,890
Then you still ignore me.

300
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,480
Go away.

301
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,720
You ask me to go away?

302
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,240
What right do you have to let me go?

303
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,600
You, liar.

304
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,900
Where did I lie to you?

305
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,790
I also don't know it until today.

306
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,570
Don't you hear Jiang Yuan's tone?

307
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,680
Where did I lie to you?

308
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
Bai Luoyin, what do you want?

309
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,220
Am I not kind to you?

310
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,840
Are you the only one who were wronged?

311
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
Your mother has been having an affair with my father for so many years.

312
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,740
The cause of my mother's death is still unknown.

313
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,080
It is me who should be angry.

314
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,720
It is me who should say go away.

315
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,710
Right. You're right.

316
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,810
Leave now. If you leave, everything will be fine for both of us.

317
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,450
You tell me why I'm not leaving.

318
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,250
If I am willing to part with you,

319
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,670
why would I degrade myself and not leave?

320
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,910
No matter how I hate your mother,

321
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,280
that is nothing, compared with my affection for you.

322
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,090
Bai Luoyin,

323
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,440
you hate my father. I can't stop you.

324
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,540
But why do you shift your hatred to me?

325
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,680
Don't you think that is too cruel?

326
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,880
Gu Hai, I don't hate you.

327
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
And I don't hate your family.

328
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
I just can't accept you.

329
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
I can't accept your family.

330
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,980
Because I have my family as well.

331
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,960
Your family is a pain on my family.

332
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,700
You mean...

333
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,600
I have to leave.

334
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,840
I will pack those things for you.

335
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,240
Bai Luoyin, you are so cruel.

336
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,540
Enough.

337
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,810
You don't need to pack those things. I don't need them.

338
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,100
Tell Mrs Zou for me,

339
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,210
I congratulate her on the opening of her business.

340
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,370
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

341
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,320
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

342
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,110
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

343
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,450
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

344
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:24,790
♫You held my hand that had been wavering♫

345
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,690
♫Slowly moving forward..♫

346
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,120
♫Slowly moving forward with me..♫

347
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,620
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

348
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,540
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

349
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,360
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

350
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,610
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

351
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,670
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

352
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,850
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

353
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,670
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

354
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,630
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

355
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,460
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

356
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,650
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

357
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,620
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

358
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,730
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

359
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,870
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

360
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:36,540
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying:♫

361
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,260
♫Please, don't go..♫
