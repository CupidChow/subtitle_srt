♫There was beautiful handwriting on the blackboard♫

is a son of bitch.

19
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,640
Hi, I would like to have five beers.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,400
Twenty skewers of meat, five skewers of tendons

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
and three grilled fish.

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,200
Okay.

23
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,200
Can you eat that much by yourself?

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,480
One more pair of chopsticks, please.

25
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,079
Okay.

26
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,970
Finally! Finally!

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,800
If you tease me again, just leave.

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,680
Don't drink this way. It'll hurt your stomach.

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,220
Leave me alone.

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
There are so many on the table. Why took mine?

31
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,240
I'd like to.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
Come on! I'll drink with you.

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,079
Actually, my mother...

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,079
She is nothing like that.

35
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,920
She never cared about me.

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,960
But she never did anything like that.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,520
She just looks down on my dad.

38
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
And money-oriented.

39
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,680
You are so lucky. Because your mother is still alive.

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,440
My mother has passed away.

41
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
I know what are you thinking.

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,800
Have you ever seen me tease anyone but you?

43
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
You've known about my family for a long time.

44
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
A little bit.

45
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
That's why you always messes up with me.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
And makes me angry.

47
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,650
So that...

48
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,640
You can get psychological comfort, right?

49
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm not messing up with you.

50
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
I care about you.

51
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,210
It's care.

52
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,280
I love you in a special way.

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,480
Don't take my toleration as mercy.

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
You are so brazen.

55
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,720
Actually, I had a girlfriend.

56
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,360
She was so beautiful.

57
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,200
And her family was rich.

58
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
But we broke up.

59
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,960
I haven't slept well these days for her.

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm telling you. I'm really upset now.

61
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,960
Take it easy.

62
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,600
It's good for you to break up with her.

63
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,520
I am fine.

64
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,800
See? I can walk in a straight line.

65
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
You don't have to help me.

66
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,080
I'm not drunk.

67
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,680
Are you sleepy?

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,360
Just take a nap.

69
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,480
You'll be home soon.

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,880
What? I don't want to sleep.

71
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,360
Are you trying to cut my clothes again, bastard?

72
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,440
Just shut up!

73
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,760
Or I'll throw you in the ditch!

74
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,880
Mother.

75
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,240

76
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,080
Finally, you are back.

77
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,800
I didn't even dare tell his grandmother.

78
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,720
Come in and have a seat.

79
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,880
You're welcome.

80
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,840
This is his school uniform.

81
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
Just wear it. It's so cold now.

82
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,400
I am fine.

83
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,120
Just make him warmer.

84
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,880
Here.

85
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,280
Okay. Thank you.

86
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,640
It's okay. He is in a bad mood today.

87
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,440
So he drank some beer.

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
He'll be fine tomorrow morning.

89
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,440

90
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,080
Sir, see you!

91
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,560
Okay. Be careful.

92
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,240
Such a good boy.

93
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
His parents must be excellent.

94
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,240
Yin.

95
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,200
Come on. Let me help you in. Be careful.

96
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,720
Let's go.

97
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,130
Dad.

98
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,040
You are back.

99
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
I've packed your bags.

100
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,760
Go home with me today.

101
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,480
I'll let the fight thing slide.

102
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,460
By the way,

103
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,480
I'll send someone to your school tomorrow

104
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,680
to finish the transfer formalities.

105
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
You will go back to your old school.

So is Jiang Yuan's child.

107
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,240
You will go to the same school.

108
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,720
You need to get on well with each other.

109
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,080
You have to accept your brother.

110
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,360
No way! It's impossible.

111
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm not discussing it with you.

112
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,400
You have to go back home with me today.

113
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
Whether you like it or not.

114
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,240
This is an order.

115
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,400
You are not my general. You can't give me orders.

116
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,240
I won't go back with you

117
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,360
even if you kill me today.

118
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,840
Brothers? What kind of brothers?

119
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,390
I am telling you.

120
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,080
I won't go back home if they are there.

121
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,520
What are you talking about?

122
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,750
What are you talking about? Say it again.

123
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,940
General. General.

124
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
He is such a temper.

125
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
It won't work even if you beat him to dead.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,280
Okay, you've let off the anger.

127
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560
You can go now.

128
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,120
I'm going to shower and go to bed.

129
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
I have to go to school tomorrow.

130
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,600
What do I owe you?

131
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,080
You bastard!

132
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,040
You can't live in such a big house without me.

133
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,000
I tell you what!

134
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,300
I'll cut off your living expenses.

135
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,360
You will come back home in a month.

136

What are you doing now?

138
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
You can cut off my living expenses from now on.

139
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,160
And see if I will go back home in one month.

140
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
Do you think I'm kidding?

141
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
Of course not.

142
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
I think you are fearless.

You got up so early today.

So did you.

155

Here.

Auntie.

158
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,400
Do you know how to wash off the bloodstain on the clothes?

159
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,360
Bloodstain on the clothes? It's easy.

160
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,640
Just put the clothes in cold water for about 5 minutes.

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
Then wash it with sulfur soap.

162
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,960
Your clothes?

163
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,640
Let me help you.

164
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
It's fine. I can wash it myself.

165
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,400
Are you sure?

166
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes.

167
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
Here is your takeout.

168
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,160
Get on. I'll ride you to school.

169
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,080
On this bike?

170
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,800
It will fall apart once I get on.

171
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,440
You walk to school everyday. How can you look down upon me?

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,200
Don't look to the side when you're riding.

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,440
The view on the side is better than that in front.

174
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,400
Do you live near here?

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
I've always lived around here.

176
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,680
I've never met you before.

177
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,360
I'm late for the first time today.

178
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,800
Usually, you are not up when I get here.

179
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I know all the neighbors around here.

180
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,000
Who's your dad?

181
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
Why don't you ask me

182
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,360
why I am late today?

183
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,200
I don't know.

184
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,640
You were drunk last night.

185
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,680
It was me to take you back home on my back.

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,240
You held me so tight

187
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,480
and didn't want to go back home.

188
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
You are so brazen.

189
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,480
There's no way I would hold you.

190
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,400
It's hard to say.

191
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,280
I was eating my kebabs.

192
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,320
And then you pounced on me,

193
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,680
saying "Hui. Hui.".

194
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,680
It was too disgusting.

195
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
You wanted to take off my pants

196
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,600
to see whose penis is bigger.

197
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,480
You know what?

198
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You are so shameless.

199
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
Didn't you refuse to get on my bike just now?

200
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,080
It seems like you prefer I make fun of you.

201
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,200
Hey! Sneak attack?

202
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,520
Why are you sitting backwards?

203
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,560
Because I don't want to look at you.

204
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,280
Did you carry me home last night?

205
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,440
You finally remember.

206
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,520
It's just my guess.

207
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,760
That's the second time.

208
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,200
When will you carry me in return?

209
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,600
You can walk by yourself.

210
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,000
And you can walk by yourself too.

211
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,080
Then why I carried you twice?

212
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,520
Who are you talking about?

213
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,720
Do you know how to ride a bike?

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
I am taking exercise in front.

215
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,840
And you are enjoying massage in the back.

216
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,240
What a natural way to keep in good health!

217
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,440
Good morning, auntie.

218
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,160
Good morning. What do you want?

219
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,400
Please give me two beancurd jellies.

220
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,440
Five sweet biscuits and two sugar cakes.

221
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,330
Okay.

222
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,520
Auntie.

223
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm the same with him.

224
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,120
I already ordered it for you.

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,600
What's wrong?

226
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,360
Nothing.

227
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,030
I haven't eaten such delicious

228
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,530
deep-fried dough stick for a long time.

229
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
Where do you usually have breakfast?

230
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,560
Wherever. There is no usual haunts.

231
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,560
I just have my breakfast optionally.

232
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,320
Here.

233
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,320
Thanks.

234
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,240
Why are you staring at me?

235
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,530
-What's wrong?
-Why didn't you

236
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,930
come with Bai Luoyin these days?

237
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,480
I haven't seen him when I walked to and from school these days.

238
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,880
I don't know what happened.

239
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,680
Here you are.

240
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,480
Yin, don't you live near Yang Meng?

241
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
Why did you come with him?

242
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,120
I just ran into him.

243
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,880
No...

244
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,080
Whose school uniform is this?

245
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,320
What do you think?

246
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,320
Do you think this is my school uniform?

247
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,520
Is this my school uniform?

248
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,040
It's the one you wore the day you fought Wu Fang.

249
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,720
Did you wash this?

250
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,440
No.

251
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,440
Come on.

252
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,080
You wouldn't let your family see this uniform.

253
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes, you're right.

254
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,520
Hello.

255
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,160
Hai, what are you up to recently?

256
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,880
Why haven't you contacted us?

257
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,760
Nothing.

258
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,080
I just go to classes and sleep.

259
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,300
It's quite easygoing.

260
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's meet this Saturday.

261
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,200
Right, don't forget Huzi.

262
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,440
He bought a new car

263
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,640
and wanted to have a racing with you.

264
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,560
Will you come to us or shall we pick you up?

265
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,280
I'll go for you.

266
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't come to me if there's nothing serious.

267
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,880
If there's something serious, call me first.

268
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,920
Then you can come with my approval.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,960
What the hell did you do?

270
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,760
Why are you so secretive?

271
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Nothing serious.

272
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,320
So that's it. See you on Saturday.

273
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,200
You can play drifting with this second-hand bike?

274
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,200
How do you know this is second-hand?

275
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,760
Bikes are often stolen here.

276
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,970
Your bike would have been stolen if it was new.

277
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,160
You should tell me earlier.

278
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,200
If I know I can steal a bike around here,

279
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
I don't have to buy it.

280
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,400
You live around here.

281
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,720
Don't you know that?

282
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,680
Let's go to school.

283
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,020
Let's go.

284
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,950
Let's go.

285
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,800
Tomorrow is Saturday, are you going out with me?

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,600
What?

287
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,240
Tomorrow is Saturday, would you like to go fishing with me?

288
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,880
I can't. I have something to do.

289
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,520
Forget it.

290
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,720
Fine. See you tomorrow.

291
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,760
Didn't you say you weren't going?

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
You must have misheard. It was too windy just now.

293
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,480
What are you doing? I am fishing!

294
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,360
All the fish have gone!

295
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Do we need to pay by weight

296
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
when we finish?

297
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,840
Do you think it's a fishing park?

298
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,560
There's nobody within three kilometers.

299
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
Who do you pay to?

300
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,920
Blockhead.

301
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Can you talk to me nicer?

302
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
Your face is so unpleasant

303
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,440
before you talk every time.

304
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,720
I tell you what!

305
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
I hate it when people pinch my face.

306
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,800
Are you sick?

307
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,600
Do I look like a psycho?

308
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,160
What else can you do?

309
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,320
I know how to pinch your face.

310
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,440
Hello, Li Shuo.

311
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,800
I forgot to call you.

312
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,960
Lulu was sick. I went back to visit her.

313
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
She is with you now? No...

314
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,040
How about it? Did you catch any fish?

315
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,280
Hello? Hello? Huzi.

316
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
I am busy fishing now.

317
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,880
I can't join you.

318
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,200
Are you with Li Shuo now?

319
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,560
Then why are you still calling me?

320
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,880
Are you kidding me?

321
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,520
I can't join you. I am busy now.

322
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,760
I can't go.

323
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
That's it. I'll hang up. Bye.

324
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
What are you doing there?

325
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,880
Don't go. I've turned off my phone.

326
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
Yin. Yin.

327
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,560
I've turned off my phone.

328
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,320
Do you have fun fishing alone?

329
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Stop talking.

330
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,360
Fine.

331
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,960
Such a big fish!

332
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,640
I am done!

333
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,640
What's wrong?

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,400
It's boring. I am done!

335
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,720
Don't. Come on.

336
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,440
Come on up!

337
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't be silly. The water is so cold.

338
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,000
Is it this one?

339
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,200
Yes, it is.

340
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,200
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

341
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,760
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

342
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,750
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

343
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,890
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

344
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,280
♫You held my hand that had been wavering♫

345
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,190
♫Slowly moving forward♫

346
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,890
♫Slowly moving forward with me♫

347
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,200
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

348
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,070
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

349
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,710
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

350
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,010
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

351
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,400
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

352
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,150
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

353
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:04,330
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

354
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,940
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

355
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,840
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

356
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,750
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

357
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,000
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

358
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,320
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

359
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,220
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

360
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:36,200
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

361
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,480
♫Please, don't go♫
