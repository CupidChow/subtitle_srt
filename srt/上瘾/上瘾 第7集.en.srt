Do you want hawthorn ones or yam ones?

22
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,320
How about hawthorn ones?

23

All right.

Goodbye.

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,400
Take it and just eat.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,080
Why did you just get one?

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm riding the bicycle and I can't eat it.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
It's super sweet.

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,280
Don't you want to have a taste?

32
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,680
Taste it.

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,200
Give me a bite.

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
No way.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
Stop eating. Go walk the bike.

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,840
Come on, let me have a bite.

37
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:36,880
Is it sweet?

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,000
It is.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
It's really sweet.

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
And there is no seeds at all.

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,440
Have another one.

No more.

It's not for you.

Yinzi! Yinzi!

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
I didn't understand the question.

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
Could you explain it to me?

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,800
This question

52
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,220
needs to solve for all known factors,

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,360
then you could get the answer.

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,680
I did, but I still can't get it.

55

Help me out, please.

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,240
Firstly, you need to work out the coordinates of E,

57

M and M minus, AKE equals...

58

Wait, wait. Go slower, please.

59
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on. I'll teach you. Come on.

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,720

Come on.

Thanks, Yinzi.

64
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,140
No, you don't.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,360
You don't get it, I'll help you.

66
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,620
I'm sure you won't get it wrong again.

67
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,380
Come on. You get it?

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,440
I get it, I understand.

69
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,140
Can you understand?

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,390
Yes, I can.

71
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:45,860
Can you solve it?

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,420
Yes, I can, I can.

73
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,070
Will you get it wrong again?

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,400
Will you get it wrong again?

75
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,440
Have some more of this.

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
It helps get rid of toxins.

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,640
Okay.

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
Hai still doesn't agree to come back, dose he?

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
Don't talk about that lad.

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm telling you,

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
if I don't teach him a lesson,

82
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,040
he'll never know how good he has it.

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,600
How about this? I'll go talk to him.

84
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,440
Don't do that.

85
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,760
He won't be nice to you.

86
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
It's because he isn't nice to me,

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
that I want to speak with him.

88
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,920
That's how you can settle this matter between you two.

89
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,720
Forget it, don't worry about him.

90
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,140
Worry about your own son.

91
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,860
He's been living

92
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
under hard conditions.

93
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,440
It's only proper to have him move in.

94
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
If he doesn't want to live in our house,

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,040
we can arrange an apartment for him.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,490
Isn't our place over by Guomao bridge empty?

97
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,360
If there's no other option, he can move into that one.

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
We can't do that.

99
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,640
That apartment is for Hai.

100
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
If you let Luoyin live into it,

101
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Hai would fight you to the death.

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,640
Forget it.

103
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,770
He is not going to come back to live in that way,

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
why should I keep an apartment for him?

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,760
I'd better talk to him.

106
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,330
Fine.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,480
What about Luoyin?

108
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm at the end of my rope with that child.

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,800
He won't even meet with me.

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,720
How about I speak with him?

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll talk with him.

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,920
The child is extremely stubborn.

113
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,080
Please don't get tough with him.

114
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,080
Don't worry. I got it.

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,440
I'll peel you a crab.

116
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,880
All right.

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,790
Where's the cheapest place to get clothes in Beijing?

118
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,530
Near the zoo.

119
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,570
Come to get some clothes with me tomorrow.

120
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,280
Okay.

121
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,280
Can you bargain? Teach me.

122
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,200
No need to learn that.

123
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,640
You'll get it naturally once you're there.

124
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
How much is this, Lady?

125
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,840
This one? I won't sell it for less than 39.

126
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm a vendor.

127

A vendor?

128
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Vendor price is 20.

129
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,460
Fifteen.

130
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
Impossible.

131
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,880
Just forget it.

132
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,400
Hey! Don't leave, young man.

133
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,940
If you really want it,

134
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,320
let's talk it over.

135
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
No way.  Let's go.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, okay, okay.

137
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,480
Choose whatever you like.

138
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,159
Young man,

139
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,800
you are too good at bargaining.

140
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,560
I'll take that one.

141
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,520
Okay.

142
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,400
Want anything else?

143
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,280
No.

144
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,800
Lady, how much is that?

145
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,600
This? At least two hundred.

146
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Two hundred?

147
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm a vendor.

148
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
How about 15?

149
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,360
A vendor?

150
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,740
Are you trying to rob me? I'm not selling to you.

151
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
15? You must be kidding.

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,500
No, if you don't give it to me for 15, I'll leave.

153
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,680
Get out of here.

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,140
You're crazy.

155
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,200
Do you think I have grass in my cotton padded jacket?

156
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,930
You don't want to sell it?

157
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Just forget it.

158
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
General, your guest is here.

159
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Come in.

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
Come on, boy, take a seat.

161
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,460
I think

162
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,480
you've already guessed the reason I brought you here today.

163
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,710
I'm your mother's new husband,

164
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,280
which means I'm your stepfather.

165
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Your mother went to see you before

166
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,380
and wanted you to move in with us.

167
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,160
You turned her down.

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,799
I already guessed that would be the result.

169
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,679
So my main goal today is,

170
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,520
as your elder,

171
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
to put forth some views

172
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,669
on your life and studies.

173
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,000
No, I shouldn't call them views.

174
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,440
These're only suggestions.

175
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,760
Thanks.

176
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,640
Come on, have some tea.

177
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,640
Right, young man should have some stubbornness in him.

178
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,520
You're like my son in that way.

179
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,740
To be honest,

180
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
you're the same age as my son.

181
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,480
He is also very stubborn

182
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,520
and he rarely listens to my suggestions.

183
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,280
But usually, he can calmly come to a conclusion

184
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,480
in the face of important matters concerning his well-being.

185
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,320
Men like us

186
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,040
shouldn't live

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,240
for the trifles, right?

188
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,080
Even if it's for your father,

189
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,830
I think you shouldn't

190
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,960
confine yourself to those circumstances.

191
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,590
You may see it as

192
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,440
a responsibility or loyalty to your loved ones.

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
But actually, it is a covert deprivation.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,320
It doesn't matter if you disagree on this point.

195
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,400
Let me put it this way,

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,880
I can help you

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,160
make a better-quality living situation.

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
You can choose not to accept,

199
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,000
but I think

200
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,480
you shouldn't let such a great opportunity slip by.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,440
If you're smart enough,

202
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,020
you shouldn't hold a grudge against your mother.

203
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,040
You should have all that she has

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,120
to make up for all that you lost for the years.

205
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,840
This, of course, isn't a gift,

206
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,450
nor is it pity.

207
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
This is something you should have.

208
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,000
If you don't cherish this,

209
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,190
then that means you're not yet mature enough

210
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
instead of meaning you have a courageous spirit.

211
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
I think you've misunderstood.

212
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,760
What have I misunderstood?

213
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,760
I've never intended to ask Jiang Yuan for anything,

214
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,360
because I've never seen her as my mother.

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,600
If there's nothing else,

216
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,750
I'm going back to class.

217
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,330
Luoyin,

218
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,060
you know it deep down

219
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,320
whether you've seen her as your mother or not.

220
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,840
If one day you become successful,

221
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,440
the one who will benefit from it is not me or your mother.

222
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,320
Thank you.

223
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,240
I think I'm a talented person.

224
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,600
Even if I don't take any shortcuts,

225
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,320
I will make something of myself.

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,520
How do you feel now?

227
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,760
It's fine, I think.

228
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,990
After all, I'm a little weak since I'm old.

229
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm fine.

230
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,320
Your son is back

231
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,520
-Hey, you're back. -Dad

232
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,120
Dahai!

233
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,700
Sir!

234
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,210
Don't leave today, just stay for dinner.

235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Okay. Since you've already said it,

236
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
I'll feel embarrassed if I still go.

237
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,870
It's fine.

238
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,200
Your auntie is making dinner today. He won't be maltreated.

239
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,440
Today, don't let Auntie make dinner anymore. You should do it.

240
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,600
This child...

241
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,080
Let's eat.

242
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Dahai.

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
Have a drink with Sir.

244
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,400
Okay.

245
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,580
Come on.

246
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,550
We haven't eaten yet, and you guys are drinking too much already.

247
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,920
Let's stop drinking already.

248
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,530
-Forget it, let's put it away. -Put it away.

249
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,490
Come on.

250
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,280
Come on and have more, Dahai.

251
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,560
Why did you drink that much when you haven't eaten anything yet?

252
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,640
Just have more.

253
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,040
Get the hell out of here.

254
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,520
I'm drunk.

255
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Stop kidding me.

256
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,920
Who are you kidding? Get up.

257
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,490
Don't be shameless when I'm still keeping my cool.

258
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,200
Come on, get up, get up.

259
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,660
What the heck?

260
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm really drunk.

261
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
What do you want?

262
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,880
It's going to be August 15 soon.

263
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
How do you guys celebrate August 15 in your family?

264
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,000
My family doesn't celebrate August 15.

265
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,520
Maybe we'll buy two pieces of moon cake at most.

266
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,240
What about your family?

267
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,560
We're also eating some moon cakes.

268
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
What flavor of moon cake do you like to eat?

269
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,480
Egg-yolk lotus seed paste.

270
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Bai Luoyin,

271
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,640
why did the teacher look for you today?

272
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,200
You insisted on staying here tonight

273
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,760
just to ask me this, did you?

274
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,170
Not really. I'm just afraid

275
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,240
that you'll get sick if you don't let it out.

276
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,680
I did tell you before

277
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,920
that my mother has remarried, right?

278
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,950
Yes, you said that.

279
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,920
Today, that guy came to talk with me.

280
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,560
He told me to move back in with them.

281
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,580
Did you say yes to him?

282
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
Of course, I didn't.

283
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,380
The thing I cannot accept the most is

284
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,640
the tone of his words.

285
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,950
He compared me to his son.

286
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,080
He praised his son like a golden boy

287
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
to make me look like someone who is shortsighted.

288
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm telling you, I'm also sick of this kind of people.

289
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,500
I'm telling you, just leave him alone.

290
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,760
If you're annoyed with him, then curse him.

291
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,370
Curse that his son who is going to hit by a car

292
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,820
and become paralyzed tomorrow.

293
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,040
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

294
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
I was just sitting here, and that thing fell.

295
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,640
Are you okay?

296
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,280
You're even laughing.

297
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,760
I'm telling you, stop hugging me.

298
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,480
What's wrong with hugging you?

299
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
It's gross.

300
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
What are you doing?

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,610
I just want to warm my hands.

302
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,740
Let go.

303
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,270
I'm not letting go.

304
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,970
-Come on, let go. -I won't.

305
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,480
I'll make you fall.

306
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Even if I fall, I won't let go.

307
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,960
[Class 27 of Senior Two]

308
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,660
Gu Hai, someone is asking for you.

309
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,520
I won't help you to go.

310
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,440
Let the one who likes to help you carry you.

311
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
I finally found you, my little master.

312
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,880
What are you doing here?

313
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,840
I have something to do with you.

314
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,360
Come on, let's talk inside the car.

315
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,320
Let's talk about it here.

316
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,640
I don't have the time to go out with you.

317
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,330
The problem is it's not me who wants to talk to you.

318
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,320
Then just go back.

319
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,920
General  has already said

320
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,800
I should not think of going back anymore if I couldn't get you.

321
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
What would you like to drink?

322
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,640
I don't want to drink anything.

323
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,040
Just get to the point.

324
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,319
Here is the thing. Your father and I have decided...

325
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,280
If it's about making me go back home, then you can save it.

326
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm not going back with you.

327
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,619
You misunderstood.

328
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,240
What your dad and I have decided is

329
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,560
for you to go back home, while we will move out.

330
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,800
Thus,

331
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,240
it's better than leaving you alone outside.

332
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,839
Even if the outside world is good,

333
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,760
it's not as good as home, is it?

334
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,859
Besides this,

335
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,400
your mother lived in that house for so many years.

336
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
You surely have feelings for that house.

337
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,020
Does it have anything to do with you

338
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,000
that when and how

339
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,360
I will go back home?

340
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,760
I realized that you are really very similar to my son.

341
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,680
You can choke someone with your words.

342
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
Don't get me wrong.

343
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,280
It's just

344
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,410
that I don't know what to say to you

345
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,680
every time I see you.

346
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,560
My relationship with my son is also like this.

347
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,720
Whatever I say,

348
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,240
he always has a hostile attitude.

349
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,120
It looks like I'm not very good at communicating

350
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,080
with your generation.

351
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
I will learn diligently

352
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
try to understand it more.

353
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,880
Have you finished?

354
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,520
If you've  finished, I'm going to leave.

355
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,080
Please wait a little more.

356
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,200
Even though you've never treated me as a mother,

357
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,480
I've already treated you as a son.

358
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,440
If you still don't like me,

359
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
I can move out first.

360
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,000
I could move back after your college entrance examination.

361
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,520
You are ridiculous.

362
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,920
If you really have this sincerity,

363
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,120
then why did you still marry my dad?

364
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,190
[Moon Cake]

365
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,240
I bought you some moon cake.

366
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,840
You can keep it for yourself.

367
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,120
I especially bought it for you.

368
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,230
Don't you really want to taste it?

369
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,000
You could buy it for anyone you like,

370
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,680
I already told you I don't want to eat...

371
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,880
How was it? Delicious, right?

372
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,800
I went to several stores,

373
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,360
but only this store was willing to make it.

374
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,400
There are twelve yolks in it.

375
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,680
You can eat enough at a time.

376
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Are you stupid?

377
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,840
You could just buy several small ones

378
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,000
instead of working so hard to buy this big one.

379
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,920
We can eat like a horse.

380
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,760
I want to have one with you.

381
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,640
This is the most suitable one.

382
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,840
I've been keeping something from you.

383
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,670
Are you going to say that

384
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,280
the house you're living in is just a rental?

385
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,440
How did you know that?

386
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,170
There's a couple

387
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,680
living beside the house you've rent,

388
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,080
and one is my grand uncle, the other is my grand aunt.

389
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you also want to tell me that

390
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
you actually come from a rich family?

391
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,600
Aren't you going to ask how I knew about it?

392
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
How did you know that?

393
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,440
When the school year started,

394
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,360
I had seen your driver pick you up at the gate every day.

395
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,320
And when you transferred to the desk behind me,

396
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,400
I saw you

397
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,520
wearing a limited-edition watch.

398
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,200
Laugh? I'll let you laugh.

399
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,400
Laugh? I'll let you laugh.

400
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,720
Don't you dare play dirty with me?

401
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,570
Who lied first?

402
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,230
Fine.

403
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,230
I got to admit my mistake first.

404
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,680
I lied to you first,

405
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
but you also did something wrong.

406
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,320
You must not indulge in shielding the prisoner.

407
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,000
How about this?

408
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,240
Don't be mad about this,

409
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,480
and don't distance yourself from me just because of this.

410
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,200
We're even now.

411
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,600
Are you really angry?

412
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm not the person who likes to get angry.

413
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,080
How could you think of me as a girl?

414
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,840
What I said that day when I was drunk

415
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,080
was for her and her family.

416
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't hate rich people.

417
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,650
There are so many luxurious cars on the street,

418
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,320
could I break every single one of them?

419
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
Why didn't you say it earlier?

420
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,320
You didn't give me the chance to say it.

421
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,550
♫ You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, ♫

422
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,680
♫ And stalling for time on your own. ♫

423
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,750
♫ I was smiling while listening to you. ♫

424
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,940
♫ But a tear-blurred vision faded in. ♫

425
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,920
♫ You held my hand that had been wavering, ♫

426
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,230
♫ Slowly moving forward... ♫

427
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,910
♫ Slowly moving forward with me... ♫

428
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,980
♫ Don't say I'd never understand. ♫

429
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,880
♫ Don't say I'd never feel the pain. ♫

430
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,060
♫ As the wind was blowing over, ♫

431
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,240
♫ It left some warmth on my lips. ♫

432
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,030
♫ Don't tell me you'll be here with me. ♫

433
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,160
♫ I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. ♫

434
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:17,150
♫ You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. ♫

435
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,990
♫ Don't say I'd never understand. ♫

436
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,860
♫ Don't say I'd never feel the pain. ♫

437
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,000
♫ As the wind was blowing over, ♫

438
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,900
♫ It left some warmth on my lips. ♫

439
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,960
♫ Don't tell me you'll be here with me. ♫

440
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,160
♫ I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. ♫

441
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:49,070
♫ You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying: ♫

442
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,790
♫ Please, don't go... ♫
