172
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,440
Right.

173
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,360
Why did he cut you?

174
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,280
When we were kids, we fought for a slice of watermelon,

175
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,540
he couldn't win me,

176
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,090
and then he gave me a cut with the fruit knife.

177
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,940
So do you

178
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,080
take it for granted that he gives you money

179
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,960
and treats you well?

180
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,920
I didn't force him. He did it of his own free will.

181
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,960
But to be fair,

182
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
your brother is more handsome than you.

183
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,450
"A man shouldn't lose his grace."

184
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,200
When we were little,

185
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
we went out to fly kites together.

186
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
But the kite string was broken,

187
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,480
and we chased for the fallen kite.

188
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,520
I was crying while chasing

189
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,720
and my brother was laughing while chasing.

190
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,830
What do you mean by that?

191
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,570
Can't you see it from this little thing?

192
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,400
My nature is good.

193
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,670
My brother is evil.

194
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
I'm just being curious.

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,170
That kite had fallen,

196
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,630
you could just go and pick it up,

197
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,760
why did you cry?

198
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,490
Aren't you stupid?

199
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,440
Forget it. Go to sleep.

200
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,290
Brother,

201
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,430
when will you leave?

202
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm not sure yet.

203
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Before returning home,

204
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,760
I planned to finish things here in six or seven days.

205
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,960
But the speed of people here handling things made me so...

206
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,520
I'm afraid it'll take another week.

207
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
You should leave

208
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
as soon as you finish your business.

209
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,320
Why do you want me leave?

210
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,310
I remember you were the one

211
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,120
who called me to come back the last few times.

212
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,290
But this time, why do I feel like

213
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,100
you're not happy seeing me?

214
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,840
I...

215
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
I just think you're too tired of jet lag all day.

216
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,310
Hai,

217
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,260
this time I come back here,

218
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,160
I feel that you have changed a lot

219
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
and even known how to care for others.

220
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Please don't talk with sarcastic tone, okay?

221
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
What about your little brother?

222
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,710
Why are you asking about him?

223
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,690
Just curious.

224
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,310
What would you like to eat?

225
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,470
How about two packs of rice crust?

226
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,720
What kind of flavor would you like?

227
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,570
Chicken flavor.

228
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,440
Okay.

229
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,220
Hello, could you get me

230
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,250
two packs of "rice flavored cock"?

231
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,500
Come on, get me two packs of "rice flavored cock".

232
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,450
We really don't have such things here.

233
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,079
Keep the change.

234
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,690
Is that really so funny?

235
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,960
Gu Hai, that was a retribution

236
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,910
for you not taking things seriously all the time.

237
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,670
Now you're slipping of your tongue!

238
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,230
I just want to eat it, what, is there a problem?

239
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,160
Tonight, I'll eat yours.

240
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,160
It's not over, is it? Stop laughing!

241
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,470
"Rice flavored cock" !

242
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,080
Did you forget to lock the door?

243
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,160
You're back.

244
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,540
Why are you here?

245
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,140
Your father asked me to come and have a look.

246
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,780
He's worried about you guys living here.

247
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,800
Where did you get the key?

248
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,120
Your father gave it to me.

249
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,900
He had made two sets of keys for this apartment.

250
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,640
One for you

251
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,870
and the other was kept by him,

252
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,290
just in case

253
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,930
when you need something,

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,920
we could come to see you.

255
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,040
Even if you want to come here,

256
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
you should let us know first.

257
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,520
I don't have your phone number,

258
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,180
so I couldn't contact you.

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,570
I didn't move anything in this house,

260
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,900
just did some cleaning and organizing.

261
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,060
Luoyin, come here.

262
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,160
Luoyin, sit on the couch.

263
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,500
Luoyin,

264
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,300
I heard your dad and that woman got married.

265
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
So what?

266
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,480
What do you think?

267
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,280
The woman had a child of her own.

268
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
Do you think she will treat you well?

269
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,730
Look, you father just got married,

270
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,800
and they kicked you out.

271
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
I was willing to come here.

272
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
Would you stop slandering my dad

273
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,960
every time you see me?

274
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,960
All right, all right.

275
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,240
Are you feeling good about yourself

276
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,140
by putting him down?

277
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,040
I just feel sorry for you.

278
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,640
You're so young

279
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
and you need to be loved and cared.

280
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,960
They can't just let you be.

281
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,760
I had my own difficulties in the past

282
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,320
and couldn't take good care of you.

283
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,040
Now I have the opportunity and the ability,

284
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,130
I want you back

285
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,280
and let me make up for it, okay?

286
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,960
It's too late.

287
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,180
Yin,

288
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,220
do you want to take a bath together?

289
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,600
Coming.

290
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,250
Look at you boys,

291
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,600
how could you be so close?

292
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm so happy to see this

293
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,760
and I feel so relieved now.

294
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,360
What took you two so long?

295
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,120
Shouldn't we take more hot baths during winter?

296
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:48,920
That's true.

297
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,640
Come on, come on.

298
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,680
You two just sit down.

299
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,680
I just peeled some apples.

300
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,830
Have some.

301
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,800
No. I'm going back to my bedroom to do my homework.

302
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,600
Sit down.

303
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,080
Come on.

304
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,560
It's not necessary to do your homework.

305
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,720
It's just for the exam-oriented education.

306
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,550
Now, you should let your brain

307
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,280
relax and have a good rest.

308
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,000
And you really don't need to

309
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,440
do those boring homework.

310
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
Just think about it, even if getting into a famous university

311
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,510
and studying for four years,

312
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,320
those coming from the bottom are still at the bottom.

313
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,020
Son, your hair is too wet.

314
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,600
I'll blow it dry for you.

315
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,140
No, I can dry it myself.

316
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,200
How can that work?

317
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,280
If you don't get it dry, you will get a headache in the morning.

318
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,830
I've been like this for more than a decade

319
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,640
and I never got a headache.

320
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,390
Yeah, it's been ten years.

321
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,160
You are such a big boy.

322
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,560
There are many bad habits that have been formed.

323
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,710
It's hard to change now even if you want to.

324
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,430
All right, I'll do it for him.

325
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,200
I've never blown dry. I'm not used to it.

326
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,460
Come on, just get your hair dry

327
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,240
and we can go to bed.

328
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,490
Your dad suggested you two to study abroad.

329
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,330
Foreign education is not at the same level as here.

330
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,160
I enjoy my life now.

331
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,060
For me, going to a regular high school

332
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,920
is an essential part of life experience.

333
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
It's the same to go to a high school abroad.

334
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,440
You could make new friends

335
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
and also get many wonderful life experiences.

336
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,320
Moreover, it will be more valuable and meaningful.

337
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,360
All right, it's dry.

338
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,920
Don't waste your time on me anymore.

339
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,320
I don't have the good habit of letting parents make decisions for me.

340
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,890
Luoyin.

341
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,180
Our brains

342
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
need full relaxation and rest.

343
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,040
So, could you please just leave?

344
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,800
Well, take care of yourselves.

345
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm leaving.

346
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,560
It's really annoying.

347
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,800
How could she have the key?

348
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,630
If she come here everyday, how can we live our lives?

349
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,240
We must change the lock quickly.

350
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,750
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

351
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,580
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

352
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,950
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

353
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,140
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

354
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,120
♫You held my hand that had been wavering♫

355
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,430
♫Slowly moving forward♫

356
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,110
♫Slowly moving forward with me♫

357
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,180
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

358
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,080
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

359
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,190
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

360
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,440
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

361
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,230
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

362
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,360
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

363
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:04,350
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

364
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,190
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

365
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,060
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

366
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,200
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

367
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,100
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

368
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,160
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

369
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,360
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

370
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:36,270
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

371
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,990
♫Please, don't go♫
