♫A bike was cycling along the sidewalk♫

♫There was beautiful handwriting on the blackboard♫

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Turn to this side. Sleeping like that is not good for your heart.

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,500
Turn around to sleep.

19
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,479
Turn around to sleep.

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,480
Did you hear me?

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720
I'm talking to you!

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,640
All right, all right.

23
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,920
I won't bother you. Go to sleep.

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,930
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

25
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,510
Do they have to flirt like that while playing?

26
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
Stop, it's time for me to get on the field.

27
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,440
You Qi is so handsome!

28
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,560
Pass me the ball.

29
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
You Qi, pass me the ball.

30
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,839
You Qi is so handsome! You Qi is so awesome!

31
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,040
What are you doing?

32
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,940
What are you doing?

33
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,810
What team are you from? Get out!

34
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,100
Stop beating me.

35
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,100
-So what?
-Beating is a foul!

36
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,700
So what?

37
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,130
You Qi, just go back and keep acting cute.

38
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,659
Damn you! Don't you dare push him!

39
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,270
Gu Hai, Gu Hai, leave him alone.

40
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,020
Just take a look at Yin first!

41
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,760
Wait for me!

42
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,520
Yin!

43
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,960
Yin, let me see.

44
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,500
Yin!

45
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,420
Are you okay?

46
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,120
I'm fine. I'm fine.

47
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,640
Is this fine for you?

48
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,440
-Damn it.
-I'm fine.

49
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
Who hurt you like this, Yin?

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,080
Let me have a look.

51
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm fine. It won't leave any scars.

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
You! It's a good move

53
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,240
to take revenge for our Yin.

54
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,010
Hey girl.

55
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,320
What are you saying?

56
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,710
Who's the girl?

57
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,450
It's you!

58
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,040
You...

59
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,410
Gu Hai! That's enough.

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,330
Well. What's wrong with him?

61
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,920
Nothing.

62
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,470
Is he okay?

63
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,240
Just leave him alone.

64
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,790
Get on!

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,760
What?

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,040
What?

67
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,120
I asked you to get on the bike.

68
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,260
I'll do it myself.

69
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,650
Mom, give me the chopsticks.

70
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,530
One pair is enough.

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
Dad, I'm home. Hi, Grandma.

72
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,730
What's the matter with your face, son?

73
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,120
Nothing, I just fell down.

74
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,340
Let me have a look.

75
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,860
It's okay. It's just a little skin scratch.

76
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,670
Where's Hai? Why didn't Hai come with you?

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,640
He's dead.

78
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Dead? How?

79
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,140
All right, forget it.

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Just go ahead and do your thing.

81
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,920
Nothing.

82
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,300
What's good to eat today?

83
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,260
Why didn't you wait for me?

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,420
Yin said you were dead.

85
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,980
I'm dead? Dead?

86
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,400
Who are you talking about?

87
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,080
Who told you to come?

88
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,960
Aren't you willing to talk to me?

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
I wasn't ignoring you.

90
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,280
It's you who wanted to think that.

91
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,930
I already got medicines from the infirmary,

92
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,909
why did you buy these?

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,640
You bought it in the infirmary with someone else,

94
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,080
but these are bought by me.

95
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,600
How could they be the same?

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,930
Don't throw them away.

97
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,400
Let's take a shower together later.

98
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,560
I will help to clean your body.

99
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,210
Your wounds need to avoid contacting with water.

100
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,040
I just scratched my face,

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
how can it affect me during the shower?

102
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,850
You have also wound on your leg.

103
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,020
It's just a bit swollen.

104
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,330
It's not really wounded.

105
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,240
It's normal that two guys have a shower together,

106
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,400
why are you so embarrassed?

107
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,720
I don't even want to look at you.

108
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,730
I still feel worried about you.

109
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,799
Get out of here.

110
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,280
Fine, fine. I'm not looking.

111
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,300
What a freaky voyeur!

112
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,040
We'd better not disinfect it

113
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,200
and just apply ointment on it.

114
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,440
Don't move. Don't be scared, it won't hurt.

115
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,620
Didn't you say it wouldn't hurt?

116
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,560
You really believe what I said?

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,830
Does it still hurt?

118
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,640
Don't let that effeminate guy

119
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,670
go around you anymore.

120
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,360
Can you speak more politely?

121
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,100
He just looks that way, it's not my fault.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,610
Yang Meng is my childhood friend.

123
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,140
Yang Meng?

124
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,510
He should get another cute name since he's so cute.

125
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,940
Are you done?

126
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,960
Okay.

127
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,760
Are you crazy?

128
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
What's wrong with you teasing me

129
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,540
instead of sleeping?

130
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,260
I've been staying here for about a dozen nights,

131
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,780
why haven't I ever seen you masturbating?

132
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
Even if I do it, I won't let you see.

133
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,090
When do you do it usually?

134
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,640
I've been following you 24 hours a day

135
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
but still haven't seen it.

136
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
Is it interesting to talk about it now?

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,160
Isn't it the topic usually discussed at night?

138
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,390
Get out if you continue messing up with me.

139
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,720
We are all men. What if I touch you?

140
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,980
Haven't you heard that

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,370
letting some guy check on you,

142
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,310
and you'll do better in bed in the future?

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,840
Bullshit, I've never heard that.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,380
Even without you checking on me,

145
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm still the best.

146
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,270
It sounds like you've got a lot of experience.

147
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,330
What? Have you done it?

148
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,260
It's none of your business.

149
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,100
Are you a virgin or not?

150
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,950
Ask yourself first.

151
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,240
If you are, then I am.

152
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,960
How about

153
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,150
telling me about your first time with your girlfriend

154
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,150
and I'll tell you about my first time with my girlfriend?

155
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,370
I don't want to hear your first time.

156
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,370
Don't you want to hear an exciting story like that?

157
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,810
Exciting?

158
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,280
Wasn't it just the two guys do it with each other?

159
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,140
Who are you talking about?

160
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,650
Did it hurt?

161
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,160
Go to sleep.

162
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,030
Don't! Tell me about it.

163
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,690
For what?

164
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,500
Just satisfy my curiosity.

165
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,780
I'm particularly interested in your performance in bed.

166
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,200
Are you embarrassing me?

167
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
I've broken up with her.

168
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,800
If you don't tell me, it's surely because you're not that good.

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,850
Then tell me about your first time, okay?

170
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
My first time, huh?

171
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,080
That's mind-blowing.

172
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,160
Mind-blowing? Tell me about it.

173
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,190
My first time,

174
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,710
Jin Lulu and I...

175
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,320
I can't think about it anymore. It makes me so thirsty.

176
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,840
It's too exciting.

177
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,260
Have you ever tried to get someone else to help you out?

178
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
It's great.

179
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,320
I like to do it by myself.

180
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,300
We're brothers!

181
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,750
What's wrong with helping each other?

182
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,740
Go away!

183
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,280
Where are you going?

184
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:28,970
I'm going to pee.

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,270
It's such a cold day,

186
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,860
if you let junior Yin freeze,

187
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,180
I'll be mad with you.

188
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,320
-Thanks.
-Auntie.

189
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,950
It's you two.

190
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,130
What?

191
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,630
Are you gonna eat here or take to go?

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Why have you changed your tables and chairs?

193
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,840
Last night a bunch of guys came and smashed them.

194
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,690
-Smashed?
- Yeah.

195
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,400
Who are they? City inspectors?

196
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,140
[Breakfast and Snacks]

197
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,580
Don't ask. It wasn't them.

198
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,030
Here. Take it and go to school. Come on.

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
Go to school. Go.

200
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Just go.

201
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,570
Give me two pancakes.

202
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,750
Sure.

203
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,210
Does your dad wanna marry Aunt Zou?

204
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,290
Why do you care so much?

205
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,890
I'm just asking.

206
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,580
Mr. Zhang.

207
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,680
Here comes the young master.

208
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,520
Come in, sit down, please.

209
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,300
Sit down, please.

210
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,440
Gu Hai, how is General Gu doing lately?

211
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,240
He's great. And you?

212
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,170
Not bad. I'm fine.

213
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,800
Mr. Zhang.

214
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,280
I need your help with something.

215
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,870
Go ahead.

216
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,010
I want to find a storefront on this street.

217
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,190
Storefront?

218
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,720
What for? You want to do business at such a young age?

219
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,230
Not me. It's for my aunt.

220
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,250
Aunt?

221
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,780
Which aunt?

222
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,050
Please don't ask. Just help me find one.

223
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,960
Alright. Whatever the young master says.

224
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,510
Okay, Mr. Zhang, I'm leaving.

225
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,150
Okay.

226
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,440
Take care.

227
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,890
This is a good dog. Is it yours?

228
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes, it was a gift from someone else.

229
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,780
Okay, let me take him home for a couple days.

230
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,700
Young Master, you can't play with it.

231
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,730
This dog is fierce.

232
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,540
What could I do if it bites you?

233
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,710
It's gonna be fine, I have a professional dog trainer.

234
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,830
I won't treat your dog badly.

235
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,470
Don't worry.

236
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,760
Let's go.

237
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,700
Well, it's...

238
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,630
Yin! Good news!

239
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,560
What's up?

240
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,090
Your Aunt Zou happened to attend a government-organized program

241
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,900
that is to support peddlers.

242
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,780
And they're gonna give her a storefront at the intersection.

243
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,100
To support vulnerable groups,

244
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,220
they are gonna let her rent it for free for a period of time.

245
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,370
I'm going to clean up the store for her.

246
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,620
A free lease?

247
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,770
Why haven't I heard of such a project?

248
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,460
I haven't heard of it, either.

249
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,380
Anyway, it's just in time.

250
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,720
Thank you for helping Aunt Zou.

251
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
What are you thanking me for?

252
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,860
Don't be stupid.

253
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,160
She's also my auntie.

254
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Why don't you go home?

255
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,050
I had a fight with my dad and I don't want to go back.

256
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,200
Then you can stay in my house.

257
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,600
My house is a little run-down,

258
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,750
but we treat you with all our hearts.

259
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,170
Since you came,

260
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,990
my dad's cooking has improved.

261
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,160
I can tell

262
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
he really likes you.

263
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,880
What about you?

264
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,640
Have a guess.

265
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,770
I think you really treasure me.

266
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,359
Bai Luoyin,

267
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,000
how can I like you so much?

268
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,700
What did you say?

269
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,520
Nothing.

270
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,390
You're all here!

271
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:28,910
Here you are.

272
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,930
Let me introduce to you.

273
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
This is my new friend from school,

274
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,800
Bai Luoyin.

275
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,220
He's quite handsome.

276
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,360
This is Li Shuo.

277
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm Zhou Sihu.

278
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,040
Hai, sit down.

279
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,140
Hasn't Hai really

280
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
dated a new girlfriend at school?

281
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,400
No.

282
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,000
What did I say?

283
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,290
No one could be as loyal as

284
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,270
Hai to Jin Lulu.

285
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,900
You know Jin Lulu, right?

286
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,320
Yeah, I've met her once.

287
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,240
Let me tell you,

288
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,810
Hai is so good to Jin Lulu.

289
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,410
You haven't seen them together.

290
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,640
If you really saw them,

291
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,400
you definitely wouldn't recognize him.

292
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,200
Let me tell you,

293
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,080
don't think he's always cold.

294
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,070
When he sees Jin Lulu,

295
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,500
he'll smile so much that the wrinkle could leave for days.

296
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,530
Whenever we talk,

297
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,120
it's always about Jin Lulu.

298
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,560
Our ears are going to fall off.

299
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,680
Usually if we want something from him,

300
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,420
we've got to go to Jin Lulu first.

301
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,800
As long as Jin Lulu asks him for help,

302
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,690
Hai would never say no.

303
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,950
Isn't Gu Hai just like that?

304
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,250
What are you talking about?

305
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,360
Nothing.

306
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,060
Try this.

307
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,600
It's a little strong.

308
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,280
Strong?

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,110
I think it's pretty good.

310
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,360
Doesn't Hai never drink out of someone else's drink?

311
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,000
Did Gu Hai masturbate with you guys before?

312
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,760
Wait and see.

313
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,990
Go away!

314
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,600
Did you see that?

315
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,800
Hai hates people touching him.

316
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,880
If it's really like what you said,

317
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,100
then what you'd see is our corpses.

318
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,080
Come on.

319
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,360
Cheers.

320
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,230
Cheers.

321
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
Isn't it suffocating sleeping like this?

322
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,010
Let me loosen it up for you.

323
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,880
Stay away from me.

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,060
Why are you doing this?

325
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,250
If you're not sleeping, then get out.

326
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,660
I just don't think you're warm enough.

327
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,310
What does it have to do with you?

328
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,910
I'll help you get warm.

329
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,930
Are you crazy?

330
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,710
You're like this every night.

331
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,210
Can't you just sleep?

332
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,350
I'm telling you, I'm very sleepy today.

333
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,290
Yin.

334
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,090
Do you think it's normal?

335
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,440
What's not normal?

336
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,180
That's who I am.

337
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,550
I like being close to my bros.

338
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
Did you see Li Shuo?

339
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,300
We are always close together like we are one person.

340
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
Every time I touch him,

341
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,200
he's always obedient.

342
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,720
But when it comes to you,

343
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,200
how could it be so difficult?

344
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,430
Come on.

345
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,100
Today, Li Shuo already told me

346
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,020
that he never did that thing with you.

347
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,630
That... that's just because he's too ashamed to admit it.

348
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,680
He's as bashful as I am.

349
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,010
Why did you ask him that?

350
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,740
You don't really want to do it with me, right?

351
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,200
Or you just wanted to ask him first so you can be more prepared.

352
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,760
How come Lang barks so hard tonight?

353
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
I'm gonna go check it out.

354
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Damn it.

355
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
After all this time, I'm no better than a dog?

356
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,150
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

357
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,980
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

358
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,350
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

359
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,540
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

360
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,520
♫You held my hand that had been wavering♫

361
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,830
♫Slowly moving forward♫

362
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,510
♫Slowly moving forward with me♫

363
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,580
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

364
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,480
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

365
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,590
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

366
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,840
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

367
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,630
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

368
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,760
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

369
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,750
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

370
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,590
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

371
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,460
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

372
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,600
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

373
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,500
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

374
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,560
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

375
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,760
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

376
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,670
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

377
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,390
♫Please, don't go♫
