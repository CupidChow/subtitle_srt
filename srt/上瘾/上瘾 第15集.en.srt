Who called at this time?

174
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,560
Harassing phone call.

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,460
What are you afraid of, Yin?

179
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm afraid of pain.

180
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,120
I didn't expect you actually have something to be afraid of.

181
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,090
Or how about letting me give you a try?

182
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Come on, I have no problem.

183
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,280
Hello?

184
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,420
Where's Bai Luo Yin?

185
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,290
Who are you?

186
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,140
I'm sorry, I'm looking for Bai Luoyin.

187
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,960
Would you please give him the cell phone?

188
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,660
If you don't tell me who you are,

189
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,740
then I won't help you.

190
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,890
I'm his girlfriend.

191
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,540
Girlfriend?

192
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,590
I'm his boyfriend!

193
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,910
Are you still admiring this watch?

194
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,260
I have never seen this side of you.

195
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,320
Why?

196
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,100
I was out there for a while

197
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,250
and you've already started missing your former lover?

198
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,920
Does this bring back your old memories?

199
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,760
Are you feeling ups and downs now?

200
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,300
And are you reminiscing

201
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,640
the highlights of your romantic love life?

202
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,870
Gu Hai, will you cut it off?

203
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,020
I just opened this drawer

204
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,800
and happened to see this watch, so I took a closer look.

205
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,910
You were making such a fuss over it,

206
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
acting like a drama queen.

207
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm a drama queen?

208
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,950
I was joking with you.

209
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,930
If you weren't feeling guilty,

210
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,850
why would you get so worked up with me?

211
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,000
By the way, your girlfriend just called.

212
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,810
Oh my Gosh! Is she really your girlfriend?

213
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,450
Shi Hui, please don't do this anymore, okay?

214
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,270
I've told you everything I wanted to tell you.

215
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,220
I don't want to repeat it again.

216
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,960
We broke up, but we can still be friends.

217
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,990
Is it wrong to have a chat as a friend?

218
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,800
In my opinion, we are strangers after breaking up.

219
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,630
Bai Luoyin.

220
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,070
If you truly don't care anymore,

221
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,400
why bother picking up the phone to talk to me?

222
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,960
I don't mind,

223
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,349
but someone else might.

224
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,930
Bai Luoyin. What... what do you mean?

225
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,270
I had a new partner now.

226
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,859
That's all.

227
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,349
You're back!

228
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,310
Yes, I am.

229
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,960
Open it, take a look.

230
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,640
What are you doing?

231
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,240
These are for you.

232
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,670
Gifts for me?

233
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
Let me help you put it on.

234
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,760
Are you out of your mind?

235
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,580
Why would a grown man like me

236
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,810
wear so much jewelry?

237
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,440
They're not just for you, I will wear them as well.

238
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:54,980
Come on.

239
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,220
You didn't show up this afternoon

240
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,580
just to buy these stuffs for me, did you?

241
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,760
Not just these, there's more.

242
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,840
Have a look.

243
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,640
Where did you get so much money from?

244
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,820
When my brother left,

245
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,770
he gave me 200,000 RMB.

246
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,100
Didn't you say you'd use the money for your daily expenses?

247
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,700
Yeah, I didn't spend it all. There's still some left.

248
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,980
How much money do you have left?

249
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,430
Let me see...

250
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,390
About this much.

251
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,920
Gu Hai.

252
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,480
You did all this just because of that watch? Are you serious?

253
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,620
Even if you don't waste all this money,

254
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,280
she and I will never be together again.

255
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,910
Are you serious?

256
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,220
Why would I lie to you?

257
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,370
Why didn't you say it earlier?

258
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,630
You didn't even let me explain!

259
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,860
Come with me!

260

[A husband who doesn't want to sleep with wife isn't a good one.]

Hurry!

262
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,980
I bought it on the spur of the moment.

263
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,410
Where did you get so much money?

264
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,010
I spent the money in the saving account that my mom left me.

265
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,690
I don't regret it.

266
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,420
Even if you don't regret it, I do!

267
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,290
Why do you say so?

268
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,800
I don't regret going bankrupt

269
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,540
to buy things for you.

270
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,300
A couple of days ago, I saw a news

271
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
saying that a man had sold his kidney

272
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,000
to buy a necklace for his girlfriend.

273
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,940
Compared with him, I'm pretty reasonable.

274
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,620
At least, all this are affordable to me.

275
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,040
Compared with him? That guy was literally crazy!

276
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,080
Who hasn't had a youthful and reckless time?

277
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,950
Am I right?

278
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,710
You just don't love me that much.

279
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,270
Who knows who you're thinking about right now?

280
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,220
Are you doing this again?

281
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,000
It's freezing in here.

282
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,480
Let's go sit in the car.

283
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,400
How is it? Is it comfortable?

284
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,080
Yes. It's very comfortable.

285
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,060
What about this?

286
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,460
This is more comfortable.

287
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,240
Gu Hai, do you want me to hit you?

288
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,030
Come and give me a try!

289
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,190
The more you hit, the more I'll be turned on for you.

290
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,490

We're in the garage.

293

What's wrong with the garage?

294
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,410
There's no one else in the garage, just the two of us.

I could meet all your requirements,

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,580
if you really do something that hurt me,

300
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,910
I will not be soft on you.

♫Please, don't go...♫
