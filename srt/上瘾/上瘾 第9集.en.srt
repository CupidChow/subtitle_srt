♫A bike was cycling along the sidewalk♫

♫And then it stopped at the corner store♫

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:47,350
♫There was beautiful handwriting on the blackboard♫

♫And I saw your smile of ardent love♫

♫The sun was shining on the playground♫

17
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,580
Yin.

18
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,160
Look, look.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,440
There are some blisters on the corner of my mouth, right?

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,400
It's quite painful.

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,080
Wait a moment, I have some ointment.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
No need for the ointment, OK?

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,880
A kiss will heal everything.

24
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,580
Where?

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,760
Here.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
Here. Right here.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,680
What kind of ointment is this? It's working so quickly.

28
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,900
It's the hemorrhoids ointment.

29
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,640
It's fine. You can apply this ointment everywhere.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
Last time I had mouth sore,

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,040
this did a lot of help.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,060
Don't worry.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,980
Really? Are you sure?

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,140
If I don't have any blisters,

35
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,320
will this ointment have any side effects when applied?

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,640
Side effects?

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,990
It might give you two hemorrhoids as side effects.

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,460
Oh my God. It's stinky.

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,440
Time to sleep.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,800
I need to wash it up.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,720
No need for washing.

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,120
I have to...

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,190
It's OK. Don't wash it away.

44
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,200
The smell is so strong that I can't fall asleep.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,850
It's unbearable.

46
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,750
Just endure it a bit. It will be fine when you wake up tomorrow morning.

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
I need to wash it away. Let me go.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,930
I have to.

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,840
Seriously?

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,160
Yes!

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,570
Have a try.

52
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,480
You're amazing, can't believe you managed to fix this!

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,280
Old-school phones like this are usually quite durable.

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,300
You're not taking any of these things with you?

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,720
Take a look, if you think anything is useful, you can take it.

56
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,260
Take a look, do you think

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,840
our handwriting are somewhat similar?

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,090
Why didn't you tell me when you were practicing calligraphy?

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,260
Due to these few essays lately,

60
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,520
the Chinese teacher has ignored me now.

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,440
Then you ignore him back.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,720
I should ignore you.

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,780
Then try it.

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,980
Give it to me.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,440
I haven't finished it.

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,769
That's my paper.

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,269
I still need this with my calligraphy practicing.

68
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,380
Nonsense!

69
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,240
What are you doing?

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,730
You want to have a fight, huh?

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
So what? Give it to me.

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,420
So what?

73
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,530
I won't give it to you.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,590
What?

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,020
What brings you here?

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,409
Why do you even ask?

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,980
It's now the weekend.

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm busy moving out today, as you can see.

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,270
And I don't have a mobile phone.

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,740
So I can't contact you.

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,180
No phone?

82
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,920
What is it then?

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,750
This phone has been broken

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,780
for a while now, right?

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,960
Broken?

86
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,820
You call this as broken?

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,250
Who allowed you to throw it like that?

88
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,420
After all the times we argued and broke so many phones,

89
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,160
now you're going to fall out with me

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,100
over this thing?

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,610
Yin just got it fixed for me!

92
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,940
He fixed it. So what?

93
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,200
I just threw it and now I'm going to stamp on it!

94
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,280
Kill me if you can.

95
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,700
It's just a phone.

96
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,680
Gu Hai, you're such an animal.

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,500
Go chase her now.

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,670
Gu Hai!

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,040
Why should I chase her?

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,360
Because she came all this way to see you.

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,930
Because she's been in this relationship with you for three years.

102
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,140
Because you slept with her.

103
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,680
Yin, you know that

104
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
I only listen to you.

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,850
You really want me to chase her?

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,620
Sure. You have to.

107
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Girls can easily get into troubles,

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,640
when their emotions are out of control.

109
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,950
Move now.

110
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,340
Lulu, Lulu.

111
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Gu Hai, this is the first time that

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
you chase me after we had a quarrel.

113
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,830
Alright, let's not make a scene like this in the future.

114
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,480
I won't do that again.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,610
I won't do that anymore.

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
You are moving out, right?

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Let's go. I'll help you.

118
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,730
My package...

119
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
That boy has moved all the things away.

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,250
Where are you gonna move?

121
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,330
Move into Yin's place.

122
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,400
I'll stay at his place these days.

123
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,540
Gu Hai.

124
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,480
What?

125
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,790
Don't you think

126
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
you are being too kind with Bai Luoyin?

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,280
Every man has a bro.

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,650
Why do you always have issues with him?

129
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,049
I'm telling you,

130
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,000
you don't know him well.

131
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,039
If you know him as a person,

132
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,299
you will definitely like him.

133
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,120
Although he's family is poor,

134
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,320
his thoughts are very profound.

135
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,620
He has a unique taste.

136
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
He doesn't smile much,

137
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,170
but deep down,

138
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
he's mild on the outside but wild on the inside.

139
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
If he wants to be kind to you

140
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
but feels shy to express it,

141
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,360
he'll secretly be good to you.

142
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,130
If you expose his intentions

143
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,310
he'll be angry at you.

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,040
His bark is much worse than his bite.

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,040
He is very kindhearted.

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,080
I've been freeloading at his place for such a long time,

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
and he pretended to kick me out every day.

148
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,670
But if I don't go back home for half a day,

149
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
he will be the first one who worries about me.

150
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,440
By the way,

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,620
he is very smart.

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,770
The lock of our classroom,

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,040
he got it fixed.

154
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,540
The classroom can now be locked from the outside

155
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,560
just by pulling the string from the inside.

156
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,980
Plus, my phone.

157
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,500
It has been soaked in the river for a while,

158
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
and he managed to fix it.

159
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,120
Don't tell me,

160
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,110
you're going to move in to places like this for real?

161
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,910
Gosh. It's so cold outside.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,360
He's using the cold water to wash face.

163
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,280
Will they ask you to wash your face with cold water as well?

164
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,910
Lang.

165
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,190
Gosh. Why is there such a big dog here?

166
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,240
How about going out for diner together later?

167
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,950
OK. Let me change my clothes.

168
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,240
OK.

169
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,000
Gu Hai is better to you than to me.

170
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,360
What makes you say so?

171
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,700
He always keeps a poker face in front of me.

172
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,240
But he always wears a smile in front of you.

173
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,460
You said that,

174
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,440
you would feel safe if I was being cold.

175
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,550
You know what,

176
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
men have two sides

177
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,800
when it comes to their girlfriend and their bros.

178
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,560
In front of their girlfriend,

179
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
they have to maintain their charming image.

180
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,560
So they have to pretend and keep a poker face.

181
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,290
That's how they can keep you hooked.

182
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,290
But in front of their bros, it's different,

183
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,660
they don't need to care about their image,

184
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,920
they can be carefree and mischievous.

185
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,560
That's why you feel that he's more closer to me.

186
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,520
You see,

187
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,370
he's more eloquent than you.

188
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,520
You give Bai Luoyin a punch.

189
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,800
Why should I punch him?

190
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,890
No reason.

191
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,470
I just want to see it.

192
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,490
You guys

193
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,340
always have a fight for fun, huh?

194
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,750
Are you bored?

195
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,820
Gu Hai, I'm just kidding.

196
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,020
Why are you so angry at me?

197
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,170
Are you so reluctant?

198
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,540
He's a dude.

199
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,440
Of course he can handle a punch.

200
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,050
It's just a mild touch.

201
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,370
Can't you do that for me?

202
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,280
No.

203
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,080
Nobody can touch him, including me.

204
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,850
Gu Hai, you are so disgusting.

205
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,740
Then get out of here.

206
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,670
Don't regret.

207
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
Why did you piss her off again?

208
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,290
What do you mean?

209
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,900
You also saw that unreasonable side of her just now, right?

210
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I can't spoil her.

211
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,760
I don't even know how you two

212
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,120
ended up together.

213
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,000
Both of you need some space to calm down.

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,870
You can't keep quarreling like this.

215
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,160
What's this?

216
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,280
Is it for me?

217
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,970
Of course. It's already in your hands now.

218
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,060
Otherwise, who else am I gonna give it to?

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,220
Yin, you are so kind.

220
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,280
Hug my dad if you want to.

221
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,100
He paid for it.

222
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,360
He insisted on buying it for you.

223
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,600
I couldn't stop him.

224
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,160
Sir, thank you.

225
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
You don't need to thank me.

226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,970
If it weren't for Yin who took me to the store,

227
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,100
I couldn't even tell

228
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,450
the difference between a good phone and a bad phone.

229
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,000
I think,

230
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,120
as long as it is sturdy and can make calls,

231
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,350
then it's a good phone.

232
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,160
Yin said that was not enough.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,200
We had to buy a good one for Hai.

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,500
A fully functional smart phone.

235
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,000
Sir, don't listen to him. That's nonsense.

236
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,400
Don't swagger after gaining it, OK?

237
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,560
What about you? What do you use?

238
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,090
I don't need a phone.

239
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,870
I have no one to contact with.

240
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,390
It's a waste for me to buy a phone.

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,020
You can contact with me.

242
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,180
Come on.

243
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,400
You are staying with me 24/7.

244
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,200
I don't even need a phone to contact you.

245
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,780
According to you,

246
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,880
I also don't have anyone to contact with.

247
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
I don't need this as well.

248
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,840
Come on. I'm counting on this phone

249
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,960
to distract some of your attention.

250
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,720
Then will you hate this phone for that, huh?

251
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Back off.

252
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,600
Sir,

253
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,680
What are you doing?

254
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,410
You know it rained the other day.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,960
There's a small leak in the roof,

256
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,210
and our freshly dried corn cobs

257
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
got soaked.

258
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,420
So, I'm heading up there to patch it

259
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,640
Sir, come down. Let me do it for you.

260
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,140
You don't know how to fix it.

261
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,920
I can. Give it to me.

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
Dad,

263
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,920
come down.

264
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,870
Let him climb to the roof.

265
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,080
Otherwise, he lived in our home for free every day.

266
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,310
How could you say this?

267
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Let me do it.

268
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,370
Are you sure?

269
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Yes. Don't worry.

270
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,790
Sir, hold this coat for me please.

271
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,220
-Be careful. -I got this.

272
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,310
The cement is all mixed and ready. Just smear it on the hole.

273
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,820
OK.

274
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,880
Put the cement on the roof first.

275
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,540
Right. It's there.

276
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,000
Here?

277
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,650
Yes. The side.

278
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,080
OK.

279
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,520
Why doesn't your father open a shop with Mrs. Zou?

280
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,870
Why should he?

281
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,410
That place is a hit.

282
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,920
They don't have to pay shop rent or taxes there,

283
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,810
and it also have government's support.

284
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
It's a pure money-making deal.

285
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,260
Mrs. Zou can't handle it all alone,

286
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,620
so if your dad helps out,

287
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,530
it's like their own shop.

288
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,760
Isn't that way better than just earning those trivial salaries?

289
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,590
That's not gonna happen.

290
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,920
My father, he won't be willing to do that.

291
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,900
Why not?

292
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,400
Come here.

293
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,490
What? Mrs. Zou is not...

294
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,730
a widow?

295
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Mrs. Zou has a husband.

296
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,630
He is working outside.

297
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
You mean,

298
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,220
they are afraid of the gossips?

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,700
I always feel like she's lying to my dad.

300
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,330
I guess she has divorced her husband.

301
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,920
You see,

302
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,950
she has lived here for so many years.

303
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,480
But her husband never came back during the holidays.

304
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,470
Is that normal?

305
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,760
Are you listening?

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,690
I heard that.

307
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,500
You mean Mrs. Zou is not a widow?

308
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,300
Yes. But my father always denies that.

309
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,970
I guess,

310
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,060
your dad knows it very well.

311
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,070
Your dad is so close to some other woman.

312
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,310
Don't you feel a bit of uncomfortable?

313
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,400
No.

314
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
I once persuaded my father to marry her.

315
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,910
From what I can remember,

316
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,410
he's been a single dad all along.

317
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,270
I can't let him live like this forever, right?

318
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,590
Have you ever considered to

319
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,960
let your dad remarry your mom?

320
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Never.

321
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,410
I prefer Mrs. Zou.

322
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,910
I don't want to see my father suffer again.

323
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,750
In fact, my father

324
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,359
not joining Mrs. Zou to open the store

325
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,160
isn't just because he's worried about what people might say.

326
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,230
You see, this shop belongs to Mrs. Zou

327
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,900
my father definitely feels embarrassed to get involved in it.

328
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,579
We are both men.

329
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
We can relate to that.

330
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,830
If it were any other woman

331
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,210
there might be a chance,

332
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,680
but with Mrs. Zou, it's impossible.

333
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,180
Right.

334
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,420
Be carful, man.

335
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,450
Mr. Bai,

336
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
the factory manager has something to tell you. Go to his office now.

337
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,000
Hurry up.

338
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,830
OK. OK.

339
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,670
Sir.

340
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,860
-Bai, you're here. Come here. Have a seat. -OK.

341
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,670
-Have some tea. -OK. Thank you.

342
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,800
Bai, our factory decides to fire you.

343
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,360
Sit down. Sit down.

344
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,760
Director, you know my situation.

345
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,890
My son just started high school,

346
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,180
we need money to support his study.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,190
I also have to look after the elder in my family.

348
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,430
I have to pay for the medicine every month.

349
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,230
If not so,

350
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,780
with your more than ten years of experience as a senior worker,

351
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,670
I'd really hate to let you go.

352
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,940
Then why do you fire me?

353
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,090
You are driving our family

354
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,980
to the wall now.

355
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,890
How could you say that?

356
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,890
I'm not driving you to the wall.

357
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,690
It seems that they haven't called you yet.

358
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,660
Who?

359
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
You really didn't receive their message.

360
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,640
Alright, I'll give them a call now.

361
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,500
Come in please.

362
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,940
Finally you're here. Have a seat.

363
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,750
I was about to call you,

364
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,150
No need to call me.

365
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm here.

366
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,110
Who is this?

367
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,510
This is Bai.

368
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,100
This is the one you are looking for.

369
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,720
Mr. Bai, nice to meet you.

370
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,940
Sorry. My hands are dirty.

371
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,160
Bai, this is

372
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,560
the HR manager of Tong Jie Refrigeration Equipment Company.

373
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,400
His name is Miao.

374
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,060
You can call him Manager Miao from now on.

375
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,070
Then you two have a chat first.

376
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,520
I have some business to do.

377
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,830
Please help yourself.

378
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,530
OK. OK.

379
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,780
Mr. Bai, here is the thing,

380
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,280
our company wants to hire you

381
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,030
as the engineer in our technology department.

382
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,590
Your take-home pay will be 20,000 yuan per month.

383
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,960
Every month,

384
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
we will provide you a travel allowance.

385
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,380
And 5,000 yuan of housing subsidy.

386
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,010
Meal allowance, and transportation allowance, each amounting to 2,000 yuan.

387
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
You work eight hours a day,

388
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,000
and enjoy weekends and holidays off...

389
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,880
Manager Miao,

390
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,340
does your company print counterfeit money?

391
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,910
Mr. Bai, you are so humorous.

392
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,810
I'm not being humorous.

393
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,610
The conditions your company offers are so unreliable.

394
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,290
Mr. Bai,

395
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,400
Mr. Bai, this is my business card.

396
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,320
Please take it.

397
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,930
I guess you've worked here for over a decade.

398
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,660
You probably know

399
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,120
the business of this factory.

400
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,800
Half of the components used in our company

401
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,600
were produced by your factory.

402
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,460
And I also know your factory manager.

403
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,850
You can trust me.

404
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,970
The point is I know nothing about the technology.

405
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,060
Don't worry.

406
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,230
We'll arrange someone to guide you.

407
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,980
If so,

408
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,500
you can directly hire a real engineer.

409
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,140
That would be more convenient.

410
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,030
Mr. Bai,

411
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,940
if you are still hesitant,

412
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,850
then,

413
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,760
come with me to visit our company now.

414
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,770
We have

415
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
prepared the office for you.

416
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,710
What's the occasion today?

417
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,790
Dad, you look like you're already drunk without even having a drink.

418
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,520
I got promoted.

419
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,080
Promoted?

420
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,900
Are there any different positions in that old factory?

421
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,420
Not in our factory.

422
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
It's another company.

423
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,060
They invited me to work there as an engineer.

424
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,680
Dad, are you sure it's not a fraud?

425
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,660
How could you say that?

426
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,390
I have signed the contract.

427
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,640
The treatment is very good there.

428
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,420
They were afraid that I didn't believe them.

429
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,410
They even gave me 5,000 as the guarantee deposit.

430
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,240
If you are available tomorrow,

431
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
I'll take you to see my new studio.

432
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,880
Gu Hai, come here.

433
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,580
What?

434
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,270
Did you arrange my father's promotion?

435
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,880
Your father's what?

436
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,820
Quit acting.

437
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,680
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past,♫

438
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,630
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

439
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,420
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

440
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,760
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

441
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,110
♫You held my hand that had been wavering♫

442
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,010
♫Slowly moving forward♫

443
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,440
♫Slowly moving forward with me♫

444
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,940
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

445
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,860
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

446
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,670
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

447
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,930
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

448
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,980
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

449
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,170
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

450
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:59,990
♫You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying♫

451
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,950
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

452
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,780

453
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,970

454
