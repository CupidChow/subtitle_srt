It's not same last time.

161

Leaving school will let him be punished and stay in a hotel.

169
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,970
Will you go with us?

170
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,070
What's wrong with him?

171
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,060
-Why is he always upset? -Never mind.

172
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,850
Leave him alone. Let's go.

173
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,910
Go inside.

174
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,650
It's enough.

175
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,480
Okay, stand here.

176
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,900
Hi, my boy. Where's Gu Hai?

177
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,930
Yinzi, come out.

178
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
What's the problem?

179
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,920
Why didn't you ask Hai in?

180
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,140
Did he offend you?

181
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,110
As I said, you have always been a stubborn boy.

182
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,530
Gu Hai is a good boy.

183
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,620
I don't have such a good brother.

184
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,040
-If I... -I did ask him in.

185
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,760
But he refused.

186
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,380
-You must have upset him. -I haven't.

187
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,920
Anyway, ask him in now.

188
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,440
I won't.

189
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,750
Okay, I'll do it.

190
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,670
No..

191
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,360
Gu Hai,

192
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,100
you're a bastard.

193
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,290
Hai,

194
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,830
come in.

195
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,660
Forgive my stubborn boy.

196
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,250
Dad, leave him alone.

197
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,830
-Let him stand here. -You should be standing here.

198
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,390
Don't worry about me, sir.

199
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,970
It's very cool

200
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,480
to stand here.

201
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,020
Aren't you coming in?

202
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,950
But you told me to stand here.

203
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,370
Leave him alone, dad. Let's go back to the house.

204
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,220
-Ask him in... -Don't worry, dad.

205
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,290
Come in.

206
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,250
How long do you want to stand?

207
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,900
Get inside.

208
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,020
When did you plug it in?

209
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,250
Use it, or give back to me.

210
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,280
Your hand is so cold.

211
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,180
You were standing outside and my dad was upset.

212
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,530
How could I stay in my room?

213
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,060
-Don't move. -I'm fine.

214
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,200
Don't move.

215
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,490
Yinzi, what happened to your foot?

216
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,860
You don't know?

217
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,840
Someone went crazy and gave me a kick.

218
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,310
-Does it hurt? -Of course it hurts.

219
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,230
Stop! My dad is there.

220
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,090
I don't care. I want to kiss it.

221
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,770
I feel guilty.

222
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,450
I'm just kidding. It doesn't hurt at all.

223
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,690
It's normal for me.

224
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,180
I'm fine. Leave it alone.

225
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,530
Gu Hai!

226
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,800
It was my fault.

227
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,190
I know it.

228
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,650
I shouldn't have offended your buddy.

229
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,870
But, Yinzi,

230
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,960
It's true that I could hardly control myself.

231
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm extremely insecure.

232
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,970
If you can give me a clear answer,

233
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,970
I won't mess around like this.

234
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,690
Insecure?

235
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,690
We provide you with free food every day.

236
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,690
What else do you want?

237
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,910
You know what I want.

238
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,070
Yinzi.

239
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,990
Gu Hai.

240
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,660
Stop! Gu Hai.

241
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,130
Gu Hai.

242
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,810
I want you, really.

243
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,660
Please stop.

244
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,140
I really want you.

245
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,810
Never again!

246
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,880
If you want to have the feeling of security from here,

247
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,740
you'll never get it.

248
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,240
Yinzi,

249
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,400
don't get me wrong.

250
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,590
This is not the reason why I want to be with you.

251
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,100
I'm a normal man, too.

252
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,070
If I like to do this,

253
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,230
I could find a girl.

254
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,320
It's just because...

255
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,680
...I like you too much.

256
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,550
So I can't control myself.

257
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,370
In fact, you're the purest boy in my eyes.

258
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,910
-So I'm very reluctant to touch you. -Gu Hai,

259
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,970
Both of us are male.

260
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,920
I can't do that with you.

261
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,280
Then answer me,

262
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,670
do you like me?

263
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,640
You can't ask another boy like this.

264
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,450
But I have to ask.

265
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,960
Do you like me?

266
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,470
Are you stirred a bit by me?

267
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,180
Good Night!

268
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,130
Why are you not willing to admit it?

269
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,200
You know it. Why bother to ask?

270
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,329
Yinzi!

271
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,900
Yinzi!

272
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,310
-Yinzi! -Hurry up. Yang Meng's here.

273
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,740
Him again!

274
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,020
-Listen, be nice to him. -Got it.

275
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,920
-Hurry up. -Yinzi!

276
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,550
Bai Luoyin.

277
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,820
Yinzi...

278
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,090
Hi.

279
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,910
What're you looking at?

280
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,580
Hey, you two have been living together?

281
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,870
Yeah, almost two months.

282
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,770
But you don't like sleeping with others.

283
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,700
He hasn't got a place to sleep. How can I do?

284
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,400
-I have to accept him. -What?

285
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,750
Is he...

286
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,570
...the son of your stepfather?

287
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,150
The son of the general?

288
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,560
Has your mom married his dad, or his mom married your dad?

289
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,050
What you think?

290
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,490
My mom has married his dad.

291
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,290
Then why does he live in your house? It's not logical.

292
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,430
He can't get along with his dad.

293
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,470
I'm mad at my mom.

294
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,570
-So, that's all. -What?

295
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,210
I see.

296
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,410
It's getting colder.

297
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,210
Our dog is getting bigger.

298
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,920
It's time to take a bath for him.

299
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,450
You'll do it later.

300
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,160
He's dirty.

301
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,920
Alang.

302
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,660
We'll give you a big meal.

303
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,960
Look at him.

304
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,430
Alang.

305
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,760
Yinzi.

306
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,180
-What? -Look.

307
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,610
I think they should get married.

308
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,360
Do you think it's very easy?

309
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,620
I hope they'll marry soon.

310
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,680
Why?

311
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,230
If they get married,

312
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,940
you'll become The Extra Man.

313
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,570
Then we can live together in the small house. It'll be great.

314
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,980
Let's go, Alang. Leave the fool alone.

315
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,100
Come on, Alang.

316
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,270
Dad.

317
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,350
Marry her.

318
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,050
What?

319
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,570
Marry her.

320
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,490
Yinzi...

321
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,550
Is it a right time to get married now?

322
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,360
We've got through a dozen years of hard life.

323
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,200
If I get married now,

324
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,370
I'll feel bad for you.

325
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,640
Nothing will make you feel bad, dad.

326
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,670
You've sacrificed a lot for me all these years.

327
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,010
It's time for you to start a new life now.

328
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,580
Yinzi.

329
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,550
You're the one

330
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,210
I love most

331
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,280
in my life.

332
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,050
Come on, dad.

333
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,500
In fact, I want you to get married.

334
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,020
If you get married,

335
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,780
I'll get my freedom.

336
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,680
Help yourselves.

337
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,030
Take care of the guests inside, girl.

338
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,940
Here we are. The last dish.

339
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,760
-Okay. -Let's begin now.

340
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,310

-Congrats. -Thank you.

344
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,280
Help yourselves.

345
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,740
-Tongtian, call him dad. -Call him dad.

346
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,910
It's time to give him a red pocket.

347
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,700
-Call me dad. -Is the money enough?

348
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,810
Does he need more? Then I'll give him all.

349
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,860
-Call him dad. -Dad.

350
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,650
-Loudly. -Dad!

351
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,120
-Great. -Yeah!

352
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,120
-Cheers. -Cheers.

353
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,360
-Cheers. -Cheers.

354
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,800
-Cheers! -Cheers!

355
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,340
-Have you two given red pockets?
-Cheers, Yinzi.

356
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,130
No money, no drinking.

357
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,300
-Cheers. -Cheers.

358
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,890
-Cheers. -Cheers.

359
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,990
Come on. Bite it! Bite it.

360
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,220
Bite it! Bite it.

361
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,770
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

362
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,670
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

363
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,770
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

364
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,750
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

365
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,420
♫You held my hand..♫

366
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,190
♫...that had been wavering♫

367
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,210
♫Slowly moving forward..♫

368
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,830
♫Slowly moving forward with me..♫

369
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,040
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

370
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,960
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

371
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,720
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

372
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:26,100
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

373
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,360
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

374
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,270
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

375
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,090
♫You held my hands too tightly..♫

376
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,280
♫...to hear what I was saying♫

377
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:45,120
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

378
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,030
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

379
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,730
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

380
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,040
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

381
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,330
♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

382
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,470
♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

383
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,280
♫You held my hands too tightly..♫

384
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,180
♫...to hear what I was saying: ♫

385
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,900
♫Please, don't go..♫
