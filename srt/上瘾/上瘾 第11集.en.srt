Gu Hai. Gu Hai.

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,139
Where is Bai Luoyin?

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,060
Where is Bai Luoyin?

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
I don't know.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,420
He hasn't been to school for two days.

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,220
Don't you live near him?

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,040
You don't know?

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
No, I don't.

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,140
I haven't been to his home for a long time.

27
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,240
Then let's go to his home after school.

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,340
I'm a boarder, so teachers will come to check.

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,120
Maybe we should wait.

30
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,980
If he still doesn't show up tomorrow,

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,540
then we can go to visit him on Sunday.

32
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,280
Don't wait until Sunday, let's go today.

33
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,520
Why are you so worried?

34
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,960
He just took a two-day off.

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,860
If something really happened to him,

36
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,900
someone would come to pack his stuff.

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,120
You're too calm.

38
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,480
I thought you were sympathetic.

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,460
I never expect you are such a person.

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
Yang Meng, good for you.

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,440
What's wrong with him?

42
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,960
Yin, Yin.

43
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,760
Baby boy.

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,940
Sir, you're home.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,640
You haven't come here for a while.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,180
Why are you here?

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,079
If I hadn't followed you here,

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,340
how could I know your dad call you 'baby boy'?

49
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,520
He is not my dad.

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,900
He's Bai Luoyin's dad.

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,720
Nice to meet you, sir.

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,400
You're also Yin's classmate, right?

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,920
Such a good-looking boy.

54
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,720
Sir, where is Bai Luoyin?

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,820
He is sleeping.

56
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,240
He went to bed so early?

57
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,960
He went to bed this morning.

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,640
He should be awake by now.

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,760
Is, is he ill?

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,660
No. He's just sleepy

61
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,460
and wants to sleep.

62
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,240
-Baby boy. Come over here.
-Okay.

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,880
Help me trim the vegetables. come on.

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,960
Why are you here?

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,780
You haven't been to school for two days.

66
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
So I came here to see you.

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,940
You had quarrels with Gu Hai?

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Why him?

69
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,880
Don't you think

70
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,360
your feelings for him are special?

71
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,880
What's wrong?

72
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,140
Nothing.

73
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,800
I just don't wanna go there now.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Send me back.

75
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,340
Return the same way we came?

76
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,940
Or you just left your bag at home?

77
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,640
It's Gu Hai's homework.

78
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,140
I intended to give it to him myself.

79
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,000
Now that he didn't come to school,

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,220
I'll leave it with you.

81
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,500
Where is Gu Hai?

82
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,140
You don't know where he is?

84
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,100
Are you two trying to

85
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,800
go to school in turn?

86
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,180
You are here today, and he'll come tomorrow.

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,220
And then integrate the knowledge together.

88
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,760
Gu Hai was here yesterday?

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,400
Yeah.

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,540
He was here when you were absent for two days.

91
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,440
Hai,

92
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm glad you broke up with your girlfriend.

93
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,960
When you were together,

94
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
I felt embarrassed to tell you.

95
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,659
What's so good about Jin Lulu?

96
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,100
She may be pretty and good-shaped,

97
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,240
but there are lots of pretty girls out there.

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,200
You're too good for her.

99
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,540
He's right.

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
She's always acting arrogant,

101
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
throwing her weight around,

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,520
and considering herself a somebody.

103
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,100
If it were not for you,

104
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,640
I would've quarreled with her for several times.

105
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,120
You should've broken up with her a long time ago.

106
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,420
Look at these waitresses here,

107
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,680
they are all prettier than her.

108
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,800
That's right.

109
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,660
You're handsome and rich.

110
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,300
Every girl would want to date you.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,260
You're right.

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,500
Waitress. Wait...

113
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
Hai. What's the matter?

114
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,300
Am I...

115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,540
Am I not being good enough to you?

116
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,040
I've never been so good to someone before.

117
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,560
You've never been so good to anyone.

119
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,260
Then why did you say those cruel words?

120
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,380
Because I'm lowly.

121
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,160
I'm so lowly.

122
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,860
Who is lowly?

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,940
Hai, where did you learn to bite people?

124
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,120
What has Jin Lulu done to you?

125
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,700
Yin, I miss you.

126
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,640
Hai.

127
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,760
Get up.

128
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
Let go of me.

129
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,100
I thought you didn't care.

130
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,800
Hai, get up.

131
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,560
I thought you didn't care.

132
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
No, Hai. Listen to me.

133
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,800
I must sleep with you today.

134
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,900
No, Hai, Hai.

135
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,740
I'll change my name

136
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,320
if I can't make you feel comfortable.

137
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,180
No.

138
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,720
Hu, Hu, help me out.

139
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,920
Hu.

140
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,340
I heard that Gu Hai is going to transfer, right?

141
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,980
How do you know that?

142
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,700
I went to your teachers' office just now

143
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,039
and I heard them talking about it.

144
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,360
Hi, Mr. Gu.

145
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,400
Someone came looking for you. He said he is your classmate.

146
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,480
Can he come in?

147
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,040
Yes.

148
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,400
Okay. Please wait a moment.

149
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,660
Why are you here?

150
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I got something for you.

151
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,540
You think I still need those craps?

152
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,940
It's your business.

153
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,940
Our teacher asked me to do so.

154
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,860
You can throw them away

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
if you don't want them.

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,860
These are your stuffs.

157
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,500
I gotta go.

Is that the best you can treat me now?

161

How do you want me to treat you?

I never cried for anyone else.

165
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
Just go.

166

♫I'm willingly to feel you breath♫

177
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,240
Dad.

178
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,140
You come back so late.

179
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,660
Where have you been?

180
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,400
I brought something to my classmate.

181
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,340
Yin.

182
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,320
Hai hasn't been here for a while.

183
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,120
Tell me the truth.

184
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,360
Did you have quarrels with him?

185
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,680
No.

186
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,820
No?

187
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,860
Then why doesn't he come here?

188
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,440
He has his own home.

189
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,080
He is rich.

190
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,460
What's with him living in our house every day?

191
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,720
Yin, let me tell you.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,620
Hai is such a good lad.

193
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,360
How can you find another friend like him?

194
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,940
It's common for you guys

195
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,680
to have quarrels.

196
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,900
You're a grownup now.

197
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,000
You should be broad-minded.

198
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,720
You can't sever ties with such a good friend

199
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,440
just because of some trivial matters.

200
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,780
It's not worthy.

201
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,240
I can't be broad-minded about this.

202
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,060
He's just a child,

203
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,860
what could he has possibly done to you?

204
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,620
He stole your girlfriend?

205
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,860
No.

206
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,200
His dad stole your wife.

207
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,800
What, what do you mean?

208
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,300
His father has married my mom.

209
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,200
It's...

210
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,020
Did you know about it at first?

211
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,840
Or he just kept it from you

212
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,380
and approached you on purpose?

213
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,020
Wait.

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,460
What am I trying to say?

215
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,780
Wait. I mean...

216
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,140
Neither of us knew that at first.

217
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
Mom came to see me the other day

218
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,360
and ran into him.

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,160
That's how I know that.

220
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,220
So, you both didn't know at first?

221
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,000
What a coincidence.

222
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,080
What do you young people call this?

223
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,540
Destiny. It's destiny, right?

224
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,200
It's great.

225
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
Now you're even closer.

226
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,880
You can drop in to see him

227
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,400
when you go to visit your mom in the future.

228
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,840
Dad.

229
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,660
Don't you care?

230
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,700
Why should I care?

231
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,820
You mom has gone for so many years.

232
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,680
No.

233
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,820
I mean, we got divorced many years ago.

234
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,360
It's fine for her to marry someone else.

235
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
She is a woman.

236
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,720
It's great for her

237
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,220
to have someone to rely on.

238
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,720
I know. She has talked to you many times.

239
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,860
But you shouldn't hate or resent her.

240
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,460
After all, she is one of the few people in this world

241
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,760
who really cares about you.

242
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,820
I think she is very selfish.

243
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,860
Who isn't?

244
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,640
If it were you,

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,300
you would choose to live all by yourself?

246
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,820
Then why didn't you tell me before?

247
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,680
You never let me.

248
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,300
What should we do now?

249
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,160
I've already severed ties with him.

250
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,360
Listen to me, apologize to him.

251
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,860
And then continue your life.

252
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,180
I won't apologize to him.

253
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,980
What?

254
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,860
Why are you so stubborn?

255
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,580
Did he ask his dad to marry your mom?

256
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,520
He is also a victim of the broken marriage.

257
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,100
I won't apologize to him.

258
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,800
What? What do you want me to say?

259
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,940
-Dad.
-It's...

260
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
Dad. Don't worry.

261
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,940
I know what to do.

262
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,920
I'm telling you.

263
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,240
You have to bring Hai back

264
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,860
within three days.

265
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,880
Alright.

266
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,180
Remember that.

267
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,220
I get it.

268
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,600
-I'm sorry.
-How dare you hit me?

269
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,740
Boy, you need to come with us.

270
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,020
Let go of me.

271
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,360
Let go of me.

272
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,060
-Don't move.
-Let go of me.

273
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,320
Tie him up. Hurry up.

274
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,120
Let go of me.

275
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,320
Let go of me.

276
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,820
Let go of me.

277
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,800
Who are you?

278
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,740
-Let go of me.
-Hold him.

279
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,480
Let go of me.

280
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,180
Let go of me.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,760
I've never been such a loser in my life.

282
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,820
Look at my hand.

283
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,360
You see? My finger is hurt.

284
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,020
Stop it.

285
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,640
When I was in the army,

286
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,900
no one dared to fight against me.

287
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,360
We suffered great losses today.

288
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,840
I told you that we should bring more people.

289
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,840
But you refused. Look at us.

290
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,080
How could I know that he is so fierce?

291
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,680
Alright, stop it. Just drive..

292
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,720
The employer is waiting for us.

293
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,420
Let's go.

294
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,940
What do you want?

295
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,599
You tell me.

296
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,060
Don't you wanna leave me?

297
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,260
Don't you wanna make a clean break with me?

298
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,760
Then I'll imprison you here.

299
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,500
You have no where to go.

300
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,400
You... You...

301
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Baby.

302
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,700
You have already known that

303
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,040
I have special feelings for you, right?

304
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
So, you shouldn't be surprised

305
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,660
that I kissed you.

306
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,980
Gu Hai, what the hell is wrong with you?

307
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,580
Take it easy.

308
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,160
Just hear me out.

309
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,080
You can curse me after that.

310
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,760
I don't have a lofty image in your heart anyway.

311
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,700
I'll let it collapse today.

312
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm telling you,

313
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,280
I never regard you as my buddy.

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,320
The reason why I've been so nice to you

315
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,840
is because I like you.

316
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,980
The reason why I've slept on the same bed with you

317
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,000
is because I wanna sleep with you.

318
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,620
I even dream about that.

319
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,420
What?

320
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,860
You think I'm nasty?

321
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,640
You think I'm sick, right?

322
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,300
I can tell you,

323
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,180
it's your responsibility.

324
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,240
You must've known

325
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,820
my nasty thoughts a long time ago.

326
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,100
And you still tried to seduce me on purpose.

327
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,820
Bai Luoyin.

328
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
I don't regret at all

329
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,040
for what I said today.

330
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,920
Don't you wanna curse me?

331
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,500
Come on, do it.

332
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,100
I wanna know how you're gonna curse me.

333
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,120
I won't.

334
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,400
You're desperate, right?

335
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,820
Regret knowing me, huh?

336
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,320
You want me to piss off, huh?

337
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm telling you. No way.

338
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,580
You made me fall for you and now you wanna walk away?

339
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,440
Gu Hai.

340
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,040
You're gonna pay for what you said.

341
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,460
I don't care.

342
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,300
As long as I can see you everyday,

343
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,880
I can take anything.

344
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,840
Well.

345
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Listen carefully.

346
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,980
I actually came to apologize to you today.

347
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,880
I talked with my father for a long time yesterday.

348
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,760
He doesn't care about who you are at all.

349
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,620
And he wants me to bring you home.

350
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,700
And then, I got kidnapped this morning.

351
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,600
Being tied here

352
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,340
to be humiliated by a psychopath.

353
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,280
You tell me, what should I do?

354
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,780
Untie me.

355
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,820
You...

356
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,020
You're telling the truth?

357
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,840
Of course.

358
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,760
What if it's a trap?

359
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,880
Then I'll be tricked by you again.

360
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,560
Sir.

361
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,420
Hai.

362
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,080
Why haven't you come to play recently?

363
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,120
I miss you.

364
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,340
Sir, did Yin tell you everything?

365
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,300
Yeah.

366
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,500
Yin knows nothing. I sent him to you.

367
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
He should've arrived at your place by now.

368
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,960
Yeah, he should be here soon.

369
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,940
Sir, I gotta go. I'll go check on him.

370
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,760
Untie me.

371
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,940
What if I untie you and you run away?

372
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,720
Don't worry, I won't run.

373
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,320
My Yin.

374
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,700
Baby.

375
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,500
You're still angry at me?

376
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,160
Who do you want to sleep with?

377
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,280
If I don't wanna sleep with you,

378
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,840
-then I'm not a good boyfriend.
-You...

379
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,980
Where are you going?

380
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,180
It's none of your business.

381
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,580
We haven't done talking. Where are you going?

382
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,680
We have nothing to talk about.

383
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,680
Just now I bared my heart to you,

384
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,380
shouldn't you also say something to me?

385
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,780
What do you want me to say?

386
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,980
I'm kind enough that I didn't kill you.

387
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,100
What do I want you to say?

388
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,240
I've already told you that I like you.

389
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,060
Don't you think that you should respond?

390
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,240
Gu Hai.

391
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,840
Would you stop going crazy?

392
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm not crazy.

393
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,300
I'm telling you the truth.

394
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,980
What's wrong with two men being together?

395
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,420
Don't you remember the other day

396
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,240
while we were walking the dog,

397
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,240
we saw a dog and a cat were together.

398
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,000
That's not the same.

399
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,360
What's the difference?

400
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,980
You don't need to worry about my gender,

401
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,700
or whether

402
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,860
it's a male cat or a female dog.

403
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,600
Just tell me,

404
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,140
whether you like me or not.

405
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,400
No, I don't.

406
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560
Get out of my way. I'm going home.

407
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,260
What else do you want?

408
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,420
You don't like me, huh?

409
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,840
Alright then. I'll lock you up in this room.

410
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
And I won't let you leave

411
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,200
until you fall in love with me.

412
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,960
Gu Hai.

413
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,340
Yin.

414
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,600
I really like you.

415
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,920
I know you've known that a long time ago.

416
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,720
You can ignore my nonsense.

417
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,160
But you have to believe that I like you.

418
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,140
It's okay if you don't like me.

419
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,100
I can wait for you.

420
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,960
I can go after you.

421
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,180
I will give you lots of love.

422
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,560
You will be moved one day.

423
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,860
Luoyin, have some sea cucumber.

424
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,080
There are many left in the plate.

425
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,460
Why are you taking Luoyin's?

426
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,460
He doesn't like it. He'll have diarrhea.

427
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,660
You...

428
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,920
Wow.

429
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,840
Look at them.

430
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,620
They are so close.

431
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,880
I never had the chance to ask Hai

432
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,960
when your birthday is.

433
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,780
Your birth years are the same.

434
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,660
Then what about the month?

435
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,960
Luoyin was born in May in lunar calendar.

436
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,460
Hai, in which month were you born?

437
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,580
He was also born in May.

438
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,380
And the date?

439
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
May the first in lunar calendar. How about you?

440
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,980
The same as you. At what time?

441
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,540
I...

442
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,740
Weren't you born on May the sixth in lunar calendar?

443
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,080
It seems that Hai wants to be the elder brother,

444
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,520
but it turns out that Luoyin is elder.

445
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,780
I feel really happy

446
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,360
to see them so close.

447
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,900
How about moving back here? Both of you.

448
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,600
Then it would be easier for me to look after you.

449
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,160
We have a driver to send you to and from school.

450
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,160
You father will feel relieved too.

451
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,900
I won't move in here.

452
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,620
Hai, how are you living out...

453
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,820
I have moved back to Guomao Bridge.

454
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,840
The living condition is fine.

455
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,860
You don't need to worry about me.

456
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,040
I see. It's good.

457
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,780
If you wanna stay there,

458
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,760
you can stay there.

459
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,040
Good.

460
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,220
Alright. Let's eat.

461
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,420
Let's eat.

462
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,600
Come on. Let's eat.

463
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,980
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

464
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,080
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

465
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,860
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

467
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:35,540

♫Slowly moving forward♫

♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

472
