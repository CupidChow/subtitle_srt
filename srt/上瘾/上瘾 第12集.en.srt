♫A bike was cycling along the sidewalk♫

♫And then it stopped at the corner store♫

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,260
♫There was beautiful handwriting on the blackboard♫

00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,800
♫And I saw your smile of ardent love♫

♫The sun was shining on the playground♫

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,800
Grandma, you can lean on it.

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,300
Isn't it cozy?

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,580
This has a particularly good therapeutic effect

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,280
on your cervical and lumbar spine,

22
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,380
especially suitable for elderly people of your age.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
It's awesome.

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,180
It must be expensive.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,900
No, it's cheap.

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,140
And this is also for you.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,580
It's a therapeutic equipment of cerebral thrombosis,

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,540
which is really effective.

29
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,160
By the way, sir.

30
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,940
The other day, I heard you talking about

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,740
renovating your bathroom.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,320
I've already connected a repairman for you.

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,820
He charges the least among those guys.

34
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
All you have to do is to wait at home.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,220
You're too kind.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,540
Great.

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
Madam, your son is now in primary school, right?

38
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,620
-Yeah. -Here.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,320
It's a learning machine I bought for your son.

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,100
I have a gift, too?

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,320
Just take it and let him use it.

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,920
It's...

43
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,240
You're such a nice kid.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,420
Just enjoy the massage, grandma.

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,220
Let me help you.

46
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,480
This glue is really sticky.

47
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,520
You can't wash it off.

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,220
No need. Go away.

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,220
I can do it myself.

50
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,660
By the way,

51
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,079
you don't need to wait in line at the hospital

52
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,079
to buy medicine for grandma anymore.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,140
I've talked to the hospital,

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,700
and they will send someone

55
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,800
bringing the medicine for you regularly.

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,920
Just call them.

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,840
I don't want to.

58
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,660
I'd rather line up myself

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,220
than inconvenience other people.

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,820
You won't inconvenience anyone.

61
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,260
It's their job.

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
Even if you don't call them,

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
they would call you.

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm telling you,

65
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,400
don't try to move me by doing things for my family.

66
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,280
You can tell that?

67
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm not an idiot.

68
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,320
In one examination room?

69
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,180
Yin. Yin.

70
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
I heard that we have to

71
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,860
take off all our clothes in physical examination tomorrow.

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,760
And there will be twenty boys in one examination room.

73
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,760
Deputy monitor.

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,120
Don't arrange me and Gu Hai in the same team

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
when we're doing the physical examination.

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,140
Why? Isn't he your best friend?

77
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,060
I specially put you two in the same team.

78
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,200
Don't worry about it.

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,100
Just don't put us in the same team, okay?

80
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,120
Thanks.

81
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,459
Let's go. Let's do the physical examination.

82
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,480
I'm not in the same team as you.

83
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,779
I'll go in the next class.

84
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,600
We don't have class now.

85
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,140
Let's go.

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,820
It's so boring to stay in the classroom.

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm a little sleepy.

88
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,420
I wanna sleep for a little while.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,620
Guys.

90
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,659
The physical examination of the last team is about to finish.

91
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,380
We should go now.

92
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,460
Because many classes are doing it at the same time,

93
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,860
there are a lot of people waiting.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,080
We should pick the one with the shortest queue.

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,080
From what I saw,

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,520
genital examination is the fastest.

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,620
Let's go.

I... I feel embarrassed.

105
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,960
I'd better wait for the next round.

106
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,460
Why are there so few people in this team?

107

Why are you still standing there?

111
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Hurry up. Get in here.

112
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,500
Lad, you have a nice figure.

113
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,840

Bai Luoyin.

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,140
You need to prepare for this.

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,240
We're not sure yet.

117
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,320
It's just a suspicion.

118
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,120
Our physical examination results have come out today.

119
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,900
and your test result is positive for HBV.

120
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,020
It's impossible.

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
I did a physical examination when I was in senior one.

122
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,340
I was quite healthy at that time.

123
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,820
You should know that HBV is contagious.

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,220
You may get it from other people.

125
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,760
But I was vaccinated.

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,240
The vaccine didn't always work.

127
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,440
Another two in our class

128
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
got the same result as you.

129
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,180
In my opinion, it's better for you to go to the hospital

130
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,380
for a follow-up check.

131
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,780
The earlier you treat it, the earlier you recover.

132
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,880
Don't worry, I won't tell the others.

133
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,500
I gotta go.

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,340
What's the matter?

135
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,160
Nothing.

136
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,480
I just wanna stay here for a while.

137
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,740
Just because I glanced at your privacy part a bit today,

138
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,800
and now you're upset?

139
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,680
Get lost.

140
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,020
Let's go. It's so cold here. Come on.

141
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,280
I don't wanna go back.

142
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,180
Why?

143
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,460
Can you tell me about it?

144
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,580
No.

145
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,360
You can't stay here forever.

146
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,720
Come on. Let's go.

147
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,980
Dumplings are ready!

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,780
Come on. Eat while they are still warm.

149
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,860
What's wrong?

150
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,840
Do you want me to feed you?

151
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,280
Alright.

152
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,100
Come on, baby. Open your mouth.

153
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,080
Have a try.

154
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,220
I've got Hepatitis B.

155
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Who told you that?

156
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,680
Deputy monitor said that

157
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,140
the result of physical examination has come out.

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,020
I've got hepatic dysfunction.

159
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,240
They primarily suspect it's Hepatitis B.

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,780
Don't listen to him.

161
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,080
He's unreliable.

162
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,760
Come on, let's eat dumplings.

163
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,840
You're the one who's unreliable.

164
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,000
I've already told you that I have hepatopathy.

165
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,360
Why are you still using the same pair of chopsticks

166
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,060
and bowl with me?

167
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,020
Do you wanna die?

168
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Come on. Have a bite.

169
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,440
Gu Hai!

170
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,560
Why are you doing this for me?

171
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,060
It's not about why I'm doing this.

172
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,040
It's just impossible for you to have this disease.

173
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,800
Well, I have it!

174
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,200
I just have it.

175
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
Alright, you have it, okay?

176
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,480
Then, just welcome me with your open arms today.

177
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,540
Just do whatever you want, okay?

178
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,500
I'll have the disease with you.

179
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,320
You idiot.

180
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,460
You're right. I'm an idiot.

181
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,400
Today I'm gonna show you the things that

182
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,980
an idiot can see while you can't.

183
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,120
So you think you have Hepatitis B, right?

184
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,020
You just won't listen to me, right?

185
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,040
Then let me cure you today.

186
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,980
How did I forget,

187
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,460
he's the type who responds better to persuasion than force.

188
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,220
Don't be afraid.

189
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,160
Let's go to the hospital this Saturday.

190
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,600
You will be fine.

191
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,660
Can you promise?

192
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,780
I can promise.

193
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,700
I'm reliable.

194
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't worry. You'll absolutely be fine.

195
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,960
Let's go.

196
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,180
Then don't touch me today.

197
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,360
Just in case.

198
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,360
No problem, let's go.

199
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,460
Did you hear me?

200
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,760
Do you have extra pajamas in here?

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
Yeah. Wait a second. I'll go get it for you.

202
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,860
[Chronic Hepatitis B]

203
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,300
What are you looking at?

204
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,700
Piss off. I'm irritated right now.

205
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,740
What? Are you playing cat and mouse with me?

206
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,520
This is my final warning.

207
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,020
Stay away from me.

208
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,700
You seduced me first.

209
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,080
And you pretend to be like nothing had happened.

210
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,460
You're so naughty.

211
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,740
Who seduced you?

212
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
Just now, a little prick

213
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,860
was dilatory in changing pajamas

214
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,520
in front of me.

215
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,560
You did that on purpose, right?

216
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,740
You tried to seduce me on purpose, right?

217
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,800
You did it on purpose, right?

218
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,440
What are you doing here?

219
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm here to sleep.

220
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,060
There are so many bedrooms in your house.

221
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,220
Why do you have to sleep in this room?

222
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,080
I told you,

223
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,560
don't get too close to me.

224
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,400
HBV can be transmitted through sweat, you know?

225
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,280
What else?

226
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,880
I heard that

227
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,420
it can also be transmitted through saliva, right?

228
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,700
What are you doing?

229
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,280
Yin, don't be afraid.

230
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,700
It's okay.

231
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
I'll be with you if anything happens.

232
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,360
Don't do this. What are you doing?

233
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,620
I heard that

234
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,840
HBV can also be transmitted through sex.

235
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,680
Don't do this. Absolutely no.

236
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,700
Don't be silly.

237
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,300
I'm well aware of what I am doing.

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,500
Yin. I can't help it.

239
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,440
Don't do this!

240
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,920
Yin.

241
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,340
You were so charming, so sexy.

242
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,420
Yin.

243
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,800
Did you enjoy it?

244
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,760
If you keep being garrulous,

245
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,580
I'll kick you out through the window.

246
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,080
That's not what I'm trying to say.

247
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,200
Then what do you wanna say?

248
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,360
Say it right here.

249
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,840
Then the atmosphere will be ruined.

250
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,060
I will take good care of you

251
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,140
and make up for all the love you've missed

252
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,020
in these past ten years.

253
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,900
Bai Luoyin. Come and have a word.

254
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,060
I need to tell you something.

255
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,280
You'd better go back.

256
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,800
I wanna hear.

257
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,600
Just tell me.

258
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm ready for it anyway.

259
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,460
Actually, I misunderstood the result yesterday.

260
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,920
There's only one positive index

261
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,560
among all five indexes.

262
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,520
It means that there are already antibodies inside you.

263
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,780
In our class,

264
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,940
only you and the other two guys have antibodies.

265
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,520
The rest of us who

266
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,900
don't have antibodies

267
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,240
need to continue getting booster shots.

268
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,780
You are saying that he doesn't have HBV?

269
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,140
Yeah, you can say so.

270
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,640
You really need to thank me

271
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,660
for giving you such a big surprise.

272
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,240
I really need to thank you.

273
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,400
Why don't you tell him later?

274
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,960
You ruined my plan.

275
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,200
Otherwise he may fall in love with me

276
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,380
in a few days.

277
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,320
But you ruined everything.

278
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,120
My happiness is gone.

279
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,320
Yin. Yin.

280
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,800
Come home with me this Friday.

281
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,120
-Come home with you? -Yeah.

282
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,020
-Go back to Tianjin? -Yeah.

283
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,020
I always speak of you with my mom,

284
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,099
she really wants to see you.

285
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,359
No.

286
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,660
I can go to your place

287
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,680
when your mom isn't home.

288
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,700
Come on.

289
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,720
My mom wants to see you.

290
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,940
That's why I invite you.

291
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,200
My mom cooks really well.

292
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,360
Can I come together?

293
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,580
It's up to you.

294
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,740
I won't pay for your transportation fare.

295
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,100
Then forget about it.

296
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,820
Here's the thing.

297
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,760
-My mom... -Yin.

298
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,360
Will you accompany me to check out furniture this Saturday?

299
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Furniture?

300
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,060
What for?

301
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,040
My house hasn't done decorating.

302
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,780
I need to buy lots of furniture.

303
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,840
Can't you go alone?

304
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,820
Why do you ask me?

305
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,580
You have a good taste, so I want you to give me some suggestions.

306
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,280
Yin.

307
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,460
I've already told my mom you would come

308
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,600
when I was home last week.

309
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,540
She has prepared all the ingredients.

310
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,560
We're just waiting for you.

311
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,500
How about this?

312
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,380
I'll buy a gift.

313
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,460
You can give it to your mom.

314
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,220
And please tell her that

315
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,280
I would definitely come to your place

316
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,460
when I'm available.

317
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,100
Okay?

318
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,560
Yang Meng.

319
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,620
Come out. Come on.

320
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
Why are you always stuck in the classroom?

321
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,900
Can't a grown man like you please go out for a walk?

322
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,180
Look at yourself.

323
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,280
I can't believe you're wearing a hoodie at school!

324
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,380
Don't you have nothing else to do?

325
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,880
Look at the corner of your lips!

326
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,340
There are even some instant noodles crisps on it.

327
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,880
Don't you know it's fried food?

328
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,080
-Don't you know that fried food is unhealthy? -You...

329
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,040
What? What are you trying to say?

330
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,360
I'm telling you.

331
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,600
I can see the filthiness

332
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,540
through your eyes.

333
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,000
You're filthy, you're such a jerk.

334
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,800
Don't stare at me.

335
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,280
You think you can be purified by doing so?

336
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,280
No, you can't.

337
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,740
Why are you still eating?

338
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,220
Everyone knows how to eat.

339
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,300
Everyone knows how to eat.

340
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,560
You think I don't know the dirty things you've done?

341
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,060
I know them all.

342
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,600
Shame on you.

343
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,200
Dude,

344
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,460
you should go to the infirmary to have some medicine.

345
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,800
Or your disease would become worse.

346
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,760
You'd better call a taxi.

347
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,300
Hurry up. You can take me back.

348
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,700
Get on.

349
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,560
Let's go.

350
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,340
You don't need to do this.

351
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:06,900
It...

352
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,400
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

353
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,380
Hurry up.

354
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,040
Who is the initiator of the Revolution of 1911?

355
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,460
The Revolution of 1911?

356
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

357
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,500
What is the impact of the First Opium War?

358
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,520
The impact of the First Opium War...

359
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,320
It can be illustrated from three aspects.

360
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,240
No, no. Four.

361
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,360
No.

362
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,160
Three. Three aspects.

363
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,500
First, the social nature has changed since then.

364
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,940
Second, social contradictions have changed.

365
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
Third...

366
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,220
What is the third one?

367
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,560
Why did you hit me?

368
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,740
I've asked you about this a thousand times.

369
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,660
How come you still can't memorize it?

370
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,340
Well, let's recite them for an hour first.

371
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,840
An hour?

372
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,780
Do you know what time is it now?

373
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,520
I'd usually go to bed by now.

374
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,860
I was also caught in the rain today.

375
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,000
I have a headache.

376
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,180
You can refuse to recite.

377
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,680
I'm gonna test you now.

378
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,520
If you get one question wrong,

379
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,320
you'll move one centimeter away when sleeping.

380
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,620
If you get two questions wrong

381
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,460
it's two centimeters.

382
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,780
If you get them all wrong,

383
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,340
you'll sleep in my dad's room.

384
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,840
If I can answer all the questions,

385
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,740
can I sleep on top of you?

386
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,920
Sleep on top of me? Get out.

387
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,360
Recite the textbook.

388
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,020
I recited all the contents.

389
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,940
Do I have any reward?

390
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,260
Are you still a child?

391
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,880
I also recited all the contents.

392
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,980
Who's gonna give me any reward?

393
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,500
That's what you should do.

394
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,440
It's not glorious.

395
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,840
I can give you a reward, do you want it?

396
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,160
No. Get your hands off me.

397
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,300
Seriously.

398
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,880
What do you wanna do in the future?

399
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,060
Me?

400
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,140
I want to go into business.

401
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,820
-Go into business? -Yeah.

402
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,440
I don't think your father would agree.

403
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,860
I think,

404
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,760
he would definitely want you to take his path.

405
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,180
I don't care what he thinks.

406
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,680
I will go into business anyway.

407
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,440
You're no match for him.

408
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,680
Let him be.

409
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,380
And you? What do you wanna do in the future?

410
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,200
I...

411
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I also wanna go into business.

412
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,220
Come on.

413
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,040
You're so shrewd.

414
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,140
If I become your competitor,

415
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,640
I'll surely go bankrupt.

416
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,700
I've run out of money.

417
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,840
Look at the way you spend your money,

418
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,720
you'd end up broke in no time.

419
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,900
What do you mean by 'in no time'?

420
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,880
I need to decorate my house.

421
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,140
And it costs money.

422
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Besides, I have daily expenses.

423
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,880
And I have no way to earn money.

424
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,220
I even spent all my savings.

425
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,660
Good for you.

426
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,420
Didn't your father give you any money?

427
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,460
He wanted to give me.

428
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,560
But I didn't take it.

429
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,460
Why not?

430
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,440
It's okay for you to use your dad's money.

431
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,880
I'm the one to blame.

432
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,520
When I left home,

433
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,860
I told him that

434
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,140
I wouldn't use his money in the future.

435
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,740
Though our relationship is now better,

436
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,080
I can't take back

437
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,180
what I said.

438
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,260
You can stay at my home.

439
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,580
And you can go back

440
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,860
when you don't think it's a shame to ask him for money.

441
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,800
No.

442
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,540
I can't freeload at your home.

443
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,700
You've already been freeloading at my home

444
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,740
for nearly two months.

445
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,540
It doesn't matter for you

446
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,320
to stay for another couple of months.

447
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,780
Besides, you helped my dad find that job.

448
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,520
He's still thinking about how to repay you.

449
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,420
He's willing to

450
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,460
let you stay at our place for years,

451
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,720
let alone a few months.

452
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
Well, I can freeload at your home,

453
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,340
but I can't ask sir for money.

454
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,660
If something happens

455
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,680
when I go out,

456
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,020
I will need money.

457
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,780
I have an idea.

458
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,840
It can help us earn money quickly.

459
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm listening.

460
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,340
Wait. I'm all ears!

461
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,300
♫You carried me on your back, recollecting the past♫

462
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,140
♫And stalling for time on your own♫

463
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,420
♫I was smiling while listening to you♫

464
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,400
♫But a tear-blurred vision faded in♫

465
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:58,640
♫You held my hand that had been wavering♫

466
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,740
♫Slowly moving forward♫

467
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,400
♫Slowly moving forward with me♫

468
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,540
♫Don't say I'd never understand♫

469
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,460
♫Don't say I'd never feel the pain♫

470
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,240
♫As the wind was blowing over♫

471
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,600
♫It left some warmth on my lips♫

472

♫Don't tell me you'll be here with me♫

473

♫I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence♫

474
