=Dangerous Love=

2
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,590
What's wrong?

4
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,110
Do you want me gone that badly?

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,800
Never in my dreams did I imagine

6
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,000
these treasures would end up mine.

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
(So this old guy)

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,080
(doesn't even know their value.)

9
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,240
Of course.

10
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,550
These treasures rightfully belong to

11
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,120
a hero of this chaotic age like you.

12
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,400
That young kid Xu Beisheng,

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,440
how could he possibly outmatch you?

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
Besides,

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,230
I've already lined up buyers overseas.

16
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,690
Once we

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
make the sale abroad,

18
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,630
we'll be living the good life.

19
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,800
Aren't you working with him?

20
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Oh, please.

21
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
I...

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,320
worked so hard for you just to trick them

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,160
into handing over the relics.

24
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,670
And you still say
I'm in cahoots with them.

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
I...

26
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,800
have been your third concubine.

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,670
Long time...

28
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,470
no see.

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,600
Don't you miss me at all?

30
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,590
I do.

31
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,950
I miss you so much.

32
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,830
But don't be in such a rush.

33
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,920
And...

34
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,030
we...

35
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,270
we try something fresh.

36
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,510
Miaoyin,

37
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,440
good to see you're okay.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,320
Stop putting on an act.

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
Why did you deceive me again?

40
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,630
Because I want to know

41
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
whether you care about me or not.

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Xu Miaoyin.

43
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,470
Do you enjoy messing with me?

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not messing with you.

45
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,670
I just want to know.

46
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,310
Alright.

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Now you're sure, right?

48
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,670
So you can face death without regret?

49
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,790
Yes.

50
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,230
Then go for it.

51
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,200
Lu Siyuan.

52
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,670
- Stop.
- Get out.

53
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,510
Lu Siyuan!

54
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
What are you doing?

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Lu Siyuan!

56
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,230
Lu Siyuan!

57
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,440
Lu Siyuan!

58
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,440
Lu Siyuan!

59
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,950
Lu Siyuan!

60
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,350
Tell Xu Beisheng

61
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,240
to make the deal now.

62
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,350
Miaoyin.

63
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,500
- Miaoyin.
- Mom.

64
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,630
Stay back.

65
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,640
You killed Beisheng's parents.

66
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,170
I guess that was my way of avenging them.

67
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,200
Young Master Xu.

68
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,070
Where's the stuff?

69
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,950
Over here.

70
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,390
Mr. Lu.

71
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Young Master Xu.

72
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,720
You sure you don't want to come in?

73
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,480
What's up, Mr. Lu?

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,320
Is there a problem?

75
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
No problem.

76
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,790
You really do keep your word.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,350
I'll make sure Mr. Yamamoto

78
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,350
knows about your contribution.

79
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,070
Will the restriction

80
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,790
on my mansion be lifted?

81
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,320
It's been driving me crazy.

82
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,810
Miss Zhou.

83
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,670
Adjutant Yuan.

84
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,550
I knew you were alive.

85
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,760
Miss Zhou, I guessed right after all.

86
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,830
Commander helped me get out first.

87
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,200
He deliberately pretended

88
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,920
to betray the nation for personal gain.

89
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,670
The reinforcements

90
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,790
should have arrived.

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,880
Don't worry.

92
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,160
The relics have been moved.

93
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,790
Here you go.

94
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,270
When the time comes,

95
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,440
we will meet up again.

96
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
Stay safe.

97
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,830
Mr. Lu.

98
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,790
The item is a fake.

99
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,950
Say that again.

100
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,180
Mr. Lu,

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,810
Mr. Yamamoto was a professor of history

102
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,110
before joining the army

103
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,400
and an authentication expert.

104
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,000
Xu Beisheng tricked you.

105
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,590
Xu Beisheng, you've got some nerve,

106
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,110
daring to fool me.

107
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,670
- Hurry.
- Move.

108
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,630
Faster!

109
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,800
Search every corner.

110
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:00,020
(Ning City Governor's Mansion)

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,050
Xu Beisheng.

112
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,030
Don't bother.

113
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
Everyone here in the residence

114
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,280
has left, except me.

115
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,710
Why didn't you leave?

116
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,760
Because I wanted to stay

117
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,190
with you.

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
They couldn't have gone far.

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,440
Send people to block

120
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,670
the ports and the stations.

121
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,080
You must catch them.

122
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,390
- Hurry!
- Move!

123
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,320
Steamed buns for sale.

124
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,360
Lu Siyuan.

125
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,200
That's the woman.

126
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
Grab her!

127
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
Why are you here alone?

128
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,300
Where's Xu Beisheng?

129
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
He already took the relics and fled.

130
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,550
Catching me won't help you.

131
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,990
Mr. Lu.

132
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,400
The relics are gone.

133
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
We have no way
to respond to Mr. Yamamoto.

134
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,590
Spread the word.

135
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,000
Say we've caught Zhou Menghuan.

136
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,110
Let's see if Xu Beisheng comes back.

137
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,200
Stop dreaming.

138
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,840
The relics matter most.

139
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,790
Xu Beisheng will never come back.

140
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,280
Right now, you're in my hands.

141
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,840
Whether he comes back or not

142
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,230
isn't up to you.

143
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,600
Take her away.

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,040
(Xu Beisheng,)

145
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
(don't come back.)

146
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,140
(Ning City Governor's Mansion)

147
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,800
Commander,

148
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,230
we're too short on people.

149
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,710
Should we wait longer?

150
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,800
No time for that.

151
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,630
Every extra second,

152
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,320
Meng Huan's in more danger.

153
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,120
Stick to the plan.

154
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,870
Yes.

155
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Mr. Lu.

156
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,880
You already failed once.

157
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,350
If you still can't secure the treasures,

158
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,230
Mr. Yamamoto will hold you responsible.

159
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,750
Captain Lin,

160
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
we're all in the same boat here.

161
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,960
No one's getting away.

162
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,110
You might as well

163
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,400
sit down, have some tea

164
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,480
and think about

165
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,320
how to deal with Xu Beisheng.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,590
You're that sure he'll come back?

167
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,840
I'm sure I would come back.

168
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,400
Xu Beisheng, you fool.

169
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,590
Why did you even come back?

170
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,880
I promised I'd leave with you,

171
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,350
so I'll keep my word.

172
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,110
Idiot.

173
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,310
Enough talking.

174
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,880
Tell me where the relics are,

175
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,640
or she doesn't walk out of here.

176
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
Then take me instead.

177
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
My life isn't worth much.

178
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
But the relics must never

179
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,400
fall into the hands of those traitors.

180
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,200
Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu.

181
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,050
This is bad.

182
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,350
The bomb at the back gate

183
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,520
took many of our brothers.

184
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,870
Who did this?

185
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
They must have a death wish.

186
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,750
Let them go.

187
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,600
Let them go!

188
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,200
Lu Siyuan is just a nobody.

189
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,840
If he's gone, he's gone.

190
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
Threaten me with him?

191
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,550
I can even send him on his way early.

192
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,510
Don't!

193
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,360
Miaoyin.

194
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,630
Miaoyin!

195
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,600
Miaoyin.

196
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,990
Why?

197
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,990
Siyuan.

198
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,640
About before,

199
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,400
it was my fault.

200
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
I let you down.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,150
Stop talking.

203
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,280
Hang in there.

204
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,430
You'll be fine.

205
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,790
You'll be fine.

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,160
It's too late.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840
But...

208
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,880
you still have a chance.

209
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,760
Don't be stubborn anymore.

210
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,590
Promise me, will you?

211
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,150
If there's a next life,

212
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,550
I swear I won't lie to you again.

213
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,630
Miaoyin.

214
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,400
Miaoyin!

215
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,880
Xu Beisheng.

216
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,790
Tell us where the relic is.

217
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,670
Or we both go down together.

218
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,520
Don't hurt him.

219
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,420
Don't hurt him.

220
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,280
Let go!

221
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,950
I'll say.

222
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,040
Menghuan,

223
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,750
don't be foolish.

224
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,000
Even if we tell him,

225
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,760
we're not getting out today.

226
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,950
Mr. Xu,

227
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,760
I promise you,

228
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,960
as long as you tell the truth,

229
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,590
I can ask Mr. Yamamoto

230
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,640
to spare your lives.

231
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,840
Let her go first,

232
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,310
then I'll talk.

233
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,380
(Blessing Amulet)

234
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,190
Commander,

235
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,720
let's move.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Menghuan,

237
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,580
the country's in trouble.

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,720
Yuan Rong and I
are heading north to fight.

239
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,880
Take care of the family.

240
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,070
Don't worry.

241
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,790
I'll be home,
waiting for you to come back.

242
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,840
Oh right.

243
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,760
I have some great news for you.

244
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,270
Beisheng.

245
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,710
I'm pregnant.

246
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,190
So…

247
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,400
Promise me.

248
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,350
You must come back alive.

249
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,030
Menghuan!

250
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,400
- Menghuan!
- Miaoling, you're back.

251
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,700
A letter from Beisheng.

252
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,270
What's wrong?

253
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,560
What did the letter say?

254
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,520
Did something happen to Beisheng?

255
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,560
Menghuan.

256
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,470
The baby's coming.

257
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,920
- Go get the doctor.
- He...

258
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,910
Hurry!

259
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
Miaoling, quickly!

260
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,230
Go get the doctor, fast!

261
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,430
Hurry.

262
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,760
Calm down, calm down.

263
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Take it easy, Menghuan.

264
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,360
In recent days,

265
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,040
the battles have been fierce.

266
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,400
Commander and I engaged

267
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,190
in a major fight with the enemy.

268
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,950
Amid the chaos,

269
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,400
Commander and Japanese

270
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,950
fell off the cliff together.

271
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,480
He died with glory.

272
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,830
Please take care of yourself, Madam.

273
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,000
My condolences.

274
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,430
This child is so beautiful.

275
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,310
Looks just like you.

276
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,230
Pity Beisheng can't see it.

277
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,640
Let's give her a name.

278
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Call her Dengdeng.

279
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,790
Dengdeng?
[*Deng: Wait]

280
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,200
Wait until the country is at peace.

281
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,950
Wait until the war is over.

282
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
