00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,680
Take a look at this.

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,720
Who would buy this?

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,630
Have a look, price dropped.

6
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
Price dropped, who's buying?

7
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,860
Come with me.

8
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,990
- Hey.
- Nothing good here.

9
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,240
Sir, miss.

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,790
Feel free to browse.

11
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,800
These are all genuine pieces.

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Guaranteed fair for all.

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,630
Porcelain from the Ming Dynasty.

14
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,760
Worth a fortune.

15
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,270
You, you, you...

16
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,440
What are you doing?

17
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,550
Looks like it's from near Capital.

18
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,190
Newly made in Nanyang County.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
- It's fine.
- Should be

20
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,390
not even three months old, right?

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,910
This mark here

22
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,030
is just crude work.

23
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,240
Double-handled green ring...

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
Look at the craft.

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a fake jar.

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,030
Things in this room

27
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,320
are obviously fake,

28
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,830
except for this one.

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,630
A Shang Dynasty ritual vessel.

30
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,520
Not bad.

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll take it.

32
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,880
You can't just leave.

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,190
You wrecked my whole shop.

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,240
You owe me for that.

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Wrap it up.

36
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,110
Hurry.

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Hit him.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Hit him, hit him.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,640
Stop.

40
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,560
Stop.

41
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,560
You alright?

42
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,470
Pretty girl.

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,600
If you want to save this little beggar,

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,520
trade yourself for him.

45
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Stay back.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,320
Do you know who I am?

47
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
Look at this face.

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,910
Fresh as morning dew.

49
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,280
Get out of my sight.

50
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,550
If I catch you bullying folks again,

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,440
especially the weak,

52
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,030
watch your necks.

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
Want to live a life

54
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,880
with full meals and warm clothes?

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,600
I do.

56
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,670
Governor's Mansion.

57
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,380
You'll be taken care of.

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
However,

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,510
being a soldier is tough work.

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
I... I'm not afraid of hardship.

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
Go on.

62
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,190
I just saved you.

63
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,000
How will you thank me?

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
I didn't need saving.

65
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
Jerk.

66
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,670
Governor.

67
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,950
So?

68
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,990
Did you enjoy the trip?

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
Not really.

70
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,230
He pretended to obey.

71
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,760
Instead of protecting me,

72
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,670
he let some thugs almost mess with me.

73
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,700
What happened?

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
Governor.

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,670
Madam Zhou smashed

76
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,550
an antique shop.

77
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,390
I was negotiating compensation.

78
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,670
After a moment,

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,720
Madam Zhou ran off.

80
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,910
I was neglected.

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,050
Governor,

82
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,510
that's no antique shop at all.

83
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,230
It's a fake goods store.

84
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,790
Even the last piece I bought

85
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,630
was a fake.

86
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,230
Alright, alright.

87
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,760
As long as you're fine.

88
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,950
How about this,

89
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,070
Manzhen and Miaoyin

90
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,070
are finding matches for Miaoling.

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
You've got such a sharp eye.

92
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,510
Go help them.

93
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,760
For Miaoling's marriage,

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,840
I'll be serious.

95
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,790
Xu Miaoyin.

96
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,950
Sis,

97
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,640
these are all good families I picked,

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
not one catches your eye?

99
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,490
Good families?

100
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,000
Qian Liu's a widower.

101
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,110
Sixty already.

102
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,270
The kid from the Ximen Sun family

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,440
lives a wild life.

104
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,440
He fooled around

105
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,160
with all the maids already.

106
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,670
Tha Wang in East Guantou

107
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,350
looks proper on the outside.

108
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,580
But who doesn't know

109
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,730
their family is so broke.

110
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,680
Barely make ends meet.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
Xu Miaoyin.

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
You did this on purpose.

113
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,350
Me?

114
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,160
I just followed Dad's orders.

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,830
If you're not happy with it,

116
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,580
feel free to take it up with Dad.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
Miaoling.

118
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,110
Madam.

119
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,230
Better tone it down.

120
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,640
Or it'll end up in front of Dad again

121
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,790
and you're in for trouble.

122
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,110
You…

123
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,350
So lively here.

124
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,880
Heard the noise from afar.

125
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,430
Anyone who knows

126
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,070
would think you're picking a groom.

127
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,490
Those who don't know

128
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,760
might think you're fighting over one.

129
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,160
Let me take a look.

130
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,540
(Marriage Proposal Letter)

131
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,230
From what I see,

132
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,270
no one is as good as Jiang Xu.

133
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,230
Jiang Xu?

134
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm not marrying Jiang Xu.

135
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,390
Marry whoever you like.

136
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,880
It's none of my business.

137
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,440
You…

138
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,760
Spending time with you

139
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
is just too dull.

140
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm going to rest.

141
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,110
Take your time to decide.

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
You...

143
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,790
I've got things to do.

144
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,880
If you've made a decision,

145
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,270
if there's any news,

146
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,390
just let me know.

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,560
I...

148
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,760
Mom.

149
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,640
Though Jiang Lin can't stand Qingshan,

150
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,960
he's still from a well-off family.

151
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,320
Way better than those random nobodies.

152
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,310
Mom.

153
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,510
Tomorrow,

154
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,590
I'll find someone to ask around.

155
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
Mom.

156
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,360
Dad.

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,540
You agreed to a marriage
with the Xu family?

158
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
Let me be clear, I'm not okay with it.

159
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,950
Why not?

160
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,150
That Xu Miaoling woman

161
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,000
is so bossy.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
Thinks she knows it all.

163
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
She is annoying.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,320
She's just a woman.

165
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,840
You married her.

166
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,470
Talk to her if you want.

167
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,550
If you don't want to,

168
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,840
then just ignore her.

169
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,470
Things have changed.

170
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,520
Who knows what trick

171
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,470
Xu Beisheng pulled.

172
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,760
He has Marshal Liu

173
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,900
wrapped around his finger.

174
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,960
The arms shipment we stopped last time

175
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,400
was given back to Beisheng.

176
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,750
So what?

177
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,440
We are not afraid of him.

178
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,550
What matters is,

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,350
we still didn't find

180
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,520
where the treasure went.

181
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,150
Once the marriage is set,

182
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,320
we can use it as an excuse

183
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,350
to visit the Xu family

184
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,640
and snoop around more often.

185
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,120
Got it?

186
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,590
Let's be clear, Dad.

187
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm doing this for our family

188
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,550
and giving up my own tastes.

189
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,880
It's really unfair to me.

190
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,480
From now on,

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,840
be nicer to me.

192
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,520
You little rascal.

193
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,480
Get out.

194
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,670
You brat.

195
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,310
Commander,

196
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,910
for this arms shipment,

197
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,960
you've dealt with so many people.

198
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,720
You've worked hard.

199
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,200
As long as it gets done,

200
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,550
it's all worth it.

201
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,870
Go get some rest.

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
Alright.

203
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
(Zhou Menghuan,)

204
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,230
(you again.)

205
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,040
Miaoling?

206
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,600
What are you doing?

207
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,280
Brother.

208
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
Beisheng.

209
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,150
I like you.

210
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
I really, really like you.

211
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,720
You…

212
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Will you marry me?

213
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,310
Put your clothes on.

214
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,440
Go back to your room now.

215
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
Why?

216
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Is it because...

217
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,150
you're still thinking of Zhou Menghuan?

218
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,550
It's not about her.

219
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,550
How can it be?

220
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,550
If it weren't for her,

221
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,760
how could they arrange me

222
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,150
to marry Jiang Xu, that awful man?

223
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,200
My whole future happiness is ruined.

224
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,000
You're marrying Jiang Xu?

225
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,310
Who arranged that?

226
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,990
Does Governor know?

227
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,000
He doesn't care about me at all.

228
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,240
Big brother,

229
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,590
only you can save me now.

230
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,550
I've liked you since I was little,

231
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
following you around.

232
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,670
No matter how mom scolded me,

233
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,280
I still stood firmly by your side.

234
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,070
Am I not better

235
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,150
than Zhou Menghuan

236
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,520
and more worthy of your love?

237
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,280
Xu Miaoling,

238
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,910
stop talking nonsense.

239
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,230
We're brother and sister.

240
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,150
If you don't want to marry Jiang Xu,

241
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,030
I can go talk to them for you.

242
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,870
No.

243
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,280
I don't want us to be just siblings.

244
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,320
Besides, we're not real siblings.

245
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,230
Xu Miaoling!

246
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,320
In this house, I'm your older brother.

247
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,520
And that's it.

248
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,280
Get out.

249
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,470
Was Miaoling's marriage

250
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,600
your idea?

251
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,870
What?

252
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,280
Are you here to blame me?

253
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,760
Miaoling can be a bit willful at times.

254
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,440
But she's still young.

255
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,390
She's just a kid.

256
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,240
A kid?

257
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,940
She's just a kid

258
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,470
and that excuses her framing me

259
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,710
and trying to ruin me?

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,840
Xu Beisheng.

261
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't you know

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,440
what your dear sister's done?

263
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,320
I've nearly lost my life more than once.

264
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,030
And we both know

265
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,440
what kind of man Jiang Xu is.

266
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,960
If Miaoling marries him,

267
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,710
her life will be ruined.

268
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll be straight with you.

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
This was never my idea.

270
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,080
Someone did ask me to do it.

271
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,000
Wanted me to do them a favor.

272
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,550
Who?

273
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,590
It was your other dear sister.

274
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,520
Typical of your whole family.

275
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,110
Why are you here again?

276
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,910
To congratulate you, Miaoling.

277
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,150
You'll marry a great man.

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,840
Look.

279
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,420
These are all the betrothal gifts

280
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,640
from the Jiang family.

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,840
I know.

282
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,670
You're just here to see me fall.

283
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,350
That obvious?

284
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,400
Even you can tell?

285
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,880
Xu Miaoyin.

286
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,640
You'll pay for this.

287
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,520
If karma is real in this world,

288
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,070
then right now,

289
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,350
it's you and your mom's bad deeds

290
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,400
coming back to you.

291
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,080
Did you forget

292
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,230
how you treated me before?

293
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,190
Sis,

294
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,880
what happened back then

295
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,630
was all my fault.

296
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,950
I'm begging you.

297
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,550
Please, can you help me?

298
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,760
I'm begging you.

299
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,440
We're real sisters.

300
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,110
Miss Zhou was poisoned by pufferfish.

301
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,000
Who told you to serve her pufferfish?

302
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,320
But it wasn't me.

303
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,350
If not you, then who else?

304
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,600
Miaoyin,

305
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,330
if you messed up, you should own it.

306
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,680
Stop hitting her!

307
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,000
Please, stop!

308
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,670
Mother.

309
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,200
If you must hit, hit me instead.

310
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,830
Mother.

311
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,760
(Because of you,)

312
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,440
(Mother and I suffered so much.)

313
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,340
Miaoyin.

314
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,030
(Who will save us then?)

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,110
Whatever you say now,

316
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,880
it's already too late.

317
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,040
Xu Miaoyin.

318
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,710
Xu Miaoyin!

319
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,000
Even if it means my death,

320
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,080
I will never marry Jiang Xu,
that lowlife.

321
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,200
Xu Miaoling ran away.

322
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,170
What?

323
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,670
Ran away from the wedding?

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,840
Calm down first.

325
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,640
I'll go find Xu Qingshan right now.

326
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,910
I need some answers.

327
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,870
Young Master.

328
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,350
Gather all the people you know,

329
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,400
from all walks of life.

330
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,430
Find her for me.

331
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,200
I will reward you well.

332
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,460
Yes.

333
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,440
(No need for my father to get involved.)

334
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,840
(I'll make sure)

335
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,640
(this reckless woman understands)

336
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,040
(running away)

337
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,670
(won't be that easy.)

338
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,520
Sir, one bowl of wonton, please.

339
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,920
Got it, find a seat first.

340
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,070
Sir, could I get another bowl?

341
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,730
Here you go.

342
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,670
Enjoy your meal.

343
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,030
Sir, check please.

344
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,400
Where's my suitcase?

345
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,680
- Hey.
- Who took my suitcase?

346
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,950
- It's gone.
- You haven't paid yet.

347
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,020
Trying to eat for free?

348
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,070
You really…

349
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,190
This should cover it, right?

350
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,760
Never mind.

351
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,470
(So once I left my family,)

352
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,590
(I became a nobody.)

353
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,880
Who are you people?

354
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,830
What do you want?

355
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,310
Jiang Xu.

356
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,640
Why are you here?

357
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,270
Miss Xu.

358
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,400
What do you think?

359
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,070
Don't touch me.

360
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,270
- What are you doing?
- Guys.

361
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,400
- Something wild today?
- Let me go.

362
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,800
How do you want to play?

363
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,350
We'll stick with you all the way.

364
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,110
Let go of me.

365
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,510
- I'll be the first.
- Let go!

366
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,560
Everyone, line up.

367
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,830
You all get a turn.

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,840
You vile.

369
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,190
You jerk!

370
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,800
- Let go!
- Shout.

371
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,760
Go on, louder.

372
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,720
Let me go!

373
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,760
- You jerk!
- Louder.

374
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,520
No one's coming to save you.

375
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,640
No, stop! Don't!
