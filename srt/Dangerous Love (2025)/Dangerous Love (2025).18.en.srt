2
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,280
Sounds like it came from Miaoling's room.

4
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,550
Go get the doctor! Now!

5
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Miaoling.

6
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,920
How am I supposed to live through this?

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
Governor, the doctor is here.

8
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Doctor.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,350
How's my daughter doing?

10
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,430
She's pulled through.

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,760
I'll prescribe her

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
some medicines.

13
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,000
She'll be fine

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,870
in less than 3 days.

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
However…

16
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,190
However what?

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,270
The heart is harder

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,430
to heal than the body.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,520
If she holds on to the will to die,

20
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,870
then I'm afraid…

21
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,550
So,

22
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,910
you still need to talk to her

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,240
and help her open up.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,730
The most important thing

25
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,430
is to regain

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,590
confidence in life.

27
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,590
Miaoling.

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,640
Miaoling.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,520
You're really being silly.

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
Mom.

31
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,840
Stop crying.

32
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,560
I don't think I can go on.

33
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,280
I won't let you give up on life.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Today, you pulled me back

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,870
from death.

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,870
But tomorrow, I could jump into a well,

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
or drink poison,

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,000
or even use a gun on myself.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,680
One day, you won't be able to save me.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,120
You really want to die, huh?

41
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,310
Fine.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Before you die,

43
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,840
end me first.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,590
Come on.

45
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,750
Do it.

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,960
Take me out first.

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,430
You take me out first.

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,590
Mom.

49
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,000
Mom.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
Have you two made enough trouble?

51
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,310
Xu Qingshan.

52
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm warning you.

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,750
If anything happens to Miaoling,

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,710
I'll go down with you.

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
Governor.

56
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,870
Is your head hurting?

57
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,080
Beisheng, help him back to rest first.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
I'll handle things.

59
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,400
I can take care of this.

60
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,430
Governor,

61
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,630
let's go back.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Get out.

63
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,190
Madam.

64
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,150
You should leave too.

65
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,400
Let me talk to her.

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,390
You sly fox.

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
You troublemaker.

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,750
Quit pretending to be the good one.

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,120
Either you believe me now,

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
or

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,920
you'll be claiming her body.

72
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,870
If you dare lay a hand on Miaoling,

73
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,560
I'm telling you,

74
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,160
even if it costs my life,

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,190
I won't ever let you go.

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,190
Happy now?

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
Here to watch me fall apart?

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Yeah.

79
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,120
Since you're so eager to see me crash,

80
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
why bother persuading me?

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,190
That was just a lie to fool Madam.

82
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,500
Me?

83
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,270
I'm actually here to help you end this.

84
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,240
I don't need your help.

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
Get out.

86
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,920
I said, get out!

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,430
You're way too soft.

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
That's why you need me.

89
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,190
You don't have the guts to end your life.

90
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,360
If I were you,

91
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,800
I'd never turn the blade on myself.

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
Whoever hurt me,

93
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,270
I'd make sure they pay in full.

94
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,590
They'll face the consequences.

95
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,310
Think it through.

96
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,680
Once I strike,

97
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,680
you'll never get the chance to take revenge.

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,720
Zhou Menghuan.

99
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,830
You're not the one who was humiliated.

100
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,240
And you're not the one who was hurt.

101
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,270
What gives you the right to lecture me?

102
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,360
Yeah, you're the one who was humiliated

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
and got hurt.

104
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,820
You'll hurt your family

105
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,760
and please the villains.

106
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,160
Where's that fire you had

107
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,870
to take me down?

108
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,240
Or is it that

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
your blade only points at women?

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,750
No.

111
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,390
That's not me.

112
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,360
No.

113
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,440
That's not me.

114
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,790
Zhou Menghuan,

115
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,270
don't push me.

116
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm warning you.

117
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,510
Stay alive.

118
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,490
You'll have a shot at revenge.

119
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,800
Jiang Xu.

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,680
You heartless animal.

121
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,630
Jerk.

122
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm going to end you.

123
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,750
I'll end you!

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,890
I'll end you!

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,310
I'll end you!

126
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,340
I'll end you!

127
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
Calm down.

128
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,000
Go to hell!

129
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,590
Calm down.

130
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,960
Miaoling.

131
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Zhou Menghuan.

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
What did you do to her?

133
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,720
You cruel woman.

134
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,430
I knew you were up to no good.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Mom.

136
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,750
It's not her fault.

137
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,190
I did this to myself.

138
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,720
Why did you do this?

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Does it hurt?

140
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't be scared.

141
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,310
I'm right here, my girl.

142
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,280
Let me bandage it.

143
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Don't be scared.

144
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,270
I'm here.

145
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,970
It won't hurt once bandaged.

146
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,520
Mom.

147
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,240
I won't try to end my life again.

148
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,200
Really?

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Don't scare me like that again.

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm getting older now.

151
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,870
I can't take such shocks.

152
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,030
The one who should pay isn't me.

153
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,360
It's Jiang Xu.

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,150
(Miaoling wouldn't go after Jiang Xu, right?)

155
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,200
(She's still so young,)

156
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,720
(at such an early age.)

157
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Miaoling.

158
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm glad you've worked it out.

159
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,550
But don't rush it.

160
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
About that Jiang Xu,

161
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,600
I won't let him off the hook.

162
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,510
Trust me on this.

163
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
Don't be afraid.

164
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm here for you.

165
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm right here.

166
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
No need to be afraid.

167
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,870
Master.

168
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,870
Master.

169
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,630
Young Master is missing.

170
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,960
When did he disappear?

171
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,910
They say he went out last night

172
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,510
and still hasn't come back.

173
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,750
Then hurry and find him.

174
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,240
I've already sent people to look.

175
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Go check yourself.

176
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,030
If he messes with the Xus,

177
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
you can back him up.

178
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,390
Yes, understood.

179
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,230
Go now.

180
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,360
How's Miaoling doing?

181
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Much better.

182
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,550
She won't try to end her life anymore.

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
What did you do to her?

184
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
It's a secret.

185
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,630
A secret?

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,510
Why bring a secret to a place like this?

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Well,

188
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,030
it's a secret,

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,910
so it should be told somewhere secret.

190
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,440
Miss Zhou.

191
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,320
What do you mean?

192
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
That's the secret.

193
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,910
I just used these scissors

194
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,720
to persuade Miaoling
not to harm herself.

195
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,470
Really?

196
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
Yeah.

197
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,320
And I told her,

198
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
if anyone hurts her,

199
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,200
she shouldn't turn the blade on herself.

200
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,720
She should make that person pay instead.

201
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,470
Xu Beisheng.

202
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,670
Do you think what I said

203
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
makes sense?

204
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,120
Once I uncover the truth
behind your family,

205
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,550
you can take revenge yourself.

206
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,670
I need to handle military affairs.

207
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,630
Wait for me tonight.

208
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,560
Master.

209
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,350
Master.

210
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,360
We've found the young master.

211
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,680
Xu.

212
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,240
Who did this?

213
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,000
Who did this?

214
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,390
It was Xu Beisheng.

215
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,790
Xu Beisheng.

216
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm going to make him pay dearly.

217
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,550
Take him to the hospital.

218
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,600
Our family must live on.

219
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,200
Hurry, move!

220
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,360
Our family must not end here.

221
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,440
- Quick!
- Yes.

222
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,110
You're back.

223
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,270
So bold today.

224
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,840
Of course.

225
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,080
Because...

226
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,030
I want to try something exciting with you.

227
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
Exciting?

228
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,160
In or not?

229
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,550
If not, I'll put it away.

230
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,480
You like it.

231
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,960
Then I'll risk it for you.

232
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,840
Let me go.

233
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,000
Let me go, Xu Beisheng.

234
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,590
Beisheng.

235
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,670
Can we talk?

236
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,350
What's is it?

237
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,080
I saw my mother today.

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
Don't you see her every day?

239
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,790
I mean my birth mother,

240
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,750
Madam Gu.

241
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,470
Lu Siyuan.

242
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,600
I plotted so much,

243
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,910
and even involved you,

244
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,870
but in the end, I got nothing.

245
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,120
Now I just hope that out there,

246
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,630
you can stay safe

247
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,910
and live your life well.

248
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,870
Miaoyin.

249
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,110
Mother.

250
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,750
What happened to you?

251
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,600
You know how those brothers of mine are.

252
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Ever since they knew I was kicked out,

253
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,750
they've been freezing me out.

254
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,550
I can't even get a proper meal.

255
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,810
Miaoyin,

256
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,240
can you think of a way

257
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,120
to bring me back home?

258
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,720
You want to bring her back?

259
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,350
Yes.

260
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,870
Father listens to you about everything.

261
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,510
That's why I came to ask you

262
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,780
for your help.

263
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,870
If it were military matters,

264
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,510
I can make the call.

265
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,600
But this is a family issue.

266
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,080
It's not my place to go over

267
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,320
Madam or Third Madam's heads.

268
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,350
Beisheng,

269
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,840
if I told Father

270
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,960
about your connection with Zhou Menghuan,

271
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,990
how would he react?

272
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
So you're not here for help.

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
You're here to corner me.

274
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,180
I don't want to, either.

275
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,390
So, Beisheng

276
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,030
please don't push me.

277
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
Miaoyin,

278
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,030
given your current position,

279
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,030
who would still

280
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,550
believe your words?

281
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,360
You're saying Jiang Xu got hurt?

282
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,790
It was Xu Beisheng's doing.

283
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,270
That's what the word

284
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,110
on the street says.

285
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,750
Guess Beisheng still has a conscience.

286
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,910
Keep a close eye

287
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,480
on the Jiang family for me.

288
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,150
Anyone who hurts my daughter,

289
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,440
I'll make sure they pay the price.

290
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,560
Understood.

291
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,670
(The madam will never agree)

292
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,910
(to let my mother come back.)

293
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,360
(This matter)

294
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,630
(needs long-term planning.)

295
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,510
Commander,

296
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,630
the troops

297
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,080
are basically our people.

298
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,080
But I still haven't found any leads

299
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
about that elite unit.

300
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,440
After they showed up

301
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,750
at the Jiang family,

302
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,270
it's like they vanished.

303
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,320
Yuan Rong,

304
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,440
leave the stuff we dug up

305
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,390
untouched for now.

306
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,640
Kylin Jade Goblet stays here for now.

307
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,110
So we don't tip them off.

308
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,320
Got it, Commander.

309
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,320
You go ahead first.

310
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,820
I'll go to the office later.

311
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,580
Drinking this early in the morning.

312
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,880
You're in the mood.

313
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,710
Of course.

314
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
Lately, Governor keeps praising you.

315
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,750
Feels like

316
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,480
you'll take his seat sooner or later.

317
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,310
I'm just celebrating in advance.

318
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,440
In this whiskey,

319
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,400
you didn't slip anything in, did you?

320
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,110
Then forget it.

321
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,110
Don't waste my good whiskey.
