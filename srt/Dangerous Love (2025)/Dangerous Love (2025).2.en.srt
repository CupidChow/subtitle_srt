00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,920
Everyone.

4
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,440
Looks like dinner tonight

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,800
isn't happening after all.

6
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,110
Let's

7
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,150
call it a night.

8
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,790
What?

9
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,670
We're done?

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,880
What's going on?

11
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,670
Oh, right.

12
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,790
Someone,

13
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,950
bring me the antique jade I gifted

14
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,150
to Governor Xu.

15
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,680
Dinner may be off,

16
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,190
but we still have to be proper.

17
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,550
(Instead of dodging him,)

18
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,910
(I might as well take the lead.)

19
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,460
(Paris Night)

20
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,670
Here they come.

21
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,820
Here they come.

22
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,750
Governor.

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,640
Zhou Menghuan?

24
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,110
Mr. Xu.

25
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,030
Sorry, something held me up on the way.

26
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,110
That's why I'm late.

27
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,240
(Jiang Er'ye, brother of Jiang Lin)

29
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,390
They survived the blast?

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,800
I just heard someone

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,110
gifted you an antique jade.

32
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,030
I happen to know about antiques.

33
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,190
Why not let me take a look?

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
Lu.

35
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,950
This one here

36
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,240
isn't an antique jade.

37
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,190
Everyone, take a look.

38
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,080
The patterns and carvings on it

39
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,720
never appeared in the Shang Dynasty.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
Instead,

41
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,160
it only appeared in the Late Ming Dynasty.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,720
So it...

43
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,270
It might be

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
our servants

45
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,110
who lacked judgment

46
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,310
and made a mistake.

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,200
Menghuan,

48
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,320
you have such great skill.

49
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,880
Otherwise,

50
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,200
we would've let these

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,270
petty servants fool us.

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
Miss Menghuan,

53
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,720
nice to meet you.

54
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm your fiance,

55
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,230
Xu Tianci.

56
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm tired from walking

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,670
and need somewhere to sit.

58
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,590
Excuse me,

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,440
thanks.

60
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,110
Today,

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,110
I, Xu Qingshan, invited you all here

62
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,950
to introduce someone to everyone,

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,720
my future daughter-in-law,

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,600
Zhou Menghuan.

65
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,070
From this day on,

66
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,320
the Xu and Zhou families

67
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,640
will share a happy marital union.

68
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,040
Wonderful, wonderful.

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,890
Congratulations.

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,510
Congrats.

71
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,110
Zhou Menghuan is mine.

72
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,160
Your Xu family

73
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,200
likes secondhand things that much?

74
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,110
Jiang Xu?

75
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,070
You, Jiang,

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,760
you've got some real nerve.

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Xu Tianci,

78
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,380
aren't you feeling low?

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Choosing a woman

80
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,390
I've already been with,

81
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,260
huh?

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,350
You've got a death wish.

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,160
Young people are so impulsive.

84
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,630
Put the gun down.

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Governor.

86
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,320
Since what's done is done,

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,390
Miss Zhou is now my son's wife.

88
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,230
Utter nonsense.

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,510
I don't even know

90
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,350
this shady crook.

91
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,630
You don't?

92
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,510
Miss Zhou,

93
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,720
then this...

94
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,690
Wasn't it a gift to me as a token

95
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,640
(Menghuan)
of love?

96
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,670
You shameless...

97
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,920
Don't mind us, everyone.

98
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,640
Just a little couple's banter.

99
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,950
Sharp with your words...

100
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,790
You young people...

101
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,350
Deep down, you adore me, right?

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,440
Chairman Jiang,

103
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,640
all the big shots of Ning City are here.

104
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,880
By doing this,

105
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,070
are you trying to make us all a joke?

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,280
Well…

107
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,260
Xu Beisheng,

108
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,070
let Zhou Menghuan leave with me now.

109
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
Otherwise,

110
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,790
I'll turn this place into chaos.

111
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,510
Chairman Jiang,

112
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,600
now things have blown up.

113
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,000
If Marshal Liu finds out,

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,600
how will you explain yourself?

115
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Governor.

116
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,950
No need to lose your temper.

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
The young ones are just messing around.

118
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,910
We

119
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,760
shouldn't stoop to their level.

120
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,550
On behalf of my son,

121
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,830
I apologize to you.

122
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,830
Sorry for bothering you today.

123
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,000
Another day, you and I

124
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,950
should really catch up.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Let's go.

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
Pretty girl.

127
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,210
We've got plenty of time ahead.

128
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,040
You worthless thing.

129
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,720
Darn it.

130
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,270
Darn it.

131
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
Jiang Lin, one day soon,

132
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,740
I'll make you pay dearly.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,300
I'll drive you out of Ning City,

134
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,710
so you know who's really in charge.

135
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,920
Governor.

136
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,990
Please, calm down.

137
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,400
How's Miss Zhou doing?

138
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,590
Madam is with her.

139
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,470
Since Miss Zhou is here

140
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,280
and Tian Ci always

141
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,470
neglects real work,

142
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,670
spending all day painting,

143
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,470
we can't count on him.

144
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,520
You need to be more cautious.

145
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Probe them

146
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,030
see if they know about

147
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,350
the treasure outside the city.

148
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,200
Yes.

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,280
Right now, the priority is

150
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,910
the key to the Luban Box.

151
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,680
My lady.

152
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,380
Menghuan.

153
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,280
From now on,

154
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,030
stay here and feel at home.

155
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,280
Madam,

156
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,670
Master wants to see you.

157
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Rest well.

158
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
Alright.

159
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,090
Master,

160
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,960
Miss Zhou's settled...

161
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,550
What's going on here?

162
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,910
Is this how you run the house?

163
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,760
You didn't know there was a break-in?

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,080
Did you lose something?

165
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,880
You dare ask?

166
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,280
Something important.

167
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,520
Go find the Luban Box.

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,640
If you fail,

169
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,880
you'll be in serious trouble.

170
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,040
Go find it!

171
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Xu Beisheng.

172
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,870
Stop right there.

173
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,070
Miss Zhou.

174
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,480
This...

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,960
You left this, a snake venom antidote.

176
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,440
What's wrong with you?

177
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,400
You dropped this of

178
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,670
and just left without a word?

179
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,510
Watch out!

180
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,550
Are you okay?

181
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,600
It's fine.

182
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you have something to say?

183
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,320
Actually,

184
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,280
it's nothing special.

185
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,950
Just…

186
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,820
- Just…
- Sorry,

187
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,880
I need to go.

188
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,880
I just wanted to thank you

189
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
for saving me.

190
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,230
(So she's the young lady
from Zhou family)

191
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,320
(She dared to go after my brother.)

192
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,630
(A sly fox.)

193
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,150
Commander, about what you asked for,

194
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,760
I've completed two of them.

195
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,110
That's much better than expected.

196
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,550
No rush.

197
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,720
And the item?

198
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,640
Commander.

199
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,080
I've studied this box already.

200
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,390
We need the key.

201
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,310
Otherwise, forcing it open

202
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,230
will damage what's inside.

203
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,440
The reporters from Ning City Daily

204
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,720
already published it.

205
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,620
(Zhou Menghuan & Xu Beisheng
Soon To Tie the Knot)

206
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,430
Mom,

207
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,760
of all the times for this to get lost,

208
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,370
why right when two outsiders

209
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,220
came into the house?

210
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,370
So strange.

211
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,510
Madam!

212
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,230
Young Master and Miss Zhou

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,790
made Ning City Daily's front page.

214
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,550
(Ning City Daily)
Zhou Menghuan

215
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,550
and Xu Beisheng, eldest son of Governor

216
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,640
are soon to be wed.

217
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,520
Do you know how your father died?

218
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,950
You told me before,

219
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
Xu Qingshan killed my father.

220
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,790
And he forced you too.

221
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,110
I'm going to end him.

222
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,670
Xu Qingshan has always thought

223
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,760
you were his son.

224
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,640
Unless Xu Qingshan is gone,

225
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,520
this secret dies with you forever.

226
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
Mom!

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,080
Miss Zhou, please calm down.

228
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,160
Father.

229
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
Mother.

230
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,760
I'll soon avenge you both.
