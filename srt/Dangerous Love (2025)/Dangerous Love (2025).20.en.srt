=Episode 20=

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,150
Because you're not my father at all.

4
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,120
What did you just say?

5
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,440
Haven't you suspected me
for a long time?

6
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,120
Cen Yin, that evil woman, lied to me.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Shut up.

8
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,190
Don't you dare insult my mother.

9
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
Xu Qingshan.

10
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,680
Back then, you killed my father

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,310
and stole his position.

12
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,510
To protect me, my mother

13
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,270
had no choice but to tell that huge lie.

14
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,710
Xu Beisheng,

15
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
I'll end you.

16
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,710
Xu Beisheng,

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
I'll end you.

18
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm going to end you.

19
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,070
Madam Zhou.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
Where's the Governor?

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,190
He has gone out.

22
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,350
Who did he go with?

23
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,950
After Young Master got back,

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
they went out together.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,560
I heard them say

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,830
it was to some pier.

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,630
You guys step out.

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
(Xu Beisheng,)

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,190
(I will end you for sure.)

30
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,470
(No matter what.)

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,110
No way.

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,560
No way.

33
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,750
I don't believe it.

34
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,230
Beisheng.

35
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,270
There must be some misunderstanding.

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,520
You have to trust me.

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
I dug up all the truth from back then.

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,550
You did kill my father.

39
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,360
Then my mother ended her life.

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,310
Beisheng.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,830
I raised you with my own hands.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,360
We've always been like father and son.

43
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,360
Father and son?

44
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,390
You've always doubted and feared me,

45
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,440
yet had to rely on me.

46
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,910
Is this your so-called father-son bond?

47
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,110
You really want to kill me.

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,720
Is that it?

49
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,240
Fine.

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,970
Go on then.

51
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,030
End me right here.

52
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,320
I'm the one who taught you how to shoot.

53
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,230
Pull the trigger.

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,270
I'll help you do it.

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Dad.

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,470
Isn't it time we rushed in now?

57
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,590
Wait a bit longer.

58
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,830
Wait any longer and it'll be too late.

59
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,910
If more people come,

60
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,970
how do you handle that?

61
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,550
Your old man isn't some clueless kid.

62
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,960
Let me be straight with you.

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
I've stationed my men

64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,670
around this area.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
It's locked down tight.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
You're still young.

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't understand.

68
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,200
Even though this dock's been abandoned,

69
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,950
this warehouse

70
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,110
was built years ago by Xue Mu at great cost.

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,670
Once it's locked from the outside,

72
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,790
you can only blast it open

73
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
without the key.

74
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,320
Then blast it open.

75
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,720
We have explosives.

76
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,390
Dad, stop wasting time.

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,600
Tell the guys

78
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
to get moving.

79
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,510
Xu Beisheng,

80
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,200
you think you've already won, huh?

81
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,720
I told you, I don't trust you anymore.

82
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,880
You think just because

83
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,920
I heard about the relics,

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I'd come here totally unprepared?

85
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,600
I've looked after you all these years

86
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,600
and you're still this clueless.

87
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,040
So from the very start,

88
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,440
you never believed a word I said.

89
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,950
You got the key from Zhou Menghuan,

90
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,110
took me to find the treasures

91
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,670
and ended up finding nothing.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,950
I thought about it and realized

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,000
the only person who could get them

94
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,510
was you.

95
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,270
You're right about that.

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,070
Take your people to Bao Temple

97
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,480
and move the items out.

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Got it.

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,830
I've supported you for so many years.

100
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
I know exactly how you are.

101
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760
You can endure in silence

102
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,480
and you've got a ruthless heart.

103
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,550
You took the cultural relics.

104
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,000
What was the endgame?

105
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,040
I kept thinking about it

106
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,440
and finally figured it out.

107
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,790
You wanted me to play my final card.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
You used the cultural relics

109
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,790
to lure me into your trap.

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,790
You were never sick at all

111
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,320
and you didn't touch
the liquor I gave you.

112
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,600
I'd stopped using

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,390
those little tricks of yours long ago.

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,200
How could I fall for them?

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,950
You pretended to fall for mine,

116
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
so I'd think the win was in my hands

117
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
and act early.

118
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,350
So you had someone

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,270
swap my gun out too.

120
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,600
You're not that foolish.

121
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,880
Too bad I realized it way too late.

122
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,000
Xu Beisheng.

123
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,670
Can't believe you are Xue Mu's son.

124
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,480
You're just as foolish as he was.

125
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,360
You schemed in every possible way

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,110
and still ended up in my hands.

127
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,670
Xu Qingshan.

128
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
The excuse to lure you here

129
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,040
was full of holes.

130
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,830
I'm sure you knew that.

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,510
If I wanted to set a trap for you,

132
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,760
I'd have to make it look real.

133
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Exactly.

134
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,790
Then why do you think

135
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,950
I wouldn't notice the gun's off?

136
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,160
I've been handling guns for years

137
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,040
after all.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
You were plotting against me.

139
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,550
But I was plotting against you too.

140
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,040
What now?

141
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,880
So you've got a backup plan?

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
And so what?

143
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,590
My elite unit is already on the way.

144
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,200
You didn't actually think

145
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,670
I'd hand it over to you, right?

146
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,390
You guys over there.

147
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,800
Ready to blow the door.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes.

149
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,520
You deal with

150
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,350
the soldiers of the Xus.

151
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,280
Yes.

152
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,490
(The Jiangs are here too.)

153
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
(Looks like they're planning an ambush.)

154
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,500
(Should I give Beisheng a heads-up?)

155
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,230
(Zhou Menghuan, you're being ridiculous.)

156
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,520
(Why warn him at all?)

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,710
(If they start a fight)

158
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,910
(and Xu Beisheng happens to die,)

159
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,030
(that'd be perfect.)

160
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,790
(And if he doesn't,)

161
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,910
(let them tear each other apart.)

162
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,590
(Both sides will lose.)

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,200
(What's this woman doing here?)

164
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,450
Of course I know

165
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,440
your troops would never take my orders.

166
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,840
From the start, what I wanted to know

167
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,880
was only the whereabouts of this army.

168
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,790
You had people wipe out my elite unit?

169
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,590
From the first moment
I was by your side,

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,470
I'd been training a secret unit.

171
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,030
I feared your elite unit

172
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,350
would no longer exist from then on.

173
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,520
Does that even matter?

174
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,110
With these cultural relics,

175
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,110
would I still be short of an elite unit?

176
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,430
Xu Beisheng.

177
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,200
Go tell that to your late father.

178
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,120
Dad.

179
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,080
Take him out.

180
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,040
Take him out.

181
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,280
Xu Beisheng.

182
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,320
You should've been gone long ago.

183
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,800
Dad.

184
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,480
Dad!

185
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,870
Menghuan,

186
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
why are you here?

187
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,140
I'm worried about you.

188
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,940
Dad.

189
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,470
Xu Beisheng,

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,030
I'm taking you down!

191
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,790
Who's this crazy woman?

192
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,880
- Get away!\
- How dare you hurt my Miaoling!

193
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,640
I want you gone for good.

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,480
Let go.

195
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Are you alright?

196
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,070
Who told you to come?

197
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,380
This place is dangerous.

198
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,120
Why did you come?

199
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,680
Answer me!

200
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,630
Xu Beisheng,

201
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,110
after everything we've been through,

202
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,520
I finally realized

203
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,080
and I can finally admit,

204
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,030
every time you faced life and death,

205
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,550
I was worried about you.

206
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,310
Xu Beisheng,

207
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,550
you matter to me.

208
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,240
Menghuan,

209
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,230
don't be so reckless.

210
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,430
Oh, right,

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,550
I've got some good news for you.

212
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,080
The culprit behind your tragedy.

213
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,440
I've known who it is.

214
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,320
But at the same time,

215
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
I resent you.

216
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,550
I made it.

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,150
- Father.
- Commander.

218
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,030
- You can rest in peace.
- Commander.

219
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,870
Commander.

220
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,120
Are you okay?

221
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,360
Commander.

222
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,430
Commander.

223
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,080
Zhou Menghuan.

224
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,710
I'm going to end you,

225
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,790
Zhou Menghuan!

226
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,680
Menghuan.

227
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,910
The one behind your family's tragedy

228
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,760
was Jiang Lin.

229
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,840
Give her the evidence.

230
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,360
Zhou Menghuan.

231
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,550
This proves that the Jiangs

232
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,000
made deals with the Police Bureau.

233
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,280
They got nothing

234
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,400
from Mr. Zhou.

235
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,550
So they silenced your family,

236
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,080
all to erase the evidence.

237
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,110
They murdered the entire Zhou family.

238
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
That's impossible.

239
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,230
The one who destroyed my family was him.

240
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,150
He's been lying to me from the start.

241
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,550
He lied to you at first.

242
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,150
But he had his own reasons.

243
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,430
He was seeking justice for his parents,

244
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,230
enduring hardship

245
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,350
and living under the enemy's roof.

246
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,790
He even gave up

247
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,840
the woman he loved.

248
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,790
Who's ever tried to understand him?

249
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,920
No way.

250
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,750
I don't buy it.

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
Zhou Menghuan,

252
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,550
if he really was

253
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,350
as awful as you think,

254
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,760
why didn't he just kill you?

255
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,030
Why would he

256
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,320
save you over and over again?

257
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,550
Why would he?

258
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,680
Commander,

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
let's go.

260
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,910
Mr. Zhou,

261
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,400
so you still don't want to talk, huh?

262
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,070
Did you take

263
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,470
that batch of cultural relics?

264
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,560
You heartless scum.

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,310
In this lifetime,

266
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,640
don't even dream
of getting those treasures.

267
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,480
You...

268
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,430
Master, someone's here.

269
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,670
