00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,470
Tianci.

4
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,040
Bring the acid!

5
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,510
- Brother,
- Tianci.

6
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,790
what are you doing?

7
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,240
- It's not me, Tianci.
- Stop.

8
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,000
It was Xiaotao.

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,390
Miaoyin is innocent.

10
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,110
No way.

11
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
Young Master.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,030
You only asked me

13
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,870
if I went out today.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,800
How could you assume

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,680
that I did it?

16
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,070
My lady,

17
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,790
you have to trust me.

18
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,440
I would never betray you.

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,430
Xu Beisheng.

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,280
Xiaotao has been

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,040
kind-hearted since young.

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,510
She'd never do this.

23
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,310
Or was it you behind it?

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,950
Trying to pin it on her.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,480
You left at 3 PM

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,630
and avoided the crowds on purpose

27
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,680
by taking the back streets.

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,590
By 3:30, you hit the black market,

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,720
and bought acid from Zhao Laowu.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,000
Am I right?

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,310
It's fine you don't admit it.

32
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,830
Zhao Laowu's on his way here.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,440
You can't stand Zhou Menghuan anyway.

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,020
So how about this,

35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,030
work with me.

36
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,520
Let's ruin her face.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,470
So she can't show off again.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Xiaotao came with me

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,470
from Capital.

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,720
She doesn't know a black market exists here

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,030
and that Zhao Laowu guy

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,160
sells sulfuric acid.

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Someone must be using her,

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,900
tricking her into this.

45
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,110
Xiaotao,

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
tell me now,

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,800
who made you do it?

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
I don't blame you.

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Don't be scared.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,470
By the family rules,

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,110
Xiaotao defied her superior.

52
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,520
Throw her into the well.

53
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,940
No way.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,320
Guards! Take her away.

55
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,630
No, my lady.

56
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,160
- Why?
- Take her away!

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
Xiaotao is my maid, you can't.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,800
My lady, save me!

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Let her go.

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,440
Let her go!

61
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,310
Xiaotao!

62
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,390
Xiaotao!

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,190
Since you want to marry in,

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,960
you must follow the Xu family rules.

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
I warned you before,

66
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,510
here is a dangerous place.

67
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,830
You could be the next Xiaotao.

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,790
The acid incident,

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,600
was it really you, Xiaotao?

70
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,110
You can look into it.

71
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,270
About the one behind you...

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,550
About this matter,

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,920
nobody truly cares.

74
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,790
And no one cares if you live or die.

75
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,200
This world

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,040
is just this unfair, isn't it?

77
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,670
This is imported meds.

78
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,550
It works wonders on burns.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,070
Think over carefully

80
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,910
what I've told you.

81
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,510
It's not too late

82
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,230
of you leave now.

83
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,490
(Mr. Lu, thanks.)

84
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,630
(if you need help, come to)

85
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,500
(Japanese Army Base.)

86
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,340
(— Yamamoto Nijiro)

87
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,670
Lady Miaoyin.

88
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,160
It's so late. What are you here?

89
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,070
Your face...

90
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
What happened?

91
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,950
They did this.

92
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,190
I'll go find them.

93
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,350
Wait.

94
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,720
Lady Miaoyin,

95
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,760
you...

96
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,270
What are you doing?

97
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,560
Siyuan.

98
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,350
You like me, right?

99
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
Take out Xu Tianci.

100
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,550
Then I'll leave with you.

101
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,690
Do we really have to do this?

102
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Are you scared?

103
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,070
I'm not.

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,160
For you,

105
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,490
I'm not afraid of anything.

106
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,630
Menghuan.

107
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,880
You had quite a scare tonight.

108
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,470
If you're still uneasy,

109
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,200
I can stay here with you.

110
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,240
No need.

111
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,150
We're not married yet.

112
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,590
People might talk if word gets out.

113
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,080
You should head back.

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,670
We're marrying next month anyway.

115
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,470
Who dares to gossip?

116
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,080
Good things take time.

117
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,110
I'll be yours sooner or later.

118
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
Go on, head back.

119
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,070
Alright then.

120
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,910
We'll wait for our wedding night.

121
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,030
Let's create art then.

122
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,430
Commander,

123
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,950
you want to see me?

124
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,350
Get me a travel permit.

125
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,840
On Miss Zhou's wedding day,

126
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,200
I need to get someone out safely.

127
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,570
No way.

128
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,440
Commander, that's risky.

129
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,420
It'll cause you trouble.

130
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,260
Do as I say.

131
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,120
Yes, sir.

132
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,750
Go.

133
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,480
Alright.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,880
Congrats, Governor.

135
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,580
Thanks.

136
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,590
Please, come inside.

137
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Where's Menghuan?

138
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,080
She wanted a bath

139
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,920
and asked for water.

140
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,070
A bath?

141
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,160
Yes.

142
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,950
Got it.

143
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,960
You were the one

144
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,030
who came to me first.

145
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,150
Now you act all virtuous.

146
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,550
Shameless pair.

147
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Come with me.

148
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,030
But you really are stunning.

149
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,320
In your dreams.

150
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,230
Shameless pair.

151
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,470
Once I finish my masterpiece,

152
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,720
I'll send you both

153
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,400
to your deaths.

154
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
Shameless pair.

155
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,670
Go to hell.

156
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,080
You lied to me again.

157
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,910
Annoying little vixen.

158
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,190
Flirting with Tianci? Shame on you.

159
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,470
I'll beat you.

160
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,280
I'll beat you, beat you.

161
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,240
Miaoling.

162
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
Come here.

163
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,880
Call your brother and sister-in-law down.

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,130
It's time for the toasting.

165
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,470
All the guests are waiting.

166
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,530
Got it.

167
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,400
Quickly.

168
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,240
Got it.

169
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,680
Tianci!

170
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,350
Look at me, Tianci.

171
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,470
Are you really leaving like this?

172
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,590
How am I supposed to go on?

173
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
Tianci.

174
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,550
Tianci.

175
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,590
Tianci.

176
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,000
My son...

177
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,320
Guards.

178
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,790
Arrest everyone

179
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,030
in the bridal rooms tonight.

180
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,760
- If you can't find the killer,
- Tianci...

181
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,590
everyone here will go down with Tianci.

182
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,920
Miaoyin.

183
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,080
Go question these people.

184
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,550
We must find out who the killer is.

185
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,480
Yes.

186
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,240
On your feet.

187
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,470
Move to the backyard.

188
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,750
Hurry.

189
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,840
Mom.

190
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,880
Dad.

191
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,910
I've looked into it.

192
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,030
Tonight,

193
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,070
besides Menghuan,

194
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,070
Tianci,
