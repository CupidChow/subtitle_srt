=Episode 15=

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
Zhou Menghuan,

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,150
you're just born a curse.

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,710
Anyone who gets close to you

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,230
ends up unlucky.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,310
People like you

8
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,710
don't deserve to live.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
I truly admire the Governor.

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,950
If you have to kill me,

11
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,910
then do it.

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,880
Are you insane?

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,120
Dad?

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you here?

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,600
Dad.

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
Dad!

17
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,430
Let go of me.

18
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,560
Dad!

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
Easy.

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm your young lady.

21
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,990
Let go of me.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,240
Dad.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,040
I was framed.

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,150
It was her.

25
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,230
That wicked woman.

26
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,430
She set me up.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Silence.

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,840
If I hadn't seen it myself,

29
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,870
would you still deny it?

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,510
Guards, punish her by family rules.

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,910
Don't hit her.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,840
- Master, please don't.
- Mom.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,710
Miaoling is not yet eighteen.

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,750
She's still just a naive child.

35
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,030
You still dare plead for her?

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
She's turned out like this now.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
Who taught her?

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,680
A crooked head ruins the house.

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
Hit her.

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,920
I dare you.

41
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,030
Master,

42
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,960
I'm begging you.

43
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,120
Please spare me and my daughter.

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,870
Tianci is already gone.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,710
Miaoling is all I have left.

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
If anything happens to her,

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,150
I won't go on living.

48
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,470
Mom...

49
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,150
Governor, you make the call.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,630
But Miaoling

51
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,980
always stirs up trouble like this,

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,840
makes me wonder how we'll live on.

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,000
The household authority

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,910
will be given to Menghuan and Miaoyin.

55
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,910
You two stay in and reflect.

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,140
If it happens again,

57
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,030
I won't let it slide.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,570
- Miaoyin.
- Yes.

59
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
Go find a few matchmakers.

60
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,530
Pick a suitable family

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,030
and marry her off.

62
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,440
Dad, I…

63
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,120
Yes, Dad.

64
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,800
I'll find a good match

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
for Miaoling

66
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,560
as soon as possible.

67
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,350
(Dad,)

68
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,560
(I've thrown my life away,)

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,040
(married off as someone's concubine.)

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,070
(If you were alive,)

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,190
(you'd surely scold severely.)

72
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,870
(If only you were)

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
(still alive...)

74
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,580
(Shanghai Public Security Bureau Archives)

75
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,030
Dad.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,610
I got what you asked for.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
What took you so long?

78
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,820
Almost past the lucky hour.

79
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,510
Oh right, the pharmacy owner said

80
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,600
this has side effects.

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,830
- Don't eat more.
- Fine.

82
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
Dad.

83
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,000
Governor, urgent telegram
from Capital.

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
I'm Xu Qingshan.

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
Got it.

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
Go tell Menghuan

87
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
to be patient.

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,920
Yes.

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
Alright.

90
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,390
Xu Beisheng, are you out of your mind?

91
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,480
What do you want now?

92
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,630
I won't let you marry him.

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,230
Leave. Now.

94
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,800
Or I'll shout for help.

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,800
If you don't want everyone to know,

96
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,330
and lose your dignity,

97
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,960
then shout.

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,870
By then, everyone will believe

99
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
that we have affairs.

100
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,070
Guess what Governor will think?

101
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,120
Shameless.

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
Zhou Menghuan,

103
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,710
whether you believe

104
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,110
or not, I don't care.

105
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,800
I didn't kill your family.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,390
You don't need to marry him

107
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,270
just to get back at me.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,950
You didn't?

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,400
Xu Beisheng,

110
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,950
you do have a way with words.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,630
But I won't believe a single one anymore.

112
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,710
So,

113
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,190
this Madam Zhou role,

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
you're definitely taking it?

115
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,150
Alright.

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
You'd better hurry.

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
Get everything set.

118
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,310
That's it.

119
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,270
Okay.

120
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,360
Is Menghuan waiting impatiently?

121
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,680
Dad, I think I just saw...

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,310
Saw what? Just say it.

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,510
I just saw someone slip into her room

124
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
and hug her.

125
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
Darn it.

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
Dad.

127
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,230
Dad!

128
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,080
What's going on?

129
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,510
Where's this man you mentioned?

130
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,870
It might've just been my eyes

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,320
playing tricks on me.

132
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,270
Let me warn you.

133
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,560
Xu Miaoyin is very calculating.

134
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,150
Be careful.

135
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,090
Sorry, Dad.

136
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,030
Get out.

137
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,320
Governor.

138
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,630
Has something happened?

139
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,150
Official business delayed me for a bit.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,510
Let's get started now.

141
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,350
Hold on a sec.

142
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,470
(This is bad.)

143
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,630
(That's what I use)

144
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,080
(to get my energy back.)

145
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,630
Who's there?

146
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,750
Governor,

147
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,630
are you still awake?

148
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,980
Governor.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,240
Congrats on your new marriage.

150
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
A little gift from me.

151
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,470
What's this?

152
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
Snake Whip Liquor.

153
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,770
It wasn't easy

154
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,720
to get.

155
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,040
I think this will

156
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,910
come in handy.

157
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,550
You really know your dad.

158
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,800
Go on, get to work.

159
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,910
You ready yet?

160
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,600
Just a minute.

161
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
Almost ready.

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
Come on, come on.

163
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,470
Come on, come on.

164
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
Hurry, hurry.

165
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
(Zhou Menghuan,)

166
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,840
(this is all for revenge.)

167
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,120
(The price I have to pay.)

168
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,710
(No matter what,)

169
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,440
(I have to endure this.)

170
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,590
Menghuan,

171
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,040
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,510
I...

173
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
It's alright.

174
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,870
It's just lately,

175
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,910
wedding prep's worn me out.

176
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,510
Didn't expect you to be so thoughtful.

177
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,760
Don't worry.

178
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,270
I'll treat you even better from now on.

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,670
(Could there be something off with it?)

180
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,870
(Probably not.)

181
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,310
(Xu Beisheng)

182
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,120
(wouldn't leave such a big flaw.)

183
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,350
Is everything set?

184
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,560
Commander, don't worry.

185
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
About Boss Liu's pharmacy,

186
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,630
I've taken care of it.

187
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,000
No one will suspect

188
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,750
Snake Whip Liquor itself is harmless.

189
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,440
It works only with the drug in his cigar

190
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,750
to trigger the effect.

191
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
These are just small tricks.

192
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,510
They won't last forever.

193
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
Commander,

194
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,670
the Governor

195
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,550
has favored you a lot lately.

196
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
I think

197
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,550
it's about time…

198
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,750
He hasn't handed an elite force

199
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,910
over to me.

200
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,510
Last time at the Jiang family,

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,030
if this army hadn't stepped in to help,

202
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,030
none of us would've made it back.

203
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,720
If we act recklessly now,

204
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,670
we might get us killed.

205
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,990
So what should we do?

206
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,150
Use every possible way

207
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,030
to get Xu Qingshan to give me that ace.

208
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,790
So, did you sleep well?

209
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,390
Are you feeling any better?

210
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
Still feeling a bit tired.

211
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,330
Then,

212
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,630
I'll get a doctor.

213
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,980
It's nothing serious.

214
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,030
No need to call a doctor.

215
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,770
Then I'll prepare you

216
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,890
a bowl of medicinal cuisine.

217
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,550
Thank you.

218
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
I'm already married to you.

219
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,390
No need to be so formal.

220
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,350
Xu Beisheng.

221
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,630
Yes? Madam Zhou.

222
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,440
About the liquor last night,

223
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,720
did you put something in it?

224
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,510
What do you mean?

225
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,790
It was your wedding night.

226
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,090
What could I have done?

227
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,960
You...

228
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,790
Governor felt unwell this morning.

229
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,480
As his son,

230
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,080
shouldn't you make him some medicinal cuisine

231
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,270
to show filial piety?

232
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Madam Zhou,

233
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,670
are you lecturing me?

234
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
I wouldn't dare.

235
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,470
But

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,240
if you won't do it,

237
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,550
don't blame me for telling Governor.

238
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll personally

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,120
bring it over later.

240
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,590
Governor.

241
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,480
I heard from Madam Zhou,

242
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,720
you've been feeling unwell.

243
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,200
I made a medicinal cuisine.

244
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,280
Have a taste.

245
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,870
You can actually make this?

246
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,480
My mother taught me.

247
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,120
Then it must be good.

248
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,350
Menghuan.

249
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,920
Wait.

250
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,530
Governor, that bowl

251
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,470
is for Madam Zhou.

252
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,910
It's for beauty and skincare.

253
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,920
This one here

254
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,390
is the one for you.

255
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,240
This is your mother's recipe.

256
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,480
Madam Zhou won't drink it?

257
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I'm not hungry right now.

258
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,800
I'll have it later.

259
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,510
Alright then.

260
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,550
I'm feeling sleepy.

261
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,660
Get back to your work.

262
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,680
Governor.

263
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
Lately,

264
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,440
I've been really bored.

265
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,630
I want to go to the antique market nearby.

266
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,150
The world outside is so chaotic now.

267
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,200
For a woman like you,

268
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,000
it's risky to be out on your own.

269
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,360
Governor.

270
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,670
Governor, if you feel uneasy,

271
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,150
I can go with her.

272
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,000
I can keep her safe.

273
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,450
No need.

274
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,600
I can go by myself.

275
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,370
Menghuan.

276
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,750
Just to be safe,

277
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,520
let Beisheng accompany you.

278
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,620
Stay extra alert out there.

279
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,480
You must ensure Menghuan's safety.

280
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Yes.

281
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,750
I'll head out first.

282
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,680
Governor.

283
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,660
I'm going too.

284
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,510
Go on.

285
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,160
- Master.
- Keep an eye on them.

286
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,250
Watch them closely.

287
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,190
Yes.
