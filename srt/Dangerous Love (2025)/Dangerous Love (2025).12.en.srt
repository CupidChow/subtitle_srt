00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,920
Madam,

4
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,790
Xu Miaoling,

5
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
what do you want?

6
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,040
Where is this place?

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
This is where you should be.

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,070
See where we are.

9
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,740
(Tomb of Beloved Son, Xu Tianci)

10
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Come here.

11
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,430
Look at him carefully.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,240
Zhou Menghuan,

13
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,560
you're such a jinx,

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,600
a sly temptress.

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,200
Ever since you entered my family,

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,150
Tianci had nothing but trouble.

17
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,640
You're the reason.

18
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,680
Now, you're paying with your life.

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,680
Pay with your life!

20
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,400
Does Ning City have no laws at all?

21
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,350
The law?

22
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,560
I am the law.

23
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,920
- Die with him.
- I won't.

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,070
I can't die.

25
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,310
Let me go.

26
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,640
Or I'll take her life.

27
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,270
Let me go.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,680
Let me go.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
Pull her back.

30
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,040
Over a hundred
in the Zhou family are gone.

31
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,280
What did I do wrong?

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,910
Why are you doing this to me?

33
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,360
Now Tianci is already dead.

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,630
Who even cares if you live or die?

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Guards!

36
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,190
She's evil.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,310
Bury her alive.

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
Bury her alive!

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,910
Guards, bury her alive for me.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,310
Bury her alive!

41
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,750
Let me go.

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,150
Help!

43
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,030
Help!

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Let me go.

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,310
Let me go, all of you.

46
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,150
Bury her, now.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Bury her!

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,310
Stop!

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,630
Help!

50
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
Get her buried!

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Help me!

52
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,000
Help!

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,740
Keep going.

54
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,130
Bury harder!

55
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,150
Tianci.

56
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,310
Mom has avenged you.

57
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,800
Commander, something's wrong.

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,490
It should be here.

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
Start digging!

60
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,080
Commander, it's been so long.

61
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,920
Dig, hurry up.

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Come on, dig faster.

63
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,460
Weren't you going to kill me?

64
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,870
Well, I'm still breathing.

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,910
If you die now, can you accept it?

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Zhou Menghuan.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
You can't leave now.

68
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
Zhou Menghuan!

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
Zhou Menghuan.

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,390
Commander, the medicine's ready.

71
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,510
You may go.

72
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,470
Yes.

73
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,710
Tianci.

74
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,000
I've sent Zhou Menghuan

75
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,270
to accompany you in the afterlife.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,920
She'll be right there with you.

77
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,950
Rest easy now.

78
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,240
Why are you here?

79
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,240
Madam,

80
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,750
better not push it too far.

81
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
What do you mean?

82
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Nothing special.

83
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,270
If you keep acting recklessly,

84
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,750
I'll make sure you taste

85
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,310
what it's like to lose everything.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,510
Are you threatening me?

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,080
It's too late.

88
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,270
Zhou Menghuan is already gone.

89
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,380
Young Master.

90
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,370
Let me handle it.

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
No need.

92
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,870
Go get me something sweet.

93
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Yes.

94
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Menghuan.

95
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Dad.

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,270
You can't fight them alone.

97
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,070
Leave the Xu family now.

98
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,240
I don't want you risking your life.

99
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,270
I'm not leaving.

100
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,240
Dad.

101
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm not leaving.

102
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,070
I'll make sure to avenge you.

103
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,180
Dad, Dad.

104
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,670
You're awake.

105
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,880
Take your medicine.

106
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,320
Come on, drink your medicine.

107
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
If it tastes bitter…

108
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,640
Get out.

109
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,390
Bring another bowl.

110
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,950
Another bowl.

111
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Yes.

112
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,240
You can throw a fit all day.

113
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,920
I've got all the time for you.

114
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,750
Drink it.

115
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,390
Get some rest first.

116
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,270
I'll head out for a bit.

117
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,510
(Xu Tianci is gone.)

118
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,750
(What reason do I have to stay now?)

119
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,200
(Li Manzhen and Xu Miaoling)

120
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,840
(won't let go of me.)

121
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,160
Master.

122
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
Master.

123
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,300
Heaven

124
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,150
might cut off all hope.

125
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,390
But a person

126
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,870
must not give up on themselves.

127
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,350
Hurry up, hurry.

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,080
Get rid of all this stuff now.

129
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,230
Move it, faster.

130
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,350
Such bad luck.

131
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Who dares throw it away?

132
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,110
A ghost.

133
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,250
Mom.

134
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,390
Could she be a ghost?

135
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,620
Mom, look.

136
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,840
I really underestimated you.

137
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,080
You're still alive.

138
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
And you dare come back.

139
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
Yeah.

140
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,800
You two...

141
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,630
didn't manage to take me out.

142
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
From now on, you'd better watch yourself.

143
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,030
Sneaking in the gutters long enough,

144
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,720
and your boat will flip eventually.

145
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,030
I want some rest.

146
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Ladies,

147
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,800
please leave.

148
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,840
Mom, let's get going.

149
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,900
What if she tells Dad?

150
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,040
Governor,

151
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
I've settled things with Marshal Liu.

152
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,040
That arms shipment

153
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,510
will reach here next month.

154
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,320
Well done, Beisheng.

155
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
I knew I was right about you.

156
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,390
Governor,

157
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,360
it's about time.

158
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,630
How about

159
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,080
we grab lunch first?

160
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,390
No problem.

161
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,790
Haven't had much of an appetite lately.

162
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm good, not eating.

163
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,550
Fetch the transfer order

164
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,240
from the Ministry of Military Affairs.

165
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
(Old fox,)

166
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,790
(still keeping his guard up.)

167
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,630
Even if you're busy,

168
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,790
you should eat something.

169
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,160
Menghuan.

170
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,150
I heard

171
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
you've had a poor appetite.

172
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,100
So I specially

173
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,840
made some mini wontons.

174
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,240
They're light and easy to digest.

175
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,630
Beisheng,

176
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,910
if there's nothing else,

177
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,750
go back to work.

178
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,110
Yes.

179
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,480
My arms are aching from holding this.

180
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
So? How is it?

181
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,990
Is it good?

182
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,280
Yeah, tastes great.

183
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,510
Governor, glad you like it.

184
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,710
What did you call me?

185
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,750
Governor.

186
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,360
Tianci and I aren't married.

187
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,320
So we're no father-in-law

188
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,510
and daughter-in-law thing.

189
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,870
Besides…

190
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,600
You look so young, Governor.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
Not much older than me.

192
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,960
Thinking it over,

193
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,360
calling you "uncle" feels wrong.

194
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,870
So…

195
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,080
I'll call you Governor.

196
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,120
Do I really look that young?

197
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,480
Then I'll have to take a closer look.

198
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,630
Not just young…

199
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,630
You're also really handsome.

200
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,270
Get some proper rest.

201
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,990
Young

202
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,960
and handsome.

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,840
Zhou Menghuan,

204
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
what are you really after?

205
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,670
Flirting with men.

206
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,960
Isn't it obvious?

207
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,200
Yesterday's incident

208
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,480
didn't teach you a lesson.

209
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,590
You're so shameless.

210
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,000
Can't live without a man, huh?

211
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
You won't even spare an old guy.

212
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,230
That's right.

213
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,750
I am that shameless.

214
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,000
Didn't I learn it from you?

215
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,840
To get what you want,

216
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,150
you'll use anyone.

217
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,160
Xu Beisheng,

218
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
you taught me that.

219
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,990
Cigarettes...

220
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,360
You should cut down on those.

221
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,080
And this tea...

222
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,750
You should drink more of it.

223
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,080
Please be careful.

224
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,590
Then,

225
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,750
I'll bring you a late snack later.

226
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,080
Zhou Menghuan,

227
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
what are you up to?

228
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,440
Take a guess.

229
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,080
Money?

230
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,990
Or power?

231
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,510
Money and power...

232
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,390
I don't want either.

233
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,440
What I want

234
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,000
is a great hero in troubled times.

235
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,840
I remember back then

236
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,600
you swore to me

237
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,870
you wanted Beisheng

238
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,040
and

239
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,270
you'd marry no one else.

240
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,800
Yeah.

241
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,670
I used to think the same way.

242
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,960
But later I found

243
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,240
I was trying to see in Young Master

244
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,600
a glimpse of you, Governor.

245
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,440
