00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,180
=Dangerous Love=

2
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,470
Why did you come back?

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,910
Why marry Xu Tianci?

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,590
Of course, it's for revenge.

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,270
I told you, it wasn't me.

7
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,360
I didn't kill your father.

8
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,470
So...

9
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,270
The one who tricked me back then

10
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,800
and toyed with my feelings wasn't you?

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
Listen to me.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,920
Leave here first.

13
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,190
I'll find the killer

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,030
and the truth.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,340
Drop the act.

16
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,230
I'll say it again.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,480
If you don't leave now,

18
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,390
later on,

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,760
it'll be too late.

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,270
I'm not leaving.

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,080
So you're saying you just won't leave?

22
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,950
I won't leave.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,760
Unless you die.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,550
Or I do.

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,490
Are you still not leaving?

26
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,230
Trying to get me into bed?

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
Zhou Menghuan.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,360
Must you talk like that?

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,650
Do you have to degrade yourself?

30
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,270
Whether I degrade myself or not

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,830
is none of your concern.

32
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,910
Better worry about yourself.

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Sneaking in through my window at night

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,530
looks suspicious.

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,630
You won't explain that away.

36
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,190
You'd better remember my words.

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,190
And you remember mine.

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,670
You and I,

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
it's war till the end.

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,200
Get out.

41
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,110
(Zhou Menghuan,)

42
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,880
(aren't you just relying)

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,270
(on that pretty face of yours?)

44
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,110
(Do you really think)

45
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,470
(you'll stay beautiful forever?)

46
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,750
(Dad,)

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,190
(it's my fault)

48
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,080
(for not ending Xu Beisheng now,)

49
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,080
(but don't worry.)

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,320
(I'll fight him to the bitter end,)

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,320
(so you can rest in peace)

52
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,390
(without regrets.)

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,440
Xiaotao.

54
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
Xiaotao.

55
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,430
Sorry, Third Young Master.

56
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,390
I didn't mean it.

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,440
Let me clean it.

58
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,800
Offering yourself, huh?

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,670
Don't you

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,240
like me?

61
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,720
Of course, I do.

62
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,950
Take it all off.

63
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,440
I like you even more.

64
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,030
(Zhou Menghuan,)

65
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,160
(the man you chose)

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,510
(will be sharing a bed with me soon.)

67
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,950
(Even if you're the lady of the house,)

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,070
(I'll claim him before you can.)

69
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,350
Third Young Master,

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,320
why aren't you undressing yet?

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Xiaotao.

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,950
Your proportions aren't great

73
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,640
and your skin's a bit rough,

74
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,230
like a poor quality canvas.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,210
I'm not into low-grade goods.

76
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,280
You can leave now.

77
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,640
Third Young Master,

78
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,720
please, keep me here.

79
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
If you don't go now,

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
I'll call someone.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,840
Stop right there.

82
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,110
My lady.

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
Xiaotao.

84
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,920
Can you do me a favor?

85
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,320
What kind of favor?

86
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,370
Who upset you this time?

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
Dad,

88
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,440
haven't you heard?

89
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,830
Zhou Menghuan is back.

90
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,550
And she even asked

91
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,550
to marry Xu Tianci.

92
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,600
A tragedy happened to the Zhou family.

93
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,070
She's the only one left.

94
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,440
If she doesn't marry,

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
what else can she do?

96
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,040
Why are you anxious?

97
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,200
It's exactly because

98
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,140
there's only her left.

99
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
That's why I…

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,510
Watch your words.

101
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
Yes, Father.

102
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,440
But Zhou Menghuan

103
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,160
is the one I liked at first sight.

104
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,230
I'm unwilling to give up.

105
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,910
Unwilling?

106
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920
Then go after her yourself.

107
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,040
Why come to me?

108
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,390
You mean…

109
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,160
I should stir things up.

110
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,270
Use this chance

111
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,950
to also test Xu Qingshan.

112
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,390
That old fox.

113
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,950
See what tricks he's up to lately.

114
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,440
Medicine tastes sweet

115
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,910
when it's from you.

116
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,230
So would you be all better

117
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,640
if I kiss you once?

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,320
No idea.

119
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's find out.

120
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,640
Why aren't you being gentle?

121
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
Because you don't rest well.

122
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,110
Busy daydreaming instead.

123
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,460
With beauty in your arms,

124
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,670
of course you'd dream of good things.

125
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,480
Jiang Xu.

126
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,810
You mutt.

127
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,720
How dare you come here?

128
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,840
Careful you don't leave here in a box.

129
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,630
Xu Tianci.

130
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,250
Honestly,

131
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,510
losing your touch
doesn't give you an excuse

132
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,190
to envy other men.

133
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,210
You're asking for this.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,110
If your third leg

135
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,040
won't work,

136
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,940
how will you ever please a beauty?

137
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,520
Mad dog,

138
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,630
barking like crazy.

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Miss Zhou.

140
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,400
I heard the Zhou family

141
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,960
is wiped out by a gang

142
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,880
of unknown thugs.

143
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,520
You're not mourning them,

144
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,880
but came here for marriage.

145
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,030
Aren't you afraid Master Zhou will haunt you?

146
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
This is my business,

147
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,820
not your concern.

148
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,750
Miss Zhou,

149
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,230
that's not very nice.

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,350
We go way back, you and I.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
How could I not care

152
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,350
anything about you?

153
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,350
You must have a death wish.

154
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,190
Jiang Xu.

155
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,960
This is not a place for you
to cause trouble.

156
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,720
Xu Beisheng.

157
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,080
You're running around

158
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,460
like a dog chasing its tail.

159
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,280
In the end, you're just like me,

160
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
witnessing a beauty

161
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,760
marry this useless guy?

162
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,520
Get out of my sight.

163
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,280
Open your eyes and watch closely.

164
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
The truth is

165
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,150
Tianci has recovered now.

166
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
Even if he doesn't,

167
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,230
I'd still marry him.

168
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,350
For anyone else,

169
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,590
I wouldn't even glance at.

170
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,240
Alright.

171
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
You've got guts.

172
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,550
Let's see how long you will

173
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,760
stay tough.

174
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,990
Bring the sketch board.

175
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,430
Can I keep it on?

176
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,990
I'm a bit cold.

177
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,480
Bear with it.

178
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,430
I'll be quick.

179
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,760
You have no idea how stunning you look.

180
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,630
Beisheng.

181
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,870
Miaoling.

182
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,190
What's up?

183
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,910
Looks like Tianci's sketching.

184
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,080
Let's go take a look.

185
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,350
Tianci's wedding is a big deal.

186
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,080
Pick a few auspicious dates

187
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
for Master to decide.

188
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,310
Tianci.

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,470
The person in this painting

190
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,520
looks like the courtesan Feng Feifei,

191
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,320
especially the eyes

192
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
and the mouth.

193
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,520
Look a bit too plain and ordinary.

194
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,080
Get your bad eyes checked.

195
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,190
Pretty, right?

196
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,950
Tianci,

197
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,760
she looks stunning and unique,

198
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,000
but not easy to figure out.

199
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,470
You should be careful.

200
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
You never know

201
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,880
when you might just get bitten back.

202
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,760
Beauty always comes with thorns.

203
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,640
But they'll prick you, not me.

204
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,280
Also, the number of guests,

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,190
the dishes,

206
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
and the gifts for guests.

207
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,470
Honey, you should review all of this.

208
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,800
Honey.

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Can you not be so naggy?

210
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,880
Just decide for yourself.

211
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
When it comes to the kids,

212
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,760
you really should care more.

213
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,470
Tianci is right over there.

214
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,470
Let's go ask

215
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,310
his opinions.

216
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,230
The 8th of next month is a lucky day.

217
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,630
On that day,

218
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,790
we'll set the wedding.

219
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,040
How do you feel about it?

220
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,800
Menghuan, what do you think?

221
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,910
It's up to Tianci.

222
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,950
You ran into trouble

223
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,000
at the Xu family again?

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,540
- I went to gather intel.
- Greetings.

225
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,320
It's normal to hit a wall

226
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,910
on their turf.

227
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,240
By the way, Dad.

228
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,080
I keep feeling Xu Qingshan

229
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,760
is hiding something.

230
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,110
Maybe that batch of relics

231
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,550
is already in his hands.

232
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
Keep watching the Xu family.

233
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,520
Especially every move

234
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,640
of Xu Qingshan and Xu Beisheng.

235
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,910
Report to me right away.

236
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,630
Got it.

237
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,950
Miaoling.

238
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,080
Menghuan's soon to be your sister-in-law.

239
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,030
When you talk to her,

240
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,230
don't be so harsh.

241
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,160
Got it.

242
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,430
Madam.

243
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,770
Here's the guest list for the wedding.

244
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,800
Please take a look.

245
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,750
Madam.

246
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,400
Madam, something's wrong.

247
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,960
Miss Zhou was splashed with acid.

248
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,870
Menghuan.

249
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,950
Take me to her.

250
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,710
My canvas…

251
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,640
It's ruined.

252
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,160
Who did this?

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Who did this?

254
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,840
I need to know who's behind this!

255
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,400
Is this how you manage the staff?

256
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,320
Miss Zhou's room.

257
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,080
Why wasn't it properly checked and cleaned?

258
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,870
Madam, it really wasn't me.

259
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,470
Miss Zhou gave the order.

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,870
For her room,

261
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,230
only her maid Xiaotao can enter.

262
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,470
No one else is allowed.

263
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,470
You still talk back?

264
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,070
Guards, seize her.

265
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,480
Madam.

266
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,600
Tianci.

267
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,640
It was Xu Miaoyin's oversight.

268
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,030
Just punish her.

269
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,870
That's enough.

270
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,990
Don't let this upset you.

271
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,880
Bad for your health.

272
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,320
You're not fully recovered.

273
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,390
Tianci.

274
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,600
