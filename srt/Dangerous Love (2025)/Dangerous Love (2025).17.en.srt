=Episode 17=

3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Get away!

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
What are you doing?

5
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,540
(Ningcheng Governor's Mansion)

6
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,990
Bodhisattva, please protect my child.

7
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,070
Wish her to come home soon,

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,200
safe and sound.

9
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,400
Bless us, Bodhisattva.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,520
- Bless us, Bodhisattva.
- Madam.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Lady Miaoling...

12
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,790
Something's happened.

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,120
Miaoling.

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
Miaoling.

15
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,760
What happened to you?

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,680
Don't scare me.

17
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,910
Miaoling.

18
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,310
Say something.

19
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,040
What happened to you?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,950
Miaoling.

21
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,160
What's going on here?

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
What happened?

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,740
Still got the nerve to ask?

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,790
This is all because of you.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,510
You drove Miaoling to run away from home.

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,590
I could just end you.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,560
End you!

28
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,910
Stop fighting.

29
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,230
End you!

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
What are you doing?

31
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,270
Don't make a scene.

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,940
I'm the one making a scene?

33
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,470
Xu Qingshan,

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,190
you heartless man.

35
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,560
Why don't you see

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,030
what Miaoling looks like now?

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Don't touch me!

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Don't touch me!

39
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,310
Young Master Jiang,

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,680
I was wrong.

41
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,080
I won't ever do it again.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,800
I won't ever do it again.

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,750
I was wrong, I was wrong.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,120
Could it be Jiang Xu did something...?

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,920
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,710
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,120
Miaoling.

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,710
Was it Jiang Xu?

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Get away!

52
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,430
You heartless monsters!

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
Get out!

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Get out!

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,870
Get out!

56
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080
Get out of here!

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Governor.

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,150
Looks like Miaoling

59
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,120
was badly shaken and traumatized.

60
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,030
Let's not agitate her for now.

61
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,660
Let her get some proper rest.

62
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,840
Take Madam back to her room.

63
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,680
Everyone else, come with me.

64
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,960
About the engagement
with the Jiang family,

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
why was I the last to know?

66
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,480
Madam arranged it herself.

67
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,160
And surprisingly,

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,510
Chairman Jiang agreed.

69
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,390
Manzhen dotes on Miaoling so much.

70
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,310
She wouldn't ignore what she wants.

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,430
How did she end up running away?

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Maybe…

73
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,510
it's for some other reason.

74
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,270
Miaoling's always relied on Beisheng.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
But that night,

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
she was in tears

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,270
and ran out of your room.

78
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,790
The very next day,

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
she left home.

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Governor.

81
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,870
Meet a few people,

82
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,510
and you'll understand.

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,200
Yuan Rong.

84
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,030
These two here

85
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,480
were found by Miaoyin

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,720
to set up a match for Miaoling.

87
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,150
Go ahead, tell them.

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,950
What exactly did Miaoyin tell you?

89
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,000
Lady Miaoyin said,

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,000
"Choose the worst—no prospects,

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
not even a decent person.

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,600
It has to be the last man

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,070
Madam would ever want

94
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,000
Lady Miaoling to marry."

95
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,910
That's right.

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,510
She told me the exact same thing.

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,350
Dad.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,680
Do you even have a conscience?

99
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,480
You're hurting your own sister.

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,750
Stay out of family matters from now on.

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,270
Leave everything to Menghuan.

102
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,590
Dad.

103
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,270
Governor.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
I'll take people to the Jiang family

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
and get justice for Miaoling.

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Stop right there.

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
If this blows up,

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,430
Miaoling's life will be ruined.

109
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,000
And the Xu family's reputation

110
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,950
will be in shambles.

111
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,360
Right now, the priority

112
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,370
is finding that batch of cultural relics.

113
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Understood.

114
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,110
Governor.

115
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,710
Yuan Rong.

116
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,720
You really didn't think this through.

117
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,190
If the Xus lash out in desperation,

118
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,490
we'll be on the back foot.

119
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,400
What's done is done.

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,190
They won't make a scene for all to see.

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,640
It'll embarrass the Xus,

122
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,240
not us.

123
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,950
You're still too young

124
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,390
and don't know your limits.

125
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,270
Stay home for now.

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Keep a low profile,

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,070
so no one can set you up.

128
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Got it.

129
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
Is something up?

130
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,120
Now you're running the family matters.

131
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,270
I made all the plans,

132
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,720
only for you to take the glory.

133
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,070
Xu Miaoling ended up like this.

134
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,270
Are you satisfied?

135
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,190
Wasn't this marriage your idea?

136
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,630
Why pretend to be the good one?

137
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,360
You insisted I suggest it.

138
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,400
You lied to me.

139
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
Lying?

140
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,640
Between us,

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
who's the real liar?

142
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,310
What is your relationship with Beisheng?

143
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,960
We're enemies.

144
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,150
Liar.

145
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,600
From what I see,

146
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,070
you two are like partners in crime.

147
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,190
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
Come on, Miaoling,

149
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,960
have some chicken soup.

150
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,860
It'll help you recover.

151
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,430
There's Tianma in it,

152
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,480
your favorite root.

153
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,710
Get lost.

154
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,150
Don't touch me.

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
Miaoling,

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,040
look at me.

157
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,240
I'm your mother.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
Miaoling, you…

159
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Look at me. I'm your mom.

160
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,870
I'm not a bad person.

161
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,710
Miaoling.

162
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,120
Madam.

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,610
With Miaoling's condition,

164
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,640
she should go to Capital

165
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,600
and see a psychologist.

166
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,960
It would do her good.

167
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,510
Stop pretending to be kind here.

168
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,590
Get out.

169
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Believe me or not,

170
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,150
this medicine can prevent pregnancy.

171
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
It is up to you.

172
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,000
Living in chaotic times,

173
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,870
it's incredibly hard for a woman

174
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,120
to protect herself.

175
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,510
And if she seeks justice,

176
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,720
it's even harder.

177
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,510
Heaven sees all.

178
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,730
Fairness lives in people's hearts.

179
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,750
Jiang Xu must face consequences.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,480
I promise you'll get an answer.

181
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,400
How are you feeling?

182
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,380
Your head still ached?

183
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,080
Drink the medicine.

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,670
You may go now.

185
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
Menghuan.

186
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,350
Do you feel like my body

187
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,630
is getting weaker day by day?

188
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,920
No, I don't.

189
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,120
You're just worn out
from Tianci's accident.

190
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,120
Rest well for a while

191
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,240
and you'll recover.

192
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,840
I'll get some more sleep.

193
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
(Xu Beisheng's influence keeps growing,)

194
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,720
(but Governor's health is declining.)

195
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,240
(Even his speech is getting harder.)

196
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,000
(I planned to use Xu Qingshan)

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,390
(to eliminate Xu Beisheng.)

198
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
(But it seems it won't work.)

199
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,480
Today I drank to my heart's content.

200
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,390
And your service was as satisfying.

201
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,960
- I'm not done.
- Go back.

202
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,790
Or Master Jiang might punish you.

203
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,790
Don't bring him up.

204
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,750
He's always meddling in everything.

205
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,200
Go.

206
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,160
Leave me alone.

207
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
W-who's there?

208
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,200
Who's breaking the code of honor?

209
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,490
Sneaking up on me
when I'm taking a leak?

210
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,790
Do you know who I am?

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,960
Of course, I do.

212
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,320
Mr. Jiang.

213
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,200
Xu Beisheng.

214
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,120
What are you after?

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,480
Whatever you did to Miaoling,

216
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,550
I'll do the same to you.

217
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,510
Xu Beisheng.

218
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,080
Calm down.

219
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,670
Looks like you don't like

220
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,080
being touched by another man.

221
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,480
Then let's try a different approach.

222
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,750
Xu Beisheng.

223
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,870
Don't touch me.

224
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,840
Xu Beisheng, don't be reckless.

225
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,080
Xu Beisheng.

226
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,600
Xu... Xu Beisheng.

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,160
Xu Beisheng, what are you doing?

228
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,300
Xu Beisheng, I...

229
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,550
Why haven't you taken revenge yet?

230
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
Are you going to let

231
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,750
the wronged souls of the Zhou family

232
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,320
remain restless forever?

233
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,450
Zhou Menghuan,

234
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,000
you've really let me down.

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
That's not true.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,840
That's not true!

237
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,440
Are you out of your mind?

238
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,670
Jiang Xu has been punished,

239
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,000
just like you wanted.

240
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,720
I want a thank-you gift.

241
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,600
It isn't too much.

242
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
(Since using Xu Qingshan)

243
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,200
(to suppress Xu Beisheng won't work.)

244
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,440
(I can try another way)

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,150
(to throw him off guard.)

246
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,360
(First, get close to him.)

247
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,240
(Then wait for a chance to avenge.)

248
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,280
What's wrong?

249
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
I hate myself for being so weak.

250
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,480
You're clearly my enemy.

251
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,030
I should hate you.

252
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
But in my heart,

253
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,870
I just can't let you go.

254
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,230
Menghuan.

255
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Trust me.

256
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,320
I didn't take the Zhous down.

257
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
And the culprit...

258
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,150
I already have a lead.

259
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,390
Menghuan.

260
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,470
Water.

261
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,550
(Sweet talk.)

262
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,360
(Too bad I'm not falling for it anymore.)

263
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
Governor.

264
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Looks like I overslept.

265
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,960
I'll get up right now.

266
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,160
No hurry.

267
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,720
You've been looking after me.

268
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,680
Thank you.

269
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Get some more sleep.

270
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
It's time to get up.

271
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,470
Just rest.

272
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,440
What's wrong?

273
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,910
Don't like me being like this?

274
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,290
You're overthinking, Governor.

275
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,960
It's not that I don't like it.

276
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,910
When I woke up this morning,

277
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,120
I realized my body

278
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,000
feels surprisingly good.

279
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,870
We've been married for so long,

280
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,480
yet we haven't

281
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,510
consummated our marriage.

282
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,200
Let's handle it right now.

283
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,080
I have to take a shower first.

284
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,240
I like you no matter how you smell.

285
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,230
Miaoling.

286
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,920
Are you awake?

287
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,150
Miaoling?

288
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,280
What's happened?

289
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,430
Kick it open.
