Dad.

I'm sorry.

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840

What are you doing?

59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,320
Hurry, find a way to treat him.

Madam.

61
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,400
his wound

62
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,440
is really strange.

63
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,550
Maybe it's affected by a strong poison.

64
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,950
I...

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,750
I can't do anything about it.

66
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,530
- You...
- Useless.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Get out!

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,860
Get out of my sight!

69
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Useless.

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,440
Out!

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,710
Useless.

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
You...

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
Master.

74
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,110

Dad.

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,110
How about we try Miao Physicians?

77
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,200
I heard they're best at treating

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,110
rare illnesses.

79
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Miaoyin.

80
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,200
What nonsense are you spouting?

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,480
You're up to no good.

82
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,440
What a lousy idea!

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,980
You want to get Tianci killed?

84
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,790
Enough.

85
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,390
Got any better ideas now?

86
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,230
Miaoyin.

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,790
Go get the doctor.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,440
You little brat,

89
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,170
guess you got the cold shoulder.

90
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,280
Serves you right.

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,600
Beisheng.

92
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
How's it going?

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,590
(Cultural relics stolen)

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,450
(and Tianci being harmed...)

95
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,160
(Are they connected?)

96
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,510
(No.)

97
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,880
(Tianci knew nothing)

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
(about the relics.)

99
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,390
(The one who stole them)

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,160
(had no reason to hurt him.)

101
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,480
(Unless...)

102
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,830
Unless the one who hurt him

103
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,000
had hidden motives.

104
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,390
Xu Beisheng was the first

105
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,670
to get the key.

106
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,670
If he

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,600
stole the cultural relics

108
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,110
and ruined Tianci,

109
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,950
then he could

110
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,040
rightfully

111
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,000
become the next heir

112
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,200
of the Governor.

113
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,440
And Menghuan would have cause

114
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,760
to call off the engagement.

115
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,110
Someone.

116
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,370
Master.

117
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,790
Bring Zhou Menghuan's maid here.

118
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes.

119
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Commander.

120
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,730
How will you deal with

121
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,720
Miss Zhou?

122
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,280
Take her away.

123
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,550
If we don't...

124
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,110
Governor.

125
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,480
You called for me?

126
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,640
Does your young lady

127
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,160
have close ties with Beisheng?

128
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,580
No.

129
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,440
Not much.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,230
Think it over first.

131
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,350
Not much.

132
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,920
Is that your final answer?

133
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Governor, have mercy.

134
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,420
Please spare me.

135
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
Do you remember now?

136
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,510
I'll talk.

137
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,600
I'll talk.

138
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
Lady Zhou

139
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,510
likes Young Master.

140
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,160
But Young Master

141
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
is always distant

142
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,950
from Lady Zhou.

143
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,880
They hardly interact

144
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,790
in private at all.

145
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,670
Seems like

146
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,550
it's just Lady Zhou chasing him one-sidedly.

147
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
From now on,

148
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,830
without my permission,

149
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,440
you're not to step out of the Mansion.

150
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,070
Yes.

151
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,920
Then, about Lady Zhou,

152
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
will she come back?

153
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Commander,

154
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,790
you should take her away

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
or end her life.

156
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,440
Or it'd cause trouble later.

157
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,070
We'll deal with

158
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,770
whatever comes our way.

159
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,320
What's ahead can wait.

160
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
Besides,

161
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
it may not come to that.

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,800
Commander,

163
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,950
big achievers

164
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,000
ignore small things.

165
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
I've informed the Zhous' relatives.

166
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,670
Someone will come for her soon.

167
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,480
Let's get going.

168
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
And why is that?

169
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,640
(Why is it you get to)

170
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,910
(just walk away like that?)

171
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,590
(I'm the one you brought here.)

172
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,710
(But you don't care if I live or die.)

173
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,670
(I'm your maid,)

174
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,000
(but I'm not your slave.)

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,880
Sir, how is he?

176
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,550
Can he still be treated?

177
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,400
The wound looks bad,

178
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,890
but the bones are intact.

179
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,880
As long as

180
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,990
he takes meds on time,

181
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
there's still hope.

182
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,130
Then hurry

183
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,310
and write the prescription.

184
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,310
It's just… this medicine…

185
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,600
What is it?

186
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,960
You think we can't afford it?

187
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,540
No, not at all.

188
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,390
Then go on.

189
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,870
Doctor, this way please.

190
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,280
We'll be done in no time.

191
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,190
(Xing City Station)
Why stare at me?

192
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,390
Do you expect Miss Zhou

193
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,320
carry her own luggage?

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
What do you mean?

195
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,870
What about me?

196
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,910
You dare to lecture me?

197
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
You are just...

198
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,950
Stop.

199
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,360
Heavens above,

200
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,560
please bless Tianci

201
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,590
with good health.

202
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,550
Heavens, please.

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
Tianci.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Tianci.

205
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
What happened to you?

206
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,510
Tianci, you…

207
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
What's wrong?

208
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,310
Xu Miaoyin.

209
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,960
Tell me, was this on purpose?

210
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,910
Why did Tianci pass out

211
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,150
after taking that medicine?

212
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,350
Were you trying to get him killed?

213
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
Madam, I swear I didn't.

214
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,150
The doctor is very skilled.

215
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,840
The meds fit his condition.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,910
It wouldn't harm him.

217
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,350
The doctor knows his craft.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,350
Then the medicine must be bad.

219
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,520
You brewed it.

220
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,640
What did you add to it?

221
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,760
Madam,

222
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
I didn't do it.

223
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,080
Tianci acts this way

224
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
all because of...

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,840
Guards!

226
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,870
Take her away.

227
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,000
Family punishment.

228
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,030
Madam, could you...

229
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,950
Keep going.

230
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,430
Stop it!

231
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,550
Stop right now.

232
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,600
Enough, stop.

233
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,510
Madam.

234
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,760
Enough of her punishment.

235
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,150
How could she be treated like this?

236
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,350
Madam, please let her go.

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
Who let you speak here?

238
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,400
You brat.

239
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,390
- Dad!
- Get him out of here.

240
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,430
Please, stop.

241
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,840
Please, Madam, don't hit her.

242
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,280
Spare her, please!

243
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,880
- Madam.
- Miaoyin!

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
Miaoyin!

245
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,320
Stop hitting her.

246
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,760
All of you, stop!

247
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,060
- Mother.
- Madam,

248
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,200
take it out on me.

249
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,480
Concubine Gu.

250
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,000
Usually,

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,510
- you treat her badly.
- Mother.

252
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,760
What's with you today?

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Putting on this tender act now?

254
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,440
Madam Gu,

255
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,030
could it be

256
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,350
that you're the real mastermind?

257
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,110
Did you send her

258
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,600
- to work by my side?
- No, Madam.

259
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,710
- With hidden intentions?
- No.

260
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,550
Enough.

261
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,480
Master,

262
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,790
you've always kept a distance from me.

263
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,280
I have never once blamed you.

264
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,960
But Miaoyin is your daughter.

265
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,440
Can you really just watch her

266
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,400
be beaten to death?

267
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,240
Master,

268
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,400
Madam Gu and Xu Miaoyin conspired

269
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
to harm Tianci,

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,320
leaving him unconscious until now.

271
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,000
Shouldn't they be punished for this?

272
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,110
What do you suggest?

273
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,050
According to the rules,

274
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,790
they might as well

275
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,760
jump into the well.

276
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,310
Master,

277
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,080
Miaoyin is your daughter.

278
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,920
Master.

279
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,830
I'm begging you.

280
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,710
I'm begging you.

281
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,590
Let her go this time.

282
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm begging you.

283
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,030
It's not about life or death.

284
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,400
We're still family.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,910
Don't go too far.

286
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,160
Master.

287
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,440
Master!

288
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,960
Madam Gu failed to teach her child.

289
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,080
She must leave the Governor's Mansion.

290
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,510
Xu Miaoyin.

291
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,440
Kneel in the courtyard.

292
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,590
You can get up

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,470
when Tianci wakes up.

294
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,120
Mother.

295
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,870
Let go of me, let go.

296
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,360
Lady Miaoyin.

297
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,310
Young Master.

298
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,590
Master is in the study.

299
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,720
Got it.

300
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,120
The Zhous' death

301
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,320
is definitely linked

302
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,550
to the stolen treasures.

303
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,360
I agree.

304
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,400
But not many know

305
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,280
about the cultural relics.

306
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,840
And right at this moment,

307
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,110
the Zhous are wiped out.

308
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,670
They moved even faster than us.

309
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,710
After you got the pendant key,

310
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,350
are you sure you saw no one else?

311
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,520
Governor, if you suspect me,

312
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,280
why not just finish me now?
