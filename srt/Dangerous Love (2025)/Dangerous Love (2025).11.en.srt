00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Dad,

4
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,200
I've looked into it.

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,240
Tonight,

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,240
besides Menghuan,

7
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
Tianci,

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
Miaoling, and Madam,

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,360
one more person came by.

10
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,350
Who?

11
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,350
It was Beisheng.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,240
No way.

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,160
Don't make things up.

14
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,350
My eldest brother

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,910
would never hurt Tianci.

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,200
Miaoling,

17
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,630
why are you so worked up?

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,670
I'm just reporting the truth to Dad.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,760
I never said he's the culprit.

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,710
No.

21
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,120
It's him.

22
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,390
Master.

23
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,870
I told you long ago.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,360
Don't keep trouble at home.

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,350
This stray.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,830
He's never had good intentions.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,660
No, Mom.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,560
My big brother, he…

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,190
What big brother is he to you?

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,160
Your only brother is gone.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,830
Lying right here.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,920
Master.

33
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,910
This was found

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
at the crime scene.

35
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,780
(Xu Beisheng)

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,830
I did go to Tianci's room.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,270
But I left quickly.

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,720
- Never met him.
- Nonsense.

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,110
You're the groom.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,320
On Tianci's wedding night,

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,630
you barged into his and Menghuan's room.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,750
What's your motive?

43
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,280
I wanted to bring a gift

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,960
to Tianci.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,870
Qingshan,

46
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,160
why are you still standing there?

47
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,190
Deal with this two-faced scoundrel,

48
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,320
on the spot

49
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,110
for Tianci's sake.

50
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
Guards.

51
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,080
Tie him up for me.

52
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,310
Governor,

53
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,960
if I can catch the real culprit,

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,440
wouldn't that prove

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,550
I'm innocent?

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,520
You know who the killer is?

57
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,830
On Tianci's hand,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,110
there's a clear handprint,

59
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,360
likely left when the culprit dragged him.

60
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,800
And it's longer

61
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,080
than most people's middle finger.

62
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,910
So it's easy to recognize.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,360
Match the prints across the mansion.

64
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,910
No match for the killer,

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,240
no one leaves the mansion.

66
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,390
Well?

67
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,470
How was it?

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
Not looking good.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,200
They might come for you soon.

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,830
While it's chaos,

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,000
take this money

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,300
and get out through the back door

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,950
I'll find a way

74
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,070
to lure guards away.

75
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,390
Alright, we'll go together.

76
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,350
No.

77
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
I can't leave yet.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
Why?

79
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,040
You... you promised me.

80
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,510
Take down Xu Tianci

81
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,760
and I'll go with you.

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm not leaving.

83
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,390
I have my reasons.

84
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,110
Because

85
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,350
I'm pregnant.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Seriously?

87
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
We're having a baby.

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,720
If we rush out like this,

89
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,350
what if I lose the baby?

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,440
So you go first.

91
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,640
Once this is over,

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,790
I'll find a way to meet you.

93
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,070
Alright.

94
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,460
(Ning City Governor's Mansion)

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Lu Siyuan.

96
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,910
Stop right there.

97
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,510
Out with it.

98
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,110
Spare yourself the pain.

99
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,670
Darn it.

100
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,390
I'll do it.

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
You traitorous snake.

102
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,320
I, Xu Qingshan,

103
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,950
have treated you well.

104
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,230
Yet you stabbed me in the back.

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,640
Who told you to kill Tianci?

106
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,480
Talk.

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,390
No one told me.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
Speak.

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,790
I just

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,760
couldn't stand that creep

111
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,630
one bit.

112
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,920
Dad.

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,880
Dad.

114
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,520
Dad, Dad, Dad!

115
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,480
What is it?

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,560
It's bad.

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Butler Lu

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,160
has taken my mom hostage

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,040
and wants to trade her for Lu Siyuan.

120
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,390
Dad.

121
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,640
What should we do?

122
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,790
Tell them to bring Lu Siyuan here.

123
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,110
Or I'll hurt Madam.

124
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,270
We'll all go down together.

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,040
Butler Lu, calm down first.

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,640
Let's talk it through.

127
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,440
Stop right there.

128
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,110
As long as you free my son,

129
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,670
I won't harm Madam.

130
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,550
Miaoling has gone to get the Governor.

131
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,270
Let's put the knife down first.

132
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,160
Keep Madam safe.

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,090
Don't shoot!

134
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,200
You might hurt Madam.

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,050
Everyone, step back.

136
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,910
Step back!

137
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,160
Dad!

138
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Mom!

139
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,950
Darn it.

140
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,510
Do you think

141
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,550
you leave here today?

142
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,640
I'll put a bullet in you.

143
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,270
My lord, I can die.

144
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,790
But my son must live.

145
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,790
Let him go!

146
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,930
Or else,

147
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll take Madam's life.

148
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,200
- Qingshan.
- No, no!

149
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,040
Help.

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,390
Help me, Qingsan.

151
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,050
Let him go!

152
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,720
Now.

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Dad!

154
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,790
I'm not leaving.

155
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
You stubborn brat,

156
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,790
just this once,

157
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,830
do as I say.

158
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,720
Go!

159
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,510
Far away from here

160
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,600
and never come back.

161
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,070
Dad!

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
Go!

163
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,820
- My lord,
- Mom.

164
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,110
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,840
Darn it.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Useless servant.

167
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,740
Catch Lu Siyuan,

168
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,090
- alive or not.
- Yes.

169
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,680
Go after him.

170
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Mom.

171
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,070
My lady,

172
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,320
this dough figurine,

173
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,760
I bought it at the Temple Fair.

174
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
It looks a lot like you.

175
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,550
A gift to you.

176
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm a grown-up now.

177
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,230
I don't like kiddie stuff like this.

178
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,030
My lady, have some red date soup.

179
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,710
My lady,

180
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,950
your monthly is here.

181
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,910
Keep yourself warm.

182
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,080
Or your stomach will hurt again later.

183
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,990
(Monthly?)

184
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,760
(Wasn't she pregnant?)

185
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,390
(Could it be...)

186
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,960
(Now Xu Tianci is gone.)

187
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,320
(Li Manzhen won't be so arrogant.)

188
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
(Life will be much easier for me.)

189
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,280
(Lu Siyuan,)

190
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,910
(I hope you can leave safely too.)

191
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,960
(If you can't,)

192
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,320
(don't blame me then.)

193
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,550
Governor,

194
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,350
my condolences.

195
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,200
(Memorial)

196
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,230
President Jiang,

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,350
your presence is an honor for him.

198
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,230
Tianci, my dear nephew,

199
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,230
was such a good kid.

200
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,720
What a pity.

201
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
Such bad luck.

202
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,410
How could it be that he died so suddenly

203
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,220
on his wedding night?

204
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,590
He must have done too many wrongs.

205
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,960
Tianci's still so young.

206
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,550
What bad could he have done?

207
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
Then maybe…

208
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,030
it's Governor Xu
who did too many bad deeds.

209
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,030
Paying for father's sins, right?

210
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,280
Looks like you two aren't here

211
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,400
to pay respects.

212
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,600
Beisheng,

213
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,960
everything's fine.

214
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,470
Why pull a gun?

215
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,390
Governor,

216
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,000
the arms shipment Marshal Liu promised

217
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,990
ran into some trouble,

218
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,160
can't be delivered.

219
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,320
You two sabotaged this.

220
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,590
Hey,

221
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,370
watch what you're saying.

222
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,430
Even though

223
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,880
my dad is close
to Marshal Liu in private,

224
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,280
that doesn't mean he can meddle

225
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,670
in the man's official work.

226
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,880
Most likely, you upset him,

227
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,230
or maybe

228
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,980
you kept some treasure for yourselves.

229
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,030
Xu, I have no idea

230
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,520
what you mean.

231
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,040
Could it be

232
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,590
you know about some treasure?

233
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,960
I don't get it.

234
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,140
Anyway, it's getting late.

235
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
I should head to Capital

236
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,570
and meet with Marshal Liu.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
Oh right, Governor,

238
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,380
about that arms shipment,

239
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,960
I'll be sure to speak with

240
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,230
Marshal Liu on your behalf.

241
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,440
Then I'll trouble you.

242
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,070
Let's go.

243
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,510
Mom.

244
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,400
Have something to eat.

245
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
Mom.

246
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,080
I know,

247
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,470
my brother is gone.

248
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm heartbroken too.

249
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,320
But I need to eat and stay strong.

250
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,600
Only this way

251
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,400
can I deal with the one who hurt him.

252
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
Lu Siyuan has already fled.

253
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,350
I'm not talking about Lu Siyuan.

254
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,910
There's someone else?

255
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,160
Think about it.

256
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,790
Since Zhou Menghuan joined us,

257
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,200
first, Tianci lost his leg,

258
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,600
then,

259
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,670
he could no longer have children,

260
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,350
and now, he's lost his life.

261
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,920
Zhou Menghuan.

262
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,590
She's the nemesis of our family.

263
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,150
She caused Tianci's death.

264
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,910
Have some.

265
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,870
Eat a bit more.

266
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,190
Governor.

267
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,910
Tianci's funeral is all arranged.

268
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,360
It went smoothly.

269
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,880
I'm completely drained right now.

270
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,280
As for the army's affairs,

271
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,710
I'm afraid I can't manage them for now.

272
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,200
You'll have to take charge.

273
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,600
That won't do.

274
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,390
Matters of the army

275
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,900
should be in your hands.

276
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,520
You're just exhausted.

277
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,320
Some rest will do.

278
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,150
I know

279
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,150
my own body.

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,080
So stop turning it down.

281
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,280
From now on,

282
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,500
make the call if it's something

283
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,200
you can decide.

284
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,640
If you can't decide,

285
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,670
then come ask me.

286
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Got it.

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
Go on.

288
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,990
Governor, get some rest.

289
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,910
Xu Tianci is dead.

290
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,150
Will you still stay here?

291
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
Whether I stay or leave

292
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,470
is none of your business.

293
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,030
How could it not be?

294
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,160
You're still alive,

295
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,470
just to kill me, right?

296
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,200
But I should warn you,

297
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,790
Xu Tianci was Madam Xu's lifeblood.

298
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,520
Be careful.

299
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,430
Xu Beisheng,

300
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,280
I don't need your fake sympathy.
