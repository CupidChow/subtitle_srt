00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,180

2
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,320
Is that so?

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,460
But that day, I heard

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
you and your staff

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,160
talking about the relics.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,320
Beisheng.

8
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,600
Governor.

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,550
Is what Menghuan said true?

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,600
Governor.

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,360
I've never even seen those relics.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,640
However,

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,230
I've been watching the Jiangs.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,230
They often travel to Capital.

15
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,950
They meet Marshal Liu,

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,080
or Inspector General.

17
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,040
And they spend very generously,

18
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,800
even gifting antique relics.

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,310
Can't believe it's happening.

20
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,800
Tell me in detail.

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,710
Yes.

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,250
Is everything settled?

23
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,590
Among the Jiangs' spies in the army,

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,270
now only Xiaomai is left.

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,040
He's usually under tight watch.

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,560
Today,

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,030
I made sure Xiaomai heard the news

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,380
and approved his leave.

29
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,520
Looks like this snake

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080
is finally about to move.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,440
But Commander,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
should we

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
really take such a big risk?

34
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,080
If the Governor

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,600
truly suspects you,

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,840
he might stop delegating power.

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
Nothing ventured,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,030
nothing gained.

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,190
Since he's already doubting me,

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,830
I have to make a bold move.

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,190
Let Xu Qingshan

42
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,600
and Jiang Lin, those two sly foxes,

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,030
turn on each other

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,550
and tear each other apart.

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Are you serious?

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,210
The Xu family has the treasure?

47
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,310
Yeah.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,220
That's the word

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,110
I got.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,930
I'll take people to grab it.

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,360
Hold on.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,190
Last time, we followed Xu Qingshan

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
to the Suburban Temple,

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,470
only for him to throw us off

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,560
and fool us.

56
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,520
This time,

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,090
we have to plan it carefully.

58
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,470
Then hurry up and make that plan.

59
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,870
Alright,

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,600
tomorrow,

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,880
go invite Xu Qingshan

62
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,470
to join my 60th Birthday Banquet.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Also,

64
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,030
let my brother know.

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,270
Tell him to be ready.

66
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,240
We'll lure Xu Qingshan

67
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,440
into a trap.

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Last time,

69
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,390
at Tianci's funeral,

70
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,110
we really embarrassed him.

71
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,330
Will he still show up?

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,030
Xu Qingshan's wings

73
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,600
aren't fully grown yet.

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,110
He wouldn't dare openly cross me.

75
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,030
When the time comes,

76
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,830
you'll use an excuse

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,920
to visit them.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,670
Check in secret for the treasure's trail.

79
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,440
We'll attack from both sides

80
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,180
and we're sure to get results.

81
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,310
Governor.

82
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,250
We just learned

83
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,600
the treasure's at the Jiang family.

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,075
(Invitation)

85
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:06,630
(To Governor)

86
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,910
And Mr. Jiang sent an invitation

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
of his 60th Birthday Banquet.

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,880
I wonder

89
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,230
this could be a trap.

90
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,510
What's this?

91
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,470
Are you scared?

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,950
I'm not scared at all.

93
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,350
But...

94
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,070
the wedding's just days away.

95
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
I don't want anything to happen.

96
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
I knew you were worried about me.

97
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,790
Stilll...

98
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,620
(Invitation)

99
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,550
I'm going.

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
To see what's really going on.

101
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Don't worry.

102
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,110
I'll bring enough men with me.

103
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,950
I doubt they'd dare make a move.

104
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,790
How about this.

105
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,040
Let's split into two groups.

106
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,440
One group

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,160
will focus on guarding you.

108
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,500
The other group

109
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,440
will see what tricks they're up to.

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,140
I'll go with your plan.

111
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,580
Governor, please.

112
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,110
Governor.

113
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,040
It's an honor to have you.

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
Your visit

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
truly graces our home.

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
Chairman Jiang, it's your birthday.

117
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,550
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

118
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Have a seat.

119
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,040
Thank you for coming today, Governor.

120
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,350
Let me...

121
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,110
offer you a toast.

122
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,790
Thank you, Chairman Jiang.

123
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,270
It's just that lately,

124
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,510
the Governor is sick.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
He shouldn't drink.

126
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,000
So this glass,

127
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,270
I'll drink for him.

128
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,230
You don't mind, right?

129
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,110
Governor, you're close to your son.

130
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,230
Why would I mind at all?

131
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Beisheng,

132
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,350
cheers.

133
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,940
Come on, come on.

134
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,790
Enjoy yourselves.

135
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,320
Tonight we eat well

136
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
and drink well.

137
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,440
Second Uncle,

138
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,950
Xu Beisheng took the bait.

139
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,830
Just wait and see.

140
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,950
I've been ready for this all along.

141
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
Nobody moves.

142
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,760
Do you even know where you are?

143
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,790
How dare you barge in?

144
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,390
We know.

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
The Jiang family's loaded, right?

146
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,720
We're here to take some cash.

147
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,920
I'll count to three.

148
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,510
If we don't get it,

149
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,880
I'll start taking hostages.

150
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,230
Governor Xu's life

151
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,110
must be worth quite a bit.

152
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,510
Chairman Jiang,

153
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,950
this is happening in your own home.

154
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,510
Where are your people?

155
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,880
Are you going to let them

156
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
do whatever they want?

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,720
Governor, here at the Jiang Residence,

158
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
we don't have soldiers.

159
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,600
They're just the house guards.

160
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,070
Most likely all taken down by them.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Alright.

162
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,950
Since that's the case,

163
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,550
don't blame me

164
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,200
for stepping in myself.

165
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,510
Xu Beisheng.

166
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,840
Bei Sheng.

167
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,800
Bei Sheng!

168
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Bei Sheng!

169
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Chairman Jiang.

170
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,000
The banquet turned out like this…

171
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,760
You'll need tighter security from now on.

172
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,400
Governor Xu,

173
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,030
you've got a point.

174
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll keep an eye on it.

175
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,920
My dear brother...

176
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,000
I won't let you die in vain.

177
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Xu Qingshan's debt,

178
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,000
I will settle with him sooner or later.

179
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,760
How's it going at the Xu family?

180
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,280
We've checked every corner.

181
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,150
Still no trace of the treasure.

182
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,440
That sly old fox, Xu Qingshan.

183
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,670
I still underestimated him.

184
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,150
Keep watching him.

185
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,910
I refuse to believe

186
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,150
he won't slip up eventually.

187
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,510
Yes.

188
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,520
Darn it.

189
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,840
He dared set me up.

190
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,360
When I was pulling tricks like this,

191
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,440
Jiang Lin was just a nobody.

192
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,550
How's the search?

193
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,660
We went through

194
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,280
all the Jiangs' warehouses and rooms.

195
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,760
No trace of the treasure yet.

196
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,150
That old hand, Jiang Lin,

197
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,880
wouldn't let us find it so easily.

198
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,930
Keep digging for me.

199
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,870
Yes.

200
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,760
Find a good doctor.

201
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,760
Give Beisheng a full check-up.

202
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,190
Yes.

203
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
(Zhou Menghuan,)

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,030
(don't go soft again.)

205
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,190
(Take him out.)

206
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
(Take him out.)

207
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,600
When you make a sneak move,

208
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,720
don't hesitate.

209
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,960
Move fast.

210
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,640
Or you'll end up like this.

211
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,150
Xu Beisheng, you jerk.

212
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,550
You were not sleeping.

213
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,510
Let go of me.

214
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,590
I was asleep at first.

215
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,200
But you stood by the bed too long.

216
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,910
No way I wouldn't notice.

217
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,070
Let me go.

218
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,350
I'm ending you right now.

219
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,550
Zhou Menghuan.

220
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,110
Stop lying to yourself.

221
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,840
You can't bear to see me gone.

222
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,440
Let's stop hurting each other.

223
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
Alright?

224
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,280
No, that's not it.

225
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,990
No.

226
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,180
Governor.

227
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,040
Governor.

228
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,180
Menghuan.

229
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Why are you here?

230
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,360
Beisheng

231
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,660
took a bullet for you,

232
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,030
so I made some chicken soup
to thank him.

233
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Minor injuries.

234
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,550
It's nothing.

235
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,110
Silly boy.

236
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,840
You knew I arranged everything.

237
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,960
Why still step in for me?

238
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,200
It was so dangerous.

239
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,360
It was urgent.

240
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,840
All I knew was

241
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,710
I couldn't let you get hurt.

242
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
Focus on healing up.

243
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,200
Military Ministry

244
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,200
still has plenty for you to handle.

245
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,070
Yes.

246
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
I've got good news for you.

247
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,400
In three days,

248
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,550
Menghuan and I will be wed.

249
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,640
I searched all over Ning City

250
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,840
for the best tailor.

251
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,910
Had a bridal dress made.

252
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,360
When the time comes,

253
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,030
you'll rightfully take your place

254
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
as my third concubine.

255
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,550
Aren't you glad?

256
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,840
(No.)

257
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,880
(I can't just sit here and wait to fall.)

258
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,110
What are you doing?

259
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,320
Sorry, Madam.

260
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,370
The Master has ordered

261
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,350
you may not leave.

262
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,320
Master gave the order.

263
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,400
Who do you think you are?

264
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,790
Dare to order me?

265
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,720
Get out.

266
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,670
Madam, why be hard on servants?

267
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,480
And them?

268
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,520
They're just following Father's orders.

269
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,470
If you're not happy,

270
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,550
you should speak to Father

271
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
instead.

272
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,880
Miaoyin, you've really grown bold.

273
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,280
You even use Master to pressure me.

274
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,520
Well, you taught me well.

275
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,950
If I hadn't

276
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,350
suffered so much from you,

277
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
I wouldn't have

278
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,110
learned my lesson now.

279
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,760
Madam, please calm down.

280
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,470
After all, at your age,

281
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,400
anger might harm your health.

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,550
It'll all go down the drain.

283
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,950
Open the door.

284
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,070
My mother is ill.

285
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,040
I bring her medicine.

286
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,790
Sorry, my lady. Master's orders.

287
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,000
She's only under house arrest.

288
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
But she's still the mistress of this house.

289
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,290
One day,

290
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,470
she might rise again.

291
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,230
You know what to do,

292
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,310
don't you?

293
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,400
Open the door.

294
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,760
My lady, please come in.

295
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,000
Mom.

296
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,030
Mom.

297
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,270
What's wrong?

298
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
Say something, Mom.

299
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,720
- Mom.
- I'm fine.

300
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,190
I'm not dying yet.

301
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,680
Get me some water.

302
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,640
Mom, have some water.

303
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,880
Drink slowly.

304
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,800
How's it outside?

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,120
My dad…

306
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,400
is getting married

307
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
with Zhou Menghuan tonight.

308
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,430
Unbelievable.

309
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,310
Mom.

310
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,430
Don't lose hope yet.

311
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,000
I still have a plan.

312
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,070
Want to know who used Xiaotao?

313
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,880
Meet me in the garden at noon.

314
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,720
So it was you.

315
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,550
Xu Miaoling.

316
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,680
What are you up to?

317
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,190
Zhou Menghuan.

318
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,000
The first time I saw you,

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,560
I really disliked you.

320
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,040
You always act so superior

321
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,590
and full of yourself.

322
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,790
I'm busy.

323
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,470
No time for your nonsense.

324
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,800
Even your maid hates you.

325
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
You know that?

326
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,590
Just to embarrass you,

327
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,830
she even tried to lure Tianci.

328
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,000
When that failed,

329
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,920
she came to me,

330
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,760
asking where to get sulfuric acid.

331
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,000
What did you say?

332
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,560
She wanted to ruin your face,

333
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,950
so you'd live in misery

334
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,040
and beg for an end.

335
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,400
That's nonsense.

336
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,480
Xiaotao's true nature

337
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,640
is nothing like that.

338
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,030
Zhou Menghuan,

339
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,800
you're just born a curse.

340
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,310
Anyone who gets close to you

341
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,880
ends up unlucky.

342
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,880
People like you

343
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,400
don't deserve to live.
