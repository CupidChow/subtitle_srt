00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,000
That temper of yours

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,440
is just like mine when I was young.

5
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,390
Too quick to act.

6
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
We're father and son.

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,660
How could I not trust you?

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,120
But the cultural relics theft was odd,

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,230
and the Zhous' death

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,230
is even stranger.

11
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,220
It is hard not to suspect.

12
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,430
Here's the deal.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,630
Keep digging for me.

14
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,790
And see

15
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,230
who's against me.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
Got it.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
(Xu Beisheng.)

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,190
(You destroyed my family.)

19
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,110
(This debt...)

20
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,800
(I'll make you pay in full.)

21
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,750
(You want to claim)

22
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,320
(the Governor's heir position, right?)

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,160
(I won't let you get your way.)

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,960
(The more you want something,)

25
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,670
(the harder I'll make it for you.)

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Mr. Xu.

27
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,760
It's been a few days.

28
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,880
Feels like no one remembers me.

29
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,910
Menghuan.

30
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,950
I heard about

31
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,290
your family's situation.

32
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,790
You have to stay strong.

33
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Menghuan.

35
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,270
You must've been tiring.

36
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,190
Why not rest inside for a bit?

37
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,510
Mrs. Xu,

38
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,950
let me apologize first.

39
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,320
I acted rashly before.

40
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,620
Letting down the Xu and Zhou families.

41
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,580
But now I've figured it out.

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,950
I come back

43
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,190
just to marry Tianci.

44
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,160
Throw her out of here.

45
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,790
Who dares?

46
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,270
I'm the future Third Young Mistress.

47
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Master.

48
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,390
You…

49
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,440
You… you actually hit me!

50
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,480
My dear,

51
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,200
we do have some misunderstandings.

52
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,840
But I'm still your future sister-in-law.

53
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
You're young,

54
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,920
so I should guide you more.

55
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
There's always

56
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,790
an order of respect.

57
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,480
If her behavior like this

58
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,390
spreads out,

59
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,440
it will harm

60
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,830
her reputation and the Xus'.

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
What do you think?

62
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
Menghuan.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,630
I'm glad you've figured it out.

64
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,070
But

65
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,760
Tianci was set up by someone.

66
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,270
He's still in bed, can't get up.

67
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
What happened?

68
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,340
What's really going on?

69
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,320
Master, Madam.

70
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,550
Good news.

71
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,790
Third Young Master

72
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,040
is awake.

73
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Master.

74
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,510
Thank you.

75
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
I'll go check on him.

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,640
How dare she!

77
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,950
Where is everyone?

78
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,510
Where did they all go?

79
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,520
Come here and attend to me.

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
Someone!

81
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,630
Tianci.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Are you alright?

83
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,670
Madam said you were hurt.

84
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,390
I was so worried about you.

85
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,760
Seeing you fine now,

86
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm really relieved.

87
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,200
About that night,

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,230
you're not upset?

89
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
I am.

90
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,270
Of course I'm upset.

91
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,310
You've done it

92
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,950
without telling me first.

93
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
But,

94
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm even mad at myself.

95
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,790
How did I not see

96
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,100
that you are

97
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,380
actually an artist.

98
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
You know not only how to

99
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,600
to appreciate beauty,

100
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,270
but how to create it.

101
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,880
Really?

102
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110
Yes, really.

103
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,880
And

104
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,830
I really love the snake

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,920
you gave me.

106
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,390
Menghuan.

107
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,350
You're the only one who believes in me.

108
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,720
Thank you.

109
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,390
Stop, everyone's watching.

110
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,390
Master.

111
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,830
Look how sweet they are.

112
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,950
How about

113
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,620
we pick a date soon

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,510
and hold the wedding?

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
It'd be a great chance

116
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,000
to shake off the bad vibes.

117
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,260
Menghuan,

118
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,440
come with me to the study.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,070
I've something to tell you.

120
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,950
Alright.

121
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,790
Get some rest.

122
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,520
Mr. Xu, what's going on?

123
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,720
Menghuan.

124
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
Didn't you say before

125
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,790
you wanted to marry Beisheng?

126
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,710
Why the sudden change of heart?

127
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,590
Did Beisheng do something

128
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,910
that upset you?

129
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,080
Don't worry,

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,230
as long as you tell me

131
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,790
I'll stand up for you.

132
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,720
In the past,

133
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,670
I was too headstrong,

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,640
and got drawn to

135
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Young Master's cold, distant charm.

136
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,030
Now that the Zhou family is gone,

137
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,200
I can't keep being willful

138
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,550
and wasting time with him.

139
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,590
Well, at least you're honest.

140
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,070
But...

141
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,350
the main reason I suggested

142
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,320
this arranged marriage

143
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,520
is that I valued your family's status.

144
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
The Zhous are gone,

145
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,280
but the network remains.

146
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,840
Haven't you always wanted to break free

147
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,710
from being overshadowed by the Jiangs?

148
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,550
You need someone higher up.

149
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,980
And if

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,670
I become your daughter-in-law,

151
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,670
I will give everything I have

152
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,840
to connect you to the right people.

153
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,030
If that's the case,

154
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,880
then I'll be waiting to drink

155
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,740
your Bride's Tea.

156
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,350
(Smooth talker.)

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,910
(I don't believe Xu Beisheng's shady work)

158
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,320
(has nothing to do with you.)

159
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,470
(In this whole mansion,)

160
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,110
(you're all evil.)

161
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
(No one can be trusted.)

162
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,520
Then I'll follow your arrangements.

163
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,510
I'll take my leave.

164
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,480
Get up now.

165
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,280
Tianci is already awake.

166
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
Tianci.

167
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,750
Mom.

168
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
Listen up,

169
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,350
you got lucky this time.

170
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,150
Miaoyin found you

171
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,280
a trustworthy doctor.

172
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,840
Otherwise, it would've gone really bad.

173
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,480
Well...

174
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Thank her.

175
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,550
Thanks, Miaoyin.

176
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,200
My pleasure, Madam.

177
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,950
Tianci.

178
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm glad you're okay.

179
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,910
Since you care so much for me,

180
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,710
why not do me another favor?

181
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,440
What are you doing?

182
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,400
Lend me your hand as my canvas.

183
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,840
I plan to

184
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,520
tattoo

185
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
a toad.

186
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,400
I think this animal

187
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,470
suits you best,

188
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,030
always dreaming

189
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,400
of things you can't reach.

190
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,750
Don't you think?

191
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,630
Enough.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,670
You brat, talking nonsense again.

193
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm serious.

194
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,840
Alright, sit.

195
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,600
Sit down.

196
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,200
Madam, since nothing's wrong...

197
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,160
Well.

198
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,080
You've kneeled long enough.

199
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,280
Go rest.

200
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,510
Yes.

201
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,190
What's wrong?

202
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,990
Come on, have a seat.

203
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,640
(Li Manzhen.)

204
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,030
(You've really crossed the line.)

205
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,520
They've gone way too far.

206
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,920
Why are you crying?

207
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,790
It's just a scratch.

208
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,630
Lady Miaoyin,

209
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
leave with me.

210
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,280
I promise you,

211
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,470
I'll treat you well.

212
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Don't be silly.

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,880
If I leave,

214
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,120
wouldn't that let them win?

215
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,720
Come to think of it,

216
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,520
I should thank Li Manzhen.

217
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,150
That beating today

218
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,550
has completely woken me up.

219
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,440
The humiliation today,

220
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,790
I'll make them repay double.

221
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,480
But I'm scared...

222
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,230
you won't beat them,

223
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,960
and end up risking your own life.

224
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,120
It's fine.

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
I still have you, don't I?

226
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,750
Lu Siyuan.

227
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,750
In this family,

228
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,200
you're the only one I need.

229
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,990
I'm tired.

230
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,040
You go back first.

231
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
Alright.

232
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,870
Lady Miaoyin,

233
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,680
if you

234
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,080
need anything, just let me know.

235
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,720
Xiaotao.

236
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,760
My lady,

237
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,090
you're finally back.

238
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,030
From now on, can you

239
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,840
not leave me all alone again?

240
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,160
Xiaotao.

241
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,760
From now on,
we're each other's only family.

242
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,590
I'll treat you
like my own little sister.

243
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,080
My lady, please don't be sad.

244
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,540
I'll get you something to eat.

245
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,870
Okay.

246
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,430
Dad.

247
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,920
Have some water.

248
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,470
You rascal.

249
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,150
When will you make me proud?

250
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,760
Stop following that woman around

251
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,670
all the time.

252
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,450
But at least you care about me.

253
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,950
Dad.

254
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,200
I remember

255
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,320
you once saved a Japanese.

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,230
Why do you want to know that?

257
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
Just curious.

258
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,480
So I asked.

259
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,760
Siyuan,

260
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,110
times are rough right now.

261
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,880
Let's stay out of this.

262
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,310
Or someone might label you

263
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,280
a traitor to the Chinese.

264
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Butler Lu.

265
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,140
Madam wants to see you.

266
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,680
Alright, got it.

267
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,640
You go ahead first.

268
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,560
About that matter,

269
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,760
keep it to yourself

270
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,040
and tell no one.

271
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,480
Alright.

272
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,550
(Zhou Menghuan,)

273
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,400
(since you chose this path,)

274
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,920
(you must keep going
no matter how hard.)

275
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,310
Who?

276
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,310
Xu Beisheng.

277
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,880
You still dare come to me?

278
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,150
