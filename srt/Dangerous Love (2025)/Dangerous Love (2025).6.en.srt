=Episode 6=

3
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,310
Governor.

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,080
This should be the Luban Box key.

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,630
Where did you get it?

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,480
I found it in Menghuan's luggage

7
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,630
by accident.

8
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,760
Looking at the shape,

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
it matches the keyhole.

10
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,110
No time to waste.

11
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,230
Let's go to the suburb.

12
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,950
Let's move.

13
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,030
Oh no, hurry back and tell Master.

14
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,470
Xu Qingshan's making a move.

15
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,390
Go!

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Madam.

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,630
Zhou Menghuan is missing.

18
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,510
What?

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,030
She's been gone for long.

20
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,360
I asked the maid Xiaotao.

21
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,490
She doesn't know either.

22
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,800
Maybe she ran off somewhere,

23
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,080
chasing some guy again.

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
Madam!

25
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,280
Something's wrong.

26
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Third Young Master...

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,960
He got stabbed.

28
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
What?

29
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,520
My treasures.

30
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,440
I finally found you.

31
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,070
Open them all for me.

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
Yes.

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Governor.

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,830
There's nothing.

35
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
Useless fool.

36
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,440
Darn it.

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,110
Where are my priceless treasures?

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,600
Where's my Kylin Jade Goblet?

39
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,520
All our efforts

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,670
have gone to waste.

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
Governor,

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,550
Could it be the Jiangs?

43
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,440
Impossible.

44
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,960
My men have been watching them.

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,570
They're still on their way here.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But this matter...

47
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,270
Besides Jiang Lin,

48
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,180
who else could be involved?

49
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,790
You got the key.

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,880
Aren't you curious what's inside the box?

51
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,230
Governor,

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
if I had done it,

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,760
why would I hand it over to you?

54
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,000
It'd be easier to keep it for myself.

55
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,950
That means,

56
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,070
when Zhou Menghuan first arrived
in Ning City,

57
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,600
the Luban Box was lost once before.

58
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,200
And the key was in her hands.

59
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,270
Could the Zhou family be behind this?

60
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
In my opinion,

61
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,480
they probably know nothing.

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
I've looked into it.

63
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,950
Master Zhou has a passion for antiques.

64
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,540
A few years back at an auction,

65
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,790
he bought jade pieces.

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,370
Some was from the Ning City

67
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,760
Ancient Tomb owner's collection.

68
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,830
That's why there's a rumor

69
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,980
that the Zhou family

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,320
holds the secret to the treasure.

71
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,720
Head to the Zhou family in Capital

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,670
and dig deep for me.

73
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,720
Yes.

74
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,190
Remember,

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,640
don't let them catch on.

76
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,920
You came back from Ning City in silence,

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,550
and have been crying ever since.

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,560
Tell me,

79
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,040
who exactly upset you?

80
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,350
Alright.

81
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,880
So you won't say it, huh?

82
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,920
Then I'll head to the Xu family now

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,880
and get the truth.

84
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,270
Dad, please don't go.

85
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,040
I never want to see

86
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,350
anyone from the Xu family again.

87
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,920
And I won't marry into that family.

88
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
If you push me again,

89
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,640
I'd rather end it all.

90
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,270
Back then, I agreed

91
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,920
to this marriage

92
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,760
because I thought

93
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,350
with their influence in the army,

94
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,200
they could protect you

95
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,270
in these troubled times.

96
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,390
But since

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,550
you don't want it,

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
this engagement

99
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,600
ends here and now.

100
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,790
No matter where you are,

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,830
if you face anything troubling,

102
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,040
don't overthink it,

103
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,670
just smile more.

104
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,880
Go watch a movie

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,760
and relax a bit.

106
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,390
Oh, Dad,

107
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,720
please write to Xiaotao,

108
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,270
ask her to come back soon.

109
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,110
Alright,

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,280
alright.

111
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,020
Tell me,

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
where did your young lady go?

113
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,320
I really don't know.

114
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,600
That night she said,

115
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,880
she's going to Paris Night

116
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,230
and asked me to find her after ten.

117
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,200
But I overslept

118
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,600
and when I woke up,

119
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,110
she was gone.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
My lady,

121
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,550
Third Young Master's badly hurt.

122
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,440
Madam asked you to call more doctors.

123
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,660
Got it.

124
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,510
Let's go.

125
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,820
(Sheng)

126
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,510
Speak.

127
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,190
Commander,

128
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,830
you and Miss Zhou… are you two…

129
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,670
No.

130
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,260
I got close to her only to

131
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,270
get the treasures first,

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,550
to have leverage over Xu Qingshan.

133
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,880
Nothing else.

134
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,930
You forced her back to Capital.

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,510
Wasn't that to protect her,

136
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,070
get her out of the Xus' mess early?

137
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,840
That's not your concern.

138
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,300
Who said you could touch me?

139
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,870
Shameless creep.

140
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,960
I was helping you up.

141
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,230
Do you have to be so hurtful?

142
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,430
Miss Zhou,

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,320
this maid of yours

144
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,910
seems a bit on edge.

145
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,880
What do you mean?

146
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,740
What about me?

147
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
You dare to criticize me?

148
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,600
You really...

149
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,190
Menghuan.

150
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,600
Menghuan.

151
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,110
Master Zhou.

152
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,990
Master Zhou.

153
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,470
Who did this?

154
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,550
Where's Menghuan?

155
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,990
Who's there?

156
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,260
(Sheng)

157
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,480
Dad.

158
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,750
Dad.

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
Dad.

160
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,310
Dad!

161
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,160
Dad!

162
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,510
Dad...

163
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,910
Dad, wake up.

164
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,310
Dad.

165
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,360
Dad.

166
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,720
Dad...

167
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,230
How did this happen?

168
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
Dad.

169
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
Dad.

170
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,460
(Sheng)

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,320
This is for you.

172
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,000
It is...

173
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,440
a thank-you for the bunny.

174
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,260
(Sheng)

175
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,950
(This is)

176
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,640
(what I gave Xu Beisheng.)

177
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,080
(No.)

178
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,980
(Impossible.)

179
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,980
(Even if he doesn't want to be with me,)

180
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,350
(he'd never)

181
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,710
(do such a heartless thing.)

182
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,600
Commander.

183
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,840
Find anything?

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,320
The job was clean and swift.

185
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,110
Looks like they came prepared.

186
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,240
Let's head back.

187
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,120
Commander.

188
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,400
Master Zhou is already dead.

189
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,110
How do we explain this?

190
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,670
So that Governor won't suspect us.

191
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,550
If he decides to suspect me,

192
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,910
no excuse will clear me.

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,670
We worked so hard with Miss Zhou

194
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,080
to get the key to the Luban Box.

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,910
We're just about to succeed.

196
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,670
If the Zhous incident spills over,

197
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,230
we could lose it all by then.

198
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,400
Years of preparation,

199
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,880
now so close to success,

200
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,440
no one can stop me now.

201
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,720
Menghuan.

202
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,350
Xu Beisheng.

203
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,010
You went to great lengths
to get close to me,

204
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,300
lied to me,

205
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,880
all just to use me against Xu Tianci,

206
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,620
so that you could
take the heir's position.

207
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,280
This jade pendant of yours

208
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,150
is quite unique.

209
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,640
This isn't a jade pendant.

210
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,670
It's a key from an ancient Luban Box.

211
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,310
Menghuan.

212
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,750
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,910
I really did lie to you.

214
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,230
You're the real devil in your family.

215
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,360
Stand guard outside.

216
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,670
Don't let anyone in.

217
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,590
I hate you, I hate you so much.

218
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,640
You already got what you wanted.

219
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,000
Why are you still doing this?

220
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,030
Why...

221
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,110
Why would I like someone

222
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,520
as evil as you?

223
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,760
It's all on me.

224
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,520
I was just too naive.

225
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,150
I actually trusted you.

226
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,440
I brought trouble home myself

227
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,080
and that's why my dad suffered.

228
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,960
I dragged my whole family down.

229
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,280
Xu Beisheng...

230
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,200
Do you really think

231
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
I killed your dad
and the rest of the Zhous?

232
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,520
I heard everything.

233
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,110
What else can you say now?

234
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,350
At this point,

235
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,470
why are you still lying?

236
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,760
Menghuan, calm down.

237
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,110
It wasn't me.

238
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,470
They were gone when I got there.

239
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,640
Just stop talking.

240
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Xu Beisheng, we're done for good.

241
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,720
Get out now.

242
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,710
Get out of my house.

243
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
You don't deserve to be here.

244
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,280
Get out.

245
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,760
I hate that I can't end you right now.

246
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,640
Or I'd take you down with me this second.

247
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,960
Out!

248
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,480
Out!

249
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,350
Go on, get out!

250
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,720
Dad.

251
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,670
I've failed you.

252
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,110
I've failed all of you.

253
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
I, Zhou Menghuan,

254
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,880
swear to the heavens,

255
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,760
I'll personally end Xu Beisheng.

256
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,590
He'll repay the Zhou family in blood.
