3
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,830
Calm down.

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,120
I didn't kill your family.

5
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,830
They were already dead when I arrived.

6
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,600
I told you,

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,590
I didn't kill your family

8
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,590
nor your father.

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,950
Believe me or not,

10
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,030
it's up to you.

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,790
I didn't cause your family's tragedy.

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,200
Zhou Menghuan,

13
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,590
I haven't lied to you from the start.

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I truly love you.

15
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,720
(I'm sorry, Xu Beisheng.)

16
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,350
(I'm sorry.)

17
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,340
Doctor, how is it?

18
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,710
How is it?

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
I've tried my best.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,270
You'd better prepare for the worst.

22
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,040
No matter what,

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,590
you have to save him.

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,100
He's lost too much blood.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,270
We need to operate now.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,510
But during wartime,

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,510
I can't get anesthesia.

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,350
You...

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
I can take it.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
You can't go in.

31
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,550
Let me go in.

32
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,670
Just let me see him once.

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,270
Please, let me go in.

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,960
Let me in.

35
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm begging you.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,960
Let me in to see him just once.

37
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,110
I'm begging you.

38
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,750
Let me in.

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,670
Why are you here again?

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
How is he?

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,550
Is he in danger?

42
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,750
Very much so.

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,750
The doctor is operating inside.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Let me go in.

45
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,240
How is he now?

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,000
Is he going to die?

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,670
Not for now.

48
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,440
If his fever goes down in three days,

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
he'll have a chance.

When he wakes up,

92
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,230
he needs nutritious food

93
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,350
to build his strength back.

94
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,640
His body is still pretty weak.

95
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,950

That way,

107
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,920
you can look out for each other.

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,440

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,560
Miss Zhou,

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,280
long time no see.

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,510
Lu Siyuan.

116
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,510
I heard the Xu family

117
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,720
is run by Xu Beisheng now.

118
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,760
Could you show me the way?

119
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,600
I need to talk to him.

120
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,910
I've cut ties

121
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,270
with the Xu family.

122
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Go in by yourself.

123
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,110
Commander.

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,280
Commander.

125
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
You're awake.

126
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,350
Commander.

127
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,350
Easy, slow down.

128
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,880
Where's Zhou Menghuan?

129
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,140
Miss Zhou

130
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,230
looked after you all day.

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,110
She's probably resting now.

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

133
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,760
Let her sleep a bit longer.

134
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,790
- Get down.
- Don't move.

135
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,880
Nobody moves.

136
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,110
Or you'll pay with your lives.

137
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,040
Lu Siyuan, what are you trying to do?

138
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,670
You'll find out soon enough.

139
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,040
Commander, look over here.

140
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Young Master.

141
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,900
Something's wrong.

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Lu Siyuan is back.

143
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,200
Lu Siyuan?

144
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,370
That's him.

145
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,000
He's brought a bunch of armed men.

146
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,440
They're attacking our people.

147
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,320
Yuan Rong, let's go.

148
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
No need for that.

149
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,910
I'm here.

150
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,680
Young Master Xu.

151
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,310
It's been a while.

152
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,910
Mr. Lu, looks like you've changed a lot.

153
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,920
Go on.

154
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,470
What brings you here?

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,720
Today,

156
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
I,

157
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,710
on behalf of Mr. Yamamoto,

158
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,400
have come to discuss a deal with you.

159
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,910
Yamamoto?

160
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
From Japan?

161
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,030
I heard the cultural relics

162
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,470
are now with you.

163
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,440
Mr. Yamamoto seems very interested.

164
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,710
Young Master Xu, I wonder if you

165
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,320
might hand it over to us.

166
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,670
- Xu Beisheng.
- Stay.

167
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,080
- Don't move.
- Xu Beisheng.

168
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,200
Don't listen to him.

169
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,890
Our national treasures

170
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,240
must never end up in foreign hands.

171
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,350
Lu Siyuan,

172
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,190
no,

173
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,350
I should call you Captain Lu now.

174
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,150
When discussing cooperation,

175
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,110
you should show
a more cooperative stance.

176
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,840
This is a big matter.

177
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,670
I need to think it over.

178
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,280
I'll give you

179
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,710
plenty of time to decide.

180
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,440
After all, we go way back.

181
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,000
These past few days,

182
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,470
I'll be staying here.

183
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,150
That way, we can catch up.

184
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
Commander,

185
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,550
I'll mobilize the troops.

186
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,150
He came fully prepared.

187
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,230
I'm afraid none of us can get out now.

188
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,600
Menghuan,

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,840
are you hurt?

190
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm fine.

191
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,840
I heard from Yuan Rong,

192
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,320
that you've been taking care of me.

193
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,160
You must be tired.

194
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,870
Xu Beisheng,

195
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,760
don't be so good to me.

196
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,510
I don't deserve it.

197
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,190
Your injury…

198
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,350
You're being so obedient.

199
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,590
It feels a little strange to me.

200
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,000
Sorry.

201
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,200
I've been misunderstanding you.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,840
I've done so many things that hurt you.

203
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,690
Menghuan, before this,

204
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,080
the only reason I lived

205
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,910
was to get revenge.

206
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,640
But after what we've been through,

207
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,440
I finally realize

208
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,230
how much you mean to me.

209
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,120
But,

211
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,670
the situation is getting more tense.

212
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,550
We might be facing a war soon.

213
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,150
And it won't be easy

214
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,350
to handle Lu Siyuan.

215
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,000
I never thought

216
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,200
Lu Siyuan would betray our nation.

217
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,280
The country is in danger.

218
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,110
We can't just look out for ourselves.

219
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
We must protect

220
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,440
the national treasure at all costs.

221
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,550
It must never fall into their hands.

222
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,510
I understand.

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,770
Don't make pointless sacrifices.

224
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,250
We need a prudent plan.

225
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,640
Xu Beisheng.

226
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,480
No matter

227
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,960
what choice you decide to make,

228
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,960
I'll stand by you.

229
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,780
(Ning City Governor's Mansion)

230
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,680
Stop right there.

231
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,630
Who are you?

232
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,350
Are you all new here?

233
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm the Second Young Lady of the Xu family.

234
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,550
Second Young Lady? Whatever.

235
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,880
Without orders from above,

236
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,230
no one goes in or out.

237
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,200
You're Xu Miaoyin?

238
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,510
Yes.

239
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,160
And who are you?

240
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,520
Take this old lady inside first.

241
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,360
Lock her up.

242
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,910
Miaoyin.

243
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,840
- Don't.
- Don't move.

244
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
Who the heck are you?

245
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Don't you touch my mom.

246
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,510
Stop right there.

247
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,510
- Miaoyin.
- Stay.

248
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,920
No sudden moves.

249
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Who are you people?

250
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,480
What do you want?

251
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,280
We are a Special Operation Unit

252
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,710
of Mr. Yamamoto, Chief of Staff

253
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,000
of the 54th Division,
Imperial Japanese Army.

254
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,110
As for what we want,

255
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,470
once you meet our representative,

256
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,840
you'll understand.

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,840
Miss Xu,

258
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,510
this way, please.

259
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,320
I'd rather not be rough with a lady.

260
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,000
This is my room.

261
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,400
The representative

262
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,520
lives right here?

263
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,600
That's right.

264
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,280
Miss Xu, please head in.

265
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,470
Don't keep our representative waiting.

266
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,430
Lu Siyuan.

267
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,190
Lady Miaoyin.

268
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,600
It's been a while.

269
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
Siyuan.

270
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,840
You're back.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm still alive.

272
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,350
Are you disappointed?

273
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,750
Siyuan.

274
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,350
Why would you say that?

275
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,800
With you back,

276
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,790
I'm happy of course.

277
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,910
Or do you also want to tell me

278
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
the baby you were carrying

279
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,550
was lost by accident

280
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,030
and you want me to comfort you

281
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,990
and make it up to you?

282
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,120
