00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,930
Mr. Xu.

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,850
Mrs. Xu.

5
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,950
What is it?

6
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,100
Menghuan,

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,960
relax.

8
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,680
Something went missing.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,860
We just wanted to know

10
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,790
if you've seen it.

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
What are you implying?

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,120
You think we're thieves?

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,480
Isn't the Zhou family known for manners?

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
How did they raise

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,120
a girl with no manners?

16
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,470
Mom,

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
if Menghuan truly knew the rules,

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
how could she

19
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,940
betray my brother Tianci?

20
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,430
I heard

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,480
her connection with the Jiang young master

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
is far from simple.

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,390
Enough.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,270
Show some respect to Miss Zhou.

25
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,000
It was a misunderstanding.

26
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,830
The papers made all that up.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,360
Since your family is so unhappy with me,

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,880
then fine.

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,220
Let's call off the engagement.

30
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,910
I'll head back to Capital.

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,670
Menghuan.

32
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,070
You've got it wrong.

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,230
We'd never doubt your character.

34
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,120
As for this girl,

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,160
that's harder to say.

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,950
What are you doing?

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Stop!

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
Why would you hit her?

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
Tell them to stop.

40
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,190
Why would you hit her?

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,390
You have no reasons.

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,950
Stop!

43
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,310
Stop!

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,560
Governor.

45
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,750
We found the item.

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,910
Where did you find it?

47
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,880
Stolen goods usually end up

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,110
on the black market.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,160
So I figured I'd try my luck there.

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,550
A few regular offenders

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,390
were fencing goods.

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,390
According to them,

53
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,960
the house was empty last night.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,460
They slipped in and took it.

55
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,110
Nice work.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,320
Beisheng, you're hurt.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,560
It's fine, just a cut

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,830
when I got the Box back.

59
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,750
Menghuan.

60
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720
You saw it yourself.

61
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,000
A misunderstanding.

62
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,230
A misunderstanding.

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,000
You're not mad at me, right?

64
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,510
See? It's all my fault.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,960
I didn't check things properly.

66
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,310
Menghuan.

67
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,750
When your birthday comes,

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,080
we'll throw a big celebration.

69
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,360
By then,

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,570
I'll apologize to you.

71
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,030
No need.

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
I'd like to rest.

73
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,440
Go on, get some rest.

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,720
Thanks.

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,830
(Those two...)

76
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,080
(Could there really be something?)

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Mom, I'm still feeling awful.

78
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,270
I'm in no mood to please a girl.

79
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,460
Just do it.

80
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,750
Go cheer up Miss Zhou now.

81
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,830
Or that wild kid will snatch her out.

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,190
Do you still want

83
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,190
to be the heir?

84
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
No one can take

85
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,880
what belongs to me.

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Beautiful.

87
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,390
So breathtaking.

88
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,510
Like the most perfect canvas.

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
Who's there?

90
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,320
Who's outside?

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,600
Xu Tianci.

92
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
Xu Tianci.

93
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,600
It's late.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,550
What are you doing here?

95
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,880
Miss Menghuan.

96
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,760
Will you be my model?

97
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,160
(So gross...)

98
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,510
I'm an ordinary girl,

99
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
not a model.

100
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
It's fine though.

101
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,600
I can teach you.

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
No need.

103
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
I...

104
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,070
don't feel like learning yet.

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,950
Maybe in a couple of days.

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,550
I want to rest first.

107
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,600
Alright.

108
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,510
I've got all the time.

109
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
See you.

110
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,320
I'm calling off this marriage.

111
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,830
That Xu Tianci

112
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,440
keeps showing up every single day.

113
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,390
So annoying.

114
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,670
And Xu Beisheng.

115
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,270
I have no idea what he's busy with.

116
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,040
Can't even catch a glimpse of him.

Miss Zhou, you are in the mood.

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,790
In this weather,

123
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,100
you're still out here.

124
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,510
Better head back.

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
Don't get sick.

126
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,920
Whether I get sick or not,

127
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,110
you wouldn't care.

128
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,950
I've been here a few days

129
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,440
and haven't seen you once.

130
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,720
Military affairs

131
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,790
kept me busy.

132
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,350
Let me walk you to...

133
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,200
I don't need that.

134
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,670
Sorry about that.

135
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,750
I didn't mean it.

136
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,790
It's just a cut.

It is still a wound.

140
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,510
Back to my room with me.

141
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,510
Let me apply meds.

142
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,950
I brought it back from Capital.

143
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,070
It works really well.

144
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,880
Come on, let's go.

145
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,160
You manage the troops,

146
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,320
so many injuries around.

147
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,950
I'm used to it.

148
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,760
Used to it?

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,230
How can you get used to that?

150
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,250
It really worries people.

151
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,070
Don't let this happen again.

152
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,790
Interesting.

153
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,510
And who are you to order me around?

154
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,200
A friend.

155
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,160
A friend.

156
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
What kind of friend?

157
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,790
Of course, just a regular friend.

158
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,110
(Xu Beisheng,)

159
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,940
(don't you dare mess this up.)

160
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
Looks like you care about me.

161
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,320
Having you as a friend
sure has its perks.

162
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,390
Thanks for the meds.

163
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,600
I'll take my leave.

164
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,350
Xu Beisheng.

165
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
In a couple of days,

166
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,670
it's going to be my birthday.

167
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,550
Come celebrate with me.

168
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,720
Sorry, Miss Zhou.

169
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,440
I have an important task.

170
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
Might not be back.

171
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,040
Fine, then.

172
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
I wasn't dying to invite you.

173
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,110
(For those spoiled young ladies,)

174
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,920
(the less you indulge them,)

175
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,580
(the more they're drawn to you.)

176
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,040

Trash!

179
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,680
Don't move!

180
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,030
You worthless things,

181
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
not even worthy to be my canvas.

182
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,550
Trash!

183
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,510

187
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,150
Everyone, out of here!

188
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,000
Come on, hurry up.

189
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,280
Get the dishes in place.

190
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,360
Don't mess things up.

191
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Faster.

192
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,630
Go easy on the oil.

193
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,470
Miss Zhou prefers light flavors.

194
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,550
Got it, Lady Miaoyin.

195
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,520
Cut the carrots finer.

196
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,760
Make sure everything's cleaned well.

197
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,670
Miss Zhou's meals are very refined.

198
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,590
We can't shame the Governor.

199
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,080
Rest assured, Madam.

200
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,400
I'll keep a close watch.

201
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,550
Mom,

202
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,570
I remember

203
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,150
Miss Zhou loves fish slices.

204
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,590
Didn't we just get a batch of pufferfish?

205
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,400
Have them cook it.

206
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,350
Then have Tianci deliver it himself.

207
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,230
Miss Zhou will definitely love it.

208
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
Pufferfish is precious,

209
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,550
but also poisonous.

210
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,030
Normally, it takes days to prepare.

211
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,910
If we use it now,

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,910
could it be risky?

213
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,200
What risk could it be?

214
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,710
Just tell the chef to be extra careful.

215
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,950
You're overthinking.

216
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,390
Mom,

217
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,320
if you were still here,

218
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,520
you'd never let me marry Xu Tianci.

219
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,590
He's total creep.

220
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
My lady,

221
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,700
people here

222
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,880
sent loads of expensive gifts

223
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,200
to celebrate your birthday.

224
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,120
Come take a look.

225
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,840
So tacky.

226
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,870
Xiaotao.

227
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,160
A couple of days ago,

228
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,280
you put up with a lot.

229
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
Pick anything you like.

230
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
Really?

231
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,680
Thank you, my lady.

232
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,710
(If only I could marry into the Xu family.)

233
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,350
You don't like gaudy things.

234
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,320
I wonder if my gift

235
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,640
will be to your taste.

236
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,240
Xu Tianci,

237
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,840
what scheme are you cooking up now?

238
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,550
Why are you so guarded with me?

239
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,240
Nothing at all.

240
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,810
Just a bowl of porridge.

241
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,550
Relax.

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm not that low.

243
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
I wouldn't mess with the food.

244
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,310
Tastes really good.

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
But...

246
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,520
Compared to
Tianxiang Restaurant in Capital,

247
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,720
it's way behind.

248
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,430
That's okay.

249
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,550
It'll get better.

250
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,280
