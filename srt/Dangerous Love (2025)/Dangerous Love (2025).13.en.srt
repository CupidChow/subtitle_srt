00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,840
I was trying to see in Young Master

4
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,720
a glimpse of you, Governor.

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,760
What are you two up to?

6
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,110
Zhou Menghuan.

7
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,440
You shameless woman.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,720
You caused my son's death

9
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,040
and now you're tempting Master?

10
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,120
I'll end you!

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,360
You shameless woman!

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,480
I'll end you!

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,600
Manzhen, have you lost your mind?

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,270
This isn't how a mistress acts.

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,400
You're crazy.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,240
You're the crazy one.

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,550
You're really tangled up with her?

18
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,000
She's your daughter-in-law!

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,240
Qingshan,

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
if you do this...

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,690
how could you face Tianci?

22
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,040
He's barely gone.

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,880
Daughter-in-law?

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,990
She didn't finish the rituals.

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,400
This marriage doesn't count.

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,070
Listen,

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,080
I'm set on marrying her.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,200
Shameless.

29
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,830
Utterly shameless.

30
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,510
Alright, enough.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,560
Don't get worked up.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Xu Qingshan,

33
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,270
my son just died horribly

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,030
and you're blinded by desire,

35
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,910
wanting to marry his woman.

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,950
You animal!

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,920
You scum!

38
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,080
Are you even human?

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,110
Tianci,

40
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
Don't worry.

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,670
I'll make sure they pay for this.

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
Someone.

44
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,590
Madam.

45
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,720
Call Miaoyin over here.

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Yes.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,060
Commander Xu, why are you tailing me?

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,440
Zhou Menghuan, listen,

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,030
if you cross Xu Qingshan,

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,000
you'll end up dead.

51
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,270
Dead?

52
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,360
You should worry about yourself, not me.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,880
I came here

54
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,550
for one reason, to end you.

55
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,950
Oh, really?

56
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,000
Maybe I should finish you first.

57
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,230
Madam.

58
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,590
You wanted to see me?

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,840
Miaoyin.

60
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,630
I heard that your mother

61
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,630
is staying at a church on the east side.

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,110
I'll go tell Master right now.

63
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,160
We'll bring her back at once.

64
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,390
Really?

65
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,110
Thank you, Madam.

66
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,750
Ever since that incident with Tianci,

67
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,800
I've been thinking a lot.

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
This family

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,070
should still be in your hands.

70
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,070
Then I can rest easy.

71
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
Such a pity.

72
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,760
What's the pity?

73
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,550
Zhou Menghuan showed up out of nowhere.

74
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,270
Now Master is

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,830
completely smitten with her.

76
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,110
He insists on making her a concubine

77
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,830
and wants to give her the authority

78
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,830
to run the households.

79
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,510
How could that be?

80
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,950
She has no right.

81
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
No one dares go against

82
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,160
Master's decision.

83
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Unless...

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,790
we make the first move

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,000
and keep her out of this house.

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
Why let go?

87
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Why not just end me?

88
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,230
You might as well take me out.

89
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,670
Then we can finally

90
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,760
put this to an end.

91
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,110
Zhou Menghuan,

92
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,830
how did you turn into this?

93
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,510
I hope you'll tell me someday.

94
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,390
Come in.

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,600
Miss Menghuan,

96
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
you got up early.

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
Miaoyin,

98
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,200
what brings you here?

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,920
You seem worn out lately.

100
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,190
So

101
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,320
I made some chicken soup

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,640
just for you.

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,260
Drink it hot.

104
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,790
It won't taste the same cold.

105
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,790
Thank you, Miaoyin.

106
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,350
You're thoughtful.

107
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,070
Ever since I came here,

108
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,390
you've always treated me…

109
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,200
What's going on?

110
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
What did you put in this?

111
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Someone.

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,440
Someone.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,440
It's bad, go get Master now.

114
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,440
Yes.

115
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,390
Master!

116
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Miss Menghuan, she…

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,760
What is it? Why the panic?

118
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,630
Speak slowly.

119
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,720
Miss Menghuan, she…

120
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,910
She's gone.

121
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,630
Menghuan.

122
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,040
Menghuan.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,840
This...

124
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,550
What on earth happened here?

125
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,670
- Who did this?
- No idea, Master.

126
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,510
She's already gone when we came.

127
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,510
Back then,

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,950
only Miaoyin was here.

129
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,390
Madam,

130
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,760
didn't you tell me to put arsenic
in the soup

131
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,480
to poison Zhou Menghuan?

132
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
You wicked girl.

133
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,510
Stop making up wild accusations.

134
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,110
You put in the arsenic

135
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,200
and brought her the chicken soup.

136
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,880
It wasn't me.

137
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,510
You're talking nonsense.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
Qingshan.

139
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,920
Such a cunning plan, Madam.

140
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,790
Were you planning to

141
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,110
poison me to death right here

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,790
and sell off Miaoyin?

143
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,200
Two birds one stone.

144
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,720
Unfortunately,

145
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,210
I'm not as foolish as you think.

146
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,510
That's why I teamed up with Menghuan

147
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,950
to put on an act.

148
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,760
Zhou Menghuan.

149
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,110
Li Manzhen is after both our lives.

150
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,230
So, what do you say?

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Shall we work together?

152
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,790
Once it's done,

153
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,640
we both get what we want.

154
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,630
Commander,

155
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,430
maybe... I should leave.

156
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,470
Madam will never tolerate me.

157
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,600
Menghuan.

158
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,350
How could you be so cruel

159
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,840
to do something like this?

160
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
Qingshan,

161
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,030
we've been married for decades.

162
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,400
I bore you children.

163
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,990
If not credit, at least hard work counts.

164
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,910
You can't just

165
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,440
throw our marriage away.

166
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,790
If not for all these years together,

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,520
I'd have thrown you out today.

168
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
Guards!

169
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Qingshan,

170
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,590
you can't treat me like this.

171
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,910
Lock this vile woman away.

172
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,210
- Qingshan.
- She doesn't leave

173
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:29,980
without my say.

174
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,900
Qingshan,

175
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,080
you can't do this to me.

176
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,230
Qingshan.

177
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,600
Menghuan.

178
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,020
Don't worry.

179
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,440
No one will bully you again.

180
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,790
I'll keep you safe.

181
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
I've got it arranged.

182
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,120
In a few days,

183
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,070
you'll marry me

184
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,340
as my third concubine.

185
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,280
Thank you, Governor.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,860
Actually, Governor,

187
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,670
you really shouldn't mind
a bit of gray hair.

188
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,000
Because

189
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,320
it makes you look

190
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,520
even more handsome.

191
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,030
Ah, I adore that sweet talk of yours.

192
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,670
You've got the silver tongue.

193
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,030
I just worry

194
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,230
people will say I'm too old for you.

195
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,760
Maybe some younger ones

196
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
prefer a man in his prime.

197
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,920
Governor.

198
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,220
Beisheng, you're here.

199
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,880
A gang of outlaws appeared in West Hill.

200
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,200
They've been doing

201
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,040
all kinds of wrong.

202
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,790
People are upset about it.

203
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,950
It has to be dealt with.

204
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
This matter...

205
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,760
Go handle it as you see fit.

206
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,480
Yes.

207
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,110
What's wrong, Menghuan?

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,920
Nothing really.

209
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,470
Just that Beisheng won't leave

210
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,000
and block my sunlight.

211
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
Beisheng.

212
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,400
Anything else?

213
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,430
Governor,

214
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,320
last month's major camp events

215
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,240
have been recorded.

216
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,350
Read it when you have time.

217
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,550
Alright, got it.

218
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,590
Get back to work.

219
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,990
Yes.

220
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,160
Governor.

221
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,120
It's done.

222
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,150
Lately,

223
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,910
I've been hearing some rumors.

224
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,710
They say in the army, Beisheng

225
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,760
has absolute authority.

226
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,760
Even the folks in Ning City

227
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,590
think he's the real one in charge.

228
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,280
It's honestly infuriating.

229
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,550
I've only been sick for a while

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,960
and this gossip's already spreading.

231
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,150
Could it be the Jiang family

232
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,440
trying to stir things up between us

233
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,230
by planting these rumors?

234
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,590
That's what I think.

235
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,870
So...

236
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,760
we'd better look into this.

237
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
Go.

238
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,790
Bring Miaoyin here.

239
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,750
Yes.

240
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,460
(Ning City General Command)

241
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,160
Stop right there.

242
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,390
Come in.

243
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,510
Dad.

244
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm back.

245
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
How's it going?

246
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,320
Beisheng has gained

247
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,550
real influence in the army now.

248
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,000
His orders are obeyed.

249
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,280
But that's the power you gave him.

250
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,870
But…

251
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,080
But what? Just say it.

252
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,230
Spit it out.

253
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,760
Governor won't blame you.

254
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,990
I've noticed

255
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,790
there are lots of new recruits.

256
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,840
No idea when they were enlisted.

257
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,790
And in their eyes,

258
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,110
there's only Beisheng.

259
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,080
They don't even know you, Governor.

260
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Alright.

261
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,190
Got it.

262
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
You can leave.

263
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,190
Governor.

264
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,430
Governor.

265
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,670
Are you playing or not?

266
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,980
Yes.

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,840
Here.

268
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,510
My pawn here

269
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,400
has crossed the river.

270
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,570
Better watch out

271
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,550
a pawn across the river.

272
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,030
It's dangerous.

273
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,790
I'm not afraid.

274
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,300
I'm just...

275
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,470
waiting, Governor,

276
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,150
for you to take me.

277
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,550
Didn't you put it here for me to take?

278
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,600
Governor.

279
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,840
How's the bandit sweep?

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,760
The troops

281
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
are well-trained by you.

282
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
We seized over sixty bandits

283
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
and twenty weapons.

284
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,230
They're now locked up.

285
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,670
For those at large,

286
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,080
I've sent men after them.

287
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,910
These are soldiers I trained?

288
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,080
But I heard

289
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,840
the soldiers I trained

290
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,880
don't even know who I am.

291
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,600
You overstate it.

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
I was only following your orders

293
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,110
to handle military affairs.

294
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,550
Never had any other intent.

295
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,760
If that's truly the case,

296
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,510
then why

297
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,440
do they follow only you

298
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,960
and not the Governor?

299
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,910
That's quite an unfounded claim.

300
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,030
No idea who's behind it

301
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,640
stirring up trouble,

302
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,000
trying to set me up.

303
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,840
If you're truly clean,

304
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
why would trouble keep coming your way?

305
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,470
Don't you think so,

306
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,750
Governor?

307
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,920
How about this,

308
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,350
you've worked hard lately,

309
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,440
and my health

310
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,670
has improved a lot.

311
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,880
As for army affairs,

312
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,280
you can leave them be for now.

313
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,120
Alright, I'll do as you say.

314
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,500
You had entrusted me

315
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,550
with great duties.

316
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,080
The fear of mistakes

317
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,470
made me hard to sleep.

318
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,110
Now I can finally sleep in peace.

319
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,240
Thank you, Governor.

320
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,910
Get some proper rest.

321
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,120
Yes.

322
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,150
I'm done playing.

323
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,880
You promised to play with me.

324
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,790
And it's ruined by this mess again.

325
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,160
So frustrating.

326
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,260
I'm heading back to sleep.

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,840
Alright, alright.

328
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,070
Starting tomorrow,

329
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,830
I'll spend real time with you.

330
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,190
We won't be interrupted.

331
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,070
Sound good?

332
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,940
For real?

333
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,800
I'll get going then.

334
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,220
(General)

335
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,600
Xu Beisheng.

336
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,110
What charges

337
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
are you pinning on me now?

338
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,310
I'm not making things up about you.

339
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm just exposing your greedy ambition.

340
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,280
Back when you took the pendant from me.

341
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,590
Could it be you got the treasures first

342
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,760
and moved them?

343
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,720
Miss Zhou,

344
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,280
you need proof before making claims.

345
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,050
Is that so?

346
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,230
But that day, I heard

347
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,680
