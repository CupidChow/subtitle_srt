=Episode 22=

3
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,310
Xu Miaoyin.

4
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,630
How long are you planning

5
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,680
to use me and keep lying to me?

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Because of you,

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,480
my father is already gone.

8
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,680
Isn't that enough for you?

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,310
So, you already knew.

10
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,710
Who are you?

11
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,760
Why are you so scared?

12
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,630
Relax.

13
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,000
We won't touch any of you for now.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,720
Come on, let's have a chat.

15
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,070
Come on.

16
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,480
Let's just sit and talk, okay?

17
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,930
Don't touch me.

18
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,790
Don't touch me.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,720
Stay away from me.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,650
You nasty woman.

21
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,600
So you're a lunatic.

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
Stop!

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,160
If you touch her,

24
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,720
you won't get those relics.

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Get out of here.

26
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,510
It's me.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Miaoling.

28
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,960
It's me.

29
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,870
You're safe now.

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,800
Beisheng and I

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,720
will keep you safe.

32
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,880
No one will hurt you again.

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,720
It's okay now.

34
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,230
Commander,

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,520
just as you predicted,

36
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,440
the entire mansion

37
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,270
is under Lu Siyuan's control.

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
Our rifles

39
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,630
have been confiscated.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
Lu Siyuan is nothing but a puppet.

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,800
The people from Japan backing him

42
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,190
are the real problem.

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,160
Those traitors to the nation.

44
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,470
I'll fight them head-on.

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
They're not going to

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,390
give up the cultural relics.

47
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,670
Keep this gun safe.

48
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310
And remember,

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,080
no matter what happens,

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
you must protect Zhou Menghuan.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
And keep yourself safe too.

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Got it.

53
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,720
You're the representative?

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
That's me.

55
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,230
Lu Siyuan.

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,600
Are you serious?

57
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,600
Why side with the Japanese

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,490
and even be a traitor?

59
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,880
I learned all that from you.

60
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,110
To reach a goal,

61
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,140
using any means necessary,

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,230
even giving up dignity,

63
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,670
and selling one's soul.

64
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,160
Lu Siyuan,

65
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,390
if you hate me that much,

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
then end me right now.

67
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,350
Take it as paying Butler Lu's debt.

68
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,510
Want to die?

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,320
It's not that easy.

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,650
I'll use the cruelest ways

71
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,670
in this world

72
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,640
to break you

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,510
and humiliate you,

74
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,000
until living

75
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,270
feels worse than dying.

76
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,790
How's Miaoling doing?

77
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,880
Her mood's still unstable.

78
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,190
I just

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,790
gave her a bit of sleeping pills.

80
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,390
She's much better now.

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Menghuan,

82
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,600
she's done so many things to hurt you.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,070
Why are you helping her?

84
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,190
Because of you.

85
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,630
I know.

86
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,110
You came to the Xu family
out of revenge,

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,440
but you truly treat her like a sister.

88
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
By the way,

89
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880
tomorrow is Lu Siyuan's

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,110
final deadline.

91
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,550
What's your plan?

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,890
I haven't decided yet.

93
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,270
But no matter what,

94
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,830
our national treasure

95
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,640
must never fall into foreign hands.

96
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,510
Beisheng.

97
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
Don't worry about me.

98
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,390
Just do what you need to do.

99
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,720
As long as

100
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,480
I can be with you.

101
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,230
Even if it means dying,

102
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,110
I'd still be happy.

103
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,950
Siyuan.

104
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,760
Starting today,

105
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,760
you'll be my servant.

106
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
Serve me well.

107
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,950
Alright.

108
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,860
Do whatever you want to get back at me.

109
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,230
But can you let the others go?

110
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,200
They've done nothing wrong to you.

111
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,910
Xu Miaoyin, when did you become

112
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,790
this nave?

113
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,760
You're in no place to bargain with me.

114
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,160
Siyuan.

115
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
- Siyuan.
- Quiet.

116
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,550
Get up now.

117
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,200
I've got things to take care of.

118
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,430
Young Master Xu.

119
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,760
My staff are just too slow.

120
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,350
They held me up a bit.

121
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,110
That's why I'm late.

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,710
Hope you can forgive me.

123
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,520
I wanted to ask you about

124
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,200
the cultural relics.

125
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,760
Have you made up your mind?

126
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
No problem.

127
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll work with you.

128
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,990
Xu Beisheng.

129
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,080
What did you say?

130
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
However,

131
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,640
I have my own terms.

132
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,120
Alright.

133
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,510
Let's hear them.

134
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,280
First,

135
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,470
no harm can come to anyone

136
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,640
in my mansion.

137
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
Second,

138
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,110
once it's done,

139
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,110
I'd like you

140
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,520
to introduce me to Mr. Yamamoto

141
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,380
to make future cooperation easier.

142
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,800
Sure, no problem.

143
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,550
You're really straightforward.

144
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,630
Then, Mr. Lu,

145
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,320
three days from now,

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
we make the deal.

147
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,490
Pleasure doing business.

148
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,990
Pleasure doing business.

149
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,760
Xu Beisheng!

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,870
You traitor!

151
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm going to end you!

152
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,310
- Take him out!
- Wait.

153
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
I'll do it myself.

154
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,990
What are you doing?

155
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
You've gone through life and death.

156
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,680
Xu Beisheng.

157
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,010
You... you...

158
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,310
Xu Beisheng,

159
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,840
I was wrong about you.

160
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,280
Xu Beisheng!

161
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,510
Mr. Lu.

162
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,760
He's been with me all these years.

163
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,520
Please send his body back in one piece.

164
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,880
Why are you so quiet?

165
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,180
I'm waiting for your explanation.

166
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Why did you work with the Japanese?

167
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,630
Why...

168
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,200
did you kill Adjutant Yuan?

169
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
If I told you,

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,880
would you believe me?

171
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,430
Of course.

172
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,640
As long as you say it,

173
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,870
I'll believe it.

174
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,230
There's nothing to explain.

175
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,110
It's exactly what you saw.

176
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,100
I've worked so hard for years

177
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,790
to climb up to

178
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,790
the Governor's seat.

179
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,520
No one

180
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,280
and

181
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,760
nothing can stop me.

182
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,390
No way.

183
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,710
Did something happen?

184
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,470
Beisheng, tell me.

185
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,960
We can face it together.

186
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,280
Xu Beisheng.

187
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,550
Madam Zhou,

188
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,960
aren't you taking yourself too seriously?

189
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,510
You...

190
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,600
You...

191
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,000
What did you call me?

192
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,550
I called you Madam Zhou,
Xu Qingshan's concubine.

193
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,230
You've passed your prime.

194
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,080
I was just after something new.

195
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,760
You didn't really think I cared,
did you?

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,880
You jerk.

197
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,670
I'll give you one chance.

198
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,640
If you don't want more humiliation,

199
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,670
get out right now.

200
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
Get out.

201
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,310
Out!

202
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,120
Jerk.

203
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,520
Keep your eyes on him.

204
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Before the deal,

205
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,110
there can't be any mistakes.

206
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,310
Yes.

207
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,320
You and Xu Beisheng,

208
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,840
are you really siblings?

209
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
Why is it that when you act,

210
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,230
you're both so ruthless

211
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,400
and cold to your own family?

212
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,750
Xu Miaoyin,

213
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,320
stop pretending you're not here.

214
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,150
Or I'll go after your mother first.

215
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,840
Siyuan,

216
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,750
please,

217
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,710
please don't hurt my mom.

218
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm begging you.

219
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
Then you'd better behave.

220
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,440
Aren't you the one

221
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,670
who's best at reading people?

222
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,440
Make sure you please me.

223
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,710
Who knows, maybe one day

224
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,550
if I'm in a good mood,

225
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,350
I might just let you go.

226
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,520
Do you deserve that?
