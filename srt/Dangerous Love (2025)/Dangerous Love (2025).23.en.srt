what brings you here?

7
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,250
I came to check on you.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
How have you been?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,850
Have those people

10
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,710
been bothering you?

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,000
you…

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,360
are you really going to work with them?

14
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,350
What's wrong?

15
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,230
Do you also blame me

16
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
for being a traitor?

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,200
No.

18
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,870
If it's your decision,

19
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm sure you have your reasons.

20
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,760

You always treat me the best.

What are you doing?

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,440
What?

25
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,440
Aren't you seeing it clearly?

Xu Beisheng.

27
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,550
She's your own sister.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
You crossed the line.

29

I don't owe you

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,520
an explanation.

34
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,670
Get out of my sight.

35
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,230
Leave.

36
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,520

Sorry.

I didn't mean anything.

if you care about Menghuan so much,

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,240
why make her misunderstand you?

Where did you get all these?

121
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,270
These here

122
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,880
are all knockoffs.

124
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,040
and gave a little touch-up.

Others

126
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,350
are high-quality replicas.

127
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,110

128
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,510
they're enough to fool

130
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,670
But the deal's happening tomorrow.

131
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,880

Lu Siyuan

134
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,510
is sly and cunning.

135
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,480
And with Captain Lin by his side,

136
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,370
tricking them won't be easy.

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040

185

Hold on.

188
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,630
Give me a hand.

189
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,640
What should I do now?

190
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,030
I can't stay another day here.

191

Consider it a good deed.

195
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Let her go.

196
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Since when did you get so soft-hearted?

197
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,950
Forget it.

198
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm in a good mood.

199
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,430
Miss Zhou,

200
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,720
you can leave.

201
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,990
Mr. Lu,

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,110
you're truly a good person.

203
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,350
Thank you so much.

204
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,840
I honestly don't know how to thank you.

205
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,190
Well, just so happens

206
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
I have some external injury medicine.

207
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,440
I'll give it to you.

208
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,710
Consider it a thank-you gift.

209
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,710
Captain, it really stinks.

210
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,750
Can we not check?

211
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,760
Help!

212
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,750
Somebody help!

213
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,960
Someone's trying to grab my treasure.

214
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,030
What treasure is you holding?

215
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,080
Can I take a look?

216
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,190
No.

217
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,000
My big brother gave this to me.

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,440
I can't show it to anyone.

219
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,030
Hand it over, let me see.

220
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,080
Turns out you really are psycho.

221
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,820
(Ning City Governor's Mansion)

222
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,540
(Ning City Governor's Mansion)

223
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,430
Stop right there.

224
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,710
Bag check.

225
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,030
I'm a friend of Mr. Lu.

226
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,960
He told me I could go.

227
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,460
- It's personal.
- No excuses.

228
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,390
Hand it over.

229
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,110
I already told you.

230
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,350
I'm a friend of Mr. Lu

231
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,080
and it's my private belongings.

232
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,990
Nothing for you to see.

233
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,320
See? Didn't I say it was personal?

234
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,890
Alright, move along.

235
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,750
Stop staring at me.

236
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,470
This lousy Ning City.

237
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,320
I'm never coming back.

238
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,910
I'll complaint about you.

239
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,420
(Miaoyin,)

240
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,000
(whether our plan work)

241
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,080
(is all up to you now.)

242
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,120
Young Master Xu,

243
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,350
if that batch of relics checks out fine,

244
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,740
I'll put in a good word for you

245
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,390
to Mr. Yamamoto.

246
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,200
As for the rest,

247
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,790
don't worry about it.

248
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,710
Then I'll thank you in advance.

249
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,620
Something happens!

250
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,420
It's terrible.

251
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,110
Lady Miaoyin vomited a lot of blood.

252
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,820
- What happened?
- Mr. LU,

253
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,230
today's matter is crucial.

254
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,470
Don't let one woman

255
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,310
ruin the whole plan.

256
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Are you lecturing me?

257
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,200
I wouldn't dare.

258
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,640
Just that, about Mr. Yamamoto...

259
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,990
Don't use Japanese to pressure me.

260
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,670
I'm the boss here.

261
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,670
How it's done is my call.

262
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,760
You sure Miaoyin would risk helping me?

263
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,720
Honestly,

264
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,280
I'm not sure either.

265
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,150
But I hope

266
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,540
deep down,

267
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,790
she's a genuinely kind person.

268
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,160
(Menghuan,)

269
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,960
(hope everything's going well on your end.)

270
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,960
Hurry, unload it into that room.

271
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,990
It's done.

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,860
Take this.

273
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,400
Leave Ning City and don't come back.

274
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,360
Alright.

275
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,070
What happened?

276
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,470
She was fine just now.

277
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,470
Why is she like this now?

278
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,920
Mr. Lu, spare me.

279
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,710
I really don't know anything.

280
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,840
Go get a doctor, now!

281
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,070
Yes.

282
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,430
Miaoyin.

283
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,790
Miaoyin.

284
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,910
Miaoyin.

285
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,270
Miaoyin.

286
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,000
Miaoyin.

287
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,950
What's wrong, child?

288
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,800
Open your eyes and look at me.

289
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,230
I'm sorry I failed you.

290
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,590
I was wrong.

291
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,190
I shouldn't have turned away from you.

292
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,310
It's my fault.

293
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm truly sorry.

295
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,680
Xu Miaoyin.

296
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,590
You lied to me again.

297
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,420
(The cultural relics)

298
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,000
(are in the secret room
of East Street Alley.)

299
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
(After getting them,)

300
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,040
(someone will meet you)

301
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,350
(in a nearby alley.)

302
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,190
Governor.

303
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,160
So you're not dead.

304
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,560
What's wrong?

305
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,950
Do you want me gone that badly?
