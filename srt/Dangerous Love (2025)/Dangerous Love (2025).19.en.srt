=Episode 19=

3
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,150
Xu Beisheng,

4
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,060
you jerk.

5
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,270
Let's make things a bit more thrilling.

6
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't want it.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,720
Let go of me.

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,510
Isn't this exactly how you like me?

9
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,720
I don't like...

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
What happened?

11
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,550
The bandits from West Hills are back?

12
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,870
Rally the troops.

13
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,390
I'm on my way.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,230
Young Master, you're busy.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wait for me to come back.

16
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,720
Leave the stuff we dug up

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
untouched for now.

18
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,110
Kylin Jade Goblet stays here for now.

19
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,870
Menghuan.

20
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,550
Where did you find

21
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,670
this Kylin Jade Goblet?

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
In Beisheng's room.

23
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,600
What were you doing there?

24
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,320
Lately,

25
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,880
I've noticed him acting shady.

26
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,750
I was worried he might harm you,

27
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,320
so I investigated in secret.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,880
And I finally found this.

29
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
Menghuan,

30
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,460
you know a lot about cultural relics.

31
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
In your opinion,

32
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,030
is this Kylin Jade Goblet

33
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,080
the real one?

34
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Governor,

35
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,470
I've examined it thoroughly

36
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
and it's indeed a genuine one.

37
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Moreover,

38
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
I'm certain

39
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,800
it's linked to

40
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,670
the relics unearthed

41
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,590
in the Bao Temple.

42
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,110
Beisheng, my good son.

43
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,610
Guards!

44
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,550
(Xu Beisheng,)

45
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,170
(you're done for this time.)

46
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
Stop right there!

47
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,200
My apologies, Young Master.

48
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,160
Governor is waiting.

49
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,550
Governor,

50
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,510
you wanted to see me?

51
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,760
Any explanation?

52
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,190
I found it.

53
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,630
You got me wrong.

54
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,550
I did find

55
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,760
the Kylin Jade Goblet.

56
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,720
But I found it at the Jiangs' Villa.

57
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,640
The Jiangs' Villa?

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes.

59
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,320
You asked me to have people

60
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,720
keep watch on them.

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,920
We found more villas owned by them.

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
This one

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,600
was discovered at a villa in Linjiang.

64
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,910
That's nonsense.

65
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,480
Governor, don't believe him.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,950
If he truly intended to

67
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,440
hand the Kylin Jade Goblet to you,

68
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,320
why didn't he deliver it right away?

69
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,550
Because I wasn't sure

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,390
if it belonged to the same batch

71
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,270
from the Bao Temple.

72
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,320
More importantly,

73
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,160
I suspected it

74
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,640
was a decoy planted by the Jiangs

75
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,740
to lure us into a trap.

76
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,390
So I kept it quiet for now.

77
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,190
So, you mean

78
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,270
you've found it now?

79
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,390
Just as I was about to head to West Hills,

80
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
a scout reported

81
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,670
that the Kylin Jade Goblet

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,320
belongs to the same collection

83
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,270
from the Bao Temple.

84
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,720
We've also found several hiding spots.

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,350
I've narrowed those locations

86
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,520
to within a certain range.

87
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,040
I thought I'd come back

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,440
and tell you, Governor.

89
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,070
So...

90
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
I wronged you.

91
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,230
I don't blame you.

92
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,070
You were misled by someone,

93
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,790
but if you don't trust me,

94
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,510
then I'll leave now.

95
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,510
So you won't be upset.

96
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,510
Still so impulsive.

97
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,510
We're father and son.

98
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,670
No grudge between us.

99
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,340
As for this matter,

100
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,350
I'll leave it to you.

101
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,990
We must find

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,720
the Jiang family's hidden treasure spot.

103
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,630
But...

104
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,670
right now, the troops

105
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,160
are all out wiping out bandits.

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,480
I barely have anyone left on hand.

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,440
I still have an elite unit.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,950
I was planning

109
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,490
to hand them over to you later.

110
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,760
Now's the time.

111
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,600
I'll follow your orders.

112
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,820
Go get the wound dressed.

113
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Yes.

114
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,830
What's on your mind?

115
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,510
I was thinking,

116
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,320
you really have

117
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,640
a truly devoted son.

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,950
Who would disagree?

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
Though

120
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
right now,

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,440
what I want the most

122
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,760
is a child for the two of us.

123
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,720
The most important thing for you

124
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,760
is to get your health back on track,

125
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,760
so you and I can

126
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,320
win on both fronts.

127
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,510
Win on both fronts?

128
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
You're playing me?

129
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,390
What do you mean?

130
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,990
What do you mean?

131
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,070
You know I've been getting close to you

132
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,880
just to get back at you,

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,440
and you used me,

134
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,640
letting me overhear your talk

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,830
about finding the Kylin Jade Goblet.

136
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,230
You knew I'd deliver it

137
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,070
to the Governor.

138
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,230
Now the troops

139
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,640
are all out wiping the bandits.

140
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,280
But I still have an elite unit.

141
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,910
I planned to hand it

142
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,200
to you later.

143
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,790
Now's the time.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Even the bandit operation was your plan.

145
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,030
The goal is to

146
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,230
the Governor's elite unit.

147
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,640
So you figured that out,

148
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280
smart as always.

149
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,790
Xu Beisheng,

150
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,910
you're playing a deep game.

151
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,230
I've been cautious every step,

152
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,590
yet again, I've been your pawn.

153
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,430
Menghuan, calm down.

154
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,710
I had no other choice.

155
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,880
You used me.

156
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,880
You lied to me.

157
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,470
Using and lying to me is necessary.

158
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,880
So was wiping out my family,

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,440
over a hundred people, also necessary?

160
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,790
I've sent someone for the evidence.

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
We'll know the truth soon.

162
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,030
- If...
- What truth?

163
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,320
What I've seen

164
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
is the truth.

165
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,840
I won't let you fool me again.

166
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,350
Zhou Menghuan,

167
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,350
to you,

168
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,590
I never told a single lie.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,960
I truly love you.

170
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,840
You really love me?

171
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,200
You really love me?

172
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Then prove it. Give your life for me.

173
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,070
Commander,

174
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,080
as you instructed,

175
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,950
everything's ready.

176
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,000
We need you to check.

177
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,620
See if there's any oversight.

178
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,350
Carry it on as planned.

179
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,750
Yes, sir.

180
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,300
(Warehouse)

181
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,440
Useless thing.

182
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,160
Get out of my sight.

183
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,710
Find me another one.

184
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,720
Go.

185
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Xu.

186
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,200
Don't get worked up.

187
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,960
Doctors in Capital aren't good.

188
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,320
We can always go abroad.

189
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,030
Right now, what matters most is to

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,790
take good care of your health.

191
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,670
Stop beating yourself up.

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,040
You're still talking?

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,080
It's all because of you.

194
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,280
Why haven't you taken down

195
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Xu Beisheng yet?

196
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,400
That little scum Xu Beisheng.

197
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,440
One day,

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,550
I'll tear him to pieces.

199
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,590
He won't get a good ending.

200
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,950
What did you just say?

201
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,800
You found it.

202
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,770
Yeah.

203
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,640
Where is it?

204
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,240
The Abandoned Pier.

205
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,110
No wonder I couldn't track it down.

206
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
Let's move.

207
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Master.

208
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,390
What brings you here?

209
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,710
I've kept a close eye

210
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,080
on Xu Beisheng

211
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,920
and his adjutant.

212
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,540
Today I saw them went to

213
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,350
a warehouse at the Abandoned Pier.

214
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,510
The cultural relics are hidden there.

215
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,750
Good.

216
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,950
That's perfect.

217
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,950
Go.

218
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,040
Tell the butler,

219
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,350
stick to the plan.

220
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,950
I need you to

221
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,910
secure this batch of cultural relics.

222
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Bring plenty of ammo.

223
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
This time,

224
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,710
I'm taking down the entire Xu family.

225
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
Yes.

226
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,870
Madam.

227
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,670
They went out again.

228
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,230
Where did they go?

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,540
Judging by their direction,

230
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,930
it looks like the Abandoned Pier.

231
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,030
The Abandoned Pier?

232
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,480
That's odd.

233
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,630
What is it, Governor?

234
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,590
Don't you think it's strange?

235
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,520
There's no guard here.

236
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,190
My men looked into it.

237
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,080
It's the changing of gurads.

238
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,470
We need to move fast

239
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,760
or a nasty fight will be inevitable.

240
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,430
So what?

241
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,320
When have I ever feared anyone?

242
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,640
You're right.

243
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,000
But the battle will

244
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,330
end up disturbing the people.

245
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,600
We...

246
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,150
should try to avoid it if we can.

247
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,280
Let's get in.

248
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,280
These things

249
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,350
ultimately belong to me.

250
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,710
These are all rightfully yours.

251
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,230
With these cultural relics,

252
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,710
Ning City,

253
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,990
no,

254
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,440
all of the Northern region will be mine.

255
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,200
I'd like to see

256
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,910
who would still dare to cross me.

257
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,710
That depends on

258
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,710
whether you live long enough
to enjoy it.

259
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,000
What do you mean?

260
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,630
Xu Beisheng.

261
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,230
Just for those cultural relics,

262
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,790
you'd go as far as killing me?

263
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,030
I found these cultural relics first.

264
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,110
Think about it.

265
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,550
Why would I bother

266
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,590
bringing you here?

267
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,350
Zhou Menghuan was right.

268
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,110
You really are overambitious.

269
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,710
You're as sharp as ever, Governor.

270
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,480
Xu Beisheng.

271
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,790
You're my only son now.

272
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,470
Everything I have

273
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,350
will be yours sooner or later.

274
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,520
Why go to such lengths to betray me?

275
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
Betray you?

276
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,080
Because you were never my father.
