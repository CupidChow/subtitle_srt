1
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,055
Have you packed stomach medication?

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,932
Right, I forgot.

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,770
Come on, remember how
you were bedridden last time?

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,949
-Here.
-Thanks.

5
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:36,787
-How long will you be gone this time?
-Ten days.

6
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,582
Will you be okay on your own?

7
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,544
I'll be deep in the Iwate mountains,
so I won't have any signal.

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,088
If you need anything, contact Ms. Negishi

9
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:47,548
-at the college--
-I'll be fine.

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,802
More importantly, was Ms. Rumi okay?

11
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,220
You spoke at the hospital, right?

12
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,140
Yeah.

13
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,770
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,521
Don't worry.

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,778
It's the same illness my mother had.

16
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,281
It's so depressing.

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,994
I guess
there's just no escaping your genes.

18
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,999
I'll get better, I promise.

19
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,170
She said she's going
back to America for treatment.

20
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,595
If anyone can get through it, it's her.

21
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,434
Say…

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,229
these keys…

23
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,566
Yeah, I'm holding onto the keys
to the mountain villa.

24
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,235
Here you go.

25
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,951
I think we will be returning to the US
for a while.

26
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,078
I see.

27
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,333
Anna…

28
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,545
It will be okay. Rumi is a strong person.

29
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,131
I know.

30
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,428
I know the camp got canceled,

31
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,642
but I might give Ms. Rumi's
portrait assignment another shot.

32
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,352
Yeah, great idea.

33
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,688
Why don't you invite the others too?

34
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,189
Maybe go to the mountain villa.

35
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,649
Can I really?

36
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,611
I'm sure Rumi would be thrilled about it.

37
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:34,864
Yeah.

38
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,408
Maybe I'll invite everyone.

39
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,703
Don't run amok now.

40
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,413
I know, I know.

41
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,135
-All right, I'm off.
-Have a safe trip.

42
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,601
"As my father left to observe butterflies,

43
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,855
"I decided
to start observing butterflies myself."

44
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:13,027
"I will create something
only I am capable of."

45
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:19,283
To do so, I need to understand
the butterflies, the five of them.

46
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:14,630
HUMAN SPECIMENS

47
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,645
"Chapter 7. 'Observation.'"

48
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,942
SHO ISHIOKA
AGRIAS HEWITSONIUS

49
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,404
You should try this. It's good.

50
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,197
Itaru!

51
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,700
You came!

52
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,080
I took ten whole days off from work
for the camp, so I've been so bored.

53
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,500
Check this out. I painted that.

54
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,293
-Sweet, huh?
-Yeah.

55
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,008
"I felt an overwhelming power
from Sho's painting."

56
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,467
Here.

57
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,012
"Would it be better for me
to let him create more art,

58
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,306
"rather than turn him into a specimen?"

59
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,101
"I wondered to myself."

60
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,027
"However…"

61
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:19,987
-What's up?
-Hey.

62
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,447
Yo.

63
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,783
-You know this smell, Itaru?
-Yeah.

64
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,456
Guess you do since you travel the world
with Professor Sakaki.

65
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,754
An older guy at the factory
hooks me up cheap.

66
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,798
Not just this either.

67
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,009
MDMA, cocaine and other stuff too.

68
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:48,182
"When I found out that the world that Sho
painted was created through drugs,

69
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,808
"the doubts I had disappeared."

70
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:57,357
"He had sold his gift from God
to the devil."

71
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,402
Sorry, but I'll pass.

72
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,863
C'mon, give it a puff.

73
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,992
You wanna be more free, right?

74
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,132
HIKARU AKABANE
REDBASE JEZEBEL

75
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:26,428
"As I looked into a certain rockstar,
I discovered something interesting."

76
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:31,642
"He was a megastar who captivated
all of Japan a long time ago."

77
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:37,481
"Young people would copy his fashion style
because they wanted to be like him."

78
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,820
"But, out of nowhere,
he announced his retirement."

79
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,200
"He never revealed his reasons,
and held his final concert."

80
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:53,247
"During his final song, he stabbed himself
in the chest with a knife."

81
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,125
"It was all a performance, of course."

82
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:03,090
"Much like how blood would spatter,
red rose petals rained down on the stage."

83
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,511
"Then, with the knife still in his chest,
he collapsed on the stage,

84
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,555
"ending the show."

85
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,813
"Later on, he actually did die at home,
from a knife to the chest."

86
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:23,318
"He became a legend as a lonesome artist."

87
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,281
"All of this happened 17 years ago."

88
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,200
"It lines up perfectly with Hikaru's age."

89
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,745
"How did I notice this?"

90
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,291
"Their bone structures were identical."

91
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,295
"With my ability to recreate what I see,

92
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,338
"I could tell

93
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,926
"that the structure of Hikaru's skull
was identical to that of the rockstar's."

94
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,441
TORU SHIRASE
CABBAGE WHITE BUTTERFLY

95
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,195
Look, this is Toru.

96
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,696
Wow.

97
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,825
Itaru,

98
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,621
thank you for being friends with Toru.

99
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,539
-Of course.
-Toru…

100
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,084
survived an attempted murder-suicide.

101
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,002
What?

102
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,548
Because of that, he was bullied at school.

103
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,634
I'm back!

104
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,637
Welcome back.

105
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:33,639
You came over?

106
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,390
What are you looking at?

107
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,816
I used to come here on walks
with my mom a lot.

108
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,863
I can't see the color red,
but I can see blue and yellow.

109
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,951
I can even distinguish navy blue,
ultramarine and indigo.

110
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,664
That's why I loved walking
through canola fields.

111
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,169
Did my grandma say something
to you earlier?

112
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,129
The whole suicide thing?

113
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,760
I was on a walk with my mom that day…

114
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,098
and we smiled
over how beautiful it all was.

115
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,061
And then, when we got back,

116
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,855
she took a whole bunch of pills,

117
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,316
right in front of me.

118
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,028
Then my mom fell asleep.

119
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,448
I watched as she slept for a long time.

120
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,451
I didn't even call an ambulance.

121
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,580
I don't know
why she took those pills, but…

122
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,834
it wasn't a murder-suicide.

123
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,338
Before she passed away,

124
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,384
she gave me these.

125
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,807
What do you think

126
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,310
it means?

127
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,068
DAI KUROIWA
PAPER KITE BUTTERFLY

128
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,988
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

129
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,574
I would like to interview you
about Dai Kuroiwa.

130
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,576
Sure, go ahead.

131
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,454
What do you like about Dai Kuroiwa?

132
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,538
Well…

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,210
It's as if he can see through everything.

134
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,005
Like he can read minds
or perceive everything.

135
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,673
It's terrifying and I love it.

136
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:35,677
He's so suave. Maybe I'll ask
for his contact details sometime.

137
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,264
-Do you like BW's art too?
-Yes.

138
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,642
Absolutely wonderful!

139
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,479
Both the art and artist.

140
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,524
He is a gorgeous young man
with a sense of justice.

141
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,235
Really admirable.

142
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,695
Doesn't it tick you off?

143
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,864
I heard that Miyu got an abortion.

144
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,324
He must be sick.

145
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,203
I heard he'll punch you
just for asking to use a rubber.

146
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,412
That's messed up.

147
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,123
An abuser who sleeps around? Loser.

148
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,251
Maybe I'll write
a newspaper article about him.

149
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,714
There's a criminal
who goes by the name "BW"!

150
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,425
Thank you!

151
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,594
Hello!

152
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,221
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

153
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,347
-Just one.
-Okay.

154
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:21,890
Sorry, give me a sec.

155
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,809
-Could you hand these out?
-Sure, sure.

156
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,726
Itaru!

157
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,437
What are you up to?

158
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,399
Did you want a newspaper too?

159
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,150
Yeah.

160
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,570
-Sorry, hey! Hey! Could you give me one?
-Sure. Here.

161
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,198
-Thanks.
-There you go.

162
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,909
Here, just for you.

163
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,786
Thanks.

164
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,374
Cool, right?

165
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,464
I drew that based on what I felt
when I read all the online news.

166
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,802
I wondered what you would say about it…

167
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,556
AO FUKAZAWA
MORPHO RHETENOR

168
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,433
C'mon, get a move on.

169
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,600
-Sorry, sorry!
-Sorry.

170
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,893
What were you doing?

171
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,603
-Packing up.
-Yeah.

172
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,026
Ao! Hurry up.

173
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,362
Let's go home together.

174
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,325
I bet you'll take first place
in this year's comp too.

175
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,243
Yeah.

176
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
Let's go to the arcade.

177
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,165
-Good idea.
-Nice.

178
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,416
Wanna come, Ao?

179
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,376
No, I'm going to go home.

180
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,752
-You are not coming?
-Join us!

181
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,421
Nah, maybe next time.

182
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,840
-Okay.
-See you later, then.

183
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,425
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

184
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,428
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

185
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,306
It's filthy.

186
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,371
I hate that shade of blue the most.

187
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,998

did you need something from me?

220

Guess it's because you do ink painting.

I can sense that

-Real fancy.

231
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,240
Looks impressive.

232
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,159
-Give us something to toast to.
-Okay.

Thanks.

You are earlier than you said.

259
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,066
Yeah, all my connections went smoothly.

260
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,152
How were the butterflies?

261
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,237
-No dice.
-Yeah?

262
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,448
-Good job, anyway.
-Thanks.

263
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,785
-We are having sukiyaki tonight.
-Perfect! I was craving meat.

264
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,037
I'll leave the sauce to you.

265
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,747
Sure.

266
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,816
At camp, I mentioned your sukiyaki,
and I have been craving it since.

267
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,901
Really?

268
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,613
The secret to my sukiyaki
is soy sauce, sugar…

269
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,614
And sake.

270
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,660
But I can never make it like yours.

271
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,411
-Really?
-Yeah.

272
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,496
There.

273
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,917
Add some tomatoes and…

274
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,680
Under the weather?

275
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,515
No.

276
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:10,770
I think I'm tired. Maybe I worked too hard
on my research project.

277
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,106
What did you do for it?

278
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,566
Butterfly specimens.

279
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,736
What? Where? Wait, of what?

280
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,780
That's enough about me.

281
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,282
What about you?

282
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,494
What butterflies
were you looking for on this trip?

283
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,121
The common Mormon.

284
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,164
The common Mormon?

285
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,833
Give me a second.

286
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,292
What was that again?

287
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,716
The one with the white band?

288
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,093
That's the one. See?

289
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,970
-Yeah, that's it.
-Yup.

290
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,103
-Say, Dad?
-Yeah?

291
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,231
If you were a butterfly,
what do you think you would be?

292
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,526
I have never really thought--

293
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,446
Actually, I have. Just once.

294
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,198
Wait, what?

295
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,200
-It's nothing.
-Come on.

296
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,369
Well…

297
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,205
It was when I proposed to your mom.

298
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,207
Wait, what? Now I'm curious.

299
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,461
I said, "You are my Aporia hippia."

300
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,838
And how did she respond?

301
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,298
"That's so plain."

302
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,177
She didn't know
it was an endangered species.

303
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,261
Yeah.

304
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,638
What you were trying to say

305
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:32,185
was that you had finally found
the person you were looking for, right?

306
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:40,526
So I'm the child
of a swallowtail and an Aporia hippia.

307
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,822
Why am I a swallowtail?

308
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,866
Remember what Ms. Rumi said?

309
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,243
Swallowtails are
the quintessential butterfly.

310
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,579
And the quintessential swallowtail
is Shiro Sakaki.

311
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,583
And what butterfly were you born as, then?

312
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,629
Maybe a red-bodied swallowtail?

313
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,717
Not the Formosan swallowtail
you caught in Taiwan?

314
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,095
Well, I guess I'm saying

315
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,722
I've got poison, unfortunate as it may be.

316
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,600
Oh? What kind of poison do you have?

317
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,894
That's a secret.

318
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,107
You are maturing splendidly.

319
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,567
Yeah, right.

320
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,279
Let's not forget
how you led me astray, Dad.

321
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:26,989
What?

322
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,450
The pineapple juice incident.

323
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,955
Right, when I took you
on one of my butterfly observation trips?

324
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,081
That's right.

325
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,167
I ordered a cocktail
thinking it was fruit juice.

326
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,878
You were afraid
the police might arrest us.

327
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,755
I wasn't scared.

328
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,353
What?

329
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,567
You know,

330
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,862
on my 20th birthday,

331
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,783
I want to drink that pineapple cocktail
with you, Dad.

332
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,622
Sure.

333
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,876
That sounds great. Yeah.

334
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,071
Morning.

335
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,574
You are already heading out?

336
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,701
Yeah. Cram school camp starts today.

337
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,952
Cram school camp?

338
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:59,332
I told you about it yesterday.
You got tired and fell asleep real quick.

339
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,919
-For how long?
-Five days.

340
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm screwed.
I haven't touched my homework.

341
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,424
-Here.
-Thanks.

342
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,345
Sounds tough.
Don't push yourself too hard.

343
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,429
-I won't.
-Good.

344
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,515
-Well, I'm off.
-Take care.

345
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,053
That's not a morpho rhetenor.

346
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,850
And the redbase Jezebel
isn't right either.

347
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,647

There's no way he…

361
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:08,979
Well, I guess I'm saying

362
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,440
I've got poison, unfortunate as it may be.

363
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,567
Oh? What kind of poison do you have?

364
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,403
That's a secret.

365
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,629
This can't be true. Itaru…

366
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,972
What do I do?

367
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,476
Shiro.

368
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,687
Leave it all to me.

369
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,400
I won't ever let them catch you.

370
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,113
I'm telling you to start a new life.

00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,699
There is still time.

372
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:30,412
As your father, I don't want
to see you become a criminal.

373
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,584
A life like that…

374
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,212
It's not sustainable.

375
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,507

Not Itaru.

my son…

401
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,255
is not a maniacal murderer!

00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,013
Itaru…

403
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,475
will forever be Itaru…

404
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,648
as a human specimen.

405
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,829
I would like to send this to America.

406
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,998
We will need to wrap this up.

407
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,500
-One moment, please.
-Okay.

408
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,668
-Could you get the paper?
-Yes, of course.

409
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,674
-Bring that over here.
-Okay.

410
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,602
She's cute.

411
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,479
Is she your girlfriend?

412
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,733
She is kind of an embodiment of me.

00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,952
"Please grant me permission to visit."

416
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,079
"Anna Ichinose."

417
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,118
What's wrong, Mr. Sakaki?

418
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:28,205
Nothing.

419
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,145
Hello, Uncle Sakaki.

420
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,524
You are all grown up.

421
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,568
I turned 20 last month.

422
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,446
What was it about the mountain villa?

423
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,741
Are you not even going to congratulate me?

424
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:10,288
I'm void of those types of emotions now.

425
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,420
Three years have passed
since my mother passed away.

426
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,798
It was around the same time
as your incident,

427
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,883
so I didn't have the chance to tell you.

428
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,470
Sorry I couldn't offer my condolences.

429
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:26,888
It's fine.

430
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,268
I have inherited
all of my mother's assets,

431
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,270
both in America and Japan.

432
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:38,775
As such, I have decided to demolish
the mountain villa and sell it.

433
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,111
Demolish…

434
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,197
It has fallen into ruin.

435
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,575
Now it's thought of as a place
to test one's courage.

436
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,201
Do whatever you want.

437
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,288
I am relieved to hear you say that.

438
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,208
That is all I wanted to tell you.

439
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,880
Wait a second.

440
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,066
Why did you send me this painting?

441
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:27,240
I was thinking of how I could convince you
to meet with me.

442
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,911
This painting by Itaru

443
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,289
wasn't mentioned in your account,

444
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,541
so I figured you may not have seen it.

445
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,211
That dress…

446
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,173
I really like this painting.

447
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,968
I had this custom-made.

448
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:49,971
It suits you well.

449
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,193
By the way,

450
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,905
do you know the name of this butterfly?

451
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,452
I don't know as much about butterflies
as you or my mother.

452
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:14,788
It's a red-bodied swallowtail.

453
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,082
Is that…

454
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,627
one of the butterflies
you likened Itaru to?

455
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,963
The spangle
and the red-bodied swallowtail.

456
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,339
Good memory.

457
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:30,262
My name appeared in your account as well,
so I have read it multiple times.

458
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,351
I saw this painting and I realized…

459
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,730
that I was wrong.

460
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,484
About what?

461
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:46,820
My choice of butterflies.

462
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:53,410
Itaru isn't a red-bodied swallowtail
or a spangle.

463
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,204
He was

464
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,291
a Formosan swallowtail all along.

465
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:05,964
Is that the butterfly
Itaru caught in Taiwan?

466
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,799
You have really read my account
end to end.

467
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:12,470
Then you also know that
the red-bodied swallowtail is poisonous.

468
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,265
That's what you wrote.

469
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,434
Do you know
the Formosan swallowtail's traits?

470
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,395
-I do not.
-How about "mimicry"?

471
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,358
To pretend to be or act like something?

472
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:26,985
That's right.

473
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,865
When a non-poisonous butterfly pretends
to be a poisonous one.

474
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,533
Why do they do this?

475
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,830
Is this a lecture of yours,
Professor Sakaki?

476
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,542
Let me think.

477
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:49,132
They do it to protect themselves
from predators such as birds.

478
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:50,800
Correct.

479
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:56,181
A non-poisonous butterfly
pretending to be a poisonous one…

480
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,020
If Itaru isn't poisonous,

481
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,108
then who do you think he was mimicking?

482
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,115
Are you suggesting that it was me?

483
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,743
Purely hypothetically speaking,

484
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,454
if that were the case,

485
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,332
why would he need to mimic anyone?

486
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,542
Could you explain why?

487
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:35,095
If anyone wants to know
the answer to that, it's me.

488
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,518
Do you acknowledge that you are poisonous?

489
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,569
I have

490
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,698
accepted my death sentence.

491
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,828
I could even say that I want it to happen.

492
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,306
Why?

493
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,522
To become the successor.
