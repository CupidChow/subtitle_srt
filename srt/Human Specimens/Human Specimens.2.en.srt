1
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:11,387
NAGANO PREFECTURAL POLICE

2
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:15,933
Get in.

3
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:58,452
HUMAN SPECIMENS

4
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,710
"If you haven't noticed, I'll tell you."

5
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,340
What were you going to tell here?

6
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,100
Mr. Sakaki?

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,061
It's a common bluebottle.

8
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,105
Look.

9
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,524
See the blue streaks on its wings?

10
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,360
A beautiful butterfly.

11
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:50,629
You said that suddenly, one day,
you began seeing the boys as butterflies.

12
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,756
Yes.

13
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:57,845
Even if you say so,
that's simply not possible.

14
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,848
It is possible…

15
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:07,062
if you open your third eye
and be true to your heart.

16
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,658
"I decided to stay at the villa
for just one night."

17
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,286
-Bread's here.
-Use it to make a sandwich.

18
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,579
-Thanks.
-Sure.

19
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,206
The ingredients here
are different from the ones over there.

20
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,542
-Take whatever you like.
-I want some eggs.

21
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,753
There's more meat here.

22
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:31,837
What have you got there?

23
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,047
-Eggs.
-Tomatoes.

24
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,548
The drinks are here.

25
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,716
-Lettuce and pickles.
-Is the same drink okay?

26
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,637
-Too many pickles.
-Eggs.

27
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,638
We have pickles here.

28
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,055
I need some plates.

29
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,141
That's orange juice.
Do you want some water?

30
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,726
-Plates?
-Where are the plates?

31
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,894
Who wants some water?

32
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,353
-Me.
-I want some milk.

33
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,523
-Help yourself to the milk.
-Got it.

34
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,401
Sorry, thanks.

35
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,403
-You know…
-What's that?

36
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,364
-Yum!
-It's not coming out.

37
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,366
-What's with you?
-What?

38
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,910
You look happy.

39
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,536
Well…

40
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,498
How do they look to you?

41
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,042
"How"?

42
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,586
I mean, the kids.

43
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,546
-What should I go with?
-Okay.

44
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,756
Thanks.

45
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,675
-I'll go get some avocado.
-I'll make a sandwich.

46
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,009
How am I supposed to do this?

47
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,970
Full of potential.

48
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,139
Brimming with talent.

49
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,477
They seem to shine so brightly.

50
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,614
This is them in their prime.

51
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,581
"I returned home the next morning."

52
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,003
"I promised to come pick them up
in ten days."

53
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,755
I'll come pick you up in ten days, then.

54
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,216
Drive safe.

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,384
Take care.

56
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,802
Thank you for your help!

57
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,197
Once I complete the piece
that's in my mind,

58
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,701
I'll face criticism from around the world.

59
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:31,331
But maybe Rumi will appreciate it.

60
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:37,212
Perhaps she'll view it purely
as a work of art.

61
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,676
Just like when we were kids,
and she said she wanted my specimens.

62
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,183
The thought lingered in my mind,

63
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,103
and I felt compelled

64
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,107
to create a piece dedicated to Rumi.

65
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,699
Yes, hello.

66
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,164
However, soon after I returned to Tokyo,

67
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,625
I received word that Rumi had fallen ill

68
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,045
and been taken to the hospital.

69
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,177
Come in.

70
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,230
Shiro…

71
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,023
Are you all right?

72
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,027
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,862
Don't worry.

74
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,077
It's the same illness my mother had.

75
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,539
It's so depressing.

76
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,252
I guess
there's just no escaping your genes.

77
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,634
I'll get better, I promise.

78
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,012
Yeah.

79
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,646
Shiro, I have a favor to ask.

80
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,273
Okay.

81
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,363
Everyone is at the mountain villa.

82
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,740
So could you take them home?

83
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,618
Of course.

84
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,168
Here you go.

85
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,421
I'll take care of it.

86
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,967
I think we will be returning to the US
for a while.

87
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,178
I see.

88
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,474
Anna…

89
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,728
It will be okay. Rumi is a strong person.

90
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,231
I know.

91
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,694
If you need anything, let me--

92
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,196
I'll be fine.

93
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,985
-Hey, mister.
-Hi there. Where's everyone?

94
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,946
They're tidying up over there.

95
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,573
-Hello.
-Hello.

96
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,161
Is Ms. Rumi all right?

97
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,871
Yeah, she's all right.

98
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,046
-Is that all?
-Yup.

99
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,130
Hey.

100
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,008
Once we finished the paintings,

101
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,928
we were going to put them in these
and display them outdoors.

102
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,431
Wow, that would've been impressive.

103
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,810
I guess the successor selection
is postponed now.

104
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,479
I'm sure Ms. Rumi will get better soon.

105
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,731
But she's going back to the US, right?

106
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,360
If I hear from Ms. Rumi,
I'll let you all know.

107
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,445
Okay.

108
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,489
Thank you.

109
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,616
So…

110
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,203
would it be all right
if I got your contact info?

111
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,830
Yes, of course.

112
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, what's your phone number?

113
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,838
Well, since fate brought us
together like this,

114
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,631
I'd like to see you guys again.

115
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,049
Let's meet up again, yeah?

116
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,677
-For sure.
-Let's make a toast.

117
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,055
Ready? Cheers!

118
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,890
Cheers!

119
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,810
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

120
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,312
-Hey, you will break it.
-Rumi!

121
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,147
Rumi!

122
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,525
She's gonna be okay. Hey, you're the
only one with a different vibe.

123
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,071
The boys looked somewhat deflated.

124
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:19,036
Understandable, given the chance
to become Rumi Ichinose's successor.

125
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,167
Back then, I felt conflicted.

126
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,671
Among these talented youths poised
to lead Japan's art world,

127
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,050
Itaru was likely invited solely
because he was my son.

128
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:38,597
But as his parent,
I couldn't help but hope.

129
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,433
Did you want to eliminate the competition?

130
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,937
Well, it's not a world
you can fake your way through.

131
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,732
More importantly,

132
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,110
I realized something.

133
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,237
What?

134
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,325
Tetrachromatic vision
isn't passed down to males.

135
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,452
Okay.

136
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,997
Which means that, out of all of them,

137
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,417
I am the one
who best understands Rumi's world.

138
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,378
In other words,

139
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,090
the most worthy successor to Rumi Ichinose

140
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,050
is me.

141
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,094
Enough already.

142
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,933
You just wanted
to show off your own ability.

143
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,353
You couldn't accept
you were never able to become an artist,

144
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,273
so you sacrificed precious lives
to satisfy your own desire.

145
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,944
This has nothing to do with art.

146
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,370
Mr. Narumi,

147
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,289
you really

148
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,876
don't get it, do you?

149
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,379
What?

150
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,635
Art isn't all about painting pictures
or singing songs.

151
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,931
This is

152
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,517
my art.

153
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,315
Let's cut to the chase.

154
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,863
Mr. Narumi, what's the first thing needed
to create a specimen?

155
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:22,909
First,

156
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,829
you must understand
the butterfly's characteristics.

157
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,000
I began by creating an illustrated guide.

158
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,379
In other words,
I started observing the butterflies.

159
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,215
"Work 1."

160
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,636
"This butterfly's most striking feature
is its beautiful blue color."

161
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,641
"With a sapphire-like glow,
it's often called a 'living jewel.'"

162
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:47,809
MORPHO RHETENOR
AO FUKAZAWA

163
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,187
"But you would never guess

164
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,566
"that the underside of its wings
hides eyes upon eyes."

165
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,152
SEIYO GAKUIN HIGH SCHOOL

166
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,864
-Professor Sakaki.
-Hello there.

167
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,327
It really is beautiful.

168
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,538
I've been wanting to see this color again.

169
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,790
Of course, you have a good eye.

170
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,170
Professor, why did you contact me?

171
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,132
Well, since Ms. Rumi's camp
ended abruptly,

172
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,967
I was wondering how everyone was doing.

173
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,636
That's disappointing.

174
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,180
I thought I was special.

175
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,600
-Will you give me a ride?
-Yeah, sure.

176
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,728
Thank you.

177
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,196
I love blue.

178
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,783
I always use blue when I paint.

179
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,077
Why do you like blue?

180
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,747
Because it's beautiful.

181
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,124
Right.

182
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,128
There's something I want.

183
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,797
What's that?

184
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,216
A morpho butterfly specimen.

185
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,176
I see.

186
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,807
You must have a high-quality one.

187
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,268
Yeah, maybe I do.

188
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,396
Would you give it to me?

189
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,022
I'll pay for it.

190
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,693
No way, I can't take your money.

191
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,612
If I were to give you one,

192
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,698
it would be a morpho rhetenor.

193
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,783
The world's prettiest butterfly.

194
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,829
I want to make jewelry with its wings.

195
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,747
-Jewelry?
-Yes.

196
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,753
A silver ring with a morpho's wings.

197
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,884
I want to always wear that morpho blue.

198
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:57,981
But…

199
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,986
is it inappropriate to use
such a precious specimen like that?

200
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,697
I think it would suit you.

201
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,680
I hear you've got to be the best of the
best to get accepted to this art school.

202
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:31,765
That's right.

203
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,853
The kids here have been in gifted programs
since childhood,

204
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,773
raised exclusively to become artists.

205
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,652
I bet you are
one of the top students here.

206
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,236
Yes.

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,780
Did you meet Ms. Rumi here?

208
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,784
She visited here
as a special instructor before.

209
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,930
-Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,204
I've never seen shades of blue like this.

211
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,665
Thank you.

212
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,836
Actually, I feel the same way.

213
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,589
I like that about you.

214
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,302
-Hey.
-Yes?

215
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,431
We are having an art camp soon.

216
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,599
Would you like to join, Ao?

217
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,226
An art camp?

218
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,312
There will be kids of varied backgrounds,

219
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,857
so it would be
a great learning experience.

220
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,319
In that case, I'll join.

221
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,548
I saw the other kids' paintings,

222
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,718
but I still think
I'm Ms. Rumi's true successor.

223
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,929
Yeah? Why is that?

224
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:35,889
What?

225
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,808
Because I'm always the best.

226
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,061
Well, I should get going.

227
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,689
-Thank you for the ride.
-Not at all.

228
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,402
I'm looking forward to
the world's prettiest butterfly.

229
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,446
Sure.

230
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,411
He believed he would be chosen
as the successor.

231
00:17:58,953 --> 00:17:59,954
KANTO ART SCHOOL

232
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,040
Though his style differed from Rumi's,

233
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,376
he likely had the makings
of a star artist.

234
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,131
He was aware of his own beauty,

235
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,468
and that self-assurance
gave him his radiance.

236
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,514
AGRIAS HEWITSONIUS
SHO ISHIOKA

237
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,431
"Work 2."

238
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,102
"The caterpillars of this butterfly
feed on coca leaves,

239
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,522
"known as a source of narcotics,

240
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,649
"resulting in toxins in their bodies."

241
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,276
"Their striking coloration

242
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,613
"serves as a warning
to signal their toxicity."

243
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,046
-Hey, mister!
-Hey.

244
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,425
I painted this.

245
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,305
I thought you were
one of the town office guys.

246
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,141
-Town office?
-They are always quick to erase it.

247
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,978
But I've painted five other spots,

248
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,356
so they can't get rid of them all
that easily.

249
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,359
To think they would erase
something like this.

250
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,154
-It's good, right? My painting.
-Yes.

251
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,615
Where do you get such ideas?

252
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:19,909
What?

253
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,121
A gift from the devil, I guess.

254
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,457
You mean talent?

255
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,167
Yeah.

256
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,629
I don't care about logic.

257
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,633
My next move just comes to me naturally.

258
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,637
You have an interesting perspective.

259
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,687
Rumi said the same thing to me here.

260
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,035
Here.

261
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,082
-So are you guys dating or something?
-We are childhood friends.

262
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,584
Childhood friends!

263
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,586
What the heck…

264
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,547
SHINGASHI

265
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,549
I don't have any friends.

266
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,509
Sure sounds nice.

267
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,095
-What about school?
-I don't go.

268
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,139
I work here.

269
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,479
I've liked drawing
since elementary school.

270
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,441
But I wasn't a fan of scribbling
on an itsy-bitsy white paper.

271
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:40,156
I used to draw on school walls and stuff
and always got in trouble for it.

272
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,040
Alright.

273
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,169
Here goes.

274
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,886
My art is the best!

275
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,643
Those kids paying top dollar
for art lessons

276
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,228
need schooling because they suck.

277
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,742
But Rumi was the only one who praised me.

278
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,828
That made me happy.

279
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,541
You have a very interesting perspective.

280
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,670
Adults just call it graffiti, though.

281
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,633
Hey,

282
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,138
why don't you come to my class sometime?

283
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,347
Your class?

284
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,644
I don't like schools or classrooms.

285
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,981
No tuition or material fees.

286
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,942
I'll invite you as a special student.

287
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,532
I went to the class 'cause Rumi asked.

288
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,744
But it was just a bunch of rich kids.

289
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,374
I thought, "Don't lump me in with them!"

290
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,630
But I gotta admit, she's legit.

291
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,301
The real deal.

292
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,432
On par with me.

293
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:40,818
Unlike the other boys,
he couldn't afford expensive art classes.

294
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,655
Yet she made an exception
because she wanted him to paint.

295
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,993
Could he be the true successor candidate?

296
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,747
REDBASE JEZEBEL
HIKARU AKABANE

297
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,873
"Work 3."

298
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:58,544
"At first glance, this butterfly appears
modest with its white and black coloring."

299
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,256
"But its underwings reveal vibrant colors
and bold patterns."

300
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,845
"It's as though it's concealing
a passionate soul."

301
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,817
-Professor Sakaki.
-Hello.

302
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,610
What's this about?

303
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,612
You said you wanted to ask
about my painting.

304
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,739
Why here?

305
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,325
Well, it's about this video.

306
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,328
This is you, isn't it, Hikaru?

307
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,628
-You've seen it?
-Yes.

308
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,340
I meant to delete that.

309
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,050
I just kept forgetting.

310
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,719
Is that so?

311
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,721
It was amazing.

312
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,098
Not that I've seen
many videos like this before.

313
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,061
Don't you want to get it out there more?

314
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,981
There are so many ways these days.
Hashtags or whatever.

315
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,358
I don't want to be famous.

316
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:48,988
I see.

317
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,032
-Sorry about that.
-It's fine.

318
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,203
I was curious about the rose painting.

319
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,246
That's your work, right?

320
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,831
Yes.

321
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,710
I've rarely seen
such an incredible painting of a rose.

322
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,066
Thank you.

323
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,985
-That was great!
-Seriously, the best one yet.

324
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,028
Let's watch it.

325
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,489
Are you the one who DMed me?

326
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,201
It's even more powerful in person
than on video.

327
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,705
I'm not doing this for an audience.

328
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,294
What about this painting?

329
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,516
Few can capture such a red.

330
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,480
It's like white roses

331
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,608
stained with blood.

332
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:17,034
Don't you want to see this painting
in the spotlight?

333
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,215
I want the artwork in the spotlight,
not me.

334
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,095
I've stopped making videos.

335
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,056
I want to become Ms. Rumi's successor

336
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,643
and paint works that shine a vibrant light
into people's hearts.

337
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,939
If you'll excuse me now.

338
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,905
You can tell a lot from someone's back.

339
00:26:55,614 --> 00:27:00,870
And his says
that he truly wants to be center stage.

340
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:07,376
Will this red, which only he can paint,
make him the star?

341
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,545
"Work 4."

342
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,297
CABBAGE WHITE BUTTERFLY
TORU SHIRASE

343
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,176
"This butterfly has cells
that can perceive ultraviolet light,

344
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,263
"meaning it can see the world
in more than four primary colors."

345
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:24,268
"The human eye cannot tell
their males and females apart."

346
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,605
"But they can tell each other apart
by color."

347
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,350
Thank you.

348
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,310
Professor.

349
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,355
Please take good care of Toru.

350
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,191
Toru is a talented young man.

351
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,737
He's just a little reserved.

352
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:17,822
Grandma…

353
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,490
Thank you.

354
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,868
-Make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

355
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,751
That was incredible.

356
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,129
It was my first time seeing it.

357
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,631
Thank you for coming all the way here.

358
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,093
I really wanted you to see it, Professor.

359
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,554
Me? Why?

360
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,266
I have your book.

361
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,601
You mean, my father's book.

362
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,687
No, yours.

363
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,148
Really?

364
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,943
I find butterflies fascinating.

365
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,155
The differences
between the front and back of their wings,

366
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,782
or how males and females
behave differently.

367
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,036
After reading your book, it feels like…

368
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,957
I can hear the butterflies talking.

369
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,251
I'm glad to hear that.

370
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:17,381
What interests me most
is how cabbage white butterflies see.

371
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,720
Try these on and see if the male's wings
really look red to you.

372
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,225
These glasses let you see
ultraviolet light.

373
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,227
You can see how butterflies see.

374
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:31,979
I'm sorry,

375
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,900
but to tell the truth,
I have trouble seeing red.

376
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,238
I have
dichromatic color vision deficiency.

377
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,659
I apologize. That was thoughtless of me.

378
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,746
No, don't worry about it.

379
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,542
I used to feel self-conscious as a child,

380
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,212
but now I like my eyes.

381
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,969
Since I don't see all those extra colors,

382
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,891
I like to think
my world's more refined than most.

383
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,144
I see.

384
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,815
My mother had the same eyes as Ms. Rumi.

385
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,902
-Tetrachromatic vision?
-Yes.

386
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:27,910
Ms. Rumi made me realize
just how much more unique my family is

387
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,705
compared to others.

388
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,042
Looking good. Well done.

389
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,127
Thank you.

390
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,220
Try drawing it with your wrist flat.

391
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,346
Understood.

392
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,982
I'm fascinated by your eyes.

393
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:04,863
I have tetrachromatic vision,

394
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:10,286
but I can't see your world.

395
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,541
Butterflies can see even more colors,

396
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,669
but no butterfly would worry about that.

397
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:27,052
I found her perspective
really interesting.

398
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:31,765
She later told me about your book.

399
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,394
I see.

400
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,481
I was so happy to be invited to the camp.

401
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:44,236
I want to use my eyes
to create the most incredible paintings.

402
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,949
Since Rumi was the "Sorceress of Color,"

403
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:53,162
he struck me as the polar opposite
of a true successor.

404
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:57,583
But if what Rumi sought
lay beyond color itself,

405
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,045
then his imagination
wasn't to be underestimated.

406
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,300
PAPER KITE BUTTERFLY
DAI KUROIWA

407
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,426
"Work 5."

408
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:11,096
"Some call this the 'newspaper butterfly'

409
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,557
"as it resembles a newspaper fluttering
in the wind."

410
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:17,102
"Males have an organ called a hair-pencil
at the tip of their abdomen,

411
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,980
"which secretes pheromones
to attract females."

412
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,220
The line starts here.

413
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,436
I'm rooting for you.

414
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,021
Thank you as always, Ms. Mieko.

415
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,106
Oh my…

416
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,443
-And thank you for the gift.
-You are welcome.

417
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,821
Well then…

418
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,240
Professor Sakaki.

419
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,452
-Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

420
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,038
-I'm sorry, Ms. Mieko.
-Not at all.

421
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,457
Sorry, I can't today either…

422
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,418
What? Suicide?

423
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,340
-Not surprising, though.
-They went after her hard.

424
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,468
Bullying if I've ever seen it.

425
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,431
Too bad. I liked Mako-run-run.

426
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,059
-It's on the news too.
-Really?

427
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,728
Let me see.

428
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,403
Sorry to keep you waiting.

429
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,365
-Is this about Mako-run-run?
-That's right.

430
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,659
Wow, Professor Sakaki,

431
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,746
you are really up-to-date
with youth trends.

432
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,122
Not at all.

433
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,709
-This represents online bullying, right?
-Yes.

434
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,422
I want to create a newspaper
using only pictures.

435
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,175
I made this one to express

436
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,552
how I can't stand the fact
online posts can kill people,

437
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:18,181
and yet these cases are brushed aside
with a simple "I didn't mean it."

438
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:25,981
With pictures, even idiots can understand
how terrible their actions are.

439
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,568
It sure is popular, this "BW."

440
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,280
"Black & White," yes.

441
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,452
I have a knack
for noticing people's malice

442
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,871
and the things they want to keep secret.

443
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,289
I see.

444
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,503
Excuse me.

445
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,561
You seemed skeptical
whether or not I really drew it.

446
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,273
I'm truly sorry.

447
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,318
Honestly, I thought
you were the cheerleading captain.

448
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,655
You are quite frank.

449
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,198
My apologies.

450
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:18,492
Thank you.

451
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,493
Sorry.

452
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,453
I'm out of papers, so let me go get some.

453
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,497
Please wait a moment. Sorry.

454
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,584
-Can I…
-Yes?

455
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,379
Can I meet the person who drew this?

456
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,466
That… was me.

457
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,885
I'm so sorry.

458
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,888
I should have asked, "Did you draw this?"

459
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,975
No worries. I get that a lot.

460
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,355
It's a truly wonderful piece.

461
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:53,193
Would you
like to visit my art class sometime?

462
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,281
What?

463
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,791
-Please come see us again.
-I will.

464
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:08,917
Thank you.

465
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,794
-Thank you.
-Thank you as always.

466
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:17,551
You are both adults who can admit
their mistakes and apologize right away.

467
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,177
You think so?

468
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:26,685
Ms. Rumi sees people
without any prejudice.

469
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,355
Even though she's so amazing.

470
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,526
I wonder who she will choose
as her successor.

471
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,697
I have to go now.

472
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,824
-Okay.
-Sorry. Thank you for dropping by.

473
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,914
Words aren't necessary.

474
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,206
Nor are colors.

475
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,710
If we are to inherit the message contained
in that painting,

476
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,756
being Rumi's successor
will not necessarily mean

477
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,383
being the successor
to the Sorceress of Color.

478
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:05,599
These are the traits
of the five butterflies.

479
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,269
Five what?

480
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:10,938
They are human beings.

481
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,272
They are butterflies.

482
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,863
If the camp had continued,

483
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:22,199
who would have been chosen
as the successor?

484
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,328
Mr. Narumi, what do you think?

485
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,126
I have no idea.

486
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,297
What I want to know

487
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,051
is how you contacted them afterwards,

488
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,387
and how you came to kill them.

489
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,182
But…

490
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,604
while your memoir was detailed…

491
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,650
…the crucial parts are missing.

492
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:02,656
That's irrelevant to the finished work.

493
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,616
It is relevant to the case.

494
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,454
This memoir isn't about
how to make human specimens.

495
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:14,292
It's observations
of the mind of a twisted killer.

496
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,129
Why did you--

497
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,047
Why them?

498
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:20,924
Why did I kill them?

499
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,135
Why, why, why?

500
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,513
Mr. Narumi, all you say is "why."

501
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,306
It's boring.

502
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,061
Can't we simply relish its beauty?

503
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,151
Yes.

504
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:44,364
Set your heart free
when you are in the presence of art.

505
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:51,038
Now allow me to invite you
to a special gallery.

506
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:57,127
Sit back and take it in.

507
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,267
I sedated the subjects
with sleeping pills,

508
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,811
then injected them

509
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,689
with colforsin daropate,
a cardiovascular agent,

510
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,483
to end their lives.

511
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,736
Ao Fukazawa.

512
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,571
Morpho rhetenor.

513
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,492
To bring out the morpho rhetenor's
beautiful blue coloration,

514
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,911
I recreated
the wavelength-selective reflection

515
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,455
characteristic of its wings.

516
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,919
I used gray metal
and colorless zinc sulfide particles

517
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,088
to represent the scales.

518
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,850
Sho Ishioka.

519
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,186
Agrias hewitsonius.

520
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,902
This form represents

521
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,823
a chrysalis breaking through
a concrete wall to hatch.

522
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,617
The gradient on the right arm

523
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:16,414
expresses the spread of poison
from the Agrias hewitsonius specimen.

524
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,678
Hikaru Akabane.

525
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,429
Redbase Jezebel.

526
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:36,476
The focal point for this specimen
is not the front side of the wings,

527
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,978
but the beautiful back side.

528
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,815
I chose the paint carefully

529
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:46,570
to depict the redbase Jezebel's markings
from shoulder blades to buttocks.

530
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,674
Toru Shirase.

531
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,634
Cabbage white butterfly.

532
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,058
His hands are raised high,
as if reaching for the moon.

533
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:21,563
He's beautifully posed,
as though cradled by a mother.

534
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:27,152
From his closed eyes, butterflies emerge
and fly toward the moon.

535
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,630
Dai Kuroiwa.

536
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,007
Paper kite butterfly.

537
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,719
I amputated both legs and the genitals.

538
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,804
To evoke the hair-pencil

539
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,599
of a paper kite butterfly
at the male genital area,

540
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:03,146
I depicted many females
being drawn in by the pheromones.

541
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,189
Is that all?

542
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,941
Excuse me?

543
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,485
You made six specimens.

544
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:53,488
Why did you only speak about five?

545
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,448
"Why"?

546
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,955
"Anyone would have sufficed."

547
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,041
What?

548
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,627
Random killers often say that.

549
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:11,798
But while many can kill strangers,

550
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:17,512
few throughout history
have harmed their loved ones.

551
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,264
True.

552
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,059
The autopsy showed

553
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,478
that Itaru Sakaki died

554
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:29,983
about a week later than the other boys.

555
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,735
Indeed.

556
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,487
When I made specimens of these five,

557
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:39,200
I had no intention
of doing the same to Itaru.

558
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,202
Then why--

559
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,546
Mr. Sakaki, what you are saying

560
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,341
is nonsensical.

561
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,178
I have no choice

562
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,557
but to keep asking you "why"

563
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,268
until I understand.

564
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:09,689
I'll tell you…

565
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,490
why I laid hands…

566
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,953
on my own son.
