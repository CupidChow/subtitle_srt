1
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,226
Do you acknowledge that you are poisonous?

2
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,361
5 YEARS AGO
NEW YORK

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,299
From the moment I wake up,
my world is colorful.

4
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,677
The sky,

5
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:53,679
the sun,

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,348
and even the flowers by my window.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,854
They all glimmer
with colors that only I can see.

8
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:07,902
I want to share this joy
with everyone around the world.

9
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,404
That is why I paint.

10
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,288
Not at all.

11
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:23,042
There are so many mothers out there
working harder than me.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,629
But, I guess…

13
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,466
Immediately after my daughter was born,

14
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,926
I lost my husband in an accident.

15
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,473
It was a painful life experience.

16
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:43,938
But I still had my gifts from God.

17
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,273
I'm referring to these eyes of mine,

18
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,360
and my one and only daughter.

19
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,112
Anna.

20
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,489
Come here.

21
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:11,048
Unfortunately, my daughter
did not inherit my eyes.

22
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:18,430
I believe it is my duty as her parent
to find my daughter's gifts.

23
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:16,822
HUMAN SPECIMENS

24
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,164
It was all to become the successor.

25
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,333
Rumi's successor?

26
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:28,918
Yes.

27
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:34,048
The successor selection process she
announced at the mountain villa camp…

28
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:40,095
I thought I was used to
my mother's impulsiveness,

29
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,432
but she brought up having a camp in Japan
out of nowhere.

30
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:47,519
And she had bought a mountain villa
without my knowledge.

31
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,981
Even so,

32
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,235
I was happy to be able to paint
under my mother's guidance.

33
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,742
That's why I took a break from school
and came to Japan with her.

34
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,077
I did all that for her to say,

35
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,580
"Anna, you will be the model."

36
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,291
Your model will be…

37
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,627
Anna Ichinose.

38
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,129
My daughter.

39
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,173
I'm Anna Ichinose.

40
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:21,971
I'll be picking one of you
based on your finished works.

41
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,014
The one I pick

42
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,224
will be named

43
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,937
as my, Rumi Ichinose's, successor.

44
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,983
And I will entrust my "sorceress' eyes"
for color

45
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,069
to the chosen one.

46
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,749
I was absolutely shocked.

47
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,754
Not that anyone noticed.

48
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,299
None of them had tetrachromatic vision.

49
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,803
Because they were boys. All five of them.

50
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,805
Weren't there six?

51
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,557
No.

52
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,687
Itaru was never
in the running to begin with.

53
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,191
He was

54
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,195
just an excuse to invite you.

55
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,576
I'll come pick you up in ten days, then.

56
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,952
Drive safe.

57
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,495
Take care.

58
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,788
Thank you for your help!

59
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,299
Itaru.

60
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,384
Yes?

61
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:46,472
I want you to help as a judge.

62
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,265
What?

63
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:53,729
Your ability to replicate
everything accurately,

64
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,773
I want you to make full use of it.

65
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:57,733
Okay.

66
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,824
But…

67
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,579
my mom fell ill and the camp was canceled.

68
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,249
That's where it was decided that
we would immediately return to America.

69
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,671
I figured it was my chance to act.

70
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,350
I left my mom
to her secretary's care in America

71
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,268
and did not board the plane.

72
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,524
I was going to create
the ultimate work of art

73
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,111
and make her acknowledge me
as her rightful successor.

74
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,364
The ultimate work of art…

75
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,124
I decided to turn humans
into beautiful specimens.

76
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,758
Did you tell Itaru this
and ask for his help?

77
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,265
No, I told Itaru nothing.

78
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,853
He showed up on his own
the day I gathered the other five.

79
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,359
Why are you here?

80
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,237
I thought I would do
Ms. Rumi's assignment too.

81
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,074
But you were supposed to be a judge.

82
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,581
I want Ms. Rumi to acknowledge me
as a potential successor.

83
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,503
I have an idea.

84
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,047
I was planning

85
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,010
to give my mom a happy surprise.

86
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,429
Could you help me out?

87
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,015
Yeah, of course.

88
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,933
Hey, Itaru's here too!

89
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,230
-Itaru's another one of our rivals.
-Gotta get real serious, then!

90
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,523
That's a given.

91
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,070
I brought a gift for everyone.

92
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,032
-A gift?
-What is it?

93
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,035
Let's see.

94
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,247
This is what you drank in Taiwan, right?

95
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,332
Yeah, that's the one.

96
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:23,170
So you are saying
it wasn't Itaru who brought the cachaça?

97
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,505
Correct.

98
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,259
Itaru would never do such a thing.

99
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,951
It's ready!

100
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,411
-Wow!
-Awesome.

101
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,384
You are awake?

102
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,480
You did say you wanted
to paint first thing in the morning.

103
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,824
I'm not going to kill you.

104
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,789
That would just be plain murder.

105
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,968
Stop that.

106
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,472
Stop!

107
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,190
Ao deserves better.

108
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,406
You said you wanted Ms. Rumi
to acknowledge you, right?

109
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,367
Yeah.

110
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,788
But it's me.

111
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,334
I'm the one my mom…

112
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,088
needs to acknowledge.

113
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,591
Okay, I get it!

114
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,099
Leave the work that requires strength

115
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,518
to me.

116
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,525
What you did to the other five
was just plain murder too.

117
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,610
No.

118
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:45,408
You understood my feelings
better than anyone, Uncle.

119
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,955
Remember what you wrote in your account?

120
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,415
"This isn't murder. It's art."

121
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,924
It was as if you had peered into my mind.

122
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,300
I was shocked.

123
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,055
DIY CEMENT

124
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,265
Sho…

125
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,309
was on drugs.

126
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:19,568
I'll be turning him into something
to be cherished…

127
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,448
before he became an actual pest.

128
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,871
We will take this over there
once you are done.

129
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,665
Okay.

130
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,174
Three, two…

131
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,397
Hikaru doesn't need to stand onstage.

132
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,611
If he has a spotlight shining on him
as a work of art,

133
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,614
then he is practically being showered
with applause, right?

134
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,411
Make that rough.

135
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,247
I want to give it a dry feel.

136
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,458
Okay.

137
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,751
Toru wanted to die.

138
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,592
-That butterfly is facing the wrong way.
-What?

139
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,969
-It's upside down.
-Right.

140
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,722
-That way up. Yeah.
-Thanks.

141
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,023
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

142
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,830
Around here, right?

143
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,956
I think so.

144
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,794
Here?

145
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,702
What was your relationship with Itaru?

146
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,121
Relationship?

147
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,709
Like, was Itaru in love with you?

148
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,755
And did you reciprocate
those feelings in some way?

149
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,299
It was nothing like that.

150
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,178
I made a promise to Itaru.

151
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,848
That I would do anything for him
once we finished the specimens.

152
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,645
But he never asked for anything.

153
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,399
I don't know
what was going through his mind.

154
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,282
I have a question for you too.

155
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,704
How were you able to write
such a detailed account?

156
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:50,630
Itaru left a report saying
that he made the specimens on his own.

157
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:56,135
And that you were his next target.

158
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,103
You believed that and turned Itaru
into a specimen himself?

159
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,071
You saw Itaru as a failure.

160
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,240
What?

161
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,160
That's why you did something so selfish
without regard for Itaru's feelings.

162
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,497
I thought…

163
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,712
it was the right thing to do
as his parent.

164
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,548
That just means you abandoned him.

165
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,258
What gives you the right to say that?

166
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,473
My apologies.

167
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,522
Will you press charges against me?

168
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:52,817
No.

169
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,114
I want to be sentenced to death.

170
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,659
All I feel for you…

171
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,373
is pity.

172
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,710
What?

173
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,548
Weren't you

174
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,301
mimicking something yourself?

175
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,644
I know this because I made one.

176
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:33,775
It couldn't have been done by two people
in two days without any preparation.

177
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,779
Your tools were too complete.

178
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,033
The crosses, chains, background art…

179
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,496
It was all prepared in advance
to make the specimens.

180
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,962
I had been planning for a while.

181
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,630
I even drew design sketches.

182
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,969
You had no idea your mother
bought that mountain villa,

183
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,763
so where did you find the time
to prepare it all?

184
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,811
Sleeping pills I understand,

185
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,106
but is it really that easy
to procure colforsin daropate?

186
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,694
Is it possible to draw
all that background art in two days?

187
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,905
Dai Kuroiwa's background
had six paintings.

188
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,825
Did you stockpile them at home?

189
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,370
Yes.

190
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,708
Also, since there was
a large fridge there,

191
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,668
I didn't have to complete
it all in two days.

192
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,461
You said earlier that it took two days.

193
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,629
That was a mistake.

194
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,720
Did you plan it on your own?

195
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,473
Yes.

196
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,351
Very well.

197
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:55,064
Tell me the names of the butterflies
you used for the human specimens.

198
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,985
Including their traits.

199
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,501
I don't know them.

200
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,012
In the past…

201
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,768
I gifted Rumi butterfly specimens.

202
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,354
Morpho rhetenor.

203
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,108
Agrias hewitsonius.

204
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,320
Redbase Jezebel.

205
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,614
Cabbage white butterfly.

206
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,617
Paper kite butterfly.

207
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,166
The person who came up with
and executed the horrific plan

208
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,461
to create human specimens…

209
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,343
was Rumi, wasn't it?

210
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,280
Yes.

211
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,703
She had been working toward it all along…

212
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,378
and left the task to you.

213
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,465
Yes.

214
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,467
When?

215
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:57,311
The day you came to see my mother
after she was taken to the hospital.

216
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,563
No!

217
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,315
I can't commit murder.

218
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,402
Anna.

219
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,281
Look at me.

220
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,247
This is

221
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,458
a work of art that I,

222
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:24,005
Rumi Ichinose, must attempt
in my final days, as an artist.

223
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,218
I can't leave the hospital anymore.

224
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,307
You are the only one
I can entrust with this.

225
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:39,896
Why?

226
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:48,863
Because…

227
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,868
you are my one and only gift.

228
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,500
And the boys I have chosen

229
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,588
are terrible people who deserve to die.

230
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,466
Or who want to die.

231
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:17,892
First

232
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,604
is Ao Fukazawa.

233
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:24,857
He's…

234
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,821
Anna, look properly.

235
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,872
My successor…

236
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,418
My sole successor

237
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,464
has always been you, Anna.

238
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,304
I have been strict with you
because I love you.

239
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,809
I'm grateful to God

240
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,145
for blessing me with you.

241
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,568
If you successfully execute this plan,

242
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:15,283
I will officially announce you
as my successor.

243
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,954
This is my final wish.

244
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,582
If this is granted,

245
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,961
then I will have no regrets.

246
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:44,937
Yes?

247
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,154
Shiro…

248
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,656
Are you all right?

249
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,953
So are you now
officially Rumi Ichinose's successor?

250
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,716
There was more to the plan.

251
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,430
Can I tell you?

252
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,515
Go on.

253
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,103
It was to show the completed specimens
to Shiro Sakaki.

254
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,981
What?

255
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,901
You had to see the actual specimens…

256
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,072
in the mountain villa's flower garden.

257
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,411
You didn't contact me, did you?

258
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,831
I didn't.

259
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,002
Right after completing the specimens,

260
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,298
I was told that my mother's condition
was dire, so I returned to America.

261
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,884
I figured I could just

262
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,512
send you photos later for you to see.

263
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,688
Mom.

264
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,199
How did it go?

265
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,203
I made them.

266
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:26,664
All of them.

267
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,465
Thank you.

268
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,971
So…

269
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,016
what did Shiro say?

270
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,897
I will send him photos later.

271
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,615
You haven't shown him?

272
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,327
With the condition you are in,
I couldn't--

273
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,126
Useless!

274
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,093
You really are a failure.

275
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:56,564
How have you lived since then?

276
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,818
You killed in place of your mother,

277
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,154
only to be called a useless failure.

278
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,118
What was the point of your actions?

279
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,289
What role was Itaru forced to play
in all of this?

280
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,334
Itaru was prepared to take all the blame!

281
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,845
What am I supposed to do?

282
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,692
Go back

283
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,695
to being human.

284
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,255
Red-bodied swallowtail.

285
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,135
A poisonous red.

286
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,934
It doesn't look red to me.

287
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,988
Since when?

288
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:38,499
I thought…

289
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:43,253
that you didn't inherit
her tetrachromatic vision.

290
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,465
Right.

291
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,554
But I wanted my mother
to acknowledge me so badly,

292
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,600
so I desperately imitated
her use of colors.

293
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,312
I didn't have the time
to consider my own art.

294
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,982
I would copy my mother's paintings
every single day,

295
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,194
and feel utter despair
over my lack of talent every time.

296
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,533
But…

297
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,664
when I swung that axe down into Ao's body,

298
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,421
his blood appeared
to be a special color to me.

299
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:49,153
Did killing others
grant you tetrachromatic vision?

300
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:53,115
The extreme mental stress

301
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,326
gave you that vision.

302
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,122
The background art used in Toru's specimen

303
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,126
was prepared and painted
by my mother in advance.

304
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,297
I realized something when I saw it.

305
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,097
She had lost her special vision.

306
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,655
I can't see.

307
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,742
I can't see.

308
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,244
I can't see.

309
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,746
I can't see!

310
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,172
I can't see…

311
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,804
Help me…

312
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,474
Shiro…

313
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,650
What?

314
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,570
I could tell because I had copied
thousands of my mother's paintings.

315
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,453
She could no longer see
anything but ordinary colors.

316
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,874
That is why I repainted them.

317
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,085
Toru deserved better…

318
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,089
than those boring colors.

319
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,051
So, you know what?

320
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,099
Those human specimens are my works of art.

321
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,106
What did my mother
want to show me with those eyes?

322
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,089
I think

323
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,594
Itaru realized for himself

324
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,306
who the real red-bodied swallowtail was.

325
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,021
You did it for Itaru.

326
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,692
Itaru did it for me.

327
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,695
I did it for my mom.

328
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,949
We all mimicked

329
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,411
and pretended to be poisonous.

330
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,011
Could it be

331
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:47,349
that he wanted me
to turn him into a human specimen?

332
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:53,814
MAY 9
DAY BEFORE THE INCIDENT

333
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,316
Morning.

334
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,860
You are already heading out?

335
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,946
Yeah. Cram school camp starts today.

336
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,114
Cram school camp?

337
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:07,703
I told you about it yesterday.
You got tired and fell asleep real quick.

338
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,580
-For how long?
-Five days.

339
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:13,500
I'm screwed.
I haven't touched my homework.

340
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,210
Here.

341
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,089
Sounds tough.
Don't push yourself too hard.

342
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,007
I won't.

343
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,467
-Well, I'm off.
-Take care.

344
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,037
That's not a morpho rhetenor.

345
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,440
And the redbase Jezebel
isn't right either.

346
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:23,361
This is wrong too.

347
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,041
"HUMAN SPECIMENS"
CLASS 3-B - ITARU SAKAKI

348
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,043
"Human Specimens"?

349
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:07,966
The butterfly kingdom…

350
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,233
SET BOTH ARMS SO BUTTERFLIES
CAN SIT ON THEM TO REST THEIR WINGS

351
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,116
COLFORSIN DAROPATE

352
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,536
That's tomorrow.

353
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,454
FRIDAY, MAY 9

354
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,915
I was the one who made that.

355
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,125
Not Itaru.

356
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,212
My son…

357
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,549
is not a maniacal murderer!

358
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,093
Itaru…

359
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,513
will forever be Itaru…

360
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,475
as a human specimen.

361
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:05,106
MAY 10
DAY OF THE INCIDENT

362
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,639
What do you think, sir?

363
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:41,893
Sir?

364
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,437
You know,

365
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,815
on my 20th birthday,

366
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:51,111
I want to drink that pineapple cocktail
with you, Dad.

367
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,770
I wonder if we will meet again.

368
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,581
What are you doing here, Dad?

369
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:11,376
Rumi asked me to do something for her.

370
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:12,460
What about you?

371
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,463
I came here
to finish up my project on my own.

372
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:16,965
You have a key?

373
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,634
Sorry, I made my own copy.

374
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:23,471
I made curry. Let's have some together.

375
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,223
Is someone else coming too?

376
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,599
No, not today.

377
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,485
Curry was also the first thing
you made for me

378
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,279
after your mom passed away.

379
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:40,905
Was it?

380
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,285
The potato peels were thicker
than the potatoes themselves.

381
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,829
Guess I have improved, then.

382
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,414
Guess so.

383
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,167
Thanks for the meal.

384
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,806
Sorry, is it too spicy for you?

385
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,974
No, it's fine.

386
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:09,976
Think I'm just a little tired.

387
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:15,607
-Here.
-Thanks.

388
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,873
This is magnificent.

389
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,337
Is this how butterflies see the world?

390
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,384
It is exactly how they see it.

391
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,265
I could only ever imagine this.

392
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,644
I don't have the talent
to convey it like you do.

393
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,108
Seeing this…

394
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,112
has fulfilled a long-held wish of mine.

395
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,454
Maybe I was able to paint this

396
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:57,834
because I'm grandpa's grandson
and your son.

397
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,345
Hey, why don't we take a photo?

398
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,889
I bought some clothes for you too.

399
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,351
What? That's for me?

400
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,436
Yeah.

401
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,693
I'll go change into these.

402
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:48,653
I've got it!

403
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:51,906
It's beautiful.

404
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,366
It sure is.

405
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,952
-You got it.
-I did it.

406
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,121
I'm so happy.

407
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:42,415
This feels like a coming-of-age ceremony
for my 20th birthday.

408
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,585
Yeah, a coming-of-age ceremony.

409
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,672
That's why I got you something special.

410
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,841
Can you guess what it is?

411
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,803
That pineapple cocktail?

412
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,307
-You got it.
-Can I really have some?

413
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,728
It's your reward
for this fantastic masterpiece.

414
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,815
Awesome.

415
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:29,962
I said I wanted it
for my 20th birthday, though.

416
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,381
Today is special.

417
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,637
Can't wait to drink it.

418
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,225
-Give me a moment.
-Okay.

419
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,285
-Here.
-Thanks.

420
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:07,416
-Looks delicious.
-Yeah.

421
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,506
Why are we suddenly celebrating
my 20th birthday?

422
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,133
Are you ill?

423
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,219
No, it's nothing like that.

424
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:24,308
I need you to live a long life, you know?

425
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:33,401
You are becoming
more and more like your mother.

426
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,075
Anyway, cheers.

427
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,160
Cheers.

428
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,263
You made it pretty strong.

429
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,265
I'll drink it slowly.

430
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,100
Sorry about that.

431
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,533
Talk about something.

432
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:27,455
Like what?

433
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,585
Like when you made the specimens.

434
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,087
What?

435
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:41,969
The ones you gave to Ms. Rumi
when you were a kid.

436
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,058
Those?

437
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:49,894
Well…

438
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:57,276
We moved to this house
when I was six years old.

439
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,448
We lived in Tokyo until then.

440
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,910
It was my first time living
in the mountains.

441
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,750
There was this bug-collecting set
that came with a syringe.

442
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,215
I looked it up in the library
so many times.

443
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,991
I took Rumi to the flower garden.

444
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,723
Itaru…

445
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:58,647
you will become a butterfly.

446
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,781
-Itaru!
-Mr. Sakaki?

447
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,241
-Itaru!
-Are you okay?

448
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:56,825
-Itaru!
-Mr. Sakaki, are you okay?

449
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,202
Are you okay, Mr. Sakaki?

450
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,663
Calm down. It's okay.

451
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,833
-Listen, Sakaki. Calm down.
-It's okay.

452
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:04,310
On my 20th birthday,

453
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,398
I want to drink that pineapple cocktail
with you, Dad.

454
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:50,689
THE MOMENT I SWUNG DOWN MY AXE

455
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,447
"The moment I swung down my axe,
I ceased being human."

456
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,950
"My father's actions were out of love."

457
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,746
"I hope the world
will forgive him as such."

458
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:09,500
"Dad,

459
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,628
"please turn me into a specimen."
