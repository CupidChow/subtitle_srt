1
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:09,927
It's nice here.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,429
The air is clear.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,555
MOUNT CHO, NAGANO

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,308
Just stop working all the time and refresh
yourself every once in a while.

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,146
John seems to be having more fun
than usual too.

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,773
Hold on.

7
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,651
John, you want some water?

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,782
John!

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,410
I'll call you later.

10
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,327
John!

11
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,913
Come on, you can't go over there.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,541
John.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,961
John?

14
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:48,924
John?

15
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,033
Can I help you?

16
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,788
That case everyone's been talking about…

17
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,748
What?

18
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,250
Thought I would tell you about it.

19
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,294
What case?

20
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,049
I'm sure it's reached
the ears of rural police too.

21
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,636
Well…

22
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,807
I'll give you a hint, then.

23
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,143
Some incredible works of art
were discovered recently, right?

24
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,938
You know,
where they found some boys like this…

25
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,984
Right, that case.

26
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,570
Do you have any leads?

27
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,659
I made them.

28
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,037
What?

29
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,459
The Human Specimens are my work.

30
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:53,794
HUMAN SPECIMENS

31
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,215
At what time did you find them?

32
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,094
Let's see, I think it was around 9:00 a.m.

33
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,620
Ask them how soon
the coroner's van will be here.

34
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:29,705
Yes, sir.

35
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,755
Everyone, please move aside.

36
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,089
Step back, please.

37
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,883
-Move, move.
-Please give us a word.

38
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:41,842
Please let us hear.

39
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,221
NAGANO PREFECTURAL POLICE

40
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,808
Shiro Sakaki, 50 years old.

41
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,605
Biology professor
in Meikei University's Faculty of Science.

42
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,358
So you claim responsibility
for the case in Chogaoka.

43
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,952
And this as well?

44
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,747
Have you read it?

45
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,838
According to this,
after you murdered six boys--

46
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:20,756
Detective.

47
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,217
Yes?

48
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,886
They are "specimens."

49
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,560
Not "murders."

50
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,396
I made them into specimens.

51
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,332
After you murdered six boys,

52
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:00,587
you uploaded this document and photos
to a free website

53
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,592
to flaunt them to the public
before turning yourself in.

54
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,971
Well, that's about right.

55
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,231
REDBASE JEZEBEL / HIKARU AKABANE

56
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,524
Mr. Sakaki,

57
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,484
why would you--

58
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,362
No work of art is understood by everyone.

59
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:27,865
Work of art?

60
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,202
This is my life's masterpiece.

61
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,585
One of these six

62
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,129
is your own son.

63
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,173
Yes.

64
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,765
It's understandable that you are shocked.

65
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,519
That is why I wrote this.

66
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,024
The specimens alone aren't enough.

67
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,903
My reasons, my state of mind…

68
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,864
Only by knowing everything can one grasp

69
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,242
the significance
of creating the human specimens.

70
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,037
Significance?

71
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,706
Allow me to explain

72
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,292
why I turned

73
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,546
those beautiful boys,
including my own son, into specimens.

74
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,341
Or…

75
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,179
in your words,

76
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,140
why I became a deranged killer.

77
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,270
I'm off.

78
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,398
Be careful.

79
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,447
I first became captivated by the beauty
of butterflies when I was six.

80
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,949
44 YEARS EARLIER

81
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,701
Forty-four years ago.

82
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,915
It all began
when my father uprooted us from Tokyo

83
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:04,211
to live in a house in the mountains.

84
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:32,322
Back then, beautiful butterflies
were a treasure to me.

85
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:40,998
But any butterfly I captured
would die overnight.

86
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,378
By returning them to the flowers,

87
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,715
the morning dew would beautifully
bring the butterflies back to life.

88
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,552
I remember believing that back then.

89
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,864
Hey, Mom.

90
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,948
Yes?

91
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,658
This one's a swallowtail, right?

92
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,036
What about this one?

93
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm afraid I wouldn't know.

94
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,377
Hey there, butterfly expert.

95
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,463
Why don't you show it to your dad?

96
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,385
That's a luehdorfia.

97
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,056
Back when I was a kid,
you would see them flying in Tokyo.

98
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,641
Never thought I would see them again…

99
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,394
Going off the grid has its perks.

100
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,733
Shiro.

101
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,236
Let them go while they are still alive.

102
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,738
It's cruel otherwise.

103
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,615
Okay.

104
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,152
Beautiful, isn't she?

105
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,030
She was my classmate in art school.

106
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,909
Why are you painting her?

107
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,619
She asked me to.

108
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,996
She was diagnosed with a serious illness,

109
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,290
so she wants
to preserve her current appearance.

110
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,877
Wouldn't a photo do?

111
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,436
It doesn't look like her.

112
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,438
You think?

113
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,818
If only we could preserve humans
as specimens at their most beautiful.

114
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,571
Human specimens?

115
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,531
Yeah.

116
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,537
What's wrong?

117
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,664
Human specimens… Scary.

118
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,001
Of course we can't actually
make humans specimens.

119
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,712
That's why I became a painter.

120
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:40,385
And yet, the sensationalist media
blows things out of proportion.

121
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,220
HASHIMOTO PRIZE

122
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,764
This is the second time
I have received this award,

123
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,309
following the first time four years ago.

124
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,727
It is a great honor.

125
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:53,356
I would like to continue to work hard
on my creative activities.

126
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,653
Do you already have a motif or concept
for your next piece in mind?

127
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,238
Well…

128
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,407
I have long dreamed

129
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,035
of creating human specimens.

130
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,499
To carefully observe and preserve forever

131
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,753
the most beautiful moments of life.

132
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,672
-Mr. Sakaki, thank you.
-For that--

133
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,049
-Now…
-What the heck is this?

134
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,927
-What the heck are you doing?
-…we would like to ask…

135
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,678
-…Mr. Shohei Wakabayashi…
-That's rude!

136
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,847
-Stop it!
-…for his comments.

137
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,807
-Mr. Wakabayashi, please.
-Let's go home!

138
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,979
Butterfly specimens should be fine.

139
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,191
-Want to make one?
-Yeah!

140
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,573
INSECT COLLECTING KIT

141
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,293
Red is the insecticide.

142
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,337
Blue is the preservative.

143
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:58,755
What are they?

144
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,007
Well, they are poison.

145
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,759
Poison.

146
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,728
Here.

147
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,819
First, crush the butterfly's thorax.

148
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,903
What?

149
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,658
Putting it in a temporary coma
is a kinder way for it to go.

150
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,202
If we are making a specimen,

151
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,955
we should preserve
its most beautiful from.

152
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,456
We owe the butterfly that much.

153
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,670
Yeah.

154
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,631
That's good.

155
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:45,969
Should be enough.

156
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,398
Right here.

157
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,832
Here.

158
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,171
Okay.

159
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,678
Okay, hold it.

160
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,308
Cut right here.

161
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,397
You should cut off the body
so it won't get moldy.

162
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,192
Can you cut it off?

163
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,292
Good.

164
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,604
Give it a try.

165
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,358
Here.

166
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,039
Well done.

167
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,374
Good angle.

168
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,752
Pin the bottom too.

169
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,053
All that's left is to adjust the antennae,
dry it, and box it.

170
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,471
Then it's finished.

171
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,517
Living butterflies belong to God,

172
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,937
but once they are specimens,
they are yours.

173
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,607
"Butterflies can see ultraviolet light
invisible to humans."

174
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,110
INSECT LIFE

175
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:54,491
"They perceive colors
differently from us."

176
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,494
While researching butterflies,

177
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,455
I learned
that they can see ultraviolet light

178
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,125
and colors invisible to humans.

179
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,513
They perceive thousands more colors
than we do.

180
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,226
How does the world look
from the eyes of a butterfly?

181
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,816
I longed for the butterfly's world
that I could not see,

182
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,070
and even began to wish
I could become a butterfly.

183
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,218
Dad, look at this.

184
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,302
What is it?

185
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,099
-Wow, you drew a lot of pictures.
-Yeah.

186
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,688
It's beautiful!

187
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,817
-Thanks.
-Here.

188
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,193
It's very vivid.

189
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,991
-What flower is this?
-A dandelion.

190
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,617
A dandelion?

191
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,745
-Then, what is this one?
-A white clover.

192
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,501
Is this how things look to you?

193
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,086
Nope.

194
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,130
This is how butterflies see color.

195
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,718
They can see ultraviolet light
that humans can't.

196
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,971
So this is how the world looks to them.

197
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,727
-Wow! Did you research that on your own?
-Yeah.

198
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,565
That's amazing!

199
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,279
My mother praised me quite a bit.

200
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,074
Perhaps that is why I decided
to become a scholar.

201
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,789
So that's why you decided
to make human specimens?

202
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,374
Of course not.

203
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,168
I was only six years old.

204
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,340
This is all very interesting,

205
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,176
but I would like to discuss the case.

206
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,345
That's what I have been doing all along.

207
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:27,060
The bodies we found
match the six boys mentioned here.

208
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:31,481
Five of them had been reported missing
by their guardians.

209
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:40,698
The sixth was your son,
Itaru Sakaki, age 17.

210
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,118
All were naked,

211
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,830
with their bodies painted.

212
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,833
Some had their head or torsos severed.

213
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,670
Did you want to molest these boys?

214
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,130
I would never do such a thing.

215
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,090
Perhaps

216
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,926
you wanted revenge for your father?

217
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,887
Don't be absurd.

218
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:08,643
But it was your father who first mentioned
making human specimens, wasn't it?

219
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,729
Yes.

220
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,609
His words were twisted,
he was attacked by the media and public,

221
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,862
and he had to leave the art world.

222
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,573
So you did this for your father--

223
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,325
Please don't jump to conclusions.

224
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,997
That's why I wrote this.

225
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,085
Next comes the Queen's entrance.

226
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,421
Queen?

227
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,089
Yes.

228
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,466
My precious

229
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,719
Butterfly Queen.

230
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,020
Welcome.

231
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,855
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

232
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,608
In the fall of that year,

233
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:01,529
the portrait client, Mrs. Sawako Ichinose,
visited our home.

234
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,364
-Hello.
-Hello.

235
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,616
Say hello to them.

236
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,659
Hello.

237
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:07,827
Hello.

238
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,872
With her husband, Kimihiko,
and daughter, Rumi.

239
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,042
Rumi was the same age as me.

240
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,418
Thank you.

241
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,199
Stop.

242
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,650
It's beautiful.

243
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,156
Thank you.

244
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,540
I'm glad that I asked you, Ichiro.

245
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,298
It's not beautiful at all!

246
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,180
You are way more beautiful now, Mom!

247
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,395
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Don't worry.

248
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,200
Rumi.

249
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,246
I'll show you some flowers.

250
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,623
Let's go.

251
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,700
It's so beautiful.

252
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,828
In summer,
we get lots of types of butterflies here.

253
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,496
Really?

254
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,249
I like cabbage white butterflies.

255
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,543
Yeah? I like swallowtails.

256
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,253
Okay.

257
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,716
Wow!

258
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,474
Hey, what's this flower?

259
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,934
That's a pincushion flower.

260
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,229
It's so red and cute.

261
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,524
That's light purple.

262
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,693
What?

263
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,864
It looks red to you?

264
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,034
It's red.

265
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,162
What about this one?

266
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:42,750
This one…

267
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,422
It's white on the sides,
and pinkish in the middle.

268
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,595
To me, it just looks yellow.

269
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,442
What is this?

270
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,863
Wow!

271
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,366
It's the world as butterflies see it.

272
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,620
He researched it himself and painted this.

273
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,623
It's beautiful.

274
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,042
Real butterflies!

275
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,422
See this, I was just out there.

276
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,175
I want…

277
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,261
this painting.

278
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,973
What do you say, Shiro?

279
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,561
Okay.

280
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,645
Are you sure?

281
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,022
-Really?
-Yeah.

282
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,110
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

283
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,703
BUTTERFLY KINGDOM
BY SHIRO

284
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:09,378
So, this girl, Rumi Ichinose,
she's the "Queen"?

285
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:11,839
Right.

286
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,801
Of course, that's my own name for her.

287
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,013
She's a woman with extraordinary talent.

288
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,807
So she has some kind of…

289
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,060
supernatural ability?

290
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,062
No.

291
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,815
Her kind of eyes are
found in a small percentage of all humans.

292
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,611
While ordinary people see
about a million colors

293
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,447
through combinations
of three primary colors,

294
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,783
people like Rumi can see

295
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:42,995
up to 100 million colors
using combinations of four.

296
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,917
I didn't know that.

297
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,755
Rumi's mother passed away that winter.

298
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,175
Shortly after her death,

299
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,887
my father also left this world
in an unexpected accident,

300
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,350
and my mother and I returned to Tokyo.

301
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,727
TWENTY YEARS AGO

302
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:10,022
I felt very lonely
with no butterflies in Tokyo's sky.

303
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,651
That was the last time I saw Rumi.

304
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:18,572
I came to completely forget
about the girl I met once as a child.

305
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,992
Then, around my 30th birthday,

306
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,704
Rumi contacted my university lab.

307
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,582
-Here's luehdorfia.
-Thanks.

308
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,215
Excuse me.

309
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,471
There's quite a bit of mail piling up
for you.

310
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,390
Sorry. Thank you.

311
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,558
You are welcome.

312
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:04,577
RUMI ICHINOSE

313
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,665
SOLO EXHIBITION
"FOUR SEASONS"

314
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,545
She wrote that she had seen my research
in a newspaper.

315
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,090
From there,
we started keeping in touch again.

316
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:24,763
We were both busy,
so we only met once every few years.

317
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,184
But we would update each other
via email and phone calls,

318
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,103
and we became good friends.

319
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,272
Thanks.

320
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:36,484
We had our own marriages,
our own children,

321
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,069
lost our partners early,

322
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,738
supported each other,

323
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:45,034
and sometimes I would send her
butterfly specimens as a birthday gift.

324
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,995
And she would send back paintings.

325
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,253
We carried on that way for 20 years.

326
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:59,048
Then, about one month ago,

327
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,926
I received a phone call from Rumi.

328
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,432
Is something funny?

329
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,267
No, it's just that

330
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:15,814
Rumi has always been someone
who brings revelations to my life.

331
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,527
It's amusing to think
that she couldn't have known

332
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,987
the significance
that phone call would have.

333
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,115
What do you mean?

334
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,994
Looking back,

335
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,290
it was the gateway to a forbidden world.

336
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,672
1 MONTH AGO

337
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,304
Professor Sakaki?

338
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,661
It's an Indian fritillary.

339
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,123
With global warming,
you can even see them in cities now.

340
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,584
Professor…

341
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,919
you'll be late for class.

342
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,296
Right, we'd better hurry.

343
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,384
-Let's go.
-Yes.

344
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,888
Since swallowtails also learn color,
it's hypothesized

345
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,351
that color information
is part of their neural signatures.

346
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:40,316
Furthermore, the wide range
of wavelength responses corresponds

347
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,985
to the highest order
in the butterfly brain.

348
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,322
This is believed to correspond
to the swallowtail's ability

349
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,407
to discriminate colors
beyond human capacity.

350
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,910
If this research progresses,

351
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:55,247
we may be able to uncover a reality
of more than four primary colors.

352
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:12,723
I'm home.

353
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,165
Yeah.

354
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,000
You can come in.

355
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,130
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

356
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,350
It's not that there's
a kind of landscape I like.

357
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,812
I just think they are good
for studying composition.

358
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,230
You have improved a lot.

359
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,148
Yeah, I'm pretty into it.

360
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:08,278
What I like about film cameras
is you can't edit or retouch.

361
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,698
But it ups the stakes for each shot.

362
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,784
I suppose that's novel
for kids these days.

363
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,327
Maybe so.

364
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,871
Aren't you painting these days?

365
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,167
Well, high school's
on a whole other level.

366
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,461
My skills aren't quite up to par.

367
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,840
You won that amazing award.

368
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,800
You are incredible too.

369
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,432
You have inherited your grandpa's talent.

370
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,185
Don't compare me to someone so amazing.

371
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,148
I didn't inherit it myself.

372
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,151
-Thanks.
-No problem.

373
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:50,154
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

374
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,825
But, Dad, you have that.

375
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,748
Talent is a gift from God, right?

376
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,459
You are
the world's biggest butterfly nerd.

377
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,169
Butterfly expert.

378
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,172
I wonder

379
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:14,386
if talent is about
what you want to leave behind,

380
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,972
what you want to express…

381
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,646
What?

382
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,857
Nothing.

383
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,525
What is it?

384
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,447
Just do what you want to do.

385
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,953
I like painting.

386
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,333
Your grandpa and mom would be happy.

387
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,691
RUMI ICHINOSE

388
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,152
Hello?

389
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:13,987
It's been a while.

390
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,614
Rumi?

391
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,074
Hey, how many years has it been?

392
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:23,539
It's been five years
since you visited me in New York.

393
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,916
What's the occasion?

394
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,836
I have decided

395
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,006
to hold an art camp.

396
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:38,428
It's for high school students,
gathering talented kids from across Japan.

397
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,556
I see.

398
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,100
And…

399
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,728
I would really like your son
to participate.

400
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,523
What? Itaru?

401
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,650
Yes.

402
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:56,655
Well, I'm sure he will be thrilled
to have you as a teacher.

403
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,910
-Also, I have some news.
-Yeah?

404
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:06,039
That mountain house where we met,

405
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,042
I have officially purchased it.

406
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,128
What?

407
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:14,214
I looked it up,
and it's just as it ever was.

408
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:18,510
I bought it and renovated it
into a vacation home.

409
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,222
So, Shiro,

410
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,642
I would love for you to also come visit.

411
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,377
Why didn't you tell me
you were friends with Ms. Ichinose?

412
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,922
It's not like I was keeping it a secret.

413
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,927
If I knew someone that famous,
I would definitely brag about it.

414
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,056
Well, I have known Rumi
since we were kids.

415
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,143
"Rumi"?

416
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,063
Mom might get jealous.

417
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,690
Your mom also knew Rumi well.

418
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,360
She knew her late husband too.

419
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:21,865
All right.

420
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,709
Hey.

421
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,837
Cut it out.

422
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,798
Come on.

423
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,510
Knock it off.

424
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,490
Hello.

425
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,825
-Hello.
-Hello.

426
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:51,288
You are all attending
Ms. Rumi Ichinose's art camp, right?

427
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,205
Yes.

428
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,416
I'm Shiro Sakaki.

429
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:58,295
Ms. Ichinose asked me
to bring you all to the villa.

430
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,922
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

431
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,136
I'm Ao Fukazawa. Pleased to meet you.

432
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:10,515
Sho Ishioka. Pleasure.

433
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,392
I'm Hikaru Akabane.

434
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,519
I'm Toru Shirase.

435
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,730
I'm Dai Kuroiwa.

436
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,650
Will you be teaching painting as well,
Mr. Sakaki?

437
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,110
No, not me.

438
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,361
I'm accompanying my son.

439
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,282
I'm Itaru Sakaki. Nice to meet you all.

440
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,201
Nice to meet you too.

441
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,871
All right, everyone, hop in.
Luggage goes on top.

442
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:33,997
-Okay.
-Got it.

443
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,318
Okay, we have arrived.

444
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,862
Thank you.

445
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,413
-Welcome.
-Hello.

446
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,664
-Hi there.
-Thanks.

447
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,918
Hi, Ms. Rumi.

448
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,003
Come in.

449
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,130
-Really?
-In that case…

450
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,464
Thanks!

451
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,799
Thank you for having us.

452
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,051
Did you all finish your schoolwork?

453
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,596
I completed it for this camp.

454
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,639
Diligent, as always.

455
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,558
-Right?
-Excuse me.

456
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,685
-Did you guys finish it?
-Excuse me.

457
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,276
We will catch up later,
just the two of us.

458
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,360
Yes.

459
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,664
Thank you all

460
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,459
for participating in this camp.

461
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:48,256
You are the talented individuals who will
carry the future of Japan's art world.

462
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,176
I organized this camp

463
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,138
in hopes that I might contribute
to your futures

464
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,724
in some small way.

465
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,478
Over the next ten days,

466
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,063
I would like each of you

467
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,650
to complete one portrait.

468
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,069
Your model will be…

469
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,823
Anna Ichinose.

470
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,284
My daughter.

471
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,579
I'm Anna Ichinose.

472
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,668
Now, what I didn't tell you is that

473
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:30,257
I'll be picking one of you
based on your finished works.

474
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,927
The one I pick

475
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,054
will be named

476
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:40,433
as my, Rumi Ichinose's, successor.

477
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,691
Successor…

478
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,253
Everyone here is amazing.

479
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,840
Seems like Ms. Rumi
personally invited each of us.

480
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,844
Who would have thought this was about
choosing Rumi Ichinose's successor.

481
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,345
-It's crazy, right?
-Yeah.

482
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,723
Being chosen would be incredible, right?

483
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,268
Everyone's gathered here.

484
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,063
Do you guys all go to school?

485
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:28,189
Yeah, I do.

486
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,567
I don't.

487
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,570
They sorta kicked me out.

488
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,911
So this is where you were.

489
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:25,872
Just reminiscing.

490
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,417
I heard this house remained unsold

491
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,420
after you and your family
put it on the market.

492
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,465
Must have been
quite the renovation project, then.

493
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,467
Well…

494
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,428
it was pretty run-down.

495
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,765
It's been 44 years, after all.

496
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,227
Amazing.

497
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:51,648
Who would have thought you would
end up buying this place 44 years later?

498
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:57,654
It's a wonderful environment
for focusing on painting.

499
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,410
This is the one room
you have left untouched.

500
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,458
This is where the spirit
of Mr. Ichiro Sakaki still lingers.

501
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:26,808
My mom.

502
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,769
Look how beautiful she is.

503
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,569
But you were so angry back then.

504
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,863
Come on.

505
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,615
I was just a child.

506
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:45,702
Right.

507
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,996
There's something I want to show you.

508
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,637
SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY

509
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:11,227
BUTTERFLY KINGDOM
BY SHIRO

510
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,649
As a child…

511
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:22,655
I envied
how you saw different colors from me.

512
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,536
How colorful it must be.

513
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,249
A world I could never see.

514
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,551
I was the first to develop these lenses
that see ultraviolet light.

515
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:48,097
They let you perceive the same
UV frequencies butterflies detect.

516
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,808
That's amazing!

517
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,105
The colors I imagine

518
00:46:56,773 --> 00:47:00,193
are just those discernible to humans.

519
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,448
It's frustrating.

520
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,368
No matter how much I study,

521
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,663
I will never be able
to see the world you see.

522
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,376
You probably wouldn't know…

523
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,463
but when I drew this,

524
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,550
I felt like I had conquered the world.

525
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:31,099
I thought I was the only one
who understood the world of butterflies.

526
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,563
Then I met you, the real deal,

527
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,649
and my world fell apart.

528
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,736
And yet,

529
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,824
without knowing how I felt,
you offhandedly…

530
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,787
asked for this painting.

531
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,590
Because of your eyes…

532
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,219
I have been unhappy my whole life.

533
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,185
Shiro…

534
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,608
mine isn't the world butterflies see.

535
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,280
My eyes are my own.

536
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,411
Even butterflies
don't stand a chance against me.

537
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:40,627
Sorry.

538
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:43,880
You are right.

539
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:56,059
If Rumi's world is hers alone,

540
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,771
Then, I want a world that's mine alone.

541
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,985
It was the first time
I had felt such a desire.

542
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,990
Perhaps encountering Rumi's talent

543
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:16,162
stirred the dormant artist's blood
within me.

544
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:20,333
Dad.

545
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,960
Can I show everyone Grandpa's studio?

546
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,170
Sure, of course.

547
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,340
Guys, he said we can go see the studio.

548
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,424
Really?

549
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,923
It felt like

550
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,510
an electric current shot through my body.

551
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:15,388
You are
the world's biggest butterfly nerd.

552
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:16,806
Butterfly expert.

553
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,391
I wonder

554
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:23,104
if talent is about
what you want to leave behind,

555
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,773
what you want to express…

556
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:32,780
If art is about giving form
to the world only I can see,

557
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:39,036
then this was God's gift to me.

558
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:44,876
You think that kind of reasoning will fly?

559
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,503
It's not reasoning, it's art--

560
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:51,924
A father and son
making human specimens, calling it art…

561
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,553
And "Welcome to the art museum"?

562
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:59,390
Do you even understand
what you have done to your own son?

563
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:00,933
Of course.

564
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,853
Weren't you two living happily together
until recently?

565
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:05,646
Yes.

566
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,983
Do you think
your wife would have wanted this?

567
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,160
Detective,

568
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,830
have you ever eaten a top-quality steak?

569
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,000
What?

570
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:29,837
The finest A5 grade marbled steak.

571
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,467
As if I could afford that.

572
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,011
But you can imagine the taste.

573
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,935
The taste of cheap meats
can inform your guess.

574
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,481
But imagine all you want,

575
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:53,361
you won't know the actual taste
until you eat it for yourself.

576
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,032
What's your point?

577
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,456
We are told not to make human specimens.

578
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,085
That's why people paint pictures.

579
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:15,842
But the real experience
surpasses imagination.

580
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:22,181
As my father's son,

581
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:25,309
I created the specimens he couldn't.

582
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,897
And I realized something.

583
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:34,360
What?

584
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:44,662
They have gone…

585
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,374
to the Butterfly Kingdom.

586
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,797
What are you talking about?

587
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,509
They have become butterflies,

588
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,637
journeying to the Butterfly Kingdom

589
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,558
as offerings to the Butterfly Queen.

590
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:13,608
Only the chosen
may enter the Butterfly Kingdom.

591
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,904
I merely helped them get there.
