NAGANO PREFECTURAL POLICE

2
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,012
This is the Formosan swallowtail.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,182
Note its distinctive orange markings.

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:16,809
Beautiful, isn't it?

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,479
And this is a red-bodied swallowtail.

6
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:24,608
It's poisonous,
and the Formosan swallowtail mimics it.

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:29,697
Mimicry is when a species imitates another
to avoid being eaten by birds or such,

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,449
advertising itself as being poisonous.

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,492
Hard to tell them apart, right?

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,790
These butterflies can't be seen in Japan,
so Itaru was quite excited.

11
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:44,837
According to your memoir,
Itaru's body was made into this…

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,507
"red-bodied swallowtail" specimen.

13
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:49,842
That's right.

14
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,427
And another.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,179
The spangle.

16
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,603
The spangle is a beautiful butterfly.

17
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:05,024
Even surrounded by a myriad of colors,
it maintains a sort of dignity.

18
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,609
An extraordinary species.

19
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,030
Why is only Itaru represented
by two butterfly species?

20
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:16,535
I can only say,
that's how he appeared to me.

21
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:17,012
HUMAN SPECIMENS

22
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,958
2 YEARS AGO

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,043
TAIWAN

24
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,430
Itaru, it went over there.

25
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,057
Where?

26
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,413
Let's go, Itaru.

27
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,702
Okay, stop here.

28
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,789
Let me stop the car
after we pass the river.

29
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,856
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

30
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,748
It's delicious!

31
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,126
-You like it?
-Yeah.

32
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,544
This one is delicious too.

33
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,258
"Oishii"?

34
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,927
"Hǎo chī."

35
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,679
"Delicious."

36
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,264
"Delicious."

37
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:13,934
-Good?
-Yeah.

38
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,739
Hey, isn't that
a Hebomoia glaucippe butterfly?

39
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,825
-Wow, be careful.
-Okay.

40
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,050
It flew away.

41
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,770
Look.

42
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,856
Isn't that a Formosan swallowtail?

43
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,816
That's so rare. Let's catch it.

44
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,901
Okay.

45
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,527
-You approach from that side.
-Got it.

46
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,828
Keep lower.

47
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,215
I've got it!

48
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,051
-It's amazing.
-Yeah.

49
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:30,844
Wow.

50
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
It's beautiful.

51
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,142
It sure is.

52
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,645
-You got it.
-I did it.

53
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:42,813
I'm so happy.

54
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,652
Awesome.

55
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,120
You see humans as butterflies, correct?

56
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,247
Yes.

57
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,086
Do you see me as a butterfly too?

58
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,673
Of course not.

59
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:16,348
Rumi Ichinose's art camp
was canceled on April 28th.

60
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,812
You drove the five boys to their homes,

61
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,647
then returned home with Itaru.

62
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,566
Over the next few days,

63
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,654
you killed the five boys
and made them into specimens.

64
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,864
Yes.

65
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:38,412
Itaru's estimated time of death
is the afternoon of May 10th.

66
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,500
Why is there such a large time gap?

67
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,091
After the art camp was canceled,

68
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,012
I called the five boys one by one.

69
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,057
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

70
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,685
I created the specimens
taking about ten days.

71
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,317
-I'm heading out.
-See you.

72
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,946
At first, I felt
a sense of accomplishment,

73
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,868
but it was also the beginning
of my days of anguish.

74
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,706
A butterfly faces countless challenges
once it emerges from its cocoon.

75
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,500
The first challenge is flying.

76
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,461
It's a crucial moment.

77
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,465
They instinctively read the wind

78
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,761
and learn to control their wings
as they begin to fly,

79
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,430
and it becomes a daily routine.

80
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,894
An even greater desire
had begun to consume me.

81
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,189
I wanted more beautiful butterflies.

82
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,359
I wanted to create
even more magnificent specimens.

83
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,704
There are 20,000 species of butterflies
in the world.

84
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,581
If I were to kill,

85
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,208
that is to say,

86
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,419
make specimens of 20,000 humans,

87
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,465
would that finally satisfy my desire?

88
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,138
I'm home.

89
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,681
Welcome back.

90
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,863
-We are having sukiyaki tonight.
-Okay.

91
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,536
Will the police catch me
before I create my ultimate specimen,

92
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,540
leaving me to face execution with regrets?

93
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,839
It's ready.

94
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:55,841
Go wash your hands.

95
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,736
I want to create my ultimate masterpiece.

96
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,824
If I can manage that,

97
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,163
I can leave this world without regrets.

98
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:35,922
What?

99
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,051
If you were a butterfly, what would it be?

100
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,846
What's this all of a sudden?

101
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,681
Just wondering.

102
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,561
Maybe a red-bodied swallowtail?

103
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,815
Not the Formosan swallowtail
you caught in Taiwan?

104
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,984
Well, I guess I'm saying

105
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,403
I've got poison, unfortunate as it may be.

106
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,113
Oh? What kind of poison do you have?

107
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,865
That's a secret.

108
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,413
You are maturing splendidly.

109
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,957
Yeah, right.

110
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,628
Let's not forget
how you led me astray, Dad.

111
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,546
What?

112
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,174
The pineapple juice incident.

113
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,594
Right.

114
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,197
-Here.
-Thank you.

115
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,741
Wow.

116
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,044
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

117
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,602
How does the pineapple taste today?

118
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,106
It might be strong.

119
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,280
-Can I get some juice?
-Sure, what kind do you want?

120
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,365
Pineapple.

121
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,659
Get two large ones, then.

122
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,911
-What? By myself?
-Yeah.

123
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,497
I'll be watching from over there.
Practice your English.

124
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,582
Seriously?

125
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:40,046
Welcome. I recommend the mango.

126
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,467
Is this it?

127
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,385
Yes, pineapple.

128
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:46,845
One?

129
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,305
No… Two of them.

130
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,222
Two?

131
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,583
Wow.

132
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,209
-You did it?
-I did it.

133
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,187
-It's good but kinda bitter.
-What?

134
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,108
This…

135
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,818
is a pineapple cocktail.

136
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,112
-Alcohol?
-Yup.

137
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,199
-This is bad, right?
-Did you drink quite a bit?

138
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,326
Will they call the cops on me?

139
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,496
We wouldn't be arrested
for a tiny incident like this.

140
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,498
Oh, good.

141
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,751
Then can I have another sip?

142
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,170
You can have five more sips.

143
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,755
All right!

144
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,092
Your mom could really hold her liquor.

145
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,259
Must be genetics.

146
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,554
If you drank that much,
you would be snoozing in seconds.

147
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,348
Sorry I'm such a lightweight.

148
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,395
Itaru!

149
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,481
Cheers!

150
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,358
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

151
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,442
Cheers!

152
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,658
Is it delicious?

153
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,203
Delicious.

154
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,122
Delicious.

155
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:38,790
Itaru!

156
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,959
Hǎo hē.

157
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,961
-Hǎo…
-Hǎo hē.

158
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,963
-Refreshing.
-Refreshing?

159
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,673
-Hē.
-Hē.

160
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,091
Refreshing.

161
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,049
That was a lot of fun.

162
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101
You know,

163
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,187
on my 20th birthday,

164
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,608
I want to drink that pineapple cocktail
with you, Dad.

165
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,361
Your 20th…

166
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:32,862
Yes.

167
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,614
Can't we?

168
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,751
What's wrong?

169
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,880
It's nothing.

170
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,140
Even Itaru's purehearted suggestion

171
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:06,437
couldn't shake my resolve
to create specimens.

172
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:12,944
Perhaps I had already lost
all trace of human emotion by that point.

173
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,115
I didn't want to admit it until the end.

174
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,826
I didn't want to see it.

175
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,415
I often thought
about gouging my own eyes out.

176
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,838
Itaru was a sensitive child.

177
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,092
If he were to learn
his father's true nature,

178
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,096
could he accept it?

179
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,643
Could he withstand the public's scorn?

180
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,107
How would he feel
about sharing the same blood?

181
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,237
If such things

182
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,533
were to consume Itaru's life,

183
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,414
then the last thing
I could do as a parent was…

184
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,585
to preserve him as a specimen

185
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,339
in his most beautiful state.

186
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,133
That's wrong.

187
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,054
I considered ending it all,

188
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,723
taking my own life.

189
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,226
But I couldn't.

190
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:30,855
I'm…

191
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,816
not the incarnation of a butterfly.

192
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,654
You are human,

193
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,033
and the boys you killed were human too.

194
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,747
This is everything.

195
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,627
I have no regrets.

196
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,715
If it pleases you,

197
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,051
sentence me to death.

198
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,476

"This butterfly grows

201
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:22,490
"Its body is pure red,
a warning to predators not to attack it."

202
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,951
"Spangle."

203
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,161
"This one has black wings."

204
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:31,958
"Its large wings flutter slowly,
invoking the regality of a queen."

205
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,878
"Itaru Sakaki."

206
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,625
"The most beautiful specimen
in the world."

"Teachers at the art school
I had attended since I was three

215
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,578
"said I had artistic talent."

00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:33,663
HONORABLE MENTION

217
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,334
"My forte was reproducing
whatever I could see exactly as I saw it,

218
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,462
"and my artwork was praised
for being like a photograph."

219
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,298
"However, a thought nagged at me."

220
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,760
"'Then, why not just take a picture?'"

221
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,599
"What did I even want to express?"

222
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:58,271
"Perhaps I never had
a God-given gift of my own."

223
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,567
"Amidst my slump,
I lost confidence in my painting

224
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,195
"and took pictures to ease the pain."

225
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,948
"This is the second time
I have received this award."

226
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:09,907
"It's a great honor."

227
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,953
Do you already have a motif or concept
for your next piece in mind?

228
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,247
My next piece?

229
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,624
Well…

230
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,171
I've long dreamed
of creating human specimens.

231
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,297
HASHIMOTO PRIZE

232
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,508
It's a human specimen.

233
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,138
To carefully observe and preserve forever

234
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,514
-the most beautiful--
-Come in.

235
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,102
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

236
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:42,315
-Say, would you like to join an art camp?
-What?

237
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,943
An acquaintance of mine wants you to come.

238
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,155
Seems she saw your painting of Taiwan.

"Her art was filled with colors
I had never seen before."

245
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,682
"Such overwhelming art made me realize

246
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:22,063
"how dull a skill it is to reproduce
what one sees exactly as it is."

247
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:27,109
"My work felt like a mere imitation
next to hers."

"my limitation
of painting only what I see."

250
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,285
I'm Itaru Sakaki. Nice to meet you all.

251
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:40,248
"With such expectations,
I joined the training camp."

252
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,793
-Welcome.
-Hello.

253
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,796
The wall color is different.

"Chapter 3. 'At the Mountain House.'"

255
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,055
Itaru, make yourself at home.

256
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,475
This was originally
your father's house, after all.

257
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,685
Thank you.

258
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,271
-What a lovely son.
-Yeah?

259
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,942
How did such an ordinary swallowtail
produce such a wonderful butterfly?

260
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,736
You think I'm a swallowtail?

261
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,115
When it comes to Shiro Sakaki,
it's gotta be a swallowtail.

262
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,493
You think?

263
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:24,000
You are the talented individuals who will
carry the future of Japan's art world.

264
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,960
Over the next ten days,

265
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,547
I would like each of you
to complete one portrait.

266
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:35,636
I'll be picking one of you
based on your finished works.

267
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,265
The one I pick

268
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:45,646
will be named
as my, Rumi Ichinose's, successor.

269
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,281
And I will entrust
my "sorceress' eyes" for color

270
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,534
to the chosen one.

271
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:04,540
"At first, I thought I was invited
as the son of her friend."

272
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:11,005
"But when I realized I had a chance
to become Rumi Ichinose's successor,

273
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,968
"a desire to win against them all
awakened in me."

274
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,140
"Chapter 4. 'The Rivals.'"

275
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,558
How come you don't know why?

276
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,562
"Ms. Rumi said they were
all talented enough

277
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,647
"to represent Japan's art world,

278
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,691
"so I felt intimidated at first."

279
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,403
"But I was relieved to find
they were just regular kids."

280
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:35,738
Seiyo High.

281
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,822
Really?

282
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,199
-Seiyo?
-Yup.

283
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,492
You are super smart!

284
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,202
I suppose.

285
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,120
Such confidence!

286
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,040
Why do you like blue so much?

287
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,796
I believe only truly beautiful things
can wear this color.

288
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,257
Look at my work.

289
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,261
This.

290
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,186
-Wow.
-It's a morpho rhetenor.

291
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,104
Yes.

292
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,190
Mine's… Let's see…

293
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,818
Here's mine.

294
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,444
Look.

295
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,615
That's bold.

296
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,702
This reminds me of the colors
of an Agrias hewitsonius.

297
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,080
-What's that?
-"Hewitsonius…"

298
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:27,957
It's a butterfly.

299
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,210
Where do you get these ideas from?

300
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,294
Huh?

301
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,755
A gift from the devil, I suppose.

302
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,259
You mean talent?

303
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,511
Well, who knows?

304
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:45,141
What and how to paint
just comes to me naturally.

305
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:47,893
Thanks.

306
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,186
And you, Hikaru?

307
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,688
-What?
-Show us something.

308
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,274
Fine.

309
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:56,944
Seems a bit reluctant.

310
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,574
Here. It's nothing special.

311
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,955
The color feels like real blood.

312
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,208
You're incredible, man!

313
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,003
That sure sounded heartfelt.

314
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,589
And this?
What kinda butterfly would it be?

315
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,551
Maybe a redbase Jezebel.

316
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,636
-"Redbase Jezebel…"
-"Redbase Jezebel"?

317
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,846
I'm gonna look it up.

318
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,600
Morpho are considered
the world's most beautiful butterfly,

319
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,518
but its underside looks like a moth.

320
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,438
The redbase Jezebel

321
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,107
has a plain upper side,
but its underside is vibrant…

322
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,358
Redbase Jezebel…

323
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,487
Looking at Hikaru's back,
that's the feeling I got.

324
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,156
-His back…
-There it is.

325
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,908
What about you?

326
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:45,784
Say something.

327
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,039
I wonder if color
is really that important.

328
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:54,710
Sometimes, by removing color,
we can see the true form more clearly.

329
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,171
What?

330
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,423
This is my work.

331
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,056
Look.

332
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,266
A cabbage white butterfly.

333
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,476
Is this an ink painting?

334
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,519
Yes.

335
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,729
I can't see red very well.

336
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,191
It's called dichromacy.

337
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:23,447
Ms. Rumi knew this
when she invited you, right?

338
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,574
That's right.

339
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:29,328
Maybe the "Sorceress of Color"
isn't actually seeking color.

340
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,582
Everyone sees the world differently.

341
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,377
There's no such thing as "normal" eyes.

342
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,257
I see.

343
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,718
In a way, it's similar
to my black-and-white world.

344
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,643
I don't use black and white much.

345
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,026
Look.

346
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,905
-It looks like a newspaper.
-I see.

347
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,448
The theme is environmental ruin.

348
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:10,578
It depicts a world where humans live
in harmony with animals and insects.

349
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,579
You know,

350
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,832
the flower field here is great.

351
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,877
It felt like a utopia for butterflies
to me.

352
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,130
Amazing.

353
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:24,883
What's wrong?

354
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,177
What?

355
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,262
No…

356
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,640
I just thought if you were a butterfly,

357
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,852
you would be a paper kite,
a really big butterfly.

358
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,979
"Paper kite butterfly…"

359
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,397
Another unfamiliar butterfly.

360
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,692
Meanwhile, let's see your art, Itaru.

361
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,528
-What?
-It's the largest species in Japan.

362
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,572
It's embarrassing to show everyone.

363
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,198
Come on, we'll look up "paper kite."

364
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,409
Okay…

365
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,996
-There it is.
-Yeah.

366
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,164
Something like this.

367
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,210
-That's amazing.
-Show me.

368
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,720
-It looks like a photo.
-Right?

369
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,390
"Seeing everyone's drawings shocked me."

370
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,352
"Even surrounded by nature,

371
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,521
"I never even thought
about the insects living there."

372
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:25,944
My art lacks unique color,
perspective or philosophy.

373
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,240
My drawings don't tell a story.

374
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,951
-I want to try drawing…
-Wait, what are you doing?"

375
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,260
"Chapter 5. 'The Path to Conception.'"

376
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,638
There you are.

377
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,724
Sorry for coming in uninvited.

378
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,185
-Is something wrong?
-What?

379
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,021
You seem down.

380
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,606
It's nothing.

381
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,574
That's my mother.

382
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,326
Before she died,

383
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,414
Mr. Ichiro Sakaki
painted this portrait of her.

384
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:07,463
So this is Sawako Ichinose's
human specimen?

385
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,090
That's what they called it, apparently.

386
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:13,969
I saw my grandfather's speech online,

387
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:18,181
but I couldn't find any information
about what kind of a painting it was.

388
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,518
You know,

389
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,730
when I first saw this painting,

390
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,442
I said something disrespectful
to Mr. Sakaki.

391
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,904
I said, "It's not beautiful at all."

392
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,241
"You are way more beautiful
than this painting, Mom."

393
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,161
Everyone was

394
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,831
praising the painting instead of my mother

395
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,502
who was right there.

396
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,045
It made me feel frustrated.

397
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,469
I think your anger was justified.

398
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,097
After all, to your eyes,

399
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,682
your mother sitting next to you

400
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,519
didn't appear
to have lost her color, right?

401
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,105
"Although she may look weaker,

402
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,275
"she is the same as she was before."

403
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,154
That's how you felt, right?

404
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,074
That's right.

405
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:20,536
Tell me,

406
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:26,333
what time of her life
do you think Mr. Sakaki painted here?

407
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,337
Before she got sick, I suppose.

408
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,674
I thought so at first too,

409
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,425
but I realized something.

410
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,971
In his eyes,

411
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,473
even after she fell ill,

412
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,644
she must have looked
as well as she does in this painting.

413
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,522
That's why

414
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,944
she thanked him
with such a wonderful smile.

415
00:35:57,281 --> 00:36:00,492
I wonder if that's what
my grandfather was trying to express

416
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,788
with his "human specimens."

417
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,458
That's right.

418
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,503
Itaru, there's one more thing
I want to show you.

419
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,228
Wow.

420
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,606
Is this your childhood painting?

421
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,318
This is your father's work.

422
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,153
What?

423
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,824
A butterfly specimen he made
during summer break in first grade.

424
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,162
He read books to paint the background

425
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,790
as butterflies would see it.

426
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,710
Dad painted this?

427
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,716
When I realized

428
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:03,263
I could see more colors than others,

429
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,099
I hated it.

430
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,855
My mother called it a gift from God,

431
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,068
but I upset her
by saying I wanted normal eyes.

432
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,655
That was when

433
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,282
I saw this painting.

434
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,535
-Okay.
-Are you sure?

435
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,954
-Really?
-Yeah.

436
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,959
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

437
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,757
Wow!

438
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:47,474
It gave me courage to know

439
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:52,854
someone admired having eyes
like a butterfly.

440
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:55,983
"Then I'll show you

441
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,152
everything these eyes can see."

442
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,574
I decided to become an artist

443
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,119
because of this painting.

444
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,124
What did Dad say?

445
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,210
I never told Shiro.

446
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,462
Stories like this

447
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,258
are meant to make you cry
after I'm gone, right?

448
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,600
So…

449
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,479
you have entrusted me
with an important message.

450
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,859
Maybe so.

451
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:49,119
"Dad's art had inspired someone's life."

452
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,291
"That fact encouraged me."

453
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,420
"First, I needed
to focus on painting seriously."

454
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,630
BUTTERFLY KINGDOM
BY SHIRO

455
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:05,052
"I felt I was beginning to understand
what had been missing from my work."

456
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,806
"It was about seeing things
not just with my eyes,

457
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,101
"but with a third eye."

458
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,606
"At this stage,

459
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:22,402
"I still intended to paint a picture
titled Human Specimens."

460
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,033
"Chapter 6. 'The Forbidden Door.'"

461
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,410
-Okay, let's unload it. Ready?
-Yes.

462
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,705
I'm sorry, but the road
gets too narrow from here.

463
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,166
Okay, that's good.

464
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,542
-Thanks.
-Watch your step.

465
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,961
-Ready?
-One, two!

466
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,089
All good?

467
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,216
-You okay? Can you manage?
-Yeah, I'm good.

468
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,429
-Ready? It's going up.
-Yes, please.

469
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,514
One, two.

470
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:53,767
Are you okay?

471
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,770
One, two.

472
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,063
-Okay.
-Thank you.

473
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,482
It's heavy. Please be careful.

474
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,984
This is killing me!

475
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,656
Why do we have to do this anyway?

476
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,534
We can't complain. We are the ones
who are going to use these.

477
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,411
-It's heavy.
-Yeah, really heavy.

478
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,622
Should we take a break?

479
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,040
-Okay.
-We're taking a break.

480
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:18,500
-One, two.
-Put it down here?

481
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,502
-Okay.
-One, two.

482
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,964
-Are your hands okay?
-Yeah, okay.

483
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,048
There we go.

484
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,426
I wonder what these are for.

485
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,555
Seems like we will display
our paintings inside these,

486
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,889
like an outdoor art museum.

487
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,474
They are so big.

488
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:35,934
-An outdoor art museum.
-Cool.

489
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,395
-That will look beautiful.
-True.

490
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,314
I don't want to paint anymore.

491
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,859
I'll go inside myself and be the art.

492
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:54,703
"At that moment, I felt as if
I had been hit on the top of my head,

493
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,454
"leaving me temporarily stunned."

494
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,083
"For some reason,

495
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,920
"I could see what looked like wings
on them, through the case."

496
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,267
-Watch your step, guys.
-Okay.

497
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,351
All right.

498
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:20,896
Okay.

499
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,230
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

500
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,363
-Careful.
-Don't hit the sides.

501
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,324
-You okay, Itaru?
-Yeah.

502
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,243
-That should be fine, no?
-Could you put it down here?

503
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,494
Okay.

504
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:37,537
Back there?

505
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,039
There.

506
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,082
Okay?

507
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,751
Ms. Rumi, what are these for?

508
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,588
I have an idea
for how to display everyone's paintings.

509
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,633
It's a secret until it's finished.

510
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,677
-Secret?
-A secret?

511
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,347
Everyone, please take a break.

512
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,599
-Yay!
-Trust me, I will.

513
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,351
Thank you.

514
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,811
-I want to drink juice.
-Orange juice!

515
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,271
It's in the fridge.

516
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,606
-Okay.
-Thank you.

517
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,034
Are you okay, Mom?

518
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,788
I'm okay.

519
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,375
You want some water?

520
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,710
No, I'm okay.

521
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:56,157
I was planning to have you all
start on the assignments,

522
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,576
but I'm sorry,

523
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,162
I need to rest for a bit.

524
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,231
Mom isn't much of a cook,

525
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,066
so that always fell to me.

526
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,486
Me too. It's just me and my dad,
and I'm in charge of meals.

527
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,365
Though, the sukiyaki
my dad makes is amazing.

528
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,034
What's it like?

529
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,413
Dad's style is to season it
with just soy sauce, sugar and sake.

530
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:45,457
Then he adds tomatoes at the end.

531
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,541
Wow.

532
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,376
-Sounds good.
-Yeah.

533
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,213
Man, I want some booze.

534
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,507
As if you could drink it.

535
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,592
Got me there.

536
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,510
Have you ever had a drink before?

537
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:01,514
I tried some local drinks when I visited
Taiwan with my dad two years ago.

538
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:03,224
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

539
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,519
It was a cocktail called caipifruta.

540
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,065
You make it with fruits
and an alcohol called cachaça.

541
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,317
Sounds pretty good.

542
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,610
Yeah, I liked it.

543
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,362
Cachaça…

544
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,576
How many more glasses do we need?

545
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,286
-One.
-One?

546
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,121
-Ao?
-Yes.

547
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:27,332
-Will you take this for me?
-Sure.

548
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,125
Thanks.

549
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:30,585
-There?
-Yes.

550
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,839
-Is it ready?
-The salad is ready.

551
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:36,216
The salad is ready.

552
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,865
"Everyone looked like butterflies."

553
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:05,370
"It was a scene viewed
through a third eye."

554
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,791
"I believe that was the moment

555
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,711
"I was bestowed with the gift
of the ability to see the unseen."

556
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:19,008
"Their forms were truly human specimens."

557
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:24,055
"Where else could you find
a greater work of art?"

558
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,697
This story is a work of fiction.
