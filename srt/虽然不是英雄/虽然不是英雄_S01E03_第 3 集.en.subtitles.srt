1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,263
-Yes, we're heading to the entrance!
-Attention, valued customers.

3
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,474
We have confirmed

4
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,602
that the alarm from earlier
was due to a malfunction.

5
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,104
We apologize for the inconvenience.

6
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,738
Is my power back?

7
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,623
I held

8
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,792
her hand?

9
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:18,471
I can touch someone in my past?

10
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,434
Can I reach Se-yeon too?

11
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,105
Why can't I go back?

12
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,900
I did earlier.

13
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,319
Come on.

14
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,418
Take a deep breath.

15
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,463
Center yourself.

16
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,174
Now, focus.

17
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,009
The sunshine.

18
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,929
The wind.

19
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,514
The beach.

20
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,363
I'm back. It worked.

21
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,204
Do Da-hae?

22
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,721
Does this mean I was happy at that moment?

23
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,726
Go back to another moment.

24
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,770
To a time without Do Da-hae.

25
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,071
I-na.

26
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,114
Think about her.

27
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,418
Yes!

28
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,758
I-na. Stand still.

29
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,595
Move your hands.

30
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,978
Congratulations.

31
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,157
Did I just smile at Do Da-hae?

32
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,117
Did I really do that?

33
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,119
I actually smiled?

34
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,039
What the hell?

35
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,421
Something's seriously wrong.

36
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,298
Why…

37
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,967
Why can I only go back
to moments with her?

38
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,848
Do Da-hae.

39
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,475
Who the hell are you?

40
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,977
-Ms. Do Da-hae?
-Yes.

41
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,897
She's with a client at the moment.

42
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,231
May I ask what this is about?

43
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,524
I have to ask her something.

44
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,779
Mr. Bok.

45
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,243
We need to talk.

46
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,537
Now? But I'm working right…

47
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,711
-Who are you?
-What?

48
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,171
Why are you the only one in color?

49
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,466
-Excuse me?
-Everything else is gray,

50
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,343
but you glow with vivid colors.

51
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,553
And I see you every time I open my eyes.

52
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,679
Why you?

53
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,641
Why can I touch you,
and why do I keep going back to you?

54
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,770
Are you

55
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,022
asking me out?

56
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,692
What a weird way to confess your feelings.

57
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,903
Hold on.

58
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,491
You're the one who should confess.

59
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,077
Something's fishy about you.

60
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,121
Just be honest with me.

61
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,497
About what?

62
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,415
Do you have powers like we do?

63
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,333
Is it hypnosis?

64
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,252
What on earth did you plant in my head?

65
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,966
Is this how you manipulated my mother?

66
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,384
You're out of line, Mr. Bok.

67
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,552
Tell me what you did!

68
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,470
What the hell did you do to me?

69
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,596
I never…

70
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,890
I can answer that.

71
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,769
I'll tell you what's going on.

72
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,443
Ms. Do didn't plant anything in your head

73
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,819
but love.

74
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,572
Love, my foot.

75
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,532
Just move in with us.

76
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:33,327
You can quit your job
at the spa as of today.

77
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,245
Ms. Bok.

78
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,329
Let's keep her close.

79
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,206
-As I-na's tutor.
-What?

80
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,334
Let her help I-na
with her school assignments

81
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,420
and keep her fed.

82
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,297
She can't skip breakfast all the time

83
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,883
and fill up on instant noodles
late at night.

84
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,638
Gwi-ju is a good kid.

85
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:57,101
He just doesn't seem that way
because of the pain in his heart.

86
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:04,734
I thought you could really get to know him
if you lived together.

87
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,739
Why are you so obsessed with Do Da-hae?

88
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,075
She can help us recover what we've lost.

89
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,953
You must be experiencing some changes too.

90
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,955
Have you noticed anything yet?

91
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,541
No.

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,876
No signs at all?

93
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,544
I said no.

94
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,340
Mr. Bok seemed a bit confused.

95
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,382
Just do as I say.

96
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,345
He's not in the right mind
to make sensible decisions.

97
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,931
Sunday at 1 p.m.

98
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,183
The fountain outside the mall you met her.

99
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,643
Why would I meet her?

100
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,894
Aren't you curious?

101
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:45,316
About why Do Da-hae was
wearing the family ring in my dream?

102
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,588
I'm sure she's the reason
my power is back.

103
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,258
Should I keep an eye on her?

104
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,804
It's probably not worth it.

105
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,474
My power is completely useless.

106
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,144
The moment I want to return to

107
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,355
is not a happy one.

108
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,484
The moment I want to return to…

109
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,363
The past I want to change…

110
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,992
Really?

111
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,201
Okay.

112
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,328
Yes, of course.

113
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,663
Okay, bye.

114
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,044
Guys.

115
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,590
I'm going to be a dad.

116
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,216
-What?
-Really?

117
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,926
-That's incredible!
-Congrats!

118
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,011
I'm so happy for you!

119
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,347
Congratulations.

120
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,016
We're so happy for you.

121
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,934
Head over to the hospital.

122
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,603
My gosh.

123
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,937
Hey, newbie.

124
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,733
-I'll fill in for you. Get going.
-You're the best, sir!

125
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,484
Stop it.

126
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,611
Hold on.

127
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,614
Weren't you just on your way home
after your shift?

128
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,783
Wait until that baby's born,
and we'll see how you feel about home.

129
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,495
-Go on. You don't want to miss it.
-Welcome to parenthood.

130
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,875
Let me buy you a meal later.

131
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,834
Screw that.

132
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,210
-I want drinks.
-Drinks?

133
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,339
-I love you.
-Call me.

134
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,632
-We want beef!
-See you!

135
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,050
-Congratulations!
-Call us!

136
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,801
My goodness.

137
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,055
Let's finish up and stand by.

138
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,640
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

139
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,600
Another happy moment

140
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,019
for you to relive over and over again.

141
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,479
Absolutely.

142
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,732
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

143
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,442
or whenever she leaves my side

144
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,736
to hang out with her boyfriend.

145
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,739
Guess you'll be back all the time.

146
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,077
-Do you see me?
-I-na.

147
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,078
Look, she's smiling.

148
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,537
-Really?
-Yes, look.

149
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,039
Look at her.

150
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,219
Rescue team, get your asses up here!

151
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,639
Firefighting team, get inside
and find out where the fire started!

152
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,934
Multiple casualties
at Seonjae Girls' High School.

153
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,103
We've got people to save! Get a move on!

154
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,355
Requesting backup.

155
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,357
Multiple casualties
at Seonjae Girls' High School.

156
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,943
We need backup.

157
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,195
I repeat. We need backup.

158
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,655
The day I became a parent,

159
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,283
dozens of parents lost their children.

160
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,455
And…

161
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,875
Salute!

162
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,132
Proceed!

163
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,970
Don't leave us, honey!

164
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,806
How are we supposed to live now?

165
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,684
You can't leave us behind.

166
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:14,191
You promised you'd
always be there for our son.

167
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,195
No!

168
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,917
Another happy moment

169
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,377
for you to relive over and over again.

170
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,504
Absolutely.

171
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,215
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

172
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,677
or whenever she leaves my side
to hang out with her boyfriend.

173
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,763
Do you see me?

174
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,682
Guess you'll be back all the time.

175
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,809
All the time.

176
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,937
No matter how much time passes,

177
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,731
I'll never let go

178
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,193
of the moment you came to me, I-na.

179
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,073
This is the happiest moment of my life.

180
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,245
Why is this door in color?

181
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,252
I-na, Daddy's here.

182
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,590
I can touch it.

183
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,772
I can hold it.

184
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,068
I-na, Daddy's here.

185
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,028
Look at me.

186
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,911
-I-na.
-Look, she's smiling.

187
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,872
-Really?
-Yes, look.

188
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,331
-She just smiled.
-I-na.

189
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,001
Are you happy to be with Daddy?

190
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,303
Bring the safety cushion!

191
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,894
Multiple casualties
at Seonjae Girls' High School.

192
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,021
We need backup.

193
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,898
I repeat. We need backup.

194
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,680
Senior Firefighter Jeong?

195
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,100
-We're ready.
-Sir!

196
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,185
-The fifth floor is clear.
-One, two, three.

197
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,604
They inhaled too much smoke.

198
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,652
Sir, there's someone
in the fifth-floor storage.

199
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
No.

200
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,697
Fifth-floor storage?

201
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,990
Please help.

202
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,658
Don't go.

203
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,327
Hyeong-jin!

204
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,212
Let's go already!

205
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,021
-Can you walk?
-Grab your gear! Hurry!

206
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,742
Check the situation!

207
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,076
We don't have a clear view!

208
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,202
Get the hydraulics!

209
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,787
-I got it!
-On it!

210
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,456
The building may collapse further!

211
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,291
I don't think we can enter the building!

212
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,126
Check on the injured!

213
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,753
Radio the guys inside!
See if they're okay!

214
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,837
Hold this.

215
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,756
There are still kids in there!

216
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,424
Are you okay?

217
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,025
That moment is special.

218
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,401
I opened a door.

219
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,445
You said you couldn't do anything else.

220
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,158
Maybe I haven't tried everything.

221
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,245
There must be another door I can open.

222
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,124
I might be able to do something.

223
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,502
At least around the time
our daughter was born.

224
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,854
Let's go already!

225
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,947
Let's go already!

226
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,418
Let's go already!

227
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,967
Grab your gear! Hurry!

228
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,161
There must be something I can do.

229
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,292
There must be something I can touch.

230
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,470
But in the end,

231
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,806
there was nothing I could do.

232
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,824
Fire reported.

233
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,202
Fire reported at Dongnam Market.

234
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,497
All units respond immediately.

235
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,540
Fire reported.

236
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,335
Fire reported at Dongnam Market.

237
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,088
All units respond immediately.

238
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,548
Fire reported.

239
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,468
Fire reported at Dongnam Market.

240
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,429
All units respond immediately.

241
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,643
Where's the newbie?

242
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,105
He was just here.

243
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,982
Where the hell did he go now?

244
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,024
Should we go without him?

245
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,860
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

246
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,698
Another happy moment

247
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,117
for you to relive over and over again.

248
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,660
Absolutely.

249
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,080
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

250
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,834
or whenever she leaves my side
to hang out with her boyfriend.

251
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,174
I'm here again.

252
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,592
Get it together!

253
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,095
You're putting your colleagues in danger

254
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,097
by disappearing whenever you please!

255
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,016
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,020
Gwi-ju.

257
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,816
I know you're grieving over Jeong's death,
but it's time to let it go.

258
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,656
But that moment

259
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,117
won't let me go.

260
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,410
What?

261
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,828
I try not to think about it,

262
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,165
but I find myself in that moment
in the blink of an eye.

263
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,293
I keep seeing the kids in danger

264
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,714
and Senior Firefighter Jeong
jumping into the fire.

265
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,344
I have to live through that
over and over again.

266
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,222
But no matter what I do,

267
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,100
there's absolutely nothing I can do.

268
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,519
I don't know why
I keep getting dragged into it.

269
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,481
I don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to do!

270
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,485
It's driving me insane.

271
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,323
Take some time off and see a therapist.

272
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,075
Either that,

273
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,701
or find another line of work.

274
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,462
I could no longer save anyone

275
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,256
in the past or the present.

276
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,011
Daddy.

277
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,521
Where did Daddy go now?

278
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,856
He probably went to I-na.

279
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,944
Is there another I-na?

280
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,238
Does he like her better than me?

281
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,492
It's not like that.

282
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,126
Daddy has a special power.

283
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,294
And he wants to use it

284
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,381
to help other people.

285
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,510
Like a superhero?

286
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,345
Is he saving people?

287
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,596
Yes.

288
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,349
Come here.

289
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,133
Even after several years,

290
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,180
I was still stuck in this moment.

291
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,432
I don't think we can enter the building!

292
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,267
Check on the injured!

293
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,394
Radio the guys inside!
See if they're okay!

294
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,367
Where are we going, Mommy?

295
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,329
To the zoo.

296
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,249
Let's all hold hands
and have cotton candy together.

297
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,960
That means all three.

298
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,129
Don't disappear again.

299
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,048
It's not like I want to.

300
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,968
-You know that.
-It's because you just can't let go

301
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,262
of the people you couldn't save.

302
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,682
If you disappear today,

303
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm leaving with I-na.

304
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,104
What?

305
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,212
Another happy moment

306
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,881
for you to relive over and over again.

307
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,091
Absolutely.

308
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,803
The best moment of my life
and the worst are one and the same.

309
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,515
How weird is that?

310
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,269
Guess you'll be back all the time.

311
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,937
All the time.

312
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,189
No matter how much time passes,

313
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,608
I'll never let go…

314
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,610
There must be something
different about this moment.

315
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,779
Once I find the reason,

316
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,239
I might stop being dragged into it.

317
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,740
It's been seven years.

318
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,118
You didn't get anything done

319
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,453
in the past or in the present.

320
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,540
Is there a single happy moment
besides that one

321
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,917
that you can go back to?

322
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,380
If you're going to disappear today,

323
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,424
don't bother coming back.

324
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,134
I won't be here when you do.

325
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,068
Se-yeon.

326
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,946
Se-yeon!

327
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,197
-Daddy.
-I-na.

328
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,366
Daddy is here.

329
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,701
Mom…

330
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,703
Se-yeon.

331
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,748
What the hell happened?

332
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,340
Please talk to me, Se-yeon.

333
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,992
Just keep pushing forward.

334
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,204
If he can't even remember
holding your hand,

335
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,538
he's not in his right mind.

336
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,750
Neither is Ms. Bok,
with that precognitive dream nonsense.

337
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,543
And thank god for that.

338
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,338
"The Bok family
exhibits signs of mental illnesses

339
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,591
that affect their judgment
and administrative capabilities,

340
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,511
which could pose
significant financial risks."

341
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,179
"Therefore,

342
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,600
Do Da-hae, Bok Gwi-ju's spouse
and Bok Man-huem's daughter-in-law,

343
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,977
shall manage their assets

344
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,605
as their legal guardian."

345
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,733
We can't settle for
a 50-billion-won building.

346
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,826
Let's bleed them dry.

347
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,799
It won't be easy
to be appointed as the guardian.

348
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,884
Make sure you get enough evidence.

349
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:55,942
Do Da-hae?

350
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,652
Wait.

351
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,405
Why are you here?

352
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,282
I tried to be brave.

353
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,825
Since you

354
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,535
let me into your heart.

355
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,287
What?

356
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,538
Hello.

357
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,790
-Welcome.
-How have you been?

358
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,875
Good. Good to see you.

359
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,836
Welcome, Ms. Do.

360
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,380
You brought flowers. Thank you.

361
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,882
I'm sorry.

362
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:23,762
Your son actually got me these.

363
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,055
I did?

364
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,807
He did?

365
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,518
He takes after me. He's a real romantic.

366
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,187
-Is that true?
-No.

367
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,607
Yes, it is.
You're finally back to your old self.

368
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,775
No, I'm not!

369
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,236
I've never gotten her flowers

370
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,030
or asked her to move in.

371
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,162
What are you talking about?

372
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,663
Have you been drinking?

373
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,208
Wash up and pull yourself together.

374
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,710
We need to talk.

375
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,174
She just won't listen.

376
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,842
I told her to run.

377
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,846
What is this about?

378
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,017
What the hell was that?

379
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,144
Why are you lying?

380
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,729
Lying?

381
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,732
I gave you those flowers? When?

382
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,691
Where?

383
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,236
At the fountain.

384
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,279
Don't you remember?

385
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,198
Don't be ridiculous.

386
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,450
I never even went close to you that day.

387
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,660
What?

388
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,288
As far as I remember,
we were pretty close that day.

389
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,792
You hugged me.

390
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,421
I hugged you?

391
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,173
Me?

392
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,133
Wow.

393
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,719
Seriously?

394
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,515
After you held me so tight?

395
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,725
Are you denying it

396
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,019
like you denied holding my hand?

397
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,608
Are you saying you're telling the truth?

398
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,734
Just like last time?

399
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,194
What is your deal?

400
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,281
Why do you keep denying what you did?

401
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,075
What do you have to gain
by making me out to be a liar?

402
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,586
What the…

403
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,091
No way.

404
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,887
Was it my future self again?

405
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,891
I thought he had made up his mind.

406
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,143
He's just embarrassed.

407
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,895
Don't let it bother you.

408
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,522
-Let's eat.
-Dig in.

409
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,107
Thank you.

410
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,025
You're welcome.

411
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,693
I whipped up what I could.

412
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,737
I hope you like it.

413
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,948
It's really good.

414
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,913
I-na.

415
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,040
Say hello.

416
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,958
She'll be living with us from now on.

417
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,678
Put your phone away once in a while.

418
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,139
Your glasses are so thick already.

419
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,975
You don't want your eyesight
to get any worse.

420
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,894
Can't you hear me?

421
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,270
She can't.

422
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,819
You know I-na is a bit slow, don't you?

423
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,406
She's not exceptional in any way.

424
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,325
Everyone else in the Bok family

425
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,078
is extraordinary in some way.

426
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,456
She's only 13 years old.

427
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,793
She just needs a grown-up
who can bring out her potential.

428
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,421
I might have a superpower after all.

429
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:48,967
I'm invisible.

430
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,803
No one talks to me at school.

431
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,554
So you heard everything?

432
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,348
See you.

433
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,892
I-na, have some breakfast.

434
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,144
I-na!

435
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,987
Being invisible isn't all that bad.

436
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,030
Hey, it's Jun-woo.

437
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,574
He's so handsome as usual.

438
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,742
Right?

439
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,911
I guess he's pretty good-looking.

440
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,296
I can spy on someone

441
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,882
without anyone finding out.

442
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,137
-No one even notices that I'm--
-I-na.

443
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,473
Why do you keep spying on people?

444
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,227
I saw you watching our practice.

445
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,311
It was you, right?

446
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,940
Are you interested in
joining the dance club?

447
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,485
The thing is,
we need more dancers for our show.

448
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,320
You should join us.

449
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,826
Hey, I'm talking to you.

450
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,619
Look at me.

451
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,455
Your eyesight must be really bad.

452
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,456
Such thick glasses.

453
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,291
-Can I try them on?
-Stop it!

454
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,929
Please don't touch my glasses.

455
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,832
-Coming through.
-Excuse me.

456
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,459
Move out of the way.

457
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,756
Please check her makeup.

458
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,549
Let me touch up your makeup.

459
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,759
Hurry.

460
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,431
Go. Stand by.

461
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,977
Go. Stand by.

462
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,691
Go. Stand by.

463
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,824
Go.

464
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,410
Are you okay?

465
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,678
Good work.

466
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,263
-I'll call you later.
-Good work.

467
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,682
-Great job, Dong-hee.
-You were amazing.

468
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,850
-See you.
-Great job.

469
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,101
-See you.
-Good work.

470
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,729
Thank you.

471
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,813
Ms. Bok.

472
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,231
Hello, sir.

473
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,399
Congratulations on your debut.

474
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,654
It was as if you were
floating on the runway.

475
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,947
Thank you.

476
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,157
Great job.

477
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,941
I'm Bok Dong-hee!

478
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,952
What the…

479
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,797
No.

480
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,590
No!

481
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,509
No.

482
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:25,886
No.

483
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,948
-Who is it?
-I'm your realtor.

484
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,700
-I brought some potential buyers.
-What?

485
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,452
-Come on in.
-Wait.

486
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,288
Hold on a second.

487
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,582
She said to sell it as soon as possible.
Didn't you know?

488
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,667
What? That's news to me.

489
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,502
You should contact the owner.

490
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,796
Here's the living room.
The kitchen is that way.

491
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,506
Mom!

492
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,634
Are you short on money, Mom?

493
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,597
Where's this coming from?

494
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,683
Please excuse us. This is a family matter.

495
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,436
Ms. Do is one of us now.

496
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,646
I'll give you some space.

497
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,192
Wait.

498
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,509
You let her move in just like that?

499
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,802
They're going to live together?

500
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,096
She's here to take care of I-na.

501
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,390
Who cares about the reason?

502
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,393
This family really is doomed.

503
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,021
And why did you put my apartment
up for sale without telling me?

504
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,564
And why the hurry?

505
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,902
Would you rather see
the gym building get auctioned off?

506
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,153
What do you mean?

507
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,782
Are we that pressed for money?

508
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,035
You don't have to worry.

509
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,663
I started having dreams again.

510
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,041
Just a touch from Da-hae
is enough to put me to sleep.

511
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:19,959
Hold on.

512
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,293
See?

513
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,671
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

514
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,715
Money will start pouring in soon.

515
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,301
Mom, what about real estate?

516
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,262
What happened to our properties?

517
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,222
Did all our stocks tank too?

518
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,808
Wait.

519
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,727
Did you invest in crypto?

520
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,813
Go away. I'm trying to sleep.

521
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,190
Where am I supposed to go?

522
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,402
I'm about to lose my home.

523
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,113
Darn it.

524
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,291
Mom?

525
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,754
Are you asleep?

526
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,913
Will I really go back in time

527
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,915
for Do Da-hae?

528
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,000
I got a voice recording that says

529
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,461
Ms. Bok caused
financial damage to her family.

530
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,962
The problem is,

531
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,131
the damage is more significant
than we thought.

532
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,426
We better look out
for the supernatural family.

533
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,973
So she's the one who'll change me?

534
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,310
I find that hard to believe right now.

535
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,772
Supernatural, my foot.

536
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,398
Let's speed things up.

537
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,420
Dinner's ready.

538
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,258
Come and eat.

539
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,849
-You should stay for dinner.
-I'm on a diet.

540
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,565
Are you heading out?

541
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,649
Yes.

542
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,193
I have free time for once.

543
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,280
-I'm sorry.
-See you later.

544
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,291
You're home.

545
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,084
Come and have dinner.

546
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,640
I can't seem to get I-na to eat.

547
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,767
What does she like?

548
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,811
Are you planning
to win her over with food?

549
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,023
She's not interested in food.

550
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,108
She's not interested in people either.

551
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,235
So how do you think she feels

552
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,446
about eating with people?

553
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,657
Sitting around the table,

554
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,659
sharing food with family,

555
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,203
and asking about each other's day?

556
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,455
We're not that kind of family.

557
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,250
You don't know, do you?

558
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,086
What kind of food she likes.

559
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,389
Good grief.

560
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,243
Give them back.

561
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,162
You have such pretty eyes.

562
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,748
Why are you covering them?

563
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,459
Do you shoot lasers out of them?

564
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,294
Is that your superpower?

565
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,171
Give them back right now.

566
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,594
You're not invisible.

567
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,431
You just act like
everyone around you is invisible.

568
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,402
Wait a second.

569
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,571
Give me exactly 30 seconds.

570
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,908
And you can have these back.

571
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,998
Stay still.

572
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,337
Come on. I won't hurt you.

573
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,550
It's been 30 seconds.

574
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,260
Yes, ma'am.

575
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,017
You're done.

576
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,563
Ta-da. Have a look.

577
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,277
See? You're not invisible at all.

578
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,237
You could really stand out.

579
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,953
Stop covering your eyes.

580
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,621
The eyes are the window

581
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,206
to the soul.

582
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,418
That's exactly why I cover mine.

583
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,419
I don't like that.

584
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,592
That makes sense.

585
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,263
Knowing what others think
can be pretty scary.

586
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,851
But the more you avoid them,
the scarier it'll get.

587
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,395
Once you look, it's not that bad.

588
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,356
You might even discover something good

589
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,150
in people's eyes.

590
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,390
I knew it.

591
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,642
You hold the key.

592
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,565
You mean the key
to the 50-billion-won building?

593
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,735
What…

594
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,154
did you just say?

595
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,297
Is she a psychic or something?

596
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,433
Hey, wait.

597
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,811
Are you wearing makeup?

598
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,354
No.

599
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,273
You can't fool me. You look different.

600
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,234
Okay, I got it.

601
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,236
You got your eyebrows done.

602
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,238
Did you do them yourself?

603
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,490
They look great.

604
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,994
Don't be shy. Let me have a closer look.

605
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,458
Sorry.

606
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,962
I'd rather be invisible.

607
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,885
It's dangerous to stand out.

608
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,232
I don't have any glasses to hide behind.

609
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,539
She's right.

610
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,708
You look different.

611
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,960
Don't look me in the eye.

612
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,718
She's pretty.

613
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,473
You're Bok I-na, right?

614
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:55,891
What?

615
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,352
Yes.

616
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,772
I heard you joined the club.

617
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,689
What?

618
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:04,691
Yes.

619
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,861
I see why you're so touchy
about your glasses.

620
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,905
You seem so lost

621
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,782
without them.

622
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,751
Hey, I-na.

623
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,878
Does this mean you'll join our club?

624
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,714
You made the right choice.

625
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,096
Did I lose weight
because of all the stress?

626
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,981
I barely lost any.

627
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,608
You're right.

628
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,235
I'm surprised.

629
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,738
You seem awfully interested
in my body weight.

630
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,948
It's my job.

631
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,659
Hey, why don't you work out with me?

632
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,869
I'll give you a discount
since you're Mr. Bok's family.

633
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,206
Come on.

634
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,338
Hi, babe.

635
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,550
Let's have a nice dinner tonight.

636
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,468
-It's my cheat day.
-I have surgery.

637
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,012
Surgery?

638
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,348
Right.

639
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,517
That's too bad.

640
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,519
Bye.

641
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,404
Hey, it's me.

642
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:37,451
About that lady you told me about
who has connections everywhere.

643
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,618
Can I meet her tonight?

644
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,123
I made a dinner reservation at
the French restaurant at Emporium Hotel.

645
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,709
Of course it's my treat.

646
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,714
Did you enjoy your food, ma'am?

647
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,716
-I did.
-I loved it, Dong-hee.

648
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,800
Really?

649
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,595
But now I feel bad.

650
00:50:56,678 --> 00:51:01,099
Maybe we should visit your clinic
with a few of our golf buddies.

651
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,477
That would be amazing.

652
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,354
Please do.

653
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,942
Dr. Jo will make sure you can smile
without worrying about wrinkles.

654
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,235
Can he really do that?

655
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,945
-Trust me.
-Of course.

656
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,697
You're beautiful as you are though.

657
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,119
I have something on my face.

658
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,174
-Will you see them off for me?
-Sure.

659
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,469
Ma'am, I need to use the restroom.

660
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,179
Please excuse me.

661
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,472
See you at the clinic.

662
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,517
-See you.
-Okay, good night.

663
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,760
Let's go in.

664
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,138
Let me think for a second.

665
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,974
It was your idea.

666
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,017
What's there to think about?

667
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,773
I like girls who act without thinking.

668
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,316
What?

669
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,631
Wait a minute.

670
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,759
What the hell?

671
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,346
-Why would she just leave?
-What?

672
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,304
I packed all your stuff.

673
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,388
Take it.

674
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,390
Are you moving back home?

675
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,975
Just for the time being.

676
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,560
I need some cash.

677
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,522
While we're at it,

678
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,942
why don't we take a break too?

679
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,527
What?

680
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,196
To be honest,

681
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,697
I miss when you were lighter.

682
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,450
And I'm not talking about your weight.

683
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,660
I'm talking about your heart

684
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,662
and soul.

685
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,039
I was your fan when you were a model.

686
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,290
Remember?

687
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,168
Nothing in this world
could weigh you down.

688
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,295
How should I put this?

689
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,631
That's right.

690
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,050
It was as if you had wings.

691
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,224
I think I might have done this to you,

692
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,101
and it pains me.

693
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:37,148
That's one way of saying
that you're bailing out

694
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,485
because this relationship
doesn't seem beneficial to you.

695
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,863
Way to beat around the bush.

696
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,991
Come on. That's absurd.

697
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,617
I just feel bad

698
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,162
that you're losing yourself
while trying to accommodate me.

699
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,748
I'm giving you a chance
to take care of yourself.

700
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,208
It's all for your sake.

701
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,007
As you said, let's take a break.

702
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,051
Please leave now.

703
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,221
I have to hurry
if I want to salvage anything

704
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,681
from that sinking ship.

705
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,164
Dinner's ready.

706
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,879
Dinner's ready, everyone.

707
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,122
What were you holding that for?

708
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,874
Is that a fireplace poker?

709
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,542
Did you make it yourself?

710
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,565
Are you scared of fire?

711
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,736
I had a bit of a…

712
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,240
bad experience with it.

713
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,741
So why use the stove to cook?

714
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,743
No one's going to eat anyway.

715
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,496
Don't families usually…

716
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,667
share a meal around a table
at least once a day?

717
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,545
But then again,

718
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,964
I haven't had a family for so long.

719
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,994
Should I prepare a new batch of stew?

720
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,704
You don't have to try so hard.

721
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,832
As I said,

722
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,502
we're not the kind of family
that sits around a table to break bread.

723
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,632
I asked her to make it.

724
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,436
Sorry.

725
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,230
I messed up the stew.

726
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,737
It's fine. I like these too.

727
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,478
Enjoy.

728
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,230
Enjoy, I-na.

729
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,678
I gave her those flowers?

730
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,555
I mean,

731
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,931
I'm going to give her those?

732
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,766
They were in full bloom when I got them.

733
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,726
They're wilting so quickly.

734
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,020
That's why people

735
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,523
buy ones that haven't fully bloomed,

736
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,734
but that's like sacrificing
the present for the future.

737
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,196
I felt like you gifted me the present.

738
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,323
I liked that.

739
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,913
Ms. Bok only thinks
that I'm the one who saved you,

740
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,083
-but you saved me too.
-Did I?

741
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,130
You let me…

742
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,008
into your family.

743
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,492
Well…

744
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,661
I actually…

745
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,954
That's what family is for.

746
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,418
We have each other's backs.

747
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,917
I can only return to the moments

748
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,127
I spent with Do Da-hae.

749
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,173
She's the only one

750
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,801
who can see me.

751
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,392
She's the only one I can touch.

752
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:32,563
However…

753
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,440
I'm…

754
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,777
Good evening. Would you like some flowers?

755
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,278
I'm not

756
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,489
ready yet.

757
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,372
You can't get those later.

758
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,874
They'll be out of season soon.

759
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,668
I'll give you a discount.

760
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,296
So it's now or never?

761
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,715
They're yours for 10,000 won.

762
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,145
Jeez, I'm never coming back here.

763
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,856
I thought this was a wealthy neighborhood.

764
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,692
Why is he hesitating over 10,000 won?

765
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,156
Do you want them or not?

766
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,825
Where did he go?

767
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,369
What?

768
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,955
Where did he go?

769
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,165
Did he steal them?

770
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,985
Do Da-hae may really be

771
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,612
the only one

772
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,114
who can save I-na and me.

773
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:03,714
But there's only one way I can save her.

774
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,478
It's by pushing her away

775
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,814
as far as I can.

776
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,093
You made it.

777
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,269
I'm not giving her these.

778
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,563
And I won't hug her

779
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,024
no matter what.

780
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,611
Listen.

781
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,363
I can't save…

782
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,244
My head is killing me.

783
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,747
Do you have a headache?

784
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,125
-Would you like a cup of tea?
-Sounds good.

785
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,711
Where's my husband?

786
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,963
He stepped out for a bit.

787
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,007
I want some tea too.

788
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,134
Good evening.

789
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,971
I'm moving back in.

790
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:59,348
Like it or not.

791
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:02,309
Of course I do. Welcome back.

792
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,478
I'll get you some tea. Just a moment.

793
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,484
I'll just take this cup.

794
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,486
That's for your mother!

795
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,580
Did you put something in it?

796
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,124
Sorry?

797
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,047
I was wondering how you got her to sleep.

798
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,965
It must have been sleeping pills.

799
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:37,011
You'll be in serious trouble
if she finds out.

800
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,075
Look.

801
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:03,079
I just wanted to get you some hot tea.

802
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,038
Right.

803
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,502
Let me get you a saucer.

804
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,098
Here you go.

805
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,747
Don't fall asleep.

806
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:05,683
Don't fall asleep.

807
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,318
Is there anything expensive here?

808
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,613
Something no one will miss.

809
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,123
Let's see.

810
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,586
Ms. Bok Dong-hee,
you've pocketed family assets

811
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,297
behind your mentally unwell
mother and brother's backs.

812
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:22,176
I'm sorry, but you're disqualified
from being their legal guardian.

813
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,493
Nothing here.

814
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,664
Not here.

815
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,750
Not here either.

816
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:57,730
Who was that?

817
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,899
Who's there?

818
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:10,534
She's a ghost.

819
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:14,371
This house is haunted.

820
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:24,590
Are you okay?

821
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,096
Well…

822
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,228
What's wrong?

823
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,051
Hold on.

824
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:11,428
Let me just…

825
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:15,349
Excuse me.

826
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,904
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

827
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:02,438
One of two things happens
when people find out about our powers.

828
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,941
They either run away
or take advantage of us.

829
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,902
I'll show you what kind of person I am.

830
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,572
Slowly, but surely.

831
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,407
Please show me every single detail.

832
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,451
I can see why Jun-woo is so into you.

833
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,245
You're really my first.

834
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,165
Guess what I hate hearing the most.

835
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:25,752
It was an ominous dream.

836
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,255
Love has to come first

837
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,049
for us to reach

838
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,385
the future you talked about.

839
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:39,391
