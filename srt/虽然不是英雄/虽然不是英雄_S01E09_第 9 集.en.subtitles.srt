1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,775
Gwi-ju!

3
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,614
The haze that kept fogging up my dreams

4
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,908
turned out to be smoke.

5
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,160
And you were there.

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,703
Is this the same dream

7
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,580
where you saw the ring?

8
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,040
Stay away from Do Da-hae.

9
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,833
There will be a fire.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,418
A huge one.

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,715
Don't worry about that fire.

12
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,926
It was put out a long time ago.

13
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,809
This is the ring she had.

14
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,479
Yes.

15
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,731
She stole it from the safe.

16
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,233
No, she didn't.

17
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,401
The ring was in the safe.

18
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,654
It has been all along.

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,993
They're identical.

20
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,996
-Down to the finest scratches.
-But…

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,998
how is this possible?

22
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,209
Where could she have gotten this?

23
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,378
From the person who saved her life.

24
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,839
Thirteen years ago.

25
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,383
Thirteen years ago?

26
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,011
The fire you saw in your dream
was at Seonjae Girls' High School.

27
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,638
No way.

28
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,765
I've never seen the past in my dreams.

29
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,809
It may be her past,

30
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,687
but it's my future.

31
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,026
I saved Do Da-hae in her past

32
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,821
and I will in my future.

33
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,072
Are you saying

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,493
that you're destined
to save her from that fire?

35
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,412
Don't worry.

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,706
Da-hae is alive and well.

37
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,291
That's the proof

38
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,793
that I'll survive the fire.

39
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,680
It's all in the past.

40
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,098
The fire's out.

41
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,657
This is the Bok family ring.

42
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,536
I'm the one who gave you this ring.

43
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,204
But…

44
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,665
that was just a lie.

45
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,583
It wasn't a lie.

46
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,210
At least not to me.

47
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,968
Two identical rings.

48
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,348
Do Da-hae only had the ring

49
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,351
because Gwi-ju brought it to her
from the future?

50
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,604
Does that mean

51
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,399
Gwi-ju is destined
to go back in time and save her?

52
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,946
The door in his past
must have been his way to Da-hae.

53
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,576
Their wedding fell through,
but their bond remains unbroken.

54
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,455
Their fates were intertwined 13 years ago.

55
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,998
Together,

56
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,836
they might actually get
the Bok family back on its feet!

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,879
The lottery ticket.

58
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,402
You're late, and you came empty-handed.

59
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,115
I thought the two billion won in cash
was slowing you down.

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,250
First prize.

61
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,544
Worth 2.3 billion won.

62
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,431
The number you are trying…

63
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,455
Honey.

64
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,833
When did you wake up?

65
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,774
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

66
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,407
That's the stuff.

67
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,951
We haven't worked together in forever.

68
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,579
I feel like I'm in my golden days again.

69
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,415
-Don't you think so?
-Absolutely.

70
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,416
By the way,

71
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,045
where did you find this idiot?

72
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,672
How did he get his hands on this
all of a sudden?

73
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,299
What's his secret?

74
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,969
Although,

75
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,722
this falls a bit short.

76
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,558
Because after taxes,

77
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,311
this is far less than the two billion
that he promised.

78
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,648
It's just a bit iffy, that's all.

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,441
Yes.

80
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,777
It is a bit iffy.

81
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,206
We're just friends who dance together.

82
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,959
-There's nothing more--
-Do you think I'm stupid?

83
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,337
If that's true,
how come I'm being sent such pictures?

84
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,048
Ms. Shin's husband, that bastard…

85
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,220
He blackmailed me.

86
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,097
And he sent you those pictures

87
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,516
even though I paid up like he told me to.

88
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,643
You paid him?

89
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,895
With what money?

90
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,480
The lottery ticket.

91
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,983
Did you take it?

92
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,697
I didn't want to get you
involved in this mess.

93
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,449
You've lived

94
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,534
such a sheltered life.

95
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,536
You've fooled me all this time.

96
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,705
Stop pretending you care about me.

97
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,542
Honey.

98
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,962
I'm sorry I kept my hobby from you.

99
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,088
But listen.

100
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,759
I spent a lifetime helping you
make your dreams come true.

101
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,887
Don't I deserve

102
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,307
a small dream of my own?

103
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,892
When did it begin?

104
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,228
-It hasn't been so long.
-Was it

105
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,356
after I stopped having dreams?

106
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,234
Well, that's not exactly…

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,737
You knew there was no way
I could dream about you,

108
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,448
so you thought
you could fool me completely.

109
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,410
I trusted you to have my back
while I was asleep.

110
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,747
All I could see was darkness,
with my eyes open or closed.

111
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,708
I could never be awake or asleep.

112
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,627
Even when I was going through hell,

113
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,004
I trusted you and tried to sleep.

114
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,174
-Honey.
-You stabbed me in the back

115
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,470
when I was at my lowest!

116
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,731
You're right.

117
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,234
I'll be honest.

118
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,989
I always felt like you were watching
every move I made.

119
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,742
You always knew
what would happen in my life

120
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,244
before I ever found out.

121
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,872
I had to keep my distance
from everyone I met

122
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,708
because I had to protect
the family's secret.

123
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,337
It was suffocating

124
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,756
to be in the palm of your hand.

125
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,301
I thought we shared

126
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,513
the same dream.

127
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,933
But you felt suffocated the whole time?

128
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,978
Well, you're free now.

129
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,856
Get out of the palm of my hand.

130
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,991
-Are you serious?
-Start packing!

131
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,647
I'm done packing.

132
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,716
Grandpa?

133
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,853
Where are you going?

134
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,817
I'm going on a short trip.

135
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,709
Go to bed.

136
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,379
And cut down on instant noodles.

137
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,733
Oh.

138
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,485
"Oh"? Is that all you've got?

139
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,197
It's dazzling and sexy. It's sizzling.

140
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,449
Hot!

141
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,290
What is this doing here?

142
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,126
What?

143
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,961
Does it seem familiar?

144
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,640
I assumed Ms. Bok had a lucky dream,

145
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,476
but it was a golden egg
you and Gwi-ju had together, wasn't it?

146
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,314
That's my girl. Great job.

147
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,025
Impressive.

148
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,986
You never disappoint, Mom.

149
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,240
How did you do it?

150
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:27,079
I told you I'd be here to help
if you ever got soft.

151
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,471
Where's Dad?

152
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,181
On a trip, apparently.

153
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,183
By himself?

154
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,853
Hey, Ji-han.

155
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,898
Of course I'm ready.

156
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,399
See you in a bit.

157
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,156
I shouldn't eat.

158
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,214
He's not on a trip.

159
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,091
Where is he then?

160
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,521
You got played by Mom.

161
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,439
She took the money,

162
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,235
and she got rid of the pillar
that supported your family.

163
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,154
Do you get it now?

164
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,908
You put your family in grave danger
by trying to save me.

165
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,910
Your sister

166
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,995
and even I-na

167
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,748
are in my mom's crosshairs.

168
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,210
Do you still want to save me?

169
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,420
How did that lottery ticket
end up at my house?

170
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,798
You should have paid her back and left.

171
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,216
It's not that easy.

172
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,344
She knows keeping us together
will get her golden eggs.

173
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,430
As long as we're together,

174
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,766
she won't let go of you or your family.

175
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,186
Are you still going to

176
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,564
go back in time and save me?

177
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:18,983
Why?

178
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,570
You want to put your family ring
on my finger?

179
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,906
No.

180
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,992
You don't have to do that.

181
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,703
-But…
-The rings just look alike.

182
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,706
I don't remember much about him,

183
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,750
but he had a red spot
on the back of his neck.

184
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,253
You're not the one…

185
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,339
who saved me.

186
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,261
You should save your family, not me.

187
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,847
Your father is just the beginning.

188
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,933
He wasn't my mom's final target.

189
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,477
He was just the first step
toward the real target.

190
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,150
Her real target

191
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,820
is the one who can get
golden eggs in her dreams.

192
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,448
It's your mother.

193
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,135
Let me explain.

194
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,638
The understanding of psychology
and empathy is a must

195
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,224
to keep up with the future
in this rapidly changing society.

196
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,936
I aim to combine science and humanities

197
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,813
to create brand-new values in this world,

198
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,400
and I'd like to invite you
on this journey, ma'am.

199
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,153
Mom.

200
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,446
Mom.

201
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,822
Are you listening?

202
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,910
My head is killing me.

203
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,622
Ji-han is an expert in his field.

204
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,791
His explanation must have been
hard to keep up.

205
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,501
Did I go in too deep?

206
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,712
To sum it up,

207
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,716
we have a comprehensive perception
of the consumers of the beauty market

208
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,052
-with a future-oriented--
-Here's the deal.

209
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,345
Simply put,

210
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,931
we'll have all kinds of
beauty services you can imagine,

211
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,850
such as plastic surgery,
cosmetics, spa, gym, and diet food.

212
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,311
Everything you need to be beautiful…

213
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,188
Crammed into one building?

214
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,526
We actually prefer to call it

215
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,903
a hybrid smart-care solution--

216
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,740
And where do you plan on executing
that grand plan of yours?

217
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,540
In the gym building.

218
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,127
You said it'd be mine when I got married.

219
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,004
He cheated on you.

220
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,673
With Grace, Jennifer,
or whatever her name is.

221
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,261
Who?

222
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,973
Right, Grace.

223
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,144
I only met her a few times
to promote my clinic.

224
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,148
Has Dong-hee told you
what runs in our family?

225
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,360
-Pardon?
-You haven't earned her trust, have you?

226
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,240
Even the man I trusted
to share my dreams with my whole life

227
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,743
turned out to have different priorities.

228
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,203
I'm surrounded by frauds

229
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,539
inside and outside of the family.

230
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,707
What?

231
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,958
Me?

232
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,468
Will you wait outside, Ji-han?

233
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,604
You're out of line, Mom.

234
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,149
Your dad already gave me a headache.

235
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,442
Don't make it worse.

236
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,485
What did he do?

237
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,698
He's not really on a trip, is he?

238
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,867
Makes sense.

239
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,411
He must've been desperate
for some breathing room.

240
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,871
I get him 200%.

241
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,372
What?

242
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,625
Everyone tiptoes around you
because of your dreams.

243
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,460
How do you not know that?

244
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,715
I even gave up on my own dream
just to live yours.

245
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,093
You gave up on your dream because of me?

246
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,095
Have you forgotten?

247
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,931
How you stepped all over my dream?

248
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,434
You told me to drop everything
and get married.

249
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,063
You told me to have a grandchild
to pass down our legacy.

250
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,608
I'm realizing your outdated dream,
so keep your end of the bargain.

251
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,276
You promised me 50 billion won.

252
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,321
Why do you think
I'm working my butt off to lose weight?

253
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,740
Have you even lost weight?

254
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,914
You don't even see me, do you?

255
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,624
Dong-hee!

256
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,251
I'll make your dream come true.

257
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,586
I'll start a family,

258
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,713
just like you wanted.

259
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,758
Then I'll finally be free from your grasp.

260
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,069
PAST DUE NOTICE

261
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,863
PAST DUE REMINDER

262
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,636
Excuse me, ma'am.

263
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,388
You haven't paid.

264
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,223
Sorry?

265
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,225
I mean…

266
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,354
Did that swindler leave without paying?

267
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,866
Your credit card won't go through.

268
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,035
Do you have another one?

269
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,873
Here, use this one.

270
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,130
Fancy seeing you here.

271
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,049
I was meeting some friends here.

272
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,137
My goodness.

273
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,097
Have you been losing sleep again?

274
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,226
You look awful. Are you all right?

275
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,037
The number you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

276
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,456
Please leave a message after the tone.

277
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,199
PURPLE DISCO

278
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,839
She used to pretend to be so innocent.

279
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,853
Sorry, I didn't see you.

280
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,770
Are you okay?

281
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,314
You should look where you're going.

282
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,815
Watch her flip out again.

283
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,942
Just like she did with Hye-rim.

284
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,987
Seriously? That's so scary.

285
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,324
She has a guy who looks like a thug
watching her back.

286
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,701
-How does she know a thug?
-Is it her dad?

287
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,995
Is her dad a gangster?

288
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,667
Where are you going?

289
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,420
Stop teasing her, guys.

290
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,504
Enough is enough.

291
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,131
Are you okay, I-na?

292
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,260
Are you okay, Hye-rim?

293
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,470
There she goes again.

294
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,097
-She's crazy.
-You should go to the nurse's office.

295
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,023
Hello, sir.

296
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,652
Sorry?

297
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,699
I-na is missing?

298
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,576
She left the school without permission.

299
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,286
Have you called her?

300
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,746
Her phone's turned off.

301
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,998
-What?
-It's broken.

302
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,335
It's broken, not turned off.

303
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,045
Her phone.

304
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,048
First, her glasses break,

305
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,383
and now, it's her phone?

306
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,220
No way.

307
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,806
Is she being bullied?

308
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,560
I know a few places she might be.

309
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,982
Welcome.

310
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,320
I heard she had malatang with her friends.

311
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,489
Instant noodles are the best
for solo dining.

312
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,866
"Solo dining"?

313
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,369
It means eating alone.

314
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,663
You know that, don't you?

315
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,460
Hi, can I ask you something?

316
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,546
-How long have you been tailing her?
-Have you seen her?

317
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,880
You're her dad.

318
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,258
-This is something you should know.
-I'm not sure.

319
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,968
Thank you.

320
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,029
I need a pick-me-up.

321
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,468
-Welcome.
-Hello.

322
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,846
I need to ask you something.

323
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,725
-Have you seen this girl?
-I-na's favorite is dirty iced tea.

324
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,853
Dirty iced tea?

325
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,355
Iced tea with a shot of espresso.

326
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,233
But she's too young for caffeine.

327
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,737
Does she hang out with kids
who act like adults?

328
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,780
She's usually alone.

329
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,396
What does I-na usually do here?

330
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,192
Does she ride a bike or something?

331
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,070
She doesn't know how to ride.

332
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,951
She plays with her phone.

333
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,494
Alone.

334
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,874
She hides behind her phone

335
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,334
to avoid eye contact.

336
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,506
She's probably hiding somewhere right now.

337
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,259
This was the last place I could think of.

338
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,847
Could it be the sauna lady's doing?

339
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,352
I'll check the sauna.

340
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,781
You should check your home.

341
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,992
She might have come back.

342
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,015
Is someone in there?

343
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,391
She's a VIP.

344
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,020
Was it you?

345
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,230
Where did you find her?

346
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,024
Picked her up on the street.

347
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,359
What are you planning?

348
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,778
She just fell asleep.

349
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,573
Get out of the way.

350
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,672
What is she doing here?

351
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,466
Is she really asleep?

352
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,094
She was severely sleep-deprived.

353
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,306
I tried to take her to the hospital,

354
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,224
but she'd rather die than take medicine.

355
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,561
Are you sure you didn't drug her?

356
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,648
As far as I remember,
you were the one who drugged her.

357
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,362
Listen.

358
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,698
I just want to see you and Gwi-ju
being happy together.

359
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,368
I mean it.

360
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,120
I only brought Ms. Bok here
so we could bond.

361
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,793
But I guess my daughter is
too immature to understand,

362
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,420
given how she stole the golden egg

363
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,131
and gave it to the Bok family.

364
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,342
Gwi-ju gave me that

365
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,637
so I could pay off my debts.

366
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,474
I could've left you if I wanted to.

367
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,393
So why didn't you?

368
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,229
I guess you've grown on me.

369
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,068
You think my debt was keeping me here,

370
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,861
but you're wrong.

371
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,822
Nothing kept me here.

372
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,199
I decided to stay with you.

373
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,785
-Really?
-Yes.

374
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,039
I felt sorry for you.

375
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,459
Really?

376
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,712
You wanted to keep me around so badly
that you used money as a leash.

377
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:40,051
You thought suffocating me
was the only way to keep me around.

378
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,763
It was pitiful.

379
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,309
You must miss your dead daughter a lot.

380
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,896
Probably why you're so desperate
to keep me close.

381
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,900
That's why I stayed with you
and called you Mom.

382
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,403
Sometimes, you actually felt like a mom.

383
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,197
And I thought you thought of me

384
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,617
as your daughter,
or at least a stand-in for your daughter.

385
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,703
But I guess that's not the case.

386
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,373
You didn't keep me around to be with me.

387
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,085
You just wanted to walk all over me.

388
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,629
If that's what you want,

389
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,423
fine.

390
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,301
I won't…

391
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,180
be your daughter anymore.

392
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,473
And then what?

393
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,935
Do Da-hae!

394
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,606
Do you not care what happens to our guest?

395
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,365
Stay away from the Bok family.

396
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:49,370
Or I'll make your life miserable
with everything you taught me.

397
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,247
In the cruelest way possible.

398
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,792
How could you say that to me?

399
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,003
I learned from the best.

400
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,591
Hyeong-tae!

401
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,678
Why are you just standing there?

402
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,124
Have you found her?

403
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,042
She didn't come home.

404
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,337
It'll be dark soon.

405
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,214
Have you tried going back in time?

406
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,924
I wasn't with you

407
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,093
around the time she went missing.

408
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,224
You should at least look for clues
in different times.

409
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,561
Can you go back
to a time you were with her?

410
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,980
Or is that still not possible?

411
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,190
I exactly haven't spent…

412
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,485
too much time with her.

413
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,447
I wish I could go back and find out

414
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,199
what she was going through alone

415
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,952
and why she's hiding.

416
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,885
What is it?

417
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,432
That's…

418
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,683
I-na's birthday.

419
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,104
I hope you can see it now.

420
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,108
There are others who need your help.

421
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,157
Wait.

422
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,284
What is it?

423
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,202
You're here.

424
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,623
I am?

425
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,961
I-na's in the gym at school.

426
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,837
-We have to hurry.
-Okay.

427
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,975
Hey, guys.

428
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,560
Do you know
why Jun-woo quit the dance club?

429
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,937
I thought his mom told him to.

430
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,855
I shouldn't tell,

431
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,567
but he asked someone out in the club

432
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,944
and got turned down.

433
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,529
For real? Who?

434
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,364
Who do you think?

435
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,616
No way.

436
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,495
It wasn't me.

437
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,040
Who else would be in Jun-woo's league

438
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,709
other than Hye-rim?

439
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,626
I knew it.

440
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,878
No wonder he's been so down.

441
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,588
What a bitch.

442
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,340
How could she break Jun-woo's heart?

443
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,634
We can't do a show without him.

444
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,677
We're screwed.

445
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,387
-We should just cancel it.
-Totally.

446
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,139
-Let's just eat.
-Yeah.

447
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,226
Come eat with us, Hye-rim.

448
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,519
Hurry, or it'll get soggy.

449
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,480
-Come join us.
-Come before I finish everything.

450
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,524
Is there no fish cake in this tteokbokki?

451
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,443
Jun-hui ate all of it.

452
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,320
-You're so greedy.
-I wish there was more.

453
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,614
I'm so full.

454
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,241
You ate so much.

455
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,243
You ate the most, Jun-hui.

456
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,120
What are you talking about?

457
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,622
Let's just get going.
We don't want to be late.

458
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,376
Last one there cleans up!

459
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,627
Wait for me!

460
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,678
Someone's in here.

461
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,806
Hello?

462
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,309
I'm locked in here.

463
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,688
Hello?

464
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,547
I'm…

465
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,467
I'm here.

466
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,346
I'm right here.

467
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,682
I-na.

468
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,534
I-na! Bok I-na! Dad's here!

469
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,202
Dad's here, I-na!

470
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,788
The doors are locked.

471
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,206
We need to call someone.

472
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,374
-I'm here for you!
-I-na.

473
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,085
-We'll be right there. Don't worry.
-You!

474
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,672
What's going on here?

475
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,092
Excuse me, sir.
A student's locked in here.

476
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,137
I made sure no one was here
before locking up.

477
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,222
See? No one's here.

478
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,399
-I-na.
-Dad?

479
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,870
You're okay now.

480
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,580
Hello.

481
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,755
Why were you there?

482
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,090
Who locked you in?

483
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,803
Answer me.

484
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,513
What happened at school?

485
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,058
Can I drop out of school?

486
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,018
What?

487
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,523
Why?

488
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,484
Tell me.

489
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,820
There are too many eyes.

490
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,241
What?

491
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868
Eyes?

492
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,829
I-na.

493
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,807
It's all your fault.

494
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,310
Me?

495
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,230
I wish I stayed invisible.

496
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,317
Did you read a friend's mind?

497
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,321
I wanted her to like me.

498
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,866
I wanted to understand her.

499
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,162
I don't know what went wrong.

500
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,917
How does that make you feel?

501
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,215
No one will know how you feel
if you don't tell them.

502
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,928
Not everyone has a superpower.

503
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,055
I don't know how I feel either.

504
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,017
You can read everyone else's mind.

505
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,852
How can you not know how you feel?

506
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,272
I looked into my own eyes,

507
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,192
hoping to figure out how I felt.

508
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,197
But…

509
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,327
I couldn't hear anything.

510
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,427
I used to be invisible too.

511
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,598
In high school,

512
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,726
I got locked inside the storage.

513
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,020
But no one…

514
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,565
even noticed I was there.

515
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,693
And then a fire broke out.

516
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,410
It would've been the perfect ending
for an invisible girl.

517
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,830
I was about to disappear
without anyone knowing.

518
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,749
But then

519
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,960
someone ran through the flames

520
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,963
just to find me.

521
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,260
I thought I was invisible,
but someone saw me.

522
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,764
Who was the person

523
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,974
who saved you?

524
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,443
I don't know.

525
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,408
But I know this.

526
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,243
You have someone like that.

527
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,247
Someone who'd run through flames
just to find you.

528
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,464
And when they come looking for you,

529
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,300
don't be so afraid of them.

530
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,594
What you heard

531
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,597
might be just a tiny piece

532
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,934
of everyone's mind.

533
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,607
You know, like a fleeting emotion.

534
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,033
What did she say?

535
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,202
Who did that to her?

536
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,829
Don't push her too hard.

537
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,082
Don't ask her questions.

538
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,542
Just…

539
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,544
look at her eyes.

540
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,923
-Her eyes?
-Don't say anything.

541
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,844
Just look into her eyes.

542
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,067
Your messy iced tea.

543
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,321
You mean "dirty."

544
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,367
Just drink it.

545
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,036
I'm good.

546
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,038
Take it.

547
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,831
No, it's too late for--

548
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,427
Let me clean those.

549
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,470
Stop it!

550
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,375
I'm sorry.

551
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,881
For leaving you on your own.

552
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,053
You must've been scared…

553
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,016
and lonely.

554
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,106
I hope it's not too late for me
to be by your side.

555
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,575
I'm not entirely sure how to do this.

556
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,411
I'm a bit lost.

557
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,416
But I'll do my best.

558
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,127
From now on,

559
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,878
I'll try

560
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,298
to spend more time with you.

561
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,218
Now you say that?

562
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,683
I'll do whatever it takes
to find my way back…

563
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,061
to the moment you were born.

564
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,272
What for?

565
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,193
When I held you for the first time…

566
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,654
It was…

567
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,409
the best moment of my life.

568
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,205
You mean the worst moment.

569
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,962
I-na, did you just…

570
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,008
That moment took you away.

571
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:58,927
Hold on.

572
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,430
Do you hear this?

573
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,307
Can you hear me?

574
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,855
Yes.

575
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,650
What was that?

576
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,693
How did you do that?

577
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,530
Your eyes.

578
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,117
My eyes?

579
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,036
Is that why you avoid eye contact?

580
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,996
When did it begin?

581
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,082
Why have you been hiding it?

582
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,376
Why didn't you tell anyone
you had a superpower?

583
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,795
Because I wished it would go away.

584
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,592
The moment that took you away…

585
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:45,182
It took Mom away too.

586
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,142
I-na.

587
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,271
Do you want to move to a prettier house?

588
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,648
What about Daddy?

589
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,817
Daddy…

590
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,737
can't come with us.

591
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,451
This is your fault.

592
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,913
It's because you were born on that day.

593
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,585
Because I was born?

594
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:15,921
What?

595
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,676
Should I never have been born?

596
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,261
I-na.

597
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,849
-I-na.
-Where did you learn to drive?

598
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:51,999
I-na.

599
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,506
It's all my fault.

600
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,926
People should be allowed…

601
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,889
to hide their feelings.

602
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,183
I bet Mom

603
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,935
and my friends

604
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,314
didn't want me to know.

605
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,026
But…

606
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,029
I just had to hear their thoughts.

607
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,657
I'm a monster!

608
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:30,120
-No.
-I never should have been born.

609
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,622
No, I-na.

610
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,958
It's not your fault.

611
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,926
It's not your fault.

612
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,268
I shouldn't have…

613
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,189
let you keep…

614
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,401
all of this to yourself.

615
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,279
It's my fault.

616
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:06,990
I'm so sorry.

617
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,869
I was so stupid.

618
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,211
The moment you were born…

619
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,339
You have no idea…

620
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,636
how much that moment means to me.

621
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:25,611
Mom.

622
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,530
Mom.

623
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,365
You still have me.

624
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,161
I'll be your lead actress from now on.

625
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,497
No more stupid melodramas.

626
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,875
How about something a bit more sexy?

627
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,546
Bok Don't Eat lost a ton of weight.

628
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,008
I'll get her in perfect shape,

629
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,094
fit her into a wedding dress,
and bring home 50 billion won.

630
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,014
Problem solved, right?

631
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,100
I don't think so.

632
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,810
What?

633
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,607
Ms. Bok woke up.

634
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,373
You sure are gutsy.

635
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,958
You slept like a baby in a den of frauds.

636
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,836
This place must have good energy.

637
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,382
I had a vivid dream
the last time I was here too.

638
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,425
Did you have a nice dream?

639
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,222
You said you had a daughter, right?

640
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,933
She died young.

641
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,060
What about her?

642
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,355
I think she's alive.

643
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,567
-What?
-In my dream,

644
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,029
you were crying,

645
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:54,866
holding your grown-up daughter.

646
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,162
You said you were relieved
that she was alive.

647
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,000
Her daughter who died
while she was in prison?

648
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,420
She's her only weakness.

649
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,799
But she mentioned her
the first time we met.

650
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,301
How can that be her weakness?

651
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,846
It's no longer a weakness
once it's out in the open.

652
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,556
It becomes a weapon.

653
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,310
My mom will come at you no matter what,

654
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,020
so you have to strike first.

655
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,857
Take advantage of her weakness,

656
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,817
and she's bound to be swayed.

657
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,447
That way, you'll gain the upper hand.

658
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,369
Did you follow me here

659
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,496
just to pull something like this?

660
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,291
I'm just telling you
what I saw in my dream.

661
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,293
Just like I did at the wedding.

662
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,395
Keep moving.

663
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,773
What are you doing?

664
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,858
Getting you into a wedding dress.

665
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,196
A wedding dress?

666
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,574
Let's…

667
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,079
put that dress on.

668
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,217
Forget that.

669
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,971
Get me some water.

670
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,411
Here.

671
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,426
Are you hoping to get some crumbs
off my 50 billion won?

672
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,427
I'll help you.

673
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,513
So don't hog it all.

674
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,896
I guess you're not totally useless.

675
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,941
I lose my appetite when I see your face.

676
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:21,197
If you think about it,
we have a lot in common.

677
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,619
We're both extras
in our families, aren't we?

678
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,913
-We're clearly not the favorites.
-Hey.

679
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,249
Don't put us in the same category.

680
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:47,807
Hey.

681
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,310
Why don't we fly together?

682
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,897
Together?

683
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,068
Fly with me.

684
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,153
Just once.

685
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,455
Careful.

686
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,295
Slowly. Be careful.

687
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,433
Careful.

688
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,644
-Careful.
-Wait, Dad.

689
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,445
You got it.

690
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,793
You did it!

691
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,129
Keep going, I-na!

692
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,257
I did it!

693
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,719
I did it!

694
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,803
I did it!

695
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,304
Keep going, I-na!

696
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,848
Keep going!

697
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,436
Look at her go.

698
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,610
Keep going!

699
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,867
I-na!

700
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,092
Wait, I-na.

701
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,776
Do you hate me that much?

702
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,204
I wanted to give you these.

703
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,179
I'm sorry.

704
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,015
I've been trying my best.

705
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,185
I've been trying not to talk to you

706
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,562
and not to go near you at school.

707
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,897
And it's been killing me.

708
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,110
But I'll keep trying.

709
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,987
I'll try to avoid you as much as I can,

710
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,199
so don't run away.

711
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,583
I like you.

712
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,297
What?

713
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,181
I like you.

714
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,854
You knew, didn't you?

715
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,897
About I-na's powers.

716
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,862
Yeah.

717
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,071
Thanks.

718
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,781
Thanks to you,

719
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,826
I saved her this time.

720
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:38,997
Maybe.

721
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,802
By the way,

722
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,388
earlier…

723
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,227
when you came from the future…

724
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,230
-We have to hurry.
-Okay.

725
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,084
You seemed a little sad.

726
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,594
Another happy moment

727
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,263
for you to relive over and over again.

728
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,641
Absolutely.

729
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,520
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

730
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,147
or whenever she leaves my side

731
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,274
to hang out with her boyfriend.

732
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,487
I-na.

733
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,447
You're so pretty.

734
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,701
Guess you'll be back all the time.

735
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,828
All the time.

736
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,249
No matter how much time passes,

737
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,544
I'll never let go

738
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,964
of the moment you came to me, I-na.

739
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,803
This is the happiest moment of my life.

740
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,723
It's the one

741
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,976
that I'll never lose.

742
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,939
I finally found my way back
to the moment I-na was born.

743
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,734
It was such a precious and happy moment.

744
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,195
I don't know why it took me so long.

745
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,247
No!

746
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:02,932
I found it.

747
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,106
Where did you go?

748
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,651
To the happy moment

749
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,279
that I had to recover…

750
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,992
for both I-na and me.

751
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,126
The moment I-na was born.

752
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,886
Now it's time to save you

753
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,639
using that happiness.

754
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,481
Not that again.

755
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,818
Will you stop saying that?

756
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,321
Why would you go back in time and save me

757
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,239
when I'm alive and well?

758
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,450
What's the point?

759
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,163
Do you still not get it?

760
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,875
Because I do.

761
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,763
It's to meet you 13 years after that.

762
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:25,932
To meet you

763
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,601
and fall in love with you.

764
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,205
PURPLE DISCO

765
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,375
-Honey!
-Who are you looking for, ma'am?

766
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,085
Honey!

767
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,671
Honey!

768
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,507
Come out, Um Sun-gu!

769
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,426
Honey!

770
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,760
-Honey!
-Excuse me, ma'am.

771
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,845
Honey!

772
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,680
-Come out, honey!
-Don't cause a scene, ma'am.

773
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:09,767
-You can't do this, ma'am.
-Sun-gu, come on out!

774
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,478
Honey!

775
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,522
Honey.

776
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,566
Gwi-ju…

777
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,485
Our Gwi-ju…

778
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,154
What?

779
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,781
Gwi-ju…

780
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,534
He's going to die.

781
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,873
Gwi-ju is going to die.

782
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,794
Gwi-ju is going to die…

783
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:37,754
Stop it.

784
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,341
Focus on protecting your family.

785
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,887
I will.

786
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,388
I'll protect them with my life.

787
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,266
And that family…

788
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,977
includes you.

789
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,284
This is the ring I put on your finger
13 years ago.

790
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,709
It's the same ring…

791
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,089
I'll put on your finger someday.

792
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,175
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

793
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,455
There's only one thing we can do.

794
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,918
Keeping him happy
for as long as he's around.

795
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,589
How can I stay by his side,
knowing he'll die because of me?

796
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,549
I can't do that.

797
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,968
Why did you have to
have a dream like that?

798
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,972
Don't you think you're being punished
for your own greed?

799
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,183
I thought you had superpowers.

800
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,686
What were you doing?

801
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,481
Why couldn't you save her?

802
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,858
I'm sure

803
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,694
I'll come back to this moment someday.

804
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,326
I'm really happy right now.

805
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:21,834
