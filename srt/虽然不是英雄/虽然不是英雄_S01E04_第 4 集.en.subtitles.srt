1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,436
You made it.

3
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm not giving her these.

4
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,494
And I won't hug her

5
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,996
no matter what.

6
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,081
Listen.

7
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,916
I can't save…

8
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,230
Mr. Bok.

9
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,030
That was a close one.

10
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:36,948
Thank you.

11
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,455
What's with the flowers?

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,084
Are they for me?

13
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,421
Oh my goodness.

14
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,633
How did you know these were my favorite?

15
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,762
-So this is how it happened.
-They're so pretty.

16
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,014
When did you…

17
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,665
I saved someone

18
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,667
in the past.

19
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,711
Gwi-ju.

20
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,922
Gwi-ju.

21
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,430
I was walking up here
when you appeared out of thin air.

22
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,520
Is your power back?

23
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,605
Dad.

24
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,234
I saved someone.

25
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,211
It's over here.

26
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,903
I had no idea.

27
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,571
No one could ever find it.

28
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,618
I've been compiling a digital archive

29
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,078
to keep up with the times.

30
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,626
So you did something
you couldn't do before?

31
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,544
Yes.

32
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,215
There were some precedents
from our ancestors.

33
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,675
There it is.

34
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,469
During the Injo reign
of the Joseon Dynasty,

35
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,847
there was a lady who could use telekinesis

36
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,726
whose power was
barely strong enough to lift pebbles.

37
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,061
However, when her village was attacked,

38
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,063
she moved rocks the size of houses

39
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,565
and rained them upon the enemy.

40
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,525
Her power evolved.

41
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,153
Her desperation must have
amplified its magnitude.

42
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,488
And you desperately wanted to save people.

43
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,824
I couldn't save anyone until now.

44
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,246
So why can I save

45
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,373
Do Da-hae?

46
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,293
Hey, follow me.

47
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,757
Awakening of power
induced by a particular encounter…

48
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,220
Let's see here.

49
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,432
There it is.

50
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,313
Your great-great-grandfather
was able to breathe fire.

51
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,649
At first, his power was not whole.

52
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,402
When he was little, his nose was so hot

53
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,821
that anyone who touched it got burned,

54
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,741
which forced him to live in hiding.

55
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,786
Later, he was enlisted as a soldier.

56
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,622
When his dear comrade-in-arms
held his hand,

57
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,541
he started breathing fire
through his nose.

58
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,669
The power of his flames was overwhelming.

59
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,213
So his power was somehow

60
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,215
-unsealed.
-That's not it.

61
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,008
His power finally became whole

62
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,135
when the right person came into his life.

63
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,681
But my power is far from whole.

64
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,227
I have no control over it.

65
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,312
It's a mess.

66
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,689
Love is meant to be uncontrollable.

67
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,274
I'm not in love.

68
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,698
There was also a lady
who was a shapeshifter.

69
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,535
Each time she encountered
the scholar she loved,

70
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,579
her powers turned her into
a different person.

71
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,000
Eventually, she forgot
how to go back to her original form.

72
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,796
Even after transforming
into hundreds of women,

73
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,590
she failed to capture the scholar's heart.

74
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,971
He had been harboring feelings
for a certain woman for a long time.

75
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,308
Out of yearning for the woman
who had disappeared so suddenly,

76
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,353
he painted a portrait of her.

77
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,730
Guess who the woman was.

78
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,150
Was it the woman in her original form?

79
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,067
Precisely.

80
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,195
In the end, not only did she find love,

81
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,114
but also her own self that she had lost.

82
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,121
Do Da-hae could be the one for you.

83
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,001
I'll go tell your mom.

84
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,212
Not just yet.

85
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,755
Like the door from that day,

86
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,716
we don't know what this means yet.

87
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,848
In that case, let's give it some time

88
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,433
until we can be certain.

89
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,185
Okay.

90
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,728
Either way, congratulations.

91
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,356
On what?

92
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,484
You got to use your power
in a meaningful way.

93
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,152
Just like you always wanted.

94
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,186
She's a ghost.

95
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,106
This house is haunted.

96
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,900
What the hell?

97
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,244
Ms. Do?

98
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,956
Wait.

99
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,542
You were…

100
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,546
upstairs just now.

101
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,360
You're…

102
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,654
a ghost.

103
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,073
Hey.

104
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,741
Ms. Do.

105
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,826
Ms. Do!

106
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,869
What's all this noise?

107
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,538
My goodness!

108
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,707
What happened?

109
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,292
Something must have startled her.

110
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,085
-She said she saw a ghost.
-A ghost?

111
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,506
She was probably talking about me.

112
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,843
I skipped a few meals because I was sick,

113
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,803
and I managed to fly about this high.

114
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,055
She must've seen that.

115
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,350
You should've been more careful.

116
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,227
It's too early for her to find out.

117
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,187
You're right.

118
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,025
If I'd known your son's girlfriend
would sneak into our vault,

119
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,985
I would've been more careful.

120
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,111
Why was she there?

121
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,779
She was probably just passing by.

122
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,616
Why were you flying in that room anyway?

123
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,994
I was trying to catch a mosquito?

124
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,416
Let's lay her down first.

125
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,667
Let's do that.

126
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,502
Careful.

127
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,087
Be gentle.

128
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,638
Should have run away.

129
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,102
I thought she was healthy,

130
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,271
but she's surprisingly frail.

131
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,482
It takes some getting used to.

132
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,942
I was just as shocked
when I first saw your father

133
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,987
growing colorful scales on his body
and flapping around

134
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,489
like he was the Little Mermaid.

135
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,157
He was otherwise so proper.

136
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,953
Should we call an ambulance?

137
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,955
Looks like she's asleep.

138
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,126
You think so?

139
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:14,965
She is.

140
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,676
Poor thing.

141
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,055
She must have been so nervous
in this new environment.

142
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,099
That's not it.

143
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,353
She drank the tea she made for Mom.

144
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,979
She drugged it.

145
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:29,980
What are you talking about?

146
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,609
Your sister's just anxious
that she'll lose the building to you.

147
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,028
Let's go.

148
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,327
-Good luck with her.
-You don't even have any proof.

149
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,037
Come on.

150
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,629
I'm telling you.

151
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,840
Don't eat or drink anything she gives you.

152
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,800
You never know what she put in it.

153
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,344
Just don't let her
see you flying around again.

154
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,847
She can't see that until she's one of us.

155
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,773
You were…

157
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,110
just upstairs.

158
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,655
I was upstairs?

159
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,200
Could it have been me from the future?

160
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,930
PALACE SAUNA

161
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,752
Are you okay?

162
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,091
I had a dream.

163
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,600
Tell me the winning numbers.

164
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,105
Or was it stocks?

165
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,404
It was an ominous dream.

166
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,268
Ms. Do?

167
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,813
What the heck was that last night?

168
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,472
Good morning.

169
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,978
Hey.

170
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,773
You completely passed out.

171
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,276
It was as if

172
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,863
you'd been drugged or something.

173
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,241
I was…

174
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,120
pretty tired.

175
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,342
Did you see it?

176
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,052
Sorry?

177
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,219
Did it surprise you?

178
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,223
Never seen anything like it?

179
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,268
What's wrong?

180
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,647
Take a closer look…

181
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:42,983
at my pedicure.

182
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,616
Join me sometime.

183
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,463
That sounds great.

184
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,800
I'd love to.

185
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,784
Are you okay?

186
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,956
I can see you.

187
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,630
Did you see me here last night?

188
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,090
Not again.

189
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,176
Do you not remember?

190
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,346
-Or are you pretending again?
-It doesn't matter.

191
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,474
Just tell me what happened.

192
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,520
Well…

193
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,108
You were standing here…

194
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,947
Are you leaving for school, I-na?

195
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,825
Have some breakfast.

196
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,705
I-na.

197
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,375
You should eat before you go.

198
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,878
Don't you want to grow tall?

199
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,300
I-na.

200
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,720
-Over easy or sunny-side up?
-Sunny-side up, please.

201
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,972
Sunny-side up it is.

202
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,272
Good morning.

203
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,942
I tossed and turned all night.

204
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,112
And when I finally fell asleep,

205
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,699
I had an unsettling dream.

206
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,827
What did you dream about?

207
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,881
Do you enjoy saunas, Ms. Do?

208
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,926
Oh no.

209
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,219
Oh my gosh.

210
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,054
I popped the yolk.

211
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,722
I'll make you a new one, I-na.

212
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,516
In my dream,

213
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,977
you were at a sauna.

214
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,397
Have you heard of Palace Sauna?

215
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,109
Sorry?

216
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,278
Sauna?

217
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,741
-Why do you ask?
-I saw you get carried out of that sauna

218
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,202
and into an ambulance.

219
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,580
An ambulance?

220
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,167
But then again,

221
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,211
it's just a concerned old woman's dream,

222
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,505
so don't be so alarmed.

223
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,760
But it wouldn't hurt
to stay away from saunas for a while.

224
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,889
You can never be too careful, right?

225
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,894
Even in your sleep,

226
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,689
you must have been worried about me.

227
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,524
Thank you.

228
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,822
I have to cook another egg.

229
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,198
I'm late.

230
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,700
I'm leaving.

231
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,744
You shouldn't just go
on an empty stomach, I-na.

232
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,247
Wait a minute, I-na.

233
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,338
I-na.

234
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,051
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,554
At least take this.

236
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,018
Have a nice day.

237
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,061
Didn't I warn you?

238
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,483
-Huh?
-My family has superpowers.

239
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,112
-What?
-Run away while you can.

240
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,456
She's kidding.

241
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,127
I have to get out of here.

242
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,556
I have to run.

243
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,929
In my dream,

244
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,058
you were at a sauna.

245
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,228
Have you heard of Palace Sauna?

246
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,982
If I walk in here now,
does that make her dream

247
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,192
a real precognitive dream?

248
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,594
They might actually have superpowers.

249
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,140
She must have seen things
under the influence.

250
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,310
She said she saw me here in her dream.

251
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,980
Maybe she had hired someone to tail you.

252
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,064
Forget it.

253
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,694
It's delusion that runs in their family,
not superpowers.

254
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,865
We have more than enough evidence
that they're not in their right minds.

255
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,450
Let's move on to the next step.

256
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,202
Register your marriage

257
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,788
and be appointed as their guardian.

258
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,249
I have a better idea.

259
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,626
Why don't I find another target?

260
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,097
Hey.

261
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,308
Shut up and get us
that marriage registration.

262
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,810
-Mom.
-What?

263
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,437
Are you scared of ghosts?

264
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,064
A ghost's money is still money.

265
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,982
Don't forget that you still owe me.

266
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,041
You must be Da-hae.

267
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,927
I told him to go easy on the booze.

268
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,181
Are you here alone?

269
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,557
Aren't there any grown-ups?

270
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,528
Good grief.

271
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,116
CONDOLENCES

272
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,040
This is nowhere near enough.

273
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,171
Your father's debt is yours now,
so you'll have to pay me back.

274
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,172
Come here.

275
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,844
I said come here.

276
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,229
Sign this.

277
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,321
BENEFICIARY: BAEK IL-HONG
INSURED: DO DA-HAE

278
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,913
I did some digging.

279
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,292
Every investment they've made
in the past few years has tanked.

280
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,295
All they have left is their house

281
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,630
and the gym building.

282
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:30,093
At this rate, they'll be penniless soon.

283
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,137
We can't waste any more time.

284
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,598
We have to salvage what's left of it.

285
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:40,020
You can retire as my lead actress
and ride off into the sunset after this.

286
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,146
I'll retire too.

287
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,032
You might as well
relax for a bit in the sauna.

288
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,617
You're already here.

289
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,423
Welcome.

290
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:21,895
Get out.

291
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,022
-What?
-You can't come in.

292
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,193
What's your problem?

293
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,075
CHANGE INTO SAUNA CLOTHES
BEFORE ENTERING

294
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:45,543
I saw you get carried out of that sauna

295
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,462
and into an ambulance.

296
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,442
Hey.

297
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,946
-What are you doing?
-Call an ambulance.

298
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,824
I think I'm bleeding.

299
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,325
Wait. No, I'm not.

300
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,662
Precognitive dreams, my foot.

301
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,040
Do you know why bad dreams come true?

302
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,793
It's because it gets in your head.

303
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,795
You can't help but tense up and get hurt

304
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,047
when you're so worried about it.

305
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,049
Get up already.

306
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,434
You think so?

307
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,944
No, I still think
I might have cracked my skull.

308
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,446
UNCLE

309
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,794
What now?

310
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,591
You're sweating.

311
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,096
-Why don't you get off my--
-When you sweat,

312
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,599
it makes the floor slippery, sir.

313
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,893
Excuse me.

314
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,478
I'd like to order some gimbap.

315
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,898
Some noodles and eggs too.

316
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,358
Is no one here?

317
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,275
Excuse me!

318
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,027
Here are your drinks.

319
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,059
Your food's ready.

320
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,357
DO DA-HAE

321
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,528
I have a new piece of information.

322
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,919
BAEK IL-HONG

323
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,845
NOH HYEONG-TAE

324
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,389
Is my food ready yet?

325
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,932
One moment, please.

326
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,226
Please hurry up.

327
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,730
Use your signature move
when the time comes.

328
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,236
-Mom.
-"Mom"?

329
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,953
You said you didn't have any family.

330
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,721
I can explain.

331
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,222
The thing is…

332
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,271
Da-hae is…

333
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,690
She's…

334
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,068
Fire!

335
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,529
Everyone out!

336
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,073
Please don't panic!

337
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,159
Fire!

338
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,622
Everyone out!

339
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,167
To the emergency exit!

340
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,668
Everyone out!

341
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,038
Ms. Do.

342
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,626
Ms. Do.

343
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,253
I got you.

344
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,256
Get up.

345
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,270
I told you.

346
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,563
Call an ambulance.

347
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,276
Ms. Do.

348
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,362
Are you okay?

349
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,291
PALACE SAUNA

350
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,726
Want to come with us?

351
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,571
Please read and sign this.

352
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,655
Okay.

353
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,162
Write your name here.

354
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,079
GUARDIAN

355
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,127
I'm not really her mom.

356
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,298
I used to know her dad,

357
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,592
and that somehow got us here.

358
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,219
He got drunk and froze to death

359
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,555
on the street in the middle of winter.

360
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,184
The only people
who showed up at his funeral

361
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,813
were loan sharks
who came to take the condolence money.

362
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,191
There was no grown-up to take care of her.

363
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,360
She was all by herself.

364
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,029
Not long after that,

365
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,990
she went through a terrible accident.

366
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,473
You're up. Do you know where you are?

367
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,602
-Have you contacted her guardian?
-Not yet.

368
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,688
I don't have one.

369
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,237
Stay in bed.

370
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,530
Don't get up.

371
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,911
What are you doing?

372
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,671
I can't afford this.

373
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,172
What?

374
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,688
I'm her guardian.

375
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,241
Sucks for you.

376
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,537
You won't get my insurance money yet.

377
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,043
You can pay me back while you're alive.

378
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,551
Hey.

379
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,137
Be my daughter.

380
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,188
I only took care of her for a while,

381
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,065
but she still calls me Mom.

382
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,357
Poor thing.

383
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,487
She told me that she almost died once.

384
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,615
She did?

385
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,869
She hardly ever tells anyone about it.

386
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,873
What happened?

387
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,334
You don't know the details, do you?

388
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,336
Ask her yourself.

389
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,962
It's a touchy subject.

390
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,968
Do you know how her name came to be?

391
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,223
Her dad loved mugwort soup
with dodari fish in it,

392
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,642
and she happened to be born in the spring.

393
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,021
That's when the fish is in season.

394
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,524
He was about to
register her name as Do Da-ri,

395
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,401
but the civil servant
barely managed to talk him out of it.

396
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,904
In the end, he changed the last syllable.

397
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,826
He named her Da-hae, meaning "do it all,"

398
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,911
so she can do anything she wants.

399
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,081
It's a nice name.

400
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,416
No.

401
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,545
It's not such a nice name either.

402
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,590
It became more of a curse than a blessing.

403
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,719
She's had to do everything
on her own to survive.

404
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,017
I hope she'll find someone
to stay by her side.

405
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:54,902
MOTHER

406
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,999
Get up.

407
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,884
I told you, Mom.

408
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
There's something about the Bok family.

409
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,721
We better not mess with--

410
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,306
Get me the marriage registration.

411
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,850
That's your way out.

412
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,226
From that family

413
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,394
and from me.

414
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,442
Yes, Mother.

415
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,361
Ms. Do left without saying anything,

416
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,905
and she hasn't come back.

417
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,157
Do you think she went to the sauna?

418
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,034
-She did.
-What?

419
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,952
Is she okay?

420
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,039
She's in the ER.

421
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,582
What?

422
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,542
Is it serious?

423
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,044
What happened?

424
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,340
I told her not to go there.

425
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,258
Calm down.

426
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,384
I'll call you later.

427
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,976
It really was a precognitive dream.

428
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,189
But why do I only see
Do Da-hae in every dream?

429
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,736
Keep applying pressure on it.

430
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,363
Thank you.

431
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,084
She left.

432
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,920
She had to go back to the sauna.

433
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,308
EMERGENCY ROOM RELEASE FORM

434
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,731
GUARDIAN: BOK GWI-JU

435
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,363
Just a moment, please.

436
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,451
Did you follow me?

437
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,830
It's just…

438
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,165
You left in such a hurry.

439
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,044
Why didn't you say anything

440
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,754
when my mother mentioned the sauna?

441
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,094
Has she been checking my background?

442
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,595
Be honest with me.

443
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,476
To tell you the truth,

444
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,145
I was a little worried

445
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,523
that my mother's dream would come true.

446
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:45,948
Are you saying

447
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,244
she really can see the future
in her dreams?

448
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,671
But I thought you had all lost your powers
because of your lifestyle diseases.

449
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,548
We got them back.

450
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,258
But they've changed.

451
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,264
I go back in time
for a different reason now.

452
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,517
It's Do Da-hae.

453
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,896
What?

454
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,775
Me?

455
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,821
When I held your hand at the mall

456
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,783
and showed up at the fountain
with flowers,

457
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,076
it was me from the future.

458
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,536
What?

459
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,497
It's not that I forgot what I did.

460
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,583
What had already happened to you

461
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,293
just hadn't happened to me yet.

462
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,380
Hold on.

463
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,549
What are you talking about?

464
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,468
Think about it.

465
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,637
Didn't I disappear all of a sudden

466
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,138
both times?

467
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,390
When did you…

468
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,397
Is that also why

469
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,400
your reflection wasn't
in the mirror last night?

470
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,402
I'm not only invisible in the mirror.

471
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,237
You're the only one who can see me.

472
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,031
You're the only one
who can see or touch me.

473
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,449
You're in color,

474
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,618
while everything else
is in black and white.

475
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,412
But why…

476
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,915
Why me?

477
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,000
Why?

478
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,169
Why me, of all people?

479
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,712
I'm not sure.

480
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,257
But one thing is for sure.

481
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,008
Do Da-hae's past

482
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:29,844
is my future.

483
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,555
The moments I spent with you…

484
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,892
pull me back into them.

485
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,994
You told her our secret?

486
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,746
How could you be so rash?

487
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,582
What if she gets scared and runs away?

488
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,500
We couldn't hide it any longer.

489
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,085
You told her about your dream.

490
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,297
How could I not tell her
about such a dream?

491
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:07,882
I know.

492
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,009
I wonder why you dreamed of it.

493
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,732
I have to go back.

494
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,609
Gwi-ju.

495
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,530
I can't go back to the past.

496
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,158
I have to go back to Se-yeon.

497
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,785
I have to undo everything.

498
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,370
Don't you remember?

499
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,207
You can only go back to happy moments.

500
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,126
And even if you did,
you couldn't change anything.

501
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,419
Just let it go.

502
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,592
I found this in her bag.

503
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,053
If she was pregnant,

504
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,139
why didn't she tell me?

505
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,979
Because it was another man's child.

506
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,069
-What?
-She was seeing someone.

507
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,363
She was even planning to move in with him.

508
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,615
Didn't she say anything to you?

509
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,661
How do you know that?

510
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,887
I never dreamed about Se-yeon.

511
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,306
It made me anxious
that I couldn't see anything.

512
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,392
So you never considered her family.

513
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,311
Don't blame her for your dreams.

514
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,274
It's not her fault that you only dream
about how to make money!

515
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,110
What did you dream about
on the day she died?

516
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,280
If you had dreamed about her just once,

517
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,407
we could've prevented her death!

518
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,076
I can only see what I'm shown.

519
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,620
Even if I had dreamed about her,
it wouldn't have changed a thing.

520
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,206
Just like you can't change the past,

521
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,958
I can't change the future.

522
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,009
I had a nightmare a long time ago.

523
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,471
It was about someone's death.

524
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,766
I did all I could do to prevent it,

525
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,519
but I couldn't stop what was meant to be.

526
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,897
I was overwhelmed by the futility and fear

527
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,234
of not being able to do anything
about a tragedy I know will happen!

528
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,696
Trust me, I've been there.

529
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,494
Why did you never tell me?

530
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:46,707
Because just thinking about it
broke my heart into pieces!

531
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,001
The dream was about my own father's death.

532
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,134
So basically,

533
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,596
we've been cursed for generations.

534
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,557
Depending on how you see it,
it could be a blessing.

535
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,146
How can it be a blessing
to have these useless powers?

536
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,732
What's the point of seeing the future
or going back to the past?

537
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,942
We can never change anything
or save anyone!

538
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,613
You should be grateful
that you can have a glimpse at the past.

539
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,823
Wanting more than that
is pure greed and arrogance.

540
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,451
I'm actually grateful

541
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:27,665
that I only see the stock charts
and lottery numbers in my dreams.

542
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,752
Our ancestors have been
literally ripped apart and burned alive

543
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,338
trying to play heroes!

544
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,841
From now on,
only look back on your happiness.

545
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,719
Stop looking back on others' misfortunes,

546
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,098
and don't get in over your head
trying to save others!

547
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,183
I wish it would just go away.

548
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,199
It's been seven years

549
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,826
since I stopped dreaming.

550
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,411
I told you.

551
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,414
She can help us recover what we've lost.

552
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,625
Too bad it's not
the type of dream you want.

553
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,503
I know you'd rather dream
about the lottery and stocks.

554
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,296
I'm sure I will soon.

555
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,589
Maybe this is your chance.

556
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,926
To use your power to help others,

557
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,970
not just for your own greed.

558
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,014
Are you still naive enough
to dream of being a hero?

559
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,475
Even after I told you about my dream,

560
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,144
you couldn't protect Do Da-hae.

561
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,062
Who knows?

562
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:33,856
I might be able to.

563
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,927
How do you like living with us?

564
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,679
It's been great.

565
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,930
Thanks to your kindness.

566
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,474
You don't have to do that.

567
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,975
Be honest with me.

568
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,395
My family can be a handful.

569
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,731
The more you know,
the more confusing it gets.

570
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,488
But I think

571
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,199
I've figured you out.

572
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,326
Already?

573
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,205
I'll show you what kind of person I am.

574
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,915
Slowly,

575
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,124
but surely.

576
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,295
Please show me every single detail,
slowly but surely.

577
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,421
I will.

578
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,340
It takes time to get to know someone.

579
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,883
And I'll be watching you.

580
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,553
See you.

581
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,721
Bye.

582
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,102
Watch your step.

583
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,437
I will.

584
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,130
Bok Man-huem.

585
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,007
Precognitive dreams.

586
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,051
Has trouble dreaming

587
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,469
due to insomnia.

588
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,139
Um Sun-gu. No superpower.

589
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,558
Married into the family.

590
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,685
Bok Dong-hee.

591
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,228
Able to fly.

592
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,688
Lost her power

593
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,315
due to obesity.

594
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,235
Bok Gwi-ju.

595
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,697
Able to return to a happy moment

596
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,199
from the past.

597
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,785
No longer feels happy

598
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,371
due to depression.

599
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,544
But…

600
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,009
he might be starting to feel happy again.

601
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,848
STARTING TO FEEL HAPPY AGAIN?

602
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,563
The moments I spent with you

603
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,982
pull me back into them.

604
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,446
Bok I-na.

605
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,324
Her superpower…

606
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,285
Not so sure.

607
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,875
Bok Man-huem can see the future,

608
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,462
Bok Dong-hee can fly,

609
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,257
and Bok Gwi-ju can return to the past,

610
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,345
but Bok I-na has no superpower?

611
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,722
You don't want to?

612
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,223
I can't.

613
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,433
Why not?

614
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,728
People will be looking at me.

615
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,189
Don't worry.
No one's going to look at you.

616
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,273
They'll be looking at me.

617
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,363
I'm kidding.

618
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,615
I'm just trying to help you relax.

619
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,867
-But…
-Since you're new,

620
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,494
you can have a seat and watch.

621
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,790
How did she win Hye-rim over?

622
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,125
Hye-rim is so open-minded.

623
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,293
We could use some help.

624
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,254
She could clean and get us drinks.

625
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,216
I guess. Teachers favor quiet kids too,

626
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,677
so keeping her around
might not be a bad idea.

627
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,513
Shall we get started?

628
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,557
All right.

629
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,018
Start with the hips.

630
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:45,357
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

631
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,069
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

632
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,948
One, swing, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

633
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,660
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

634
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,372
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

635
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,834
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

636
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,794
Five, six, seven, eight.

637
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,339
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

638
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,342
One, swing, three, four, five, six…

639
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,054
"ONE"
EPIK HIGH

640
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,742
Don't you hear me?

641
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,618
I was talking to you.

642
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,079
Sorry.

643
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,291
What are you listening to?

644
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:56,928
Nice.

645
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,305
What's it called?

646
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,728
Come on, what is it called?

647
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,065
You know your music.

648
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,359
Where do you find all of these?

649
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,511
Guys, let's change the song.

650
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,764
-I-na found a good one.
-Nice.

651
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,516
I never liked this song anyway.

652
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,518
-Let's have a listen.
-Let's do that.

653
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,606
I'm so tired.

654
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,691
Want to get some tteokbokki, Hye-rim?

655
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,734
Sure.

656
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,819
Is everyone coming?

657
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,196
Of course. If you're in, we're in.

658
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,405
Let's go!

659
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,991
-I'm hungry.
-Tteokbokki!

660
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,285
-Tteokbokki!
-Last one there is buying!

661
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,165
I have to go to the academy.

662
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,340
See you.

663
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,534
Buy me some cup noodles too.

664
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,621
Weren't you getting tteokbokki?

665
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,499
I came to look for a friend
who left without saying goodbye.

666
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,376
A friend?

667
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,253
Which one are you getting?

668
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,963
SUPER HOT NOODLES

669
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,052
You don't look like the type
to enjoy such spicy food.

670
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,570
You're so cute.

671
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,865
She thinks I'm cute?

672
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,410
I can see why Jun-woo is so into you.

673
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,416
-He's not.
-He seemed interested in you.

674
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,835
What do you think about him?

675
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,183
I liked him first.

676
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,684
You can't like him.

677
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,938
Not if you want to be friends with me.

678
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,111
What do you think about Jun-woo?

679
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,657
Well…

680
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,163
I think he's a jerk.

681
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,586
Hey, Jun-woo.

682
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,182
Oh no.

683
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,559
I think he heard us.

684
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,979
This is why I never want to know

685
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,439
what people really think.

686
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,877
Hey, Bok Don't Eat.

687
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,213
Have a drink.

688
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,549
Here.

689
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,807
Is it serious between you and Dr. Jo?

690
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,981
If it is, you should reconsider.

691
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,442
I'm just concerned about you.

692
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,277
He seemed like a nice person,

693
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,280
so I wanted to ask him for some advice,

694
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,825
but he suddenly dragged me
to a hotel room.

695
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:29,743
I saw you.

696
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,536
You did?

697
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,247
I wasn't sure because you just left.

698
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,207
How could you just leave?

699
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,209
Why didn't you pull out all of his hair?

700
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,462
Not mine! His!

701
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,047
I'm a victim too!

702
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,634
Guess what I hate hearing the most.

703
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,598
"Fatty"?

704
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,727
"A woman's worst enemy

705
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,146
is another woman."

706
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,690
I'm at fault for our relationship.

707
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,401
I should've taken better care of myself.

708
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,821
It's not just your size
that's extra-large.

709
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,240
You have a big heart too.

710
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,827
But it's unhealthy
to be so hard on yourself.

711
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,538
Finding the reasons within yourself.

712
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,040
That's true self-esteem.

713
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,834
That's how you take control of your life.

714
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:20,794
Do you understand?

715
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,054
Pretty inspiring take on life.

716
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,406
I have to reclaim my true self.

717
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,159
Once I do that,

718
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,079
everything else will fall in line.

719
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,227
But it's unhealthy
to be so hard on yourself.

720
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,481
A girl's gotta eat.

721
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,406
Mom?

722
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,339
What are you doing there?

723
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,137
She found out about our secrets.

724
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,474
So you want to kill her
without anyone knowing?

725
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,644
No, I think she got spooked.
She's locked herself in.

726
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,770
What?

727
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,692
Has she still not run away?

728
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,073
Maybe she did.

729
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,164
Are you there?

730
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,085
Ms. Do.

731
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,005
Ms. Do?

732
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,596
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

733
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,931
Can I come in?

734
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,185
The doctor said
that I needed to rest today.

735
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,562
Please excuse me.

736
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,066
She's here.

737
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:55,740
One of two things happens
when people find out about our powers.

738
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,035
They either run away
or take advantage of us.

739
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,938
It's not that I forgot what I did.

740
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,440
What had already happened to you

741
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,734
hadn't happened to me yet.

742
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,570
Do Da-hae's past

743
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,863
is my future.

744
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,455
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

745
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,873
I used to be powerless,

746
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,292
but now I have a purpose.

747
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,924
The only person I can save in the past.

748
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,010
Do Da-hae.

749
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,597
The sauna.

750
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,646
Get out.

751
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,898
-What?
-You can't come in.

752
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,028
What's your problem?

753
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,238
Can you put some lotion on my back?

754
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:45,993
WOMEN'S CHANGING ROOM

755
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,288
What did I just see?

756
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,793
Oh, crap.

757
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,923
This is bad.

758
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,518
Why is it so hot?

759
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,521
So cold.

760
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,442
Get it together.

761
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,694
Focus and try again.

762
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,697
I have to save Do Da-hae.

763
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,699
Do Da-hae.

764
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:54,979
If I'd known your son's girlfriend
would sneak into our vault,

765
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,814
I would've been more careful.

766
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,985
Dong-hee was telling the truth.

767
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,784
She's a ghost.

768
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,454
This house is haunted.

769
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,963
The only person I can save
while in the past.

770
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:21,964
Are you okay?

771
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:27,303
But why her?

772
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,018
What's wrong?

773
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,067
Let me just…

774
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,237
Excuse me.

775
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,588
Jeez.

776
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,360
Mr. Bok.

777
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,030
My goodness. What happened?

778
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:29,991
You're soaking wet.

779
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:33,995
Are you okay?

780
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,455
I'll do it.

781
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,508
What's wrong?

782
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,887
The Bok Gwi-ju I saw

783
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,179
was from this moment?

784
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,021
Did you just get back from the past?

785
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:03,900
Actually,

786
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,444
you just came to me again

787
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:09,947
from the future.

788
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:12,283
With this.

789
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,372
You gave this to me.

790
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,882
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

791
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,094
Marriage registration?

792
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,805
You said it was a present.

793
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,477
Hold on.

794
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,229
This can't be.

795
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,650
I know it's hard to believe.

796
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,819
It hasn't happened to you yet.

797
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,783
But you'll probably find out soon enough.

798
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,327
My past

799
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,955
is your future.

800
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,710
That may be true,

801
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,672
but this is out of order.

802
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,551
I can take responsibility for my past

803
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,261
but not for my future.

804
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,683
There's more.

805
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:24,105
There's something else
that hasn't happened to you yet.

806
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,816
I have a new piece of information.

807
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,321
Do you know
why Gwi-ju quit being a firefighter?

808
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,909
He lost a close colleague in a fire,

809
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,829
and it shocked him into quitting.

810
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,539
Guess when that was.

811
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,749
When I was in high school,

812
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,418
there was a fire at my school.

813
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:50,047
Everyone assumed the fire alarm
was malfunctioning as usual.

814
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,259
As a result,

815
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,052
the evacuation was delayed.

816
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:58,973
It was an old building,

817
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,268
so it didn't have
a proper fire protection system.

818
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,271
Don't tell me.

819
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,858
Seonjae Girls' High School?

820
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,031
I don't want to play that card anymore.

821
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:16,532
Hey.

822
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,285
Life has given you nothing but misfortune.

823
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,746
You should at least take advantage of it.

824
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:27,043
Use your signature move
when the time comes.

825
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:28,586
Mom.

826
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,963
If he hadn't come to my rescue,

827
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,466
I would have…

828
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,844
died that day.

829
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,807
You reminded me of him

830
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,769
from the beginning.

831
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:49,774
I think…

832
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,652
you might have been that person.

833
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,239
If what's already happened to me

834
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,285
hasn't happened to you yet.

835
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,137
Are you saying…

836
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,974
that I saved you 13 years ago?

837
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,226
I mean…

838
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:29,522
that I will?

839
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:40,741
Even then,

840
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,994
registering the marriage first

841
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:45,830
doesn't seem right.

842
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,707
Let's take it one step at a time.

843
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,252
Love has to come first

844
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,879
for us to reach

845
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,340
the future you talked about.

846
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,852
Let's see if we actually end up…

847
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:12,523
falling in love.

848
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,275
What?

849
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,676
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

850
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,498
We even kissed.

851
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,251
Don't you know what comes after that?

852
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:20,424
I've only been dreaming about you lately.

853
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:24,053
I saw something
when I looked at your hand.

854
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,305
About the marriage registration.

855
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,849
Shouldn't we let
your family know about it?

856
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,768
This is great news!

857
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:34,730
Are you sure I'm the one who saved you?

858
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:37,816
Stop evading the question.

859
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:40,402
You want to trust Da-hae, don't you?

860
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:42,947
You want to save her.

861
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,241
Do you think it's easy for me to believe

862
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:48,577
that you'll go back in time to save me?

863
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:55,167
