1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,456
Even then,

3
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,001
registering the marriage first

4
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,627
doesn't seem right.

5
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,173
Let's take it one step at a time.

6
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,841
What do you mean?

7
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,138
Love has to come first

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,682
for us to reach

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,100
the future you talked about.

10
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,653
Let's see if we actually end up

11
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,989
falling in love.

12
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,574
What?

13
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
He bought it.

14
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,509
He denied holding my hand

15
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,638
and giving me flowers.

16
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,224
None of that had happened to him yet.

17
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,892
Then what if…

18
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,403
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

19
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,126
HUSBAND: BOK GWI-JU

20
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,298
…I told him his future self
stamped the form with his seal?

21
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,805
Am I really going to…

22
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,906
go back in time
to save Do Da-hae from the fire?

23
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,784
But I don't know when I'll get found out.

24
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,578
They're no ordinary people.

25
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,711
What the hell?

26
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,731
They have superpowers.

27
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,568
They'll always be one step ahead of me.

28
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,382
They might even find out about my past.

29
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,010
Yes?

30
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,639
Just a second.

31
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,652
Who is it?

32
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,950
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,161
I shouldn't be bothering you,

34
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,706
but I can't seem to fall asleep.

35
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,797
Would you like some tea?

36
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,387
How does your head feel?

37
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,097
Much better now.

38
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,349
You must be shocked.

39
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,062
I heard he told you about our family.

40
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,021
Yes.

41
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,856
I guess…

42
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,067
it's a bit confusing.

43
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,070
It's hard to believe
that such powers even exist.

44
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,324
Let alone…

45
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,619
that they run in the family.

46
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,204
Don't be afraid.

47
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,791
It's like a talent
that runs in the family.

48
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:20,880
Just like how there are families
of teachers, doctors, or artists.

49
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,509
On top of that,

50
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,845
we can't even use our powers
properly right now.

51
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,475
But you predicted that I'd get hurt.

52
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,523
How far ahead and in how much detail

53
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,692
can you see the future?

54
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,695
I have no control over what I dream of.

55
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,073
I just see what I'm shown.

56
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,201
I see.

57
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,874
But I've only been
dreaming about you lately.

58
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,378
I actually just dreamed about you.

59
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,092
You did?

60
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,761
What exactly…

61
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,265
did you see?

62
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,017
I only dozed off for a bit,

63
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,727
so I couldn't see much.

64
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,398
I had the same dream the other day,

65
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,984
but I couldn't see anything clearly.

66
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,986
It was all so hazy.

67
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,698
But if I can get some quality sleep

68
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,284
with the help of your special tea,

69
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,786
I might be able to get a good look.

70
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,539
-Sorry?
-I saw it.

71
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,665
What?

72
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,500
I saw something

73
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,003
when I looked at your hand.

74
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,171
Sorry?

75
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,259
There's a ring that's been passed down
in our family for generations,

76
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,762
and you were wearing it.

77
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,558
Everything else was blurry,
but that was for sure.

78
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,353
I'm sure you know what that means.

79
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,945
Yes.

80
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,700
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

81
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,620
I can't just blindly follow
what I think is the future.

82
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,124
Marrying a woman
because I'm going to anyway?

83
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,876
That's nonsense.

84
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:45,233
I can't fall in love with her
just because I will one day.

85
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,737
As I expected,

86
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,239
I felt no love from that kiss.

87
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,705
What the hell?

88
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,834
Let's see if we actually end up

89
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,795
falling in love.

90
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,755
What?

91
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,313
I just happened to recall that moment

92
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,566
when I closed my eyes to sleep.

93
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,236
The kiss didn't mean anything to me.

94
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,907
Let's see if we actually end up

95
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,076
falling in love.

96
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,981
Goodness.

97
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,287
There's a ring that's been passed down
in our family for generations,

98
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,916
and you were wearing it.

99
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,925
The precious family ring must be in here.

100
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,095
You seem very interested in this room.

101
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,268
Sorry? Could you say that one more time?

102
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:13,065
Did you just say
you were interested in me?

103
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,193
I think that's what I heard.

104
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,319
Let's take a walk.

105
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,451
It's nice to be on a walk together.

106
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,161
Isn't it?

107
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,166
When should we tell the family?

108
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,460
About last night?

109
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,345
I mean,

110
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,681
about the marriage registration.

111
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,602
Shouldn't we let
your family know about it?

112
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,397
Not yet.

113
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,065
Especially not my mother.

114
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,322
She doesn't seem to know
about the changes you're going through.

115
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,033
If she finds out,
she'll try to rush things.

116
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,035
It's my decision.

117
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,204
Not my mother's or my future self's.

118
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,916
Falling in love and getting married

119
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,043
just because I will one day?

120
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,378
That makes no sense.

121
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,089
Let's take it one step at a time.

122
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,633
Fine.

123
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,802
Does this count as a date then?

124
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,012
By your books?

125
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,687
Or are we not ready to lock arms yet?

126
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,024
But wait.

127
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,567
Let's think about this.

128
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,946
Why do you think you gave me
the marriage registration?

129
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,282
You probably didn't want us
to worry about the order of things

130
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,576
and make that future happen sooner.

131
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,994
What if that future is fake?

132
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,040
Only you know the truth
about the marriage registration.

133
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,960
When I go back in time,
you're the only one who can see me

134
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,086
or touch me.

135
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,172
Do you not believe me?

136
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,511
Tell me about the fire at your school.

137
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,056
What?

138
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,100
Where exactly were you
at the time of the fire?

139
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,769
I'd like some details on what happened

140
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,272
and how I saved you that day.

141
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,696
Are you sure I'm the one

142
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,739
who saved you?

143
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,039
This isn't the next step I was expecting.

144
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,458
We even kissed.

145
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,421
Don't you know what comes after that?

146
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,305
I'm afraid we'll have to take a step back.

147
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,223
To before the kiss.

148
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,893
Like it never happened?

149
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,941
I kissed you to see
if I could feel anything.

150
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,776
So what's the verdict?

151
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,321
Meh.

152
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,490
"Meh"?

153
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,328
I see.

154
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,380
Where are you going?

155
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,007
Back to cleaning.

156
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,467
You're going the wrong way.

157
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,945
Where did it go?

158
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,283
Good grief.

159
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,827
Where could it be?

160
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,082
I can't find it anywhere.

161
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,461
Dong-hee.

162
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,130
Hey, what's up?

163
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,924
Have you seen my watch?

164
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,384
Which one?

165
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,469
The golden one
with the brown leather strap.

166
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,222
I have no idea.

167
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,684
What are you hiding? Show me.

168
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,143
I didn't take it.

169
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,979
It's too old-fashioned for me.

170
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,606
All your watches look the same.

171
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,691
How can you remember?

172
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,610
No wonder you have trouble sleeping.

173
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,529
Just let it go.

174
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,280
It's no big deal.

175
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,074
So you did take it.

176
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,367
Give it back.

177
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,451
It wasn't me.

178
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,161
-Give it here.
-I said it wasn't me!

179
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,414
-Come on.
-What's wrong with you? It wasn't me.

180
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,749
It wasn't me, I swear!

181
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,507
I told you it wasn't me.

182
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,551
Who else could it be?

183
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,094
Ms. Do.

184
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,931
I'm coming in, Ms. Do.

185
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,771
Where did she go?

186
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,569
Do Da-hae…

187
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,780
Forget it. There's no way she took it.

188
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,242
How dare she steal from my house?

189
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,620
It reeks of alcohol in here.

190
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,918
What are you doing here?

191
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,713
Cleaning.

192
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,799
And what are you hiding?

193
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,968
This?

194
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,636
It's nothing.

195
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,929
It's just trash.

196
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,348
-Let's see it.
-What?

197
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,184
Let me have a look.

198
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,895
-My goodness!
-What are you doing?

199
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,772
I'm getting your watch back.

200
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,274
And clearing my name.

201
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,151
What's this all about?

202
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,986
Mom's watch is missing.

203
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,405
Who in our family could have stolen it?

204
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,740
You.

205
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,662
She was snooping around the vault

206
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,873
in the middle of the night.

207
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,500
Me?

208
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,253
No, it wasn't me.

209
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,139
I wish you wouldn't look at it.

210
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,974
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

211
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,270
Oh no.

212
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,526
This can't be.

213
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,487
Oh my goodness.

214
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,364
This is great news!

215
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,158
When did this happen?

216
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,535
This can't be happening.

217
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,788
Hold on.

218
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,624
Why is this…

219
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,419
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,880
I found it on your desk,

221
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,924
and I was going to hide it

222
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,426
in case someone saw it.

223
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,943
Bok Gwi-ju. Is that really your seal?

224
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,154
Did you stamp it?

225
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,363
No, I didn't.

226
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,323
Well, I did.

227
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,784
I mean, I may have.

228
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,619
I mean, I might.

229
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,121
But I haven't yet.

230
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,252
What's that supposed to mean?

231
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,254
The thing is…

232
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,464
Have you been drinking in broad daylight?

233
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,216
Why are you rambling?

234
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,718
Let me think.

235
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,012
Where should we begin?

236
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,763
Should we book a venue first?

237
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,683
We should at least
have a small celebration.

238
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,811
No, we should go
straight to the district office.

239
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,730
Make it official.

240
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,106
Let's meet her family first.

241
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,524
This is insane!

242
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,112
Sorry?

243
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,114
It only seems appropriate.

244
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,035
But she doesn't have any family.

245
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:03,952
Yes, she does.

246
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,996
She calls her Mom.

247
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,005
Well…

248
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,387
She took me in
when I had no one to turn to

249
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,474
after my father passed away
in high school.

250
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,352
I do call her Mom,

251
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,604
but we're not actually related.

252
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,813
So don't mind her.

253
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,734
What is she like?

254
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,822
Well…

255
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,076
So…

256
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,296
The sauna I saw in my dream?

257
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,881
I have a bad feeling about this.

258
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,343
Do you ever not have a bad feeling?

259
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,513
Maybe my dream was a warning.

260
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,349
We better do some digging.

261
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,905
Should I do some digging too, Mom?

262
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,366
Just put my watch back.

263
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,999
I-na!

264
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,166
What is this?

265
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,835
Your birthday's coming up.

266
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,379
I wanted a vintage watch
just like this one.

267
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,007
With a gold frame
and a brown leather strap.

268
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,842
This is amazing.

269
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,594
Thanks, I-na.

270
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,558
This is the first time I had a friend
who totally gets me.

271
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,851
The first time?

272
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,811
It's so pretty.

273
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,814
You're my first friend ever.

274
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,234
This is the best birthday present
I've ever gotten.

275
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,486
Hey.

276
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,781
-See you.
-Bye. See you tomorrow.

277
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,832
Hey, I-na.

278
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,709
Yeah?

279
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,626
I said see you.

280
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,756
See you.

281
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,140
I talked to Jun-woo for you.

282
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,434
I told him you're just a bit awkward.

283
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,061
Thanks.

284
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,690
By the way, I love your sneakers.

285
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,525
Hey.

286
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,194
You know…

287
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,865
Would it be too much
if I asked to borrow them?

288
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,535
-Do you want to borrow them?
-What?

289
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,412
I mean…

290
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,624
I guess I could try them on.

291
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,710
I don't know if they'll…

292
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,545
No way.

293
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,631
They fit perfectly.

294
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,716
-So cute.
-You can borrow them.

295
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,842
Are you sure?

296
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,511
Thanks, I-na.

297
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,845
We're so perfect for each other.

298
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,846
Don't you think so?

299
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,307
I love them.

300
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,188
PALACE SAUNA

301
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,116
Hello, sir. It's been a while.

302
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,201
I could use some help.

303
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,078
Could you look into something urgently?

304
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,871
Right now?

305
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,456
Yes, I'll be right over.

306
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,333
Right. Thank you.

307
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,628
Just a quick look should suffice.

308
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:45,006
A quick look at her eating out
or having coffee won't lead to anything.

309
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,924
BAEK IL-HONG

310
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,677
I'll catch her entering a motel

311
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,096
or getting intimate in a car.

312
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,932
Let me catch some bigger fish for you.

313
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,518
That won't be necessary.

314
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,477
Come on.

315
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,230
It may be more painful,
but it'll help you move on.

316
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,482
-Plus, it'll get you alimony.
-What?

317
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,777
-Isn't this woman your cheating wife?
-No way.

318
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,656
She's going to be
my son's mother-in-law, sort of.

319
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:13,577
I wanted to make sure she didn't have
debt from gambling or anything.

320
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,245
My wife is no cheater,

321
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,164
but she tends to be a worrywart.

322
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,133
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

323
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,803
Baek Il-hong.

324
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,597
Hold on a second.

325
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,265
Baek Il-hong.

326
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,725
Il-hong.

327
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,685
The name rings a bell.

328
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,107
Could it be that Baek Il-hong?

329
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,507
Who is it?

330
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,761
Well…

331
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,773
Honey, this may be shocking,
but you have to hear this.

332
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,150
I looked into the woman
Do Da-hae calls her mother,

333
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,277
Baek Il-hong.

334
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,779
And she's an ex-convict.

335
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,073
What did you say?

336
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,700
This retired detective said
she was a fraud and a loan shark.

337
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,787
She was notorious
for always collecting what she's owed.

338
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,873
She has never failed
to get her money back.

339
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,918
Anyone who didn't pay up wound up dead.

340
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,879
I'm with her right now.

341
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,506
At the house.

342
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,967
Why would she…

343
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,971
Hello?

344
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,433
I'm sorry I showed up unannounced.

345
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,478
I was hoping we could talk.

346
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,733
I'll leave you to it.

347
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,670
Please.

348
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,173
I thought I should pay you a visit.

349
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,426
I hear my daughter
has been causing you trouble.

350
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,386
Not at all.

351
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,723
She's been of great help to us.

352
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,100
She is quite good with her hands.

353
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,562
That's why the spa was
so desperate to keep her too.

354
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,315
But she quit her well-paying job
to move in with strangers

355
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,901
to do chores for them
before she's even married.

356
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,530
I consider her family.

357
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,991
Employers say that all the time

358
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,910
about their employees.

359
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,331
If this were a workplace,

360
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,708
at least she'd be paid and have insurance.

361
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,545
But as things stand,
there's no guarantee for her future.

362
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,463
Mom.

363
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,261
Would you like her
to get officially married?

364
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,096
That is important.

365
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,475
If she wants to inherit my building.

366
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,685
Your building?

367
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,021
Didn't you know?

368
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,232
You were talking with such confidence

369
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,818
that I assumed you had us all figured out.

370
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,653
Given my line of work,

371
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,073
I do pick up a lot of information.

372
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,951
But your family remains a mystery.

373
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,996
All I know is that you stay home

374
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,582
without ever interacting
with your neighbors.

375
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:54,130
Are you hiding a toad
that lays golden eggs in the house?

376
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,715
I think you mean a goose.

377
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,514
You're more coherent
than people say you are.

378
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,267
I heard your insomnia
was messing with your head.

379
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,813
Rumors are just rumors.

380
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,065
There's another rumor I heard.

381
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,485
It's about your late daughter-in-law.

382
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,572
You were quite harsh to her.

383
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,951
You never considered her family
until she died.

384
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,287
May I ask why?

385
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,914
That's enough, Mom.

386
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,043
I apologize on her behalf.

387
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,087
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,175
I'm sure you won't treat
Da-hae the same way,

389
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,136
but she's such a softie.

390
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,348
She ended up getting hurt
by some jerks in the past,

391
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,183
not once but twice.

392
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:53,064
And I don't want her to waste her time
only to get hurt again.

393
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,444
I won't let that happen.

394
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,238
I heard a rumor myself.

395
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,033
I now see
that it's not completely groundless.

396
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,203
I heard you had an interesting past.

397
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,207
I'm not proud of it,

398
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,168
but you're right.

399
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,837
I'm an ex-convict.

400
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,923
I used to have a daughter,
and she was sick.

401
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,469
She died while I was in prison.

402
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,431
As I was grieving,
I decided to turn over a new leaf.

403
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,808
I chose my current occupation

404
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,437
to atone for my crimes
by helping others get clean.

405
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,731
And with the money I make,

406
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,109
I take care of kids like Da-hae
like they're my own.

407
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,614
I guess you never know
when you'll find your calling.

408
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,825
Some wealthy ladies
spread the word about my business,

409
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:50,038
and now I make enough money
to let Da-hae live a comfortable life.

410
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,834
I can contribute a generous amount
when they get married.

411
00:29:55,877 --> 00:30:00,507
You must really consider her your own.

412
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,803
You must have
very high expectations for her.

413
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,388
I only expect one thing from her.

414
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,891
And it's for her
to get married by the books.

415
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:16,314
It's the only way she won't get
pushed around in your family.

416
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,781
You two were really hitting it off.

417
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,368
Now that you've met her,

418
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,703
should I register my marriage?

419
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,414
Just like you wanted?

420
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,252
Gosh, my head.

421
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,130
My head.

422
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:04,946
Mom.

423
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,281
What?

424
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,075
A heads-up would have been nice.

425
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,036
They were digging up dirt on me,

426
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,163
so I had to get the drop on them.

427
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,665
I wanted to speed things up

428
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,585
before the allegedly supernatural family
lost all their money.

429
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,670
I was almost there.

430
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,338
Did you use your signature move?

431
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,134
Did you play
the school fire survivor card?

432
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,387
-I don't want to.
-Why not?

433
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,764
Didn't you want this to be your last job?

434
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,434
-Do you want to keep working for me?
-Come on.

435
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,437
Hi, I-na.

436
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,608
So you're I-na.

437
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,195
I'm going to be your grandma soon.

438
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,573
You're so cute.

439
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,450
You're absolutely adorable!

440
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,620
-Let me give you some pocket money.
-You don't have to.

441
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,829
Grandma's rich.

442
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,338
I'll be right with you, I-na.

443
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,384
-Go on.
-Just do your job.

444
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,481
I-na.

445
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,025
Where are your sneakers?

446
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,489
I forgot to change my shoes.

447
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,916
I wonder what she got today.

448
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,961
HERE'S A GIFT, DA-HAE

449
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,261
It stinks!

450
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,721
They reek of milk.

451
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,932
Come on, it's not the milk that stinks.

452
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,851
That smell's coming from her,
not the milk.

453
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,436
Isn't that right, Da-hae?

454
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,896
Let's go, guys.

455
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,856
-Cheese feet!
-Come on.

456
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,067
Why won't she ever say anything?

457
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,569
-Say something!
-Say something!

458
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,911
Does she not have shoes?

459
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,247
Something stinks in here.

460
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,957
Someone get her some shoes.

461
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,136
ONCE
HYE-RIM INVITED BOK I-NA

462
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,891
HAN JUN-WOO: YAY

463
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,685
Hi.

464
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,104
Let's go to the theme park on my birthday.

465
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,022
Okay.

466
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,481
I'm in.

467
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:46,983
That sounds fun.

468
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,735
-Nice!
-What about you, I-na?

469
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,902
I-na.

470
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,782
I guess you didn't hear me knock.

471
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,871
What's up?

472
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,501
I have a question.

473
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,921
Did something happen at school?

474
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,891
Wait, are you hurt?

475
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,768
Let me see.

476
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,020
It's an old scar.

477
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,648
Really?

478
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,571
You're being bullied, aren't you?

479
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,490
I have friends.

480
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,075
I do.

481
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,576
Huh?

482
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,538
Can I go back to texting my friends?

483
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,083
Sure.

484
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,295
I knew it. You hold the key.

485
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,799
You mean the key
to the 50-billion-won building?

486
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,855
It's a spider. A huge one.

487
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,940
It's enormous.

488
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,360
You have a spider in your hair, I-na.

489
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,029
-What are you doing?
-What?

490
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,537
Nothing.

491
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,330
Have fun.

492
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,340
-Where did she go?
-Hello?

493
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,008
-Where'd you go, Bok?
-You ignoring us?

494
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,093
This is frustrating.

495
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,970
I'm in.

496
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,357
Five, six, seven, eight.

497
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:57,113
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

498
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,249
This hurts my shoulders.

499
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,459
How do I fix this?

500
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,046
Look.

501
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,009
Promise me you won't hurt yourself again.

502
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,180
I promise.

503
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,936
I feel fine already.

504
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,773
Ready for another set?

505
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,026
-Another one?
-Grab this.

506
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,361
Let's do it together. Squeeze.

507
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,282
-Squeeze.
-Squeeze.

508
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,493
-I'm squeezing.
-You're doing great. Keep going.

509
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,995
Grace.

510
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,624
Want to grab a drink?

511
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,542
I'm on a diet.

512
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,336
You need protein after working out.

513
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,546
How about some barbecue?

514
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,967
You can count it as a training session.

515
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,013
Hang out with me for three hours,
and count it as three sessions.

516
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,185
Actually, I have 12 sessions left.

517
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,440
You could stay with me all night.

518
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,776
Can you even last that long?

519
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,903
What?

520
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,113
Hey.

521
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,908
Let's be real. You're hardly a trainer.

522
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,409
If I get injured at the gym,

523
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,453
it might cost you big-time.

524
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,829
Can you afford that?

525
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,957
What are you grabbing me for?

526
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,917
You can't even lift pink dumbbells.

527
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,294
You little…

528
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,424
-What the hell?
-I'll give you a refund.

529
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,885
You were so busy staring at her

530
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,846
that it seemed impossible
for you to focus on your workout.

531
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,266
I'm worried you'll actually hurt yourself.

532
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,558
Well, she dresses like--

533
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,815
We're not responsible for any accidents

534
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,527
that weren't caused by defective equipment
but by your own carelessness.

535
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,196
Transferring your membership
will cost you 200,000 won,

536
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,241
and canceling it will incur a fee of 10%.

537
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:07,868
And guess what?

538
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,831
VAT is not included.

539
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,961
Jeez.

540
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,299
Thanks.

541
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,467
Hey.

542
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,930
Want some barbecue?

543
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,268
No, thanks.

544
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,333
You could use some studying.

545
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,793
Don't you want to be more professional?

546
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,921
This is just a side job.

547
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,214
My passion is acting.

548
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,430
You're an actress?

549
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,144
But I only get indecent roles.

550
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,521
Apparently, I don't look like a lead.

551
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,024
They say my body is too distracting.

552
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,569
I can be romantic, damn it.

553
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,989
People always judge a book by its cover.

554
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,741
My brother's the same way.

555
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,786
He fell for this innocent-looking minx,

556
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,329
and he's about to marry her.

557
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,082
Mr. Bok is getting married?

558
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,459
She's marrying him for the money.

559
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,880
She's already nibbling away
at my family's fortune like a rat.

560
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,134
What exactly did she do?

561
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,011
She stole my mom's watch.

562
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,638
And everyone thinks I did it.

563
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,014
It's so dumb.

564
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,182
No way.

565
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,851
Why would she take such a risk
for some measly watch?

566
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,437
She'll get a 50-billion-won building
once she's married.

567
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,528
Fifty billion won?

568
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:09,949
How do you know that?

569
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,955
Well, that's the market price
for the gym building.

570
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,500
And it belongs to your mother.

571
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,920
Everyone at the gym knows.

572
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,810
Do you still not want to work out with me?

573
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,020
A spot just opened up.

574
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,272
I'll give you a discount.

575
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:42,898
Hold on.

576
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,528
Why are you being so friendly?

577
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,115
I have to make a living.

578
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,367
Cheers.

579
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,886
Are you already done eating?

580
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,850
You should have some tea.

581
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,691
Is it possible to develop
a tolerance to tea?

582
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:31,238
It doesn't seem to do the trick anymore.

583
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,371
I'm home.

584
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,916
Hi.

585
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,128
Come have a seat.

586
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,301
Go and get some rest.

587
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,971
Okay.

588
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,732
Close the door.

589
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,036
An ex-convict?

590
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,832
She's gone straight now.

591
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,085
Are you trying to destroy our family?

592
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,754
How could you let a criminal
into our family?

593
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,214
Let's get this straight.

594
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
Do Da-hae isn't a criminal.

595
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,927
She may as well be.

596
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,224
We thought she was on her own,

597
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,352
but a crook's been
watching her back the whole time.

598
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,188
Mom, we have to kick her out.

599
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,027
But I saw it clearly in my dream.

600
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,863
You mean her wearing our family ring?

601
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,866
What if she stole that too?

602
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,289
The dream you had

603
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,375
wasn't telling you
that she'd be a part of our family.

604
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,629
It was telling you
that she'd steal from us.

605
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,755
It was a warning.

606
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,549
Good grief.

607
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,512
-It wasn't me, was it?
-What do you mean?

608
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,849
The one who saved you
from the fire 13 years ago.

609
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,062
What makes you think that?

610
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,358
I-na was born that day.

611
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,944
For me to have saved you,

612
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,947
I'd have to return to that moment.

613
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,368
But I can't do that
no matter how hard I try.

614
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,412
Is it true

615
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,623
that I saved you?

616
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,835
You said you didn't want to follow

617
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,714
the path that was laid out
by the future anyway.

618
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,841
What matters is the present.

619
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,555
How does Bok Gwi-ju
feel about me in the present?

620
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,393
You're evading the question again.

621
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,896
Do you know what that moment means to me?

622
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,565
Do you know what it took from me

623
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,068
and what it'd mean for me
to save someone at that moment?

624
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,278
I was desperate to save everyone.

625
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,615
But even after all the years
I was stuck in it,

626
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,326
I couldn't save anyone.

627
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,080
I couldn't save anyone
I desperately wanted to.

628
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,209
So how could I have saved you?

629
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,878
Because…

630
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,799
you love me.

631
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,510
If you were lying, just come clean to me.

632
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,601
I understand your doubt.

633
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,563
If there's only one person you can save,

634
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,565
why would it be

635
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,525
someone like me?

636
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,949
Do you think I'm not worth saving?

637
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,659
Because my mom's a criminal?

638
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,288
Then don't bother.

639
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,253
Stop evading the question.

640
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,091
You did that at the park too.

641
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,221
Who the hell are you?

642
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,474
Why you, of all people?

643
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,683
I don't know either.

644
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,187
How should I know?

645
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,396
I can hardly believe it myself.

646
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,191
Do you think it's easy for me to believe

647
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:21,570
that you'll go back in time to save me?

648
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,655
Well, it's--

649
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,122
It's not.

650
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,709
She evaded my question then.

651
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,836
Tell me about the fire at your school.

652
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,546
She must be hiding something from me.

653
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:40,923
What?

654
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,175
Where exactly were you
at the time of the fire?

655
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,802
I'd like some details on what happened

656
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,222
and how I saved you that day.

657
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,732
Are you sure I'm the one

658
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,609
who saved you?

659
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,082
Why won't she say anything?

660
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,714
Where are you going?

661
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,800
Back to cleaning.

662
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,799
Could it be that she's in pain

663
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,970
just from thinking about it?

664
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,363
I thought you'd left.

665
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,967
Where have you been?

666
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,973
Did you go back to me again?

667
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,351
So?

668
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,812
What did you see?

669
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,900
What was I doing?

670
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,736
When was it?

671
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,371
I mean…

672
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,087
Fine, don't tell me.

673
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,839
But know this.

674
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,135
That moment from 13 years ago

675
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,763
wasn't easy for me either.

676
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,433
I know.

677
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,228
At least, now I do.

678
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,569
Tie up those shoelaces nice and tight.

679
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,945
If you're going to run away.

680
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,656
Why would I run away?

681
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,659
What's that?

682
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,038
I'm bringing I-na her school shoes.

683
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:31,296
I think I'll wear
something without shoelaces today.

684
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,971
I don't see Ms. Do anywhere.

685
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,932
Did she step out?

686
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,064
I was also quite shocked at first

687
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,900
after finding out
about the woman she calls her mom.

688
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,819
But if you think about it,

689
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,446
she's striving to redeem herself.

690
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,824
Even though she can't change her past,

691
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,368
she's trying to make changes
in the present.

692
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,286
I'd say she's better than some of us.

693
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,670
Be honest with me.

694
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,713
You want to trust Da-hae, don't you?

695
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,550
You want to save her.

696
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,344
So what's holding you back?

697
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,097
What if

698
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,474
I mess up again?

699
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,060
I can assure you

700
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,480
that you're going to mess up again.

701
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:34,860
What?

702
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:40,407
But whatever happens with Da-hae
can be undone.

703
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,909
You can go back in time and fix it.

704
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,453
You can make a belated apology

705
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,372
and make things right.

706
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,960
With Da-hae, you can mess up
and make a fool of yourself

707
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,044
as much as you want.

708
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,134
Mistakes can be undone.

709
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,262
All you have to do is love her.

710
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,639
But think about it.

711
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,392
I can't even go back
to my moments with I-na.

712
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,146
How can I save Da-hae?

713
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,191
Da-hae might lead you back to I-na.

714
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,118
Try calling her.

715
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,668
Let's see if we actually end up
falling in love.

716
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,633
Will I be able to love again?

717
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,303
Do I deserve that?

718
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,421
So it was you, I-na?

719
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,173
Why would you do this?

720
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,676
You could've just asked me to buy it.

721
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,552
You're not even into those things.

722
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,182
I hope she likes it.

723
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,601
Don't tell me

724
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,812
you're being bullied.

725
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,149
Why do you never tell me anything?

726
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,415
Excuse me.

727
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,291
Do you know a girl called Bok I-na?

728
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,543
-No.
-No.

729
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,216
I BROUGHT YOUR SHOES.
MEET ME OUTSIDE.

730
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:04,843
I don't know which class she's in.

731
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,055
Hey, girls.

732
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,850
Do you know a seventh grader
called Bok I-na?

733
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:12,851
-No.
-No.

734
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,811
Thanks.

735
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,148
Excuse me.

736
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,316
Do you know Bok I-na?

737
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,027
-Bok I-na?
-I don't think so.

738
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,778
-Who's that?
-We have no idea.

739
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,906
Bok I-na?

740
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,992
Isn't she Hye-rim's lackey?

741
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,118
Is that her name?

742
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,162
She's invisible.

743
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,205
-No wonder they don't know her.
-Exactly.

744
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,090
I-na.

745
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:49,763
Here.

746
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,515
You didn't have to.

747
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,730
-Hi.
-Hello.

748
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,232
Is she your mom?

749
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,235
GOH HYE-RIM

750
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,863
She's so pretty.

751
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,284
-She's not my mom.
-What?

752
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,953
Then who is she?

753
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,123
I-na.

754
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,833
Can we talk for a second?

755
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,431
It was for her, wasn't it?

756
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:34,974
Goh Hye-rim.

757
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,143
You stole the watch for her.

758
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,312
-No.
-She took your sneakers too.

759
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,689
I'm trying to help you.

760
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,607
You know nothing.

761
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,945
-Would you rather talk to your dad?
-Don't tell him.

762
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,198
He needs to know what you're--

763
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,283
If you tell him,
I'll tell everyone you're a fraud.

764
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,245
What?

765
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,705
You want to marry him
so you can become our guardian.

766
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,381
Who told you that?

767
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,507
I'm the only one who knows.

768
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,175
For now.

769
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,263
Wow.

770
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,224
I've been keeping quiet
to see how things play out.

771
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,477
I wanted Grandma to get what she deserved
for her obsession with powers.

772
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,521
Plus, I got to see a real-life con artist.

773
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,773
I also kind of felt sorry for you.

774
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,192
What?

775
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,156
You said you'd been married twice.

776
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,575
Were those marriages fake too?

777
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,042
You married your first husband
to get back at your mom,

778
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,752
who left you to be with her lover.

779
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,005
And the second time was

780
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,008
to get back at your alcoholic dad
who neglected you.

781
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,138
What…

782
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,309
What are you?

783
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,936
But the third time isn't
going as you planned, is it?

784
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,521
Your feelings are getting in the way.

785
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,450
How did you do that?

786
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,951
Keep your mouth shut,

787
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,454
and I'll keep mine shut.

788
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,081
Have you been hiding your power?

789
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,899
Excuse me.

790
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,404
The visitor parking is through the gate
and around the corner.

791
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,447
Okay.

792
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,657
HANA MIDDLE SCHOOL VISITOR LOG

793
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,283
NAME: DO DA-HAE

794
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,704
NAME: DO DA-HAE
PURPOSE OF VISIT: SHOES FOR BOK I-NA

795
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,374
Mom might not believe me,

796
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,959
but you have to, Uncle.

797
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,920
We messed with the wrong people.

798
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,258
We never should have
gotten involved with the Bok family.

799
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,262
I got busted.

800
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,681
They know everything.

801
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,892
They know what I'm up to,
no matter when and where.

802
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,311
The past, the future…

803
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,275
They even know

804
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,611
things that I've never said out loud.

805
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,364
I'm freaking out.

806
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,408
They see right through me.

807
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,749
You have to believe me!

808
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,960
-I mean…
-Ms. Do?

809
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:58,761
Wait!

810
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,388
Ms. Do!

811
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,098
Wait!

812
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,525
-Don't follow me.
-Ms. Do!

813
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,971
Ms. Do!

814
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:43,848
Ms. Do!

815
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:14,629
Yes, hello?

816
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,008
I'm locking up the gym storage now.

817
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,594
I might be late for
the seventh-grade safety training.

818
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,805
Yes.

819
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,140
Right.

820
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,809
Okay, thank you.

821
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,252
What the hell?

822
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,007
UNCLE

823
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,512
Hey, it's me.

824
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,097
Can you come pick me up?

825
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,433
I'm at I-na's school.

826
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:10,935
Hello?

827
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,645
Uncle?

828
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,242
Stop.

829
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,791
Just let her be.

830
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,127
Hello? Is anybody there?

831
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,379
I'm locked in.

832
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,466
Can you please open the door?

833
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,505
I'm bored to death.

834
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,761
Sorry.

835
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,971
Where do you think you're going?

836
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,060
I'm bored. Let's play a game.

837
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,270
Come with us.

838
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,565
Let's go.

839
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,858
Come on.

840
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,195
Let's hurry.

841
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,863
Ta-da.

842
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:53,908
Cool spot, right?

843
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,584
What are you doing?

844
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,253
Let's call it hide-and-seek.

845
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,967
If anyone notices
that you're missing and asks,

846
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,260
"Where's Da-hae?"

847
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,347
the game is over.

848
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,350
That means you win, and I'll let you out.

849
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:24,355
But what if no one looks for her?

850
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,315
Then the game goes on.

851
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,525
Forever.

852
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,445
Where are you going?

853
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,115
Come on.

854
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,909
The whole world can be a seeker.

855
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,703
I'm sure someone will look for you.

856
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,206
See you.

857
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:43,958
Let's go.

858
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,378
SEONJAE GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

859
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,432
Attention. Bow.

860
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,308
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

861
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:14,905
He has no idea.

862
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,258
It's acting up again.

863
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,302
When will they have it fixed?

864
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,805
The fire alarm, the doors…

865
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,599
They're always fixing something.

866
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,350
Hey.

867
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,479
I smell something burning.

868
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,397
Me too. What could it be?

869
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:51,692
There's smoke in the hallway!

870
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:54,862
Hey!

871
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:55,905
Stay in your seats.

872
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:08,250
Guys, there's a fire! Everyone out!

873
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,796
Head to the main entrance!

874
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,717
Don't run! No, hurry!

875
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,302
What are you waiting for?

876
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,483
Hello? Is anybody there?

877
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:35,277
I'm locked in here.

878
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,571
Please open the door.

879
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,031
Please!

880
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,035
Please open the door!

881
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,420
Hurry! Head to the main entrance!

882
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,340
Hurry up!

883
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,177
To the main entrance!

884
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,846
This way! Hurry!

885
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,270
Please help me!

886
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,437
Help me!

887
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,075
Damn it. Whatever.

888
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,585
Help!

889
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,504
Please help me!

890
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,487
Help me.

891
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,047
No one came looking for me.

892
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,927
I was alone until the end.

893
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:35,356
It was a fitting end to my miserable life.

894
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,107
Or so I thought.

895
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,166
Do Da-hae.

896
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:07,680
Try to breathe.

897
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:09,390
Breathe.

898
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,615
How…

899
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:31,829
How did you find me?

900
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,208
No one…

901
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,837
No one came looking for me.

902
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,135
I thought…

903
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,513
nobody would ever come.

904
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:59,523
It's just like the last time.

905
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:07,156
There was a fire.

906
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,368
And I was locked in the storage.

907
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,290
Sir, there's someone
in the fifth-floor storage.

908
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,083
No. Don't go.

909
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,335
Fifth-floor storage?

910
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,586
-Please help.
-Please.

911
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,555
Seonjae Girls' High School?

912
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:34,933
Fifth-floor storage?

913
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,154
How do you know that?

914
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,497
It seems like…

915
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,251
I'll have to be the one…

916
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,757
to have saved you.

917
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,765
I'll save you.

918
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,103
At that moment…

919
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,773
a hope that I didn't deserve

920
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,609
quietly emerged in my heart.

921
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,612
I sincerely wished

922
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,031
that this man…

923
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,705
was the one who saved me.

924
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,898
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

925
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:35,971
Jeez.

926
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,432
Something's wrong with Gwi-ju.

927
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:39,725
He's working out.

928
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,895
Ms. Do must be helping him
recover from depression.

929
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,525
What do I have to do for you to leave?

930
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:51,487
I'm absolutely sure this time.

931
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,988
I saw everything clearly.

932
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,533
If he loses his hope again,

933
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,369
he might not be able to recover.

934
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,040
I have to see this through myself.

935
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,751
There's something I have to see.

936
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:13,425
