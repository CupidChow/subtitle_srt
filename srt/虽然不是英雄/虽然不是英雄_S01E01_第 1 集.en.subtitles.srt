1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,580
Bok Dong-hee.

3
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:39,998
Fly.

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,563
Bok Gwi-ju.

5
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,982
Go back to the past.

6
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,282
Close your eyes.

7
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,742
Come on.

8
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,749
Hey, don't.

9
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,917
Bok I-na.

10
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,543
It's your turn.

11
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,254
You're in middle school now.

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,424
It's about time you proved yourself.

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:37,639
Your grandma's a bit cranky
because she didn't sleep very well.

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,268
What about you, Mom?

15
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,604
I can't even get a glimpse
of the future anymore.

16
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,564
The Bok family is doomed

17
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,650
unless we recover what we've lost.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,903
We might as well

19
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,155
all jump into the sea.

20
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,366
Honey!

21
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,331
You should eat before you jump.

22
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,376
I hear the fish here is amazing.

23
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,339
It all just seems so bleak!

24
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,428
If the future seems so bleak
with your foresight,

25
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,555
you should be the first to jump.

26
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,099
We should be fighting for our lives,

27
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,351
not worrying about dying.

28
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,395
We must do whatever it takes to go back

29
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,480
to the times when we were our true selves.

30
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,400
We used to be able to go back
to the good old days

31
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,735
in the blink of an eye.

32
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,279
Let's go back to the way we used to be!

33
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,829
Did he go back in time?

34
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,502
Help! Someone's drowning!

35
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,671
Someone's drowning over there!

36
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,381
That is a person, right?

37
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,926
Hey, it is!

38
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,344
Someone's drowning here!

39
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,346
Somebody help!

40
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,702
"The good old days"?

41
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,051
What do we do?

42
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,223
Oh my gosh.

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,725
He's not breathing.

44
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,018
Is he dead?

45
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,730
Is he alive? Someone do something!

46
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
Hey, wake up.

47
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,263
Hey.

48
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,439
Se-yeon.

49
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,568
Se-yeon.

50
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,404
-Gwi-ju!
-Slow down.

51
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,288
Are you okay?

52
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,676
Gwi-ju.

53
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,803
Gwi-ju!

54
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,808
Thank you, doctor.

55
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,565
Why would you jump into the sea?

56
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,068
I didn't. It was an accident.

57
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,986
Yeah.

58
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,447
That's what I told I-na.

59
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,118
That her drunk dad
suddenly felt like snorkeling.

60
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,035
Watch it.

61
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,755
At least you're okay.

62
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,674
Be more careful from now on.

63
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,774
I didn't even get her number.

64
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,901
Ms. Bok has an appointment today.

65
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,278
The insomnia lady?

66
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,238
I heard she'll tip anyone a million won

67
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,615
-to get her to sleep on the massage bed.
-Dream on.

68
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,160
There's no way anyone is getting that tip.

69
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,704
"When did you open this bottle of oil?"

70
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,831
"It might have gone bad
in this hot weather."

71
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,708
And when she sees it's fine, she goes,

72
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,586
"How can it not have gone bad
in this weather?"

73
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,546
"It must be loaded with preservatives."

74
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,465
"There's no way this is natural oil."

75
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,883
It just goes on and on.

76
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,342
Can't she just take sleeping pills?

77
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,595
That prejudiced old woman?

78
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,306
She's too worried
about dependency and side effects

79
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,557
to take drugs like that.

80
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,225
Yikes. I'm not taking her.

81
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,852
-Neither am I.
-Me neither.

82
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,187
I don't want to either.

83
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,650
Someone's gonna have to.

84
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,319
Well?

85
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
Should I do it myself?

86
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,744
Would it be okay if I treated her?

87
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,079
Newbie.

88
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,165
I know you're good, Da-hae,

89
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,292
but you've been doing all the hard work.

90
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,002
Are you sure about this?

91
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,296
How else will I learn?

92
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,304
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

93
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,764
I'm Do Da-hae.

94
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,183
Would you like a cup of tea?

95
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,895
If it's one of those tasteless
herbal teas, no, thank you.

96
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,190
I made it using medicinal herbs
from Mount Jiri.

97
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,817
I love hiking.

98
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,364
I heard you have trouble sleeping.

99
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,909
These herbs are
supposed to help with that.

100
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,169
I guess it doesn't smell too bad.

101
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,757
Were you recently on a trip?

102
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,094
Your skin seems rough and reddish.

103
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,184
I'll go get some oils
that help soothe damaged skin.

104
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,876
You're quite strong.

105
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,420
Should I be more gentle?

106
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,880
No, this is fine.

107
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,466
I know there are many good oils
and products out there,

108
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,136
but I believe it's all in the hands.

109
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,721
I agree.

110
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,855
I like to think of my hands
as the carriers of energy.

111
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,649
Most of our clients come here

112
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,777
because they're tired
and want to feel rejuvenated.

113
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,739
That's why I go to the sea

114
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,365
or to the mountains

115
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,743
whenever I have time.

116
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,870
To absorb all the good energy

117
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,124
and deliver it with my hands.

118
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,876
I see.

119
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:33,257
I've been feeling heavy
like my body was being weighed down.

120
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,012
But your massage feels like no other.

121
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,892
I can sense a special energy
emanating from your fingertips.

122
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,312
It's something
you couldn't find in my family.

123
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,522
What might that be?

124
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,815
Good health.

125
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,195
Good health?

126
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,155
Yes, good health.

127
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:01,243
It's what my family needs
more than anything.

128
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,543
Are we already done?

129
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,922
You're up, Ms. Bok.

130
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,882
Did I fall asleep?

131
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,467
No way.

132
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,763
Goodness. How long was I out for?

133
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,977
Thank you, ma'am.

134
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,941
What's the name of the therapist
who treated me earlier?

135
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,777
Here she comes.

136
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,240
-It's Do Da-hae, ma'am.
-I see.

137
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,617
Hold on.

138
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,541
It was you, wasn't it?

139
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,376
At the beach the other day.

140
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,796
Gwi-ju!

141
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,758
I did go to a beach recently.

142
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,510
It was you.

143
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,513
My goodness.
I can't believe I found you here.

144
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,850
I've been looking for you.

145
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,518
I'm not sure I follow.

146
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,687
When my son jumped into the seaâ€¦

147
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,982
Your son jumped into the sea?

148
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,941
Right.

149
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,820
Did I help your son
get his shoes out of the water?

150
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,738
Exactly.

151
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,992
-He's very fond of those shoes.
-Yes.

152
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,785
Please take this.

153
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,246
Wait a second. This won't do.

154
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,836
You really don't have to.

155
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,796
You probably couldn't sleep comfortably.

156
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,592
You can only be so comfortable
on a bed that's not your own.

157
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,429
Would you visit me at home then?

158
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,314
You do house calls, don't you?

159
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,692
Yes, of course.

160
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,657
I'll see you at your home, ma'am.

161
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,430
Hello, Ms. Bok.

162
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,265
It's Do Da-hae from Illusion Spa.

163
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,777
Hello?

164
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,023
Ms. Bok?

165
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,210
Welcome.

166
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,050
Hi, it's good to see you.

167
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,676
-This way, please.
-Okay.

168
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,381
What a beautiful garden.

169
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,049
Do you take care of it yourself?

170
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,875
Do not come out under any circumstances.

171
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,803
Would you like a cup of tea?

172
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,141
One minute, please.

173
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,545
Excuse me.

174
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,176
Do you need a hand?

175
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,267
The electric opener
should be here somewhere.

176
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,831
It can't be safe to leave it like that.

177
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,796
Damn it.

178
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,883
I'll open it for you.

179
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,303
Forget it.

180
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,235
See?

181
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,320
I told you it wasn't safe.

182
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,746
Just leave it.

183
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,248
Please don't move.

184
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,707
You'll hurt yourself.

185
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,084
And you seem drunk.

186
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,294
My goodness.

187
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,131
What happened?

188
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,800
Did you do this, Gwi-ju?

189
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,717
Are you okay?

190
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,597
Wait a second.

191
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,151
All right.

192
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,195
It's okay now.

193
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,323
My, thank you so much.

194
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,200
You helped him again.

195
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,997
Have you said hello yet?

196
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,587
She's the lady who saved you.

197
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,963
Ms. Do Da-hae.

198
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,423
Isn't that such a pretty name?

199
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,593
This is my son, Bok Gwi-ju.

200
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,554
Goodness, you're a mess.

201
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,099
It's good to know that you're doing okay.

202
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,854
You must be here to collect your reward.

203
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,398
This lady here will pay you.

204
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,069
That's no way to talk
to the person who saved you.

205
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,154
Bok Gwi-ju.

206
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,113
Excuse me.

207
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,907
Gwi-ju!

208
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,824
Wait.

209
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,576
Gwi-ju!

210
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,022
Your parents must be very proud.

211
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,566
They have such a great daughter.

212
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,903
They both passed away.

213
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,614
Oh my.

214
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,324
I'm so sorry.

215
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,993
Anyone else in your family?

216
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,495
I'm on my own.

217
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,164
I used to be married,

218
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,583
but it didn't work out.

219
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,210
But you're so young.

220
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,009
I've actually been married twice.

221
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,469
How come?

222
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,562
Babe, guess what I have
prepared for you tonight.

223
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,648
Ta-daâ€¦

224
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,610
Babe.

225
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,238
My first husband

226
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,408
cheated on me every chance he had.

227
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,077
I said stop running!

228
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,083
My second husband

229
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,169
turned into a different person

230
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,004
whenever he got drunk.

231
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,927
I was too eager.

232
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,597
I really wanted a family.

233
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,351
Is that so?

234
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,938
Actually,

235
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,068
my son, Gwi-ju,
has been in and out of a marriage too.

236
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,862
His wife died in an accident.

237
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,075
It was a long time ago.

238
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,411
He got married in his early twenties

239
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,288
when he didn't know any better,

240
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,500
so his marriage
wasn't exactly smooth sailing.

241
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,004
And yet, he can't seem to
get over his loss to this day.

242
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:05,550
I guess that's just
how dedicated he is to love.

243
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,439
I'm home.

244
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,859
I'm sorry I'm late.

245
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,279
Where's the lady who saved Gwi-ju?

246
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,322
She left.

247
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,199
Did you not ask her to stay for dinner?

248
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,034
Butâ€¦

249
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,829
I bought a ton of groceries.

250
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,789
She left as soon as we were done,

251
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,083
saying she had a client waiting.

252
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,086
PALACE SAUNA

253
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,630
I'm so tired from waking up so early.

254
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,055
She's lost her loved ones,

255
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,057
just like Gwi-ju has.

256
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,061
Mom.

257
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,604
I'm hungry.

258
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,648
Welcome.

259
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,776
-Please hurry up.
-Okay. Thank you.

260
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,238
Hey, I'm busy.
Just eat some instant noodles.

261
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,865
Fine.

262
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,243
She's no junk food.

263
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,413
She's like homemade food, so to speak.

264
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,338
She's not like Gwi-ju,
who can't move on from his past.

265
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,635
Even after getting hurt by people,

266
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,472
she still seems to
dream of having a family.

267
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,392
Are you sure you're not just

268
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,770
intrigued by the fact
that she's all on her own?

269
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,899
Because no one will
come knocking on our door

270
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,567
even if something happened to her?

271
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,404
That's why you chose me.

272
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,440
This is new.

273
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,068
You were sleeping like a baby.

274
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,279
I was almost worried
because you wouldn't wake up.

275
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,905
I had a dream.

276
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,241
-A dream?
-It was all blurry,

277
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,369
so I couldn't get a good look at anything.

278
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,830
But you haven't had a dream in forever.

279
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,790
You should be grateful
that you had one at all.

280
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,004
What did you see?

281
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,256
I saw that woman. Do Da-hae.

282
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,342
She was wearing our family ring.

283
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,677
No way.

284
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,137
I'm positive.

285
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,891
She's the savior who's come
to restore all of our powers.

286
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,146
I should officially invite her
this Saturday.

287
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,623
Hey, I-na.

288
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,001
About this Saturday.

289
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,171
If there'sâ€¦

290
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,717
anything you want or need,

291
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,803
please let meâ€¦

292
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,811
Hey.

293
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,229
By the wayâ€¦

294
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,524
I didn'tâ€¦

295
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,819
jump into the water that day.

296
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,531
Okay.

297
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,565
Excuse me.

298
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,029
Sorry.

299
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,632
Excuse me.

300
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,592
Aren't you the owner of The Bok's Gym?

301
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,262
I heard you were hiring personal trainers.

302
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,061
RÃ‰SUMÃ‰

303
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,440
You can start tomorrow.

304
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,400
Just like that?

305
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,154
It's all about looks, isn't it?

306
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,454
A personal trainer needs more than looks.

307
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,708
May I have a look at that?

308
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,293
Who are you?

309
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,254
I'm the owner of this building.

310
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,676
Well, soon-to-be.

311
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,888
"Summer Hot Body Contestâ€¦"

312
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,726
A home workout channel withâ€¦

313
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,688
Hold on. 300,000 subscribers?

314
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
I'm pretty famous in that field.

315
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,824
I heard you can
buy subscribers these days.

316
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,249
You're famous too, right?

317
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,213
-No, I'm not.
-I think you are.

318
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,340
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

319
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,052
You're mistaken.

320
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,721
You run a mukbang channel, don't you?

321
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,056
It is you.

322
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,477
No wonder the sound of you
eating chips was so appealing.

323
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,396
So nice to meet you.

324
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,773
I'll see you tomorrow.

325
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,567
Ms. Mukbang Babe.

326
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,613
That littleâ€¦

327
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,543
How come you're at work?

328
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,880
The business would be better off
if you stayed home.

329
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,423
How come you're at the gym?

330
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,176
Did you mistake it for a snack bar?

331
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,971
This will be
the last bag of chips I ever eat.

332
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,056
I'm going on a diet.

333
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,766
Don't bother. You'll fail.

334
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,309
You'll get even fatter afterward.

335
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,812
You'll lose muscle only to gain more fat,

336
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:59,232
getting you more out of shape
and more prone to weight gain.

337
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,608
It's all meaningless.

338
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,653
It's so that I can get married.

339
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,822
And once I do, this building will be mine,

340
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,991
and your squatter of a gym

341
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,159
is getting kicked out right away.

342
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,960
Is that rent money?

343
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,258
Can you buy a present on my behalf?

344
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,722
Right, liposuction.

345
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,433
I see your concerns.

346
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,893
You came to the right place.

347
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,104
Please have a look.

348
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,567
I'm worried it might go wrong.

349
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,529
If you only get the advised amount
of 2,500 cc removed per session,

350
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,488
it's totally safe.

351
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,037
-Then why haven't you gotten it?
-Me?

352
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,752
I have undergone the procedure myself.

353
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,882
Are the results only temporary?

354
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,259
When you go on a diet,

355
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,638
you're merely reducing
the size of fat cells.

356
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,349
Liposuction, on the other hand,

357
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,936
permanently reduces
the number of fat cells,

358
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,188
which prevents you
from gaining the weight back.

359
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,028
What the heck?

360
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,655
I'm sorry, ma'am.

361
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,699
I can't believe
it landed right on your face.

362
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,326
Please give us a call!

363
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,503
Ji-han.

364
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,380
You seem tired these days.

365
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,799
Why don't you take some time off?

366
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,217
I'm fine.

367
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,429
I can't take any time off
until the business is on track.

368
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,555
That's just the thing.

369
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,684
The clinic can't get on its track

370
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:02,188
because the patients lose their trust
as soon as they see you.

371
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,611
I'll handle all the consultations myself
for the time being.

372
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,030
-Yes, doctor.
-Yes, doctor.

373
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,373
SUPERMODEL BOK DONG-HEE

374
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,222
Your card is maxed out.

375
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,890
What?

376
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,311
That's weird.

377
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,982
Could you try this one?

378
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,617
This one is maxed out too.

379
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,665
I don't understand.

380
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,295
Hurry up, will you?

381
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,259
I can't use this money.

382
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,352
Here you go.

383
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,815
I'm working, Mom. What's this about?

384
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,110
What? You're inviting who?

385
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,197
Our savior?

386
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,449
Thank you. That's all we need.

387
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,910
Thank you so much.

388
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,161
Have a good one.

389
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,166
What if she's vegetarian?

390
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,751
Maybe we should've kept it vegan.

391
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,253
This is more than enough.

392
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,215
What if it's too much
and makes her uncomfortable?

393
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,758
She might think I'm showing off

394
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,760
if she's not used to these things.

395
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,386
How's the air quality today?

396
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,347
I checked it three minutes ago.

397
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,849
Are you also worried the sky might fall?

398
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,154
What's all this?

399
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,824
It's a birthday party.

400
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,911
Didn't I tell you to dress up?

401
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,121
You're her dad.

402
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,498
We've never celebrated her birthday.

403
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,752
We were just letting you
have your mourning period.

404
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,421
But let's change that from this year on.

405
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,340
I'm home.

406
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,509
The gate was open.

407
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,179
Is our savior here yet?

408
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,305
Savior?

409
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,892
I invited a guest.

410
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,937
Hopefully, she'll be the savior
to save the otherwise dull party.

411
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,066
Where's her present?

412
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,901
It'll arrive soon.

413
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,821
Do you even know this person well?

414
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,241
Did you run a background check?

415
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,287
I can take care of it. Just keep quiet.

416
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,126
What's the tracking number?

417
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,378
Overseas shipping can take a while.

418
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,424
You have no idea, do you?

419
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,594
Mom hasn't told you
what she's got cooking up.

420
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,223
-Didn't I tell you to keep quiet?
-What?

421
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,937
You spent the money on food, didn't you?

422
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,566
Is there anything else I should know?

423
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,237
What's taking I-na so long?

424
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,697
I-na!

425
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,366
I-na! Bok I-na!

426
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,743
Hello.

427
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,166
Welcome.

428
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,919
Goodness, you didn't have to.

429
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,046
It's beautiful. Thank you.

430
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,464
Thank you for inviting me.

431
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,965
I should thank you too.

432
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,717
Hello.

433
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,053
You saved my little brother
from drowning, right?

434
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,098
It seems you hit the jackpot.

435
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,728
Are you really going to marry Gwi-ju?

436
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,273
-Sorry?
-Please have a seat.

437
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,108
This way, please.

438
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,401
Okay.

439
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,972
I thought you could use
each other's presence

440
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,391
since you share the experience
of losing loved ones.

441
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,143
Does that mean

442
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,981
you're trying to set us up?

443
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,567
We should introduce our family first.

444
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,156
It's my daughter's birthday today.

445
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,491
-Your daughter?
-Yes.

446
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,160
I have a daughter.

447
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,329
Bonding with a stepchild
is hard to begin with,

448
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,540
and she's a 13-year-old adolescent.

449
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,043
She'll rebel no matter how hard
you try to understand her.

450
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,462
If you try to discipline her,

451
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,673
you'll be labeled as an abusive stepmom.

452
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,428
-Me?
-I-na wouldn't do that.

453
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,097
I-na!

454
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,141
Come down, will you?

455
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,649
See? She's locked herself in,
ignoring everyone.

456
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,028
I'm Gwi-ju's big sister,

457
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,779
Bok Dong-hee.

458
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,449
People say sisters-in-law can be mean,

459
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,367
but this woman will bleed you dry.

460
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,579
She's been practically donating
the family fortune to men.

461
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,621
What?

462
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,166
You're making that up.

463
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,127
She's opened a wine bar, a cafÃ©,

464
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,795
and most recently, a clinic.

465
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,006
Thanks to that,
she's dabbled in a few things.

466
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,759
What are you right now?

467
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,260
A coordinator?

468
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,179
Wait, why aren't you at work?

469
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,640
You got fired.

470
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,225
Shut up.

471
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,687
See?

472
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,734
Can we have a word, Gwi-ju?

473
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,735
Come with me.

474
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,785
I'll go check on I-na.

475
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,713
We ended up making fools of ourselves,

476
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,174
but my family wasn't always like this.

477
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,011
We're all just a little bit broken.

478
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,641
You should eat something.

479
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,684
Don't starve yourself.

480
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,895
I have to lose weight.

481
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,689
I used to fly everywhere.

482
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,195
If only I could fly againâ€¦

483
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,699
Did you use to be a flight attendant?

484
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,624
I'm sorry,

485
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,794
but could you get me some water?

486
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,675
Sure.

487
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,456
I see.

488
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,500
You don't want a party, do you?

489
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,254
But it's your birthday.

490
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,798
Come blow out the candles on your cake.

491
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,346
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

492
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,188
Did you make seaweed soup?

493
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,568
I want your seaweed soup.

494
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,528
Really?

495
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,780
Of course I made some.

496
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,407
Will that get you downstairs?

497
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,548
Do you need anything?

498
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,008
I was just getting some water.

499
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,219
-I'll take that.
-No, I got it.

500
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,262
It's over there.

501
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,208
Bok Gwi-ju!

502
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,800
How could you pick this date
to invite another woman home?

503
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,886
I wanted to help you move on.

504
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,389
You simply couldn't seem to,

505
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,642
so I wanted to help you
by finding someone else for you!

506
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,561
Today is I-na's birthday as well.

507
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,479
Don't you care about your granddaughter?

508
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,232
You tried to kill yourself
right before her birthday.

509
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,316
No, I didn't.

510
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,318
So why did you jump into the sea?

511
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:56,657
You're too obsessed with your dead wife
to pay any attention to those around you.

512
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,829
You tried to leave your parents
and child behind and follow her!

513
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,709
Do as I say for once!

514
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,297
Se-yeon would never have died
if she hadn't married you.

515
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,347
I tried to stop you.

516
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,726
I told you I couldn't see a future
for your marriage.

517
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,853
But you went ahead and got her pregnant,

518
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,896
saying you'd make your own future.

519
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,149
And how did that turn out?

520
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,861
Your relationship was doomed
from the beginning!

521
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,237
Honey.

522
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,287
I-na.

523
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,243
My birth was the beginning
of their misfortune?

524
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,372
I know that.

525
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,127
My lobsterâ€¦

526
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,462
My steakâ€¦

527
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,298
Oh no.

528
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,926
Dad.

529
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,719
-What do we do?
-Cover that up.

530
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,222
Yes.

531
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,473
One at a time.

532
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,558
Okay.

533
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,940
Hurry, Dad.

534
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,150
-I'll bring this in.
-That's it.

535
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,818
Way to go, Dad!

536
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,908
Honey!

537
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,244
Mom!

538
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,704
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

539
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,122
-Honey!
-Mom!

540
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,206
-Honey!
-Are you okay?

541
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,208
I'm okay.

542
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,501
I'm just a bit dizzy.

543
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,752
You're sleep-deprived.

544
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,629
-We'll take you to the doctor.
-I'll get the car.

545
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,673
Let me help you. Be careful.

546
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,341
One, twoâ€¦

547
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,262
-The stove.
-Sorry?

548
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,264
I left the seaweed soup on the stove.

549
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,141
-Please turn it off.
-Okay.

550
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,507
Thanks.

551
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,137
-I was just--
-What were you putting in this one?

552
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,723
What?

553
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,069
You must've seen me
adding something to the tea.

554
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,362
That was licorice extract.

555
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,573
It adds a hint of sweetness.

556
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:48,991
Okay, bye.

557
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:26,320
LEE SE-YEON

558
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,951
Gwi-ju?

559
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,091
We told you not to show up
looking like a mess.

560
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,650
He's just upset.

561
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,234
He's worried

562
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,321
that Se-yeon would feel bad
to see you like this.

563
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,119
How's I-na doing?

564
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,746
I'm sorry

565
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,790
I couldn't bring her.

566
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,670
Se-yeon was always reserved,
just like I-na.

567
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,844
But I still don't understand

568
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,305
how you survived the accident
without a scratch.

569
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,184
Se-yeon once told me something strange.

570
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,687
That you had this special power.

571
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,315
Is that true?

572
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,447
It's more like a special curse.

573
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,494
It's already been seven years.

574
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,205
It's not a crime to survive.

575
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,374
So just live.

576
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,070
You're still here.

577
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,451
I heated up the seaweed soup. Want some?

578
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,578
There's some rice too.

579
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,164
Who knows what you put in it?

580
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,132
It smells delicious.

581
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,026
Fine.

582
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,195
I'll eat first.

583
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,447
Your dad wasn't trying to kill himself.

584
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,033
I happened to be there that day,

585
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,702
and I saw everything.

586
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,540
He only went into the water because--

587
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,457
Run.

588
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,044
What?

589
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,713
Run before you get more involved
with this family.

590
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,175
What do you mean?

591
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,387
Didn't you notice

592
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,265
anything off about my family?

593
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:25,809
I'm not sure.

594
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,769
Like what?

595
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,230
Are they hiding any secrets?

596
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,401
I'm only telling you this
because the soup wasn't too bad.

597
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,778
My familyâ€¦

598
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,660
has superpowers.

599
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,665
Superpowers?

600
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,292
But they lost them

601
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,335
because of their diseases.

602
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,922
-Diseases?
-Modern lifestyle diseases.

603
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,305
You don't like me, do you?

604
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,434
Why do you think my grandma
is so obsessed with sleep?

605
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,769
Because she's suffering from insomnia?

606
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,064
Because she has to sleep to have dreams.

607
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,858
That's how she sees the future.

608
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,321
So she sees the future in her dreams,

609
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,406
but she happens to have insomnia?

610
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,201
Aunt Dong-hee became too heavy to fly

611
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,453
because of her obesity.

612
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,457
What about you?

613
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,209
What's your lifestyle disease?

614
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,086
Smartphone addiction?

615
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,713
And what's your superpower?

616
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,093
Hold on. No way.

617
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,721
Do you have X-ray vision?

618
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,059
Is that why you've been avoiding

619
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,937
looking directly at me this whole time?

620
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,482
I don't have any powers.

621
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,442
That's why Grandma is so anxious.

622
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,657
What about your dad?

623
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,868
He could go back
to a happy moment from his past

624
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,912
by recalling it with his eyes closed.

625
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,707
Why can't he do that anymore?

626
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,877
Because he can't find happiness
in any moment of his past.

627
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,755
He's depressed.

628
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,541
You're back.

629
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,042
What are you doing here?

630
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,003
I warmed up some seaweed soup.

631
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,798
The kid hadn't eaten anything
on her birthday.

632
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,800
I-na ate something?

633
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,552
Seriously?

634
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,682
Don't tell me

635
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,060
that's a birthday gift
for a middle schooler.

636
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,775
I heard you lost the power
to go back in time,

637
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,111
but it seems more like
you're stuck in the past.

638
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:25,947
Who told you that?

639
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,533
Your daughter.

640
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,621
She's got quite an imagination.

641
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,584
I hope your time will start moving again.

642
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,377
For I-na's sake.

643
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,464
I've got depression.

644
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,925
When you get married to someone,

645
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,595
you vow to protect that person.

646
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,556
But I can't protect anyone.

647
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,728
But I saw youâ€¦

648
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,190
protecting someone.

649
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,150
My Bunny-bunny.

650
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,986
-It's too dangerous.
-We have to save her.

651
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,572
-My dolly.
-Please stop.

652
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,866
But Bunny-bunnyâ€¦

653
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:10,992
Let's get something to eat.

654
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,244
-But my dollyâ€¦
-Let's go.

655
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,455
Bunny-bunny!

656
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,697
Mom! Dad! There she is!

657
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,908
I found Bunny-bunny.

658
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,494
A superhero must have saved her.

659
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,163
A long time ago,

660
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,457
somebody saved my life too.

661
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,089
I was sure I was going to die,

662
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,842
but someone came to my rescue.

663
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,264
But for some reason,
I felt guilty about surviving.

664
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,644
I wished someone more worthy
had survived in my place.

665
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:07,525
All I had left in my life
was loneliness anyway.

666
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,737
Still,

667
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,573
someone risked his life to save me,

668
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,908
so I had to live.

669
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,827
Life may be meaningless,

670
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,288
but I try to live as happily as I can

671
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,165
for his sake.

672
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,671
You remind me of him, Mr. Bok.

673
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,343
You're just like him, aren't you?

674
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,553
You save other people

675
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,764
and help them carry on.

676
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,732
Iâ€¦

677
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,694
can't save anyone.

678
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,988
You're mistaken.

679
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,200
You may have saved me,

680
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,495
but that doesn't mean I'll save you.

681
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,164
Don't count on it.

682
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,774
Can I count on you to do the dishes?

683
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,904
Great job, my lead actress.

684
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,114
Have some rice punch.

685
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:19,991
Here you go.

686
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,001
Can I have some too, Mom?

687
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,502
You should watch your figure.

688
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,427
But she gets whatever she wants
because she's the lead?

689
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,846
Why do I always get the crappy roles?

690
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:44,849
Watch.

691
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:50,355
"You remind me of the person
who saved my life."

692
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,400
My heartâ€¦

693
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,911
That's just bad writing.

694
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,122
Who'd fall for that?

695
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:12,043
Hey, do you think only women
dream of living a fairy tale?

696
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,670
Men also dream of being the prince

697
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:17,548
who slays the dragon to save the princess.

698
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,761
That's how both her exes fell for her.

699
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,056
Babe.

700
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,035
You said it yourself.

701
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,830
That I looked like the person
you owed your life to!

702
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,591
Right.

703
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,554
I don't actually owe you anything,

704
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,763
but I'll repay you.

705
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,492
Plaintiff's counsel,
you may question the defendant.

706
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,620
Do you remember injuring Ms. Do Da-hae

707
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,664
by throwing a liquor bottle at her

708
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,666
while drinking at home on December 8th

709
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,210
as seen in this picture?

710
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,253
No.

711
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,797
I don't remember anything.

712
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,508
The wound appears
pretty serious in the picture.

713
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,093
She must have been in great pain.

714
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,179
Are you sure you don't remember anything?

715
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,766
I swear, I don't remember anything at all.

716
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,227
There's something fishy

717
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,271
about that Bok family.

718
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:56,689
What do you mean?

719
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,651
Did you find out anything else, Uncle?

720
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:04,989
Bok Gwi-ju's daughter told me

721
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,450
that her family had a secret.

722
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,119
They have superpowers.

723
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,580
Come to think of it,

724
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,375
it doesn't sound like complete nonsense.

725
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,507
I was curious how they became so rich

726
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,301
when the gym
was their only source of income.

727
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,387
Turns out,

728
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,515
Ms. Bok has precognitive dreams.

729
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,267
That means she can see
the winning lottery numbers

730
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,144
and stock charts in her dreams.

731
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,647
No.

732
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,031
Sleep.

733
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,450
I need sleep.

734
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,744
We thought they were pushovers,

735
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,329
but they have superpowers?

736
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,706
We're in serious trouble.

737
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,793
They might shoot lasers out of their eyes
if they find us out.

738
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,671
-Let's report them first.
-To whom?

739
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,923
The National Intelligence Service?

740
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,592
Or Marvel?

741
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,678
What's a "Marvel"?

742
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:19,063
Hold on. It doesn't end there.

743
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,566
Do you know what's even funnier?

744
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,942
They've lost their powers

745
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,945
because of their lifestyle diseases.

746
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,494
What a load of bull.

747
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,081
Lifestyle diseases, my foot.

748
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,291
They're just spoiled.

749
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,794
Let them try scrubbing
people's bodies all day.

750
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,462
They'd have no trouble sleeping.

751
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,048
They'd never gain any weight either.

752
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,844
Anyway,

753
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,929
the guy's sister bothers me.

754
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,015
Ms. Bok promised to pass down her building

755
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,850
to whichever child gets married first.

756
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,643
Da-hae already charmed
the lady of the house.

757
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,561
Isn't it game over?

758
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,523
There's another person
I have to win over to marry him.

759
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,067
Come in.

760
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,577
Hey, I-na.

761
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,121
Happy birthday.

762
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,437
Thank you.

763
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,143
Are you leaving to save someone again?

764
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,937
Who will save me then?

765
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:27,233
This bunny will protect you
while Daddy's away.

766
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,468
Se-yeon.

767
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,306
Se-yeon.

768
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,519
Answer me. Se-yeon!

769
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,523
Se-yeon!

770
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,365
I-na.

771
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:00,868
Se-yeonâ€¦

772
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,122
Se-yeon.

773
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,708
I-na.

774
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:16,634
No. Se-yeon.

775
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,554
I-na. Se-yeon.

776
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,644
Se-yeon.

777
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,817
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

778
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,555
Do some more digging.

779
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,016
Thank you.

780
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,352
For holding my hand.

781
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,562
What?

782
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,398
Do you need help?

783
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,399
Do you want to marry me?

784
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:14,733
No.

785
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,570
I have trouble exchanging favors.

786
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:21,782
I'll pass this building down to Gwi-ju
once he gets married.

787
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:25,536
I think what's more important
is to try living together.

788
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,748
Bok Don't Eat or whatever her name is
might beat you to it.

789
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,293
Could it be that you came from the future

790
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:33,544
and held my hand?

791
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,463
You held my hand.

792
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,299
Remember?

793
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:47,099
