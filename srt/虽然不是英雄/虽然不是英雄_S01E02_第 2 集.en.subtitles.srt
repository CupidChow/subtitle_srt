Look, Mom.

00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,435
I won the giant carp.

17
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,818
My giant carp…

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,363
Didn't I warn you

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,157
there will be a car accident
near the stationery store?

20
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,451
I told you to stay away from it.

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,663
I told you to take the long way around!

22
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,206
My giant carp…

23
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,874

Is that me?

Let me see.

33
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,045
At nine, I first learned

34
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,757
that I could to return to a happy moment

35
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,051
from my past.

36
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,606
Finally.

37
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,983
At last!

38
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,694
Thank goodness.

39
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,447
Thank you.

40
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,490
Thank you so much.

41
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,917
TRY AGAIN

42
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,880
Better luck next time.

43
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,506
Here you go.

44
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,183
-Hey!
-Wait for me!

45
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,852
-Pass me the ball!
-Over here! I want to play too!

46
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,823
-Oh yeah!
-Let me see.

47
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,161
Reliving the happy moments

48
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,996
was incredibly sweet.

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,581
I want one too.

50
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,208
-However…
-Bok Gwi-ju.

51
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,585
It's your lucky day.

52
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,462
Have a taste, Gwi-ju.

53
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,880
Go ahead.

54
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,806
It's so sweet.

55
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,851
-Stop it.
-Let me have a piece!

56
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,604
-I want a giant carp too!
-Guys!

57
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,689
Wait for me!

58
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,940
Seon-u!

59
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,317
Jae-hui!

60
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,902
Can't you hear me?

61
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,284
Excuse me.

62
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,661
Excuse me, sir.

63
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,579
Can't you see me?

64
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,373
Can't you hear me?

65
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,542
Happy!

66
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,878
Happy!

67
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,845
Happy!

68
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,723
What was a moment of happiness for me

69
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,558
was sometimes

70
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,060
a moment of sorrow for others.

71
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,021
Please help.

72
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,484
Please help my Happy.

73
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,240
-Happy.
-Happy.

74
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,201
Poor Happy.

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,378
Happy!

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,714
Happy!

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,816
Happy.

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,360
Don't die.

79
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,362
Happy!

80
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,943
But I couldn't change the past.

81
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,404
This moment

82
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,074
no longer brought me joy.

83
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,576
Even the most special moments

84
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,871
-became dull after a few repetitions.
-Happy!

85
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,456
The guilt of being happy

86
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,625
while others were miserable

87
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,961
made it feel

88
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,630
even worse.

89
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,552
And once the happiness faded,

90
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,512
I could never

91
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,098
return to that moment again.

92
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,769
-Are you ready?
-No.

93
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,941
-I'm ready now.
-I-na, let's go to Daddy.

94
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,443
-Come to Daddy.
-Here you go.

95
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,653
-Goodness.
-You have to support her here.

96
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,697
-Do I put my arm here?
-Yes, and here.

97
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,823
-Like this?
-Yes.

98
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,659
-There you go.
-Oh my gosh.

99
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,870
I-na, do you see Daddy?

100
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,372
Do you see me?

101
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,915
Another happy moment

102
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,959
for you to relive over and over again.

103
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,669
Absolutely.

104
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,338
I'm sure I'll be back all the time.

105
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,675
I-na, Daddy's here.

106
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,886
I-na.

107
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,679
Look, she's smiling.

108
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,097
-Really?
-Yes, look.

109
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,435
But even this moment

110
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,395
is out of reach now.

111
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,305
See you, Dad.

112
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524
I-na.

113
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,901
Watch where you're going.

114
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,070
Don't walk around looking at your phone.

115
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,988
That's how you get hurt.

116
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,917
I should never have been born.

117
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,503
I don't deserve birthday presents.

118
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,552
It's called a smart "phone."

119
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,637
Use it for making calls.

120
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,847
And you never even call me.

121
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,187
Okay.

122
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,718
May I help you?

123
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,761
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

124
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,015
No.

125
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,063
-I'm sorry.
-Watch where you're going.

126
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:06,981
Sorry.

127
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,733
I'm so sorry.

128
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,862
He's on the move.

129
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,579
Do you have another child?

130
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,498
An elementary schooler?

131
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,459
A kindergartner?

132
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,922
Don't tell me those are for I-na.

133
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,266
Looking for a better present?

134
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,229
These aren't much better
than that stuffed rabbit.

135
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,740
Do you need help?

136
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,246
Do you want to marry me?

137
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,790
No.

138
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,750
I'm just here to shop.

139
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,502
So do that.

140
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,014
Oh my.

141
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,682
How about these?

142
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,231
It's weird when kids dress like grown-ups.

143
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,607
I meant for me.

144
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,110
I'm shopping like you said.

145
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,741
Wait.

146
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,244
-Should I help you pick out a present?
-Nope.

147
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,578
Let me help you.

148
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,186
Give me that.

149
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,700
Can I get another beer?

150
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,712
For I-na.

151
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,345
I said I hated it
when kids dress like grown-ups.

152
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,057
Every kid wants to look like a grown-up.

153
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,934
Mind if I sit here?

154
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,728
Suit yourself.

155
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,854
It's all yours.

156
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,816
Wait.

157
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,904
Come on.

158
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,908
After I got you those shoes?

159
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,868
You can at least buy me a nice cold drink.

160
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,873
I have trouble exchanging favors,

161
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,833
being depressed and all.

162
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,047
At least take these with you.

163
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,972
They're for I-na.

164
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,925
Here's your drink.

165
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,634
-What's going on?
-Fire!

166
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,428
Everyone out!

167
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,013
There's a fire!

168
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,640
Everyone evacuate now!

169
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,523
Please evacuate in an orderly fashion!

170
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,941
This way, please!

171
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,151
Please remain calm!

172
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,403
Move slowly!

173
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,985
Yes, we're heading to the entrance!

174
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,863
Attention, valued customers.

175
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,198
We have confirmed

176
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,243
that the alarm from earlier
was due to a malfunction.

177
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,912
We apologize for the inconvenience.

178
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,623
We have confirmed

179
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,044
that the alarm from earlier
was due to a malfunction.

180
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,713
We apologize for the inconvenience.

181
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,875
Hello.

182
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,960
So nice to finally see you again.

183
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,296
I've been waiting so long.

184
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,589
I'm sorry.

185
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,507
I've been getting a lot of new clients.

186
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:41,138
I guess I wasn't the only one
who recognized your special energy.

187
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,307
It's all thanks to you.

188
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,060
But honestly, I'm a bit upset.

189
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,023
I want to keep
all your precious energy for myself.

190
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,694
Look how rough your hands have become.

191
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,116
By the way, why did you call me here?

192
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,286
Would you like a massage
after your workout?

193
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,331
Let's talk inside.

194
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,380
Hello, Ms. Bok.

195
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,758
-Welcome, ma'am.
-Hello.

196
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,303
Hello, Ms. Bok.

197
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,914
Are you the new personal trainer?

198
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,707
What's your name?

199
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,792
Grace.

200
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,543
Grace?

201
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,630
That's a pretty name.

202
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,014
Grace?

203
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,017
That name doesn't really suit you.

204
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,060
It can't be your real name.

205
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,895
Why use a fake name?

206
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,648
What's your name then?

207
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,775
Bok Dong-hee.

208
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,068
Bok Don't Eat?

209
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,366
You're so lucky to have a name
that suits you so well.

210
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,827
I'm jealous.

211
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,662
It's Dong-hee, not Don't Eat.

212
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,462
Let me think.
When did I purchase this building?

213
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,467
Gwi-ju used to be a firefighter for a bit
when he was a young man.

214
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,721
But I wanted him
to live a safer and healthier life,

215
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,556
so I opened this gym for him.

216
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,183
The building's value has gone up
quite a bit since then.

217
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,562
I see.

218
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,857
I'll pass this building down to Gwi-ju
once he gets married.

219
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:03,405
I understand what you're trying to say.

220
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,907
I do appreciate you
thinking so highly of me,

221
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,952
but this all feels very rushed.

222
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,496
Not just for me, but also for I-na.

223
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,292
What she needs is a caring mom.

224
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,961
She pretends to be mature,
but she's still a kid.

225
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,630
I'm actually concerned
that she's slower than kids her age.

226
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,470
I'm worried that we still haven't heard
the big news from her.

227
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,890
Has she not gotten her first period yet?

228
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,978
Given your age,
you should have a child soon.

229
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,023
There's a reason I'm so desperate
to have another grandchild,

230
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,941
but that's for another time.

231
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,615
Marriage isn't something
I take lightly, Ms. Bok.

232
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,994
To be honest, this isn't the first time
I've been set up with someone.

233
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,997
They must have thought

234
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,459
that I'd easily jump into a marriage
because I've been married twice.

235
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,668
No way.

236
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,962
That's not what I'm thinking at all.

237
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,341
If anything, that should make
your next marriage even more precious.

238
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,135
I'll make sure to do it the right way.

239
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,263
We'll throw you a lavish wedding
with a lot of guests.

240
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,350
I've already worn
fancy wedding dresses twice,

241
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,060
so I don't really care about that.

242
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,938
After all I've been through,

243
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,398
I realized that formalities
are meaningless.

244
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,900
I think what's more important

245
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,778
is to try living together.

246
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,489
-What?
-Absolutely.

247
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,492
You can't really get to know anyone
until you live with them.

248
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,576
Mom!

249
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,122
Hello.

250
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,165
I need to talk to you.

251
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,544
-We're in the middle of something.
-Just come here.

252
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,463
What's the matter?

253
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,715
-Just come with me.
-What is it?

254
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,134
Let's go already.

255
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,353
You said this building would be mine.

256
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,646
I'm going to get married.

257
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,064
And when is that happening?

258
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,567
I haven't even seen Ji-han in ages.

259
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,319
His clinic just opened, so he's busy.

260
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,446
Or he's not interested in marrying you.

261
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,118
You're the one who has no interest
in me getting married.

262
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,662
You barely know that woman.

263
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,872
How can you trust her?

264
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,999
She saved your brother's life.

265
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,333
Okay, let's talk about that.

266
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,210
The woman who saved Gwi-ju from drowning

267
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,547
just happens to work
at the massage parlor you frequent?

268
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,174
Do you think that's a coincidence?

269
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,009
It's not a coincidence. It's fate.

270
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,343
I dreamed about her!

271
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,929
You lost your power ages ago!

272
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,725
Marriage? I'll beat them to it.

273
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,872
Hey.

274
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,459
Did you just get here?

275
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,794
Do you know
how fierce of a battle I have to fight

276
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,464
to come to work as a depressed person?

277
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,093
For the first time in a while,

278
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,470
I won that battle today.

279
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,223
I see.

280
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,146
Where are you going?

281
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,147
I'm going home.

282
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,484
I spent all my energy on getting here.

283
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,196
By the way, thank you.

284
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,259
For holding my hand.

285
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,344
What?

286
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,472
You held

287
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,391
my hand.

288
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,475
No, I didn't.

289
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,187
You guys held hands?

290
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:15,865
My gosh, when did you two get so close?

291
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,075
It's not like that.

292
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,368
Don't be shy.

293
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,287
If he went so far as to hold your hand,

294
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,247
he's pretty much in love with you.

295
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,130
What is she on about?

296
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,091
Now that we know how he feels about you,

297
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,302
leave the next step to me.

298
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,138
Please don't get ahead of yourself.

299
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,726
Anyway, you look a bit tired.

300
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,353
Have you been losing sleep again?

301
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,188
I have.

302
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,024
Just a second.

303
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,901
Let me give you some tea.

304
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,320
Have a seat, please.

305
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,034
This is incredible.

306
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,581
She sleeps like a baby
every time she meets Do Da-hae.

307
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,133
May your dreams bring fortune.

308
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,519
Hey.

309
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,980
I heard you guys held hands.

310
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,482
Good job.

311
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,985
Don't be absurd.

312
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,904
That never happened.

313
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,906
I quite like her.

314
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,367
She helps your mom rest.

315
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:41,993
Good luck.

316
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,842
Did you have to be so stern?

317
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,345
Marriage requires sincerity,

318
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,930
even if it's a fraud.

319
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,559
Bok Don't Eat or whatever her name is
might beat you to it.

320
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,356
It's your job to put the brakes
on Bok Dong-hee's marriage.

321
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,651
And to do that,
you should watch your figure.

322
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,657
If it took you this long to hold hands,
when will you finally

323
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,534
get him into bed?

324
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,872
There was more to it.

325
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,711
He had this look on his face.

326
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,423
Like he was drowning
and grasping at straws.

327
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,180
It's too dark in here!

328
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,787
You've turned this room into a casket!

329
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,916
We better bring someone else
into this room soon.

330
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,462
You've been living in the shadow
of the dead for much too long.

331
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,007
She had another man's child,
for crying out loud.

332
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,052
Get off to a fresh start.

333
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
Once you have a child,

334
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,515
you'll want to live again.

335
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,683
I do have a child.

336
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,519
Her name is Bok I-na.

337
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,855
Isn't she your granddaughter?

338
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,440
I love I-na dearly.

339
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,527
But there has to be a reason
she still hasn't shown any powers.

340
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,738
There's no way she's one of…

341
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,365
She's my daughter.

342
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,160
Don't you ever say that again.

343
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,287
If you care so much about her,

344
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,207
stop lying around like a corpse.

345
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,585
Get back on your feet and be a proper dad.

346
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,006
Just how much did you drink?

347
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,551
Why the radio silence after holding hands?

348
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,970
I told you.

349
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,305
Be patient.

350
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,224
It hasn't even been that long.

351
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,683
It's taking longer than usual.

352
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,232
It's Ms. Bok.

353
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,443
I told you.

354
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,450
What's the point of meeting
Ms. Bok so often?

355
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,830
She needs to win the guy's heart.

356
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,414
As Da-hae said,

357
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,376
whether she can marry him
might be up to his daughter.

358
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,211
Do some more digging.

359
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,549
Find out how we can scratch their itch.

360
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:45,844
All right, class.

361
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,222
Has everyone decided
which club they want to join?

362
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,139
-Yes.
-Yes.

363
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,267
Does anyone need more time?

364
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,853
No.

365
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,895
We're all done.

366
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,021
I think we're good.

367
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,942
In that case,
head over to your club rooms.

368
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,075
I'm off to the movie club. Bye.

369
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,286
-Which club are you in?
-The computer club.

370
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,663
Really? I want to change mine now.

371
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,540
The one I'm in is such a drag.

372
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,960
Hey, I want to join the computer…

373
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,920
We're late. We better run.

374
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,922
I am! What are we watching today?

375
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,465
Alice in Wonderland.

376
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,766
MOVIE CLUB
CINEPHILE

377
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,353
Hey, close the door!

378
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:49,532
DANCE CLUB
ONCE

379
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,025
I-na.

380
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,110
What are you doing here?

381
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,237
Why are you still here?

382
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,907
Is everything okay?

383
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,536
Do you want to talk
in the counseling office?

384
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,871
Come on.

385
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,706
Is she new?

386
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,624
She's in our class.

387
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,150
-Hello?
-He picked up.

388
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,819
Hello, Mr. Bok.

389
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,946
You finally picked up.

390
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,698
I'm I-na's homeroom teacher.

391
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,909
Right, hello.

392
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,828
I wanted to talk to you about something.

393
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,331
Club participation
is mandatory at our school.

394
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,418
During club time today,
I-na seemed lost in the hallway

395
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,837
because she hadn't joined one.

396
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,590
This could be a bit upsetting,

397
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,636
but I-na can't seem to
get along with her classmates.

398
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,388
She's not being bullied or anything,

399
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,723
but how should I put this?

400
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,891
It's as if she were invisible.

401
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,644
I know you're busy,

402
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,188
but please take more interest
in her school life.

403
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,275
You're also not registered
on our newsletter app.

404
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,944
I've even been giving I-na hard copies,

405
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,238
but she's yet to return them
with your signature.

406
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,656
I'd appreciate your help.

407
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,866
Yes, of course.

408
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,952
I'm sorry.

409
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,537
Okay.

410
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,054
I LOVE YOU, MOM
I LOVE YOU, DAD

411
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:48,211
GUARDIAN SIGNATURE

412
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,195
I put all the liquor away.

413
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,701
-Let's go out.
-What?

414
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,664
Drinking alone is bad for you.

415
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,793
Why don't we get you a drink outside?

416
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,591
This way, please.

417
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,811
Here we are.

418
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,107
The rest of your party is here.

419
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,734
Is someone in there?

420
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,239
You made it.

421
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,629
I never said I'd drink with you.

422
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,923
The groom enters!

423
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,846
You obviously like each other,

424
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,017
but you seemed to be holding back
to respect each other's boundaries.

425
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,978
So I thought you could
spend some time together over drinks.

426
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,023
Drinks?

427
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,691
Why not?

428
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,366
Have fun, you two.

429
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,869
-Stay and join us.
-No, thanks.

430
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,705
Please.

431
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,033
I'm not entirely comfortable
with this either,

432
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,534
but I had no choice.

433
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,372
Should I pour you a drink?

434
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,518
That won't do.

435
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,897
My mother was right.

436
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,607
It's never a good idea

437
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,527
to hold back.

438
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,087
Hello.

439
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,881
Is he done for the day?

440
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,132
No, he's with his last patient.

441
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,470
I guess I'll wait.

442
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,768
Why is that in the corner?

443
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,772
Dr. Jo told us to put it away.

444
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,946
I totally forgot.

445
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,323
I asked him to put it away.

446
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,036
I thought the colors were fading.

447
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,162
Of course.

448
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,573
Bear with me.

449
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,381
-That tickles.
-It's okay.

450
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,230
He's not with a patient, is he?

451
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,606
He is, but…

452
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,985
What's going on?

453
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,182
Dong-hee.

454
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,933
Bok Don't Eat, is that you?

455
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,436
"Bok Don't Eat"?

456
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,022
Is this why you told me to take time off?

457
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,482
What are you talking about?

458
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,983
I'm with a patient.

459
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,195
It's way past closing hours.

460
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,238
Oh no. Do you need to close up?

461
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,532
Let me buy you dinner or something.

462
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,451
Why would you do that?

463
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,830
I just feel bad
for keeping him here so late.

464
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,542
Give me a call.

465
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,674
It seems like someone already had dinner.

466
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,469
What did you have?

467
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,013
Black bean noodles?

468
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,536
I had no idea a medical examination

469
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,788
could be so amusing and intimate.

470
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,706
She was there about her knee creases.

471
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,334
I was just humoring her
because she was an influencer.

472
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,795
She has 300,000 subscribers,

473
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,130
so I thought she could help
promote the clinic.

474
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,029
Let's get married
earlier than we had planned.

475
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,158
You would never have to
worry about rent again.

476
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,785
Well?

477
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,373
Just getting married
won't get us that building.

478
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:05,874
We'd have to have a child.

479
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,626
Exactly.

480
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,045
-Before we get too old--
-I want to get married

481
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,964
with a clear conscience.

482
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,551
I won't marry you until I've paid back

483
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,928
all the money
you loaned me for the clinic.

484
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,013
Never.

485
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:42,620
Focus on your upper body as you pull.

486
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,330
Do you see how it's moving?

487
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,290
Okay, good.

488
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,125
Now it's your turn.

489
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,669
Try grabbing the bar.

490
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,837
Hi there.

491
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,844
Let's get a wider grip on that.

492
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,809
One.

493
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,603
Two.

494
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,562
Three.

495
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,190
Four.

496
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,775
Five.

497
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,110
You're doing great.

498
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,108
I-NA

499
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,777
The number you are
trying to reach is not available.

500
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,863
Please leave a message after the tone.

501
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,449
I-NA

502
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,960
BOK I-NA

503
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,381
BOK I-NA

504
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,176
The number you are trying to reach…

505
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,183
It's called a smart "phone."

506
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,102
Use it for making calls.

507
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,396
And you never even call me.

508
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,820
DAD

509
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,827
Dad.

510
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,623
I'm in the restroom at Jungang Park.

511
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,792
-Can you come get me?
-Is this I-na?

512
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,712
What's the matter?

513
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,965
Where's my dad?

514
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,133
Well, the thing is…

515
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:30,055
He can't come to you right now.

516
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,724
So I'll come to you.

517
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,726
I'm nearby.

518
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,769
I'll be right there.

519
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,896
But why do you need…

520
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,898
Is something wrong?

521
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,109
Never mind.

522
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,035
Mr. Bok.

523
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,582
I-na just called.

524
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,459
I-na?

525
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,086
I-na…

526
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,423
She just called you

527
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,758
and asked you to come get her.

528
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:11,138
She almost sounded like
she was being chased by someone.

529
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,806
I-na…

530
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,143
You don't even know where she is!

531
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,563
I-na.

532
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,023
-I-na.
-Excuse me.

533
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,608
-Yes?
-You haven't paid.

534
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,067
-Right.
-It's 640,000 won.

535
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,068
What?

536
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,865
Sorry.

537
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,618
Here you go.

538
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,460
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION
640,000 WON

539
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:55,849
Mr. Bok.

540
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,436
Are you okay?

541
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,523
Just stay here.

542
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,858
I'll go check on her, okay?

543
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,154
I-na called me.

544
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,864
She called me.

545
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,866
I have to go to her.

546
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,493
-I have to…
-There, I got you.

547
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,036
-Watch your step.
-She needs me.

548
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,829
Hold on.

549
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,539
Oh my goodness.

550
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,585
Steady.

551
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,586
Watch your step.

552
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,610
Oh my gosh!

553
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,495
It's that way.

554
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,003
Over there.

555
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,755
I-na.

556
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,134
Is she out of toilet paper?

557
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,262
Over there, Mr. Bok.

558
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,764
The restroom's over there.

559
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,187
That bastard.

560
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,487
Hey.

561
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,907
Why are you loitering
around the ladies' room?

562
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,534
Well?

563
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,496
You little…

564
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,374
Good grief.

565
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,630
Are you okay?

566
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,134
I'm not letting you go.

567
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,051
Don't.

568
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,971
You're dead meat.

569
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,285
Are you leaving to save someone again?

570
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,204
Who will save me then?

571
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,097
I-na can't seem to
get along with her classmates.

572
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,225
It's as if she were invisible.

573
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,313
Dad?

574
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,426
Don't you dare come
near my daughter again, got it?

575
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,896
Dad.

576
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,525
I-na.

577
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,696
Good job. Now leave.

578
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,323
I-na.

579
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,368
Are you okay, I-na?

580
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,455
Who's that man?

581
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,085
Don't worry about him.

582
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,588
I beat him to a pulp.

583
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,423
But why?

584
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,924
What did he do?

585
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,096
You can be honest with me.

586
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,848
Everything's okay now.

587
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,850
So come on out.

588
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:07,767
Come on.

589
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,479
-Let's go.
-Just a second.

590
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,482
I-na.

591
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,651
Why did you ask your dad to come?

592
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,077
Hello.

593
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,571
I-na.

594
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,324
Stand still.

595
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,660
Move your hands.

596
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,627
Congratulations.

597
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,372
Hey, I-na.

598
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,084
-Congrat--
-Don't say it!

599
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,724
Thank you.

600
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,393
Bye.

601
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,738
Good night.

602
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,993
Want to grab a drink?

603
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,543
Are you going to share this time?

604
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,395
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

605
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,773
I heard something breaking.

606
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,276
Didn't you see how
that guy in the helmet went flying?

607
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,653
That was the sound…

608
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,907
of his helmet getting cracked.

609
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,878
Anyway, thank you for helping I-na.

610
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,672
But stop making me thank you.

611
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,175
I'm not capable of feeling gratitude.

612
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,220
If I were, I wouldn't have depression.

613
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,846
Frankly, I find it uncomfortable.

614
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,723
I can't do anything for you.

615
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,021
But you already did.

616
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,442
You were kind enough to hold my hand.

617
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,530
Why do you keep lying about that?

618
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,119
Are you playing dumb?

619
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,829
Where and when exactly?

620
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,210
At the mall.

621
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,378
When the fire alarm went off.

622
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,923
It's not like we slept together
or anything.

623
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,466
We just held hands.

624
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,301
Why do you keep denying it?

625
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,887
Unbelievable.

626
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,227
Could it be

627
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,231
that you came from the future
and held my hand?

628
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,818
You can travel back in time, right?

629
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,950
That's not true.

630
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,077
I heard you could go back
to a happy moment.

631
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,662
No, I can't.

632
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,830
Right.

633
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,249
You've lost your power.

634
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,044
What if you recovered from depression?

635
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,547
What if you were happy again?

636
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,306
Could it be that you were happy

637
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,558
when you were with me?

638
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,187
No way.

639
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,689
Close your eyes and think hard.

640
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,821
Who knows?

641
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,406
You might be able to go back.

642
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,286
Even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to hold your hand.

643
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,416
I can't touch anything in the past.

644
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,468
Bok Don't Eat is still going strong.

645
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,638
She's going to throw up.

646
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,488
Why is that in the corner?

647
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:54,822
Dr. Jo told us to put it away.

648
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,618
I want to fly.

649
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,745
Just like I used to.

650
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,750
I want to fly!

651
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,224
Stay with me.

652
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,934
Keep it together!

653
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,980
Breathe with me. Deep breaths.

654
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,991
Good. Slowly.

655
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,166
You're doing great.

656
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,489
Don't you want to go back?

657
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,410
To the good old days?

658
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,412
Like I said, I can't.

659
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,205
I don't find

660
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,583
any of my past moments

661
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,461
happy anymore.

662
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,716
Are you seriously saying
you have nothing left

663
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,551
that you remember fondly?

664
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,354
What about the day
you learned to ride a bike?

665
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,856
You never forget that moment.

666
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,485
No? In that case…

667
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,447
The first time you tried shaved ice.

668
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,576
You remember that?

669
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,872
I'd never had it until high school.

670
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,718
What about the day I-na was born?

671
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,805
Another happy moment

672
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,057
for you to relive over and over again.

673
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:27,850
Do you see me?

674
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:29,977
I-na.

675
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,447
You're unbelievable.

676
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,125
Actually,

677
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,879
I might have the ability
to travel back in time too.

678
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,218
Seeing I-na reminds me of my childhood.

679
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,471
I grew up without a mom too.

680
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,725
My dad was drunk all the time.

681
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,062
I was alone.

682
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:15,940
Even then,

683
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,777
I grew up fine, all on my own.

684
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,573
Or so I thought.

685
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,576
But whenever I see I-na,

686
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,204
I keep going back

687
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,040
to my lonely childhood.

688
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,636
I can see where Ms. Bok is coming from.

689
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,848
I-na definitely needs someone.

690
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,855
Remember that stuffed rabbit I got her?

691
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,317
When she was little,

692
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,153
I was never there for her.

693
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,865
So I got her a stuffed rabbit,

694
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,035
saying it'd protect her on my behalf.

695
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,289
I see.

696
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,124
I gave her another one

697
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,503
because I still can't be there for her

698
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,963
when I'm such a mess.

699
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,179
But she threw it away.

700
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,600
You're right.

701
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,936
I-na needs someone

702
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,731
who can protect her on my behalf.

703
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,692
But…

704
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,532
I don't want you
to throw your life down the drain.

705
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,077
That being said…

706
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:53,788
stay away from me.

707
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,457
Don't make me want to hold on to you.

708
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,090
But you already did.

709
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,059
You held my hand.

710
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,105
Remember?

711
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,282
GUARDIAN SIGNATURE
BOK GWI-JU

712
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,587
I held her hand?

713
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:47,008
But why would she
commit herself to such a lie?

714
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,135
Could it be

715
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:53,347
that you came from the future
and held my hand?

716
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,312
But that makes no sense.

717
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,023
Close your eyes and think hard.

718
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:03,941
Who knows?

719
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,485
You might be able to go back.

720
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,329
No way.

721
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,374
How can this be?

722
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,911
Fire!

723
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,247
Everyone out!

724
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,290
There's a fire!

725
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,959
Everyone evacuate now!

726
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,962
Please evacuate in an orderly fashion!

727
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,547
This way, please!

728
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,923
Please remain calm!

729
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:37,928
At the mall.

730
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,056
When the fire alarm went off.

731
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,683
Please come this way.

732
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,103
This way, please.

733
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,773
Please remain calm!

734
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,566
Let's slow down a bit!

735
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,073
You held

736
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,576
my hand.

737
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,641
You were kind enough

738
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,019
to hold my hand.

739
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,600
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

740
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,173
I can touch someone in my past?

741
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,841
Aren't you curious?

742
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,804
About why Do Da-hae was
wearing the family ring in my dream?

743
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,097
Do Da-hae.

744
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,556
Who the hell are you?

745
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,268
Why can I touch you,
and why do I keep going back to you?

746
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,936
What the hell did you do to me?

747
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:15,771
Are you asking me out?

748
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,898
I tried to be brave,

749
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,359
since you let me into your heart.

750
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,111
They're going to live together?

751
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:25,114
This family really is doomed.

752
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,659
Let's bleed them dry.

753
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,953
Make sure you get enough evidence.

754
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:33,414
They might actually have superpowers.

755
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,958
She just won't listen.

756
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:39,086
I told her to run.

757
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:46,218
