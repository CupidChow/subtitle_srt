00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:40,999
It was yellow.

3
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,876
It was blue.

4
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,336
I'm positive it was yellow.

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,255
-No, it was blue.
-What?

6
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,549
I've watched that movie so many times.

7
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,760
I was a huge fan of that actress.

8
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,138
Wanna bet?

9
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,433
-Winner gets a wish.
-You're on.

10
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,353
-Let me look it up.
-Hold on.

11
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,148
Why don't you go back
and see for yourself?

12
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,568
You should be able to do that
if you were such a fan.

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,738
Maybe I will.

14
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,534
I watched it at my friend's
in high school.

15
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,913
-I never cry during movies, okay?
-Okay.

16
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,998
But with that one,

17
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,293
I bawled my eyes out with my friends.

18
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,047
That's great.
You'll get to see your friends too.

19
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,718
Fine. I'll be right back.

20
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,345
See you.

21
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,562
I won…

22
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:57,867
Da-hae.

23
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,036
Da-hae.

24
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,132
What…

25
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,854
Why?

26
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,904
5 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

27
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,541
Welcome.

28
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,004
You actually came.

29
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,507
You're a perfect fit for this family.

30
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,677
You have superpower-grade shamelessness.

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,348
You're awfully chatty
for someone who'll be out of here soon.

32
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,351
You said you'd start your own family.

33
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,270
Take your sarcasm to your own place.

34
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,398
Have a seat. Don't mind her.

35
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,820
Join us, Ms. Bok.

36
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,489
"Ms. Bok"?

37
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,118
Did you really just call me that?

38
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,161
That's my mom's name.

39
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,496
Come on.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,249
Call me Dong-hee.

41
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,877
But that's as far as I'll allow today.

42
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,712
I'm not eating with you.

43
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,343
Come on.

44
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,874
Are you not hungry?

45
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,545
This just feels so surreal.

46
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,048
We're eating together as a family.

47
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,968
You're back in the house,

48
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,844
as if nothing ever happened.

49
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,223
And you let Da-hae into the family.

50
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,521
It almost seems too good to be true.

51
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,731
I'm just grateful.

52
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,652
No one can defy what I see in my dreams.

53
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,412
I had a dream…

54
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,622
7 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

55
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,582
…where we held a funeral without a body.

56
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,877
Who was it for?

57
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,963
Bok Gwi-ju.

58
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,382
My own son.

59
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,177
He's going to go back in time
to save you from the fire 13 years ago.

60
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,139
He won't make it back
because he'll die in the fire.

61
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,016
We won't even be able to recover his body.

62
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,518
That moment will

63
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,687
finally…

64
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,440
destroy Gwi-ju.

65
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,527
We can try to keep that from happening.

66
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,447
The future I see in my dream
is inevitable.

67
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,992
We should tell Gwi-ju
not to go back to that moment.

68
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,620
He would gladly jump into the fire
even if he knew he'd die.

69
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,167
This is crazy.

70
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,211
We should at least try to convince him!

71
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,923
There must be a way.

72
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,384
I've tried everything a long time ago.

73
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,809
I dreamed about my own father's death.

74
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,812
I tried everything I could.

75
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,817
But the harder I tried to get away,
the faster fate caught up with me.

76
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,319
As if it were mocking me.

77
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,155
There's only one thing we can do.

78
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,365
Keeping him happy

79
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,119
for as long as he's around.

80
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,332
I'll let him do whatever he wants,

81
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,920
even if it means
letting him marry a swindler.

82
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,131
Move in with us.

83
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,676
No.

84
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,720
This is ridiculous.

85
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,475
How can I stay by his side,
knowing he'll die because of me?

86
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,685
I can't do that.

87
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,895
You're a swindler.

88
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,313
So swindle him.

89
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,109
-What?
-Give him a perfect moment of happiness.

90
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:46,322
Think of it as the last scam
you pull on him.

91
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,829
-Ms. Bok.
-Do you think this is easy for me?

92
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm letting you into my family,

93
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,834
knowing you'll be the death of him.

94
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,255
This is all for Gwi-ju's sake.

95
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,382
Please.

96
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,302
I'm begging you.

97
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,022
How's I-na?

98
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,775
Is everything okay at her school?

99
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,570
Who was the last to leave the gym?

100
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,410
Me?

101
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,998
Weren't you the last one to leave?

102
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,376
We all left the gym together,
but you went back in.

103
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,587
Right, guys?

104
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,963
-Yes.
-Yes.

105
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,091
Now I remember.

106
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,510
You guys didn't clean up after eating,

107
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,345
so I went back in to take care of it.

108
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,556
-Wow.
-What?

109
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,853
Lying will only make things worse.

110
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,693
You're the ones who looked down on her
and teased her.

111
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,778
It wasn't me.

112
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,238
I swear.

113
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,574
Damn it, it wasn't me.

114
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,037
Hye-rim, stay behind.

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,288
The rest of you can go.

116
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,008
It really wasn't me.

117
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,718
I didn't even know I-na was there.

118
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,636
I swear.

119
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,553
Either way,

120
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,681
one of you locked the door
while you were there.

121
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,600
I won't take further action

122
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,770
because there's no proof,
and I-na doesn't want anyone punished.

123
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,979
But…

124
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,565
this better not happen again.

125
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,234
Got it?

126
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm so shocked by Hye-rim.

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,614
She pretended to be so nice and cool,

128
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,407
taking care of the loner,

129
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,618
and then locked I-na in the storage?

130
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,162
She gives me the shivers.

131
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,623
I think I know why she did it.

132
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,582
-Why?
-Why?

133
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,877
I-na was the one that Jun-woo asked out.

134
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
-Really?
-No way.

135
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,298
I-na and Jun-woo
are officially together now.

136
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,761
She must have gotten jealous
and shown her true self.

137
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,804
She's so scary.

138
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,347
I know, she's so two-faced.

139
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,393
In the back of my mind,
I always knew she was bad news.

140
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
-Let's go.
-Unbelievable.

141
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,313
What a poser.

142
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,606
Let's just ignore her.

143
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,195
You believe me, right?

144
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,824
It wasn't me.

145
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,701
I can find out if it was you

146
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,703
just by looking at your eyes.

147
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,121
Exactly.

148
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,665
We understood each other
just by looking at each other.

149
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,501
But I don't want to look anymore.

150
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,503
Not at your eyes…

151
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,339
or at your heart.

152
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,302
What?

153
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,348
You should have done a better job
hiding your feelings.

154
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,727
Now everyone knows who you really are.

155
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,688
And how mean you are.

156
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,524
I-na!

157
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,067
Let's go!

158
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,498
Why don't we move elsewhere?

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,587
And leave the house
we've lived in for generations?

160
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,547
I thought we might try downsizing.

161
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,509
We can't afford this huge house anymore.

162
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,181
We can put Dong-hee
in charge of the gym building.

163
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,728
And as for taking care of you,
mother, and I-na…

164
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,481
I'll be in charge of that.

165
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,824
-Gwi-ju.
-I want a fresh start.

166
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,082
-Gwi-ju.
-Let's do that.

167
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,085
Let's do as Gwi-ju says.

168
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,004
Let's move.

169
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,314
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

170
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,359
I can't keep up this damn charade anymore.

171
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,902
Lower your voice.

172
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,738
You heard how
obliviously mature he sounded.

173
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,702
Are we really going to move?

174
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,206
It's only a matter of time
before we lose this house anyway.

175
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,791
If we're going to move,

176
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,877
let's move abroad with Gwi-ju.

177
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,963
Let's take him far away from Do Da-hae.

178
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,299
If we can't prevent it,
we should at least stall it out.

179
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,301
You can't do anything about it.

180
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,722
Don't forget
this is just a temporary arrangement.

181
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,725
Once Gwi-ju is gone, it's over between us.

182
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,104
So just focus on being here
as Gwi-ju's dad.

183
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,451
Keep this a secret.

184
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,163
Once Gwi-ju is gone,

185
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,707
you can finally have the building

186
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,500
all to yourself.

187
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,919
How can you say that?

188
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,922
I'm Gwi-ju's sister.

189
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,716
He's my little brother.

190
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,718
Don't tell him anything.

191
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,678
Just act normal.

192
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,221
It's that easy.

193
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,435
Why did you have to
have a dream like that?

194
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,067
You were so desperate to dream.

195
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,362
You couldn't stop stealing dreams.

196
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,615
And you accuse me of being greedy?

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,745
Don't you think you're being punished
for your own greed?

198
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,916
Was ruining my life not enough?

199
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,377
Your dream is killing Gwi-ju!

200
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,047
This is your fault!

201
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,350
Are you crying?

202
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,395
I'm just sweating.

203
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,483
Take a little break.

204
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,736
Go away.

205
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,662
Are you having fun, I-na?

206
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,746
Yeah!

207
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,292
-Be careful.
-Okay.

208
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,859
-How's this one?
-It's so cute.

209
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm gonna…

210
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,575
check out some other ones.

211
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,659
Pick out some more.

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,001
You look great.

213
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,757
How's this one?

214
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,759
It's so cute.

215
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,305
I think…

216
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,098
I'll go with these.

217
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,641
How do I look?

218
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,686
I picked mine out.

219
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,439
-This one's perfect for you, I-na.
-Try it on.

220
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,481
Let's see.

221
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,069
That's adorable.

222
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,321
Here we go.

223
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,281
One, two, three.

224
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,407
Cheese.

225
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,620
-One, two, three.
-Where's your cheek?

226
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,339
Come in.

227
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,180
Why are you here?

228
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,682
Where else would I be?

229
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,893
Well, I mean…

230
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,189
Dad changed the bedding
in my room for some reason.

231
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,232
Apparently,

232
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,195
it's goose down or something.

233
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,407
I'm good here.

234
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,329
Okay.

235
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,959
Good night then.

236
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,301
Hey, I-na.

237
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,594
You're still up.

238
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,806
I was just getting some water, and…

239
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,226
And…

240
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,270
I just…

241
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,563
You're stupid.

242
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,325
Let's have another wedding.

243
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,744
I don't want to.

244
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,496
The last one was crazy enough.

245
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,914
Should we register our marriage first?

246
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,499
Is that necessary?

247
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,836
Or I could go back to the moment
I-na was born right now.

248
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,837
No.

249
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,714
You can't do that.

250
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,259
Why not?

251
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,846
I can't wait to go back
to 13 years ago and save you.

252
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,347
And give you the ring.

253
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,352
We agreed to put that off for a bit.

254
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,814
Tell you what.

255
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,316
Once we really become family,

256
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,360
you can go back then.

257
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,532
How much longer
are you going to be a guest here?

258
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,076
What's the hurry?

259
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,913
We'll have plenty of time
to think about that

260
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,624
after your sister's wedding.

261
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:24,918
Okay?

262
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,932
You can eat today.

263
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,478
As your trainer,
I'm allowing you a cheat day.

264
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,237
How's Dodari doing?

265
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,991
I told you not to ask me
about that scammer.

266
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,327
You should cut her some slack.

267
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,120
Don't give her a hard time.

268
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,708
She left you guys at the sauna
after all those years

269
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,377
to enjoy a life of luxury on her own.

270
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,421
How can you say that?

271
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,258
Because we're family.

272
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,595
You can be mean to her if you want.

273
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,599
You don't stand a chance
against her anyway.

274
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,105
What did you say?

275
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,276
My mom is the real problem.

276
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,655
There's no way
she'll let her go so easily.

277
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,704
I got everything ready.

278
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,332
But let me ask you one last time.

279
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,918
Are you sure?

280
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,257
Is this what you want?

281
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,676
We have to give her a proper goodbye.

282
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,569
There's a leak in my room.

283
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,238
Water's dripping onto my bed.

284
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,703
It's late,
so I'll have to crash here tonight.

285
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,746
What do you think you're doing?

286
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,958
What's a real family anyway?

287
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,460
Family's nothing special.

288
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,462
We're family if we eat and sleep together.

289
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,508
Excuse me.

290
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,430
Your pillow isn't so comfortable.

291
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,890
Mine is goose down.

292
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,147
That's better.

293
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,732
This is nice.

294
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,236
Is my head heavy?

295
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,530
A little.

296
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,783
I'll be saving your life.

297
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,286
I can borrow your arm, can't I?

298
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,793
I'll let you borrow mine
when I'm back here from the future.

299
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,172
What?

300
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,592
When I come back from the future,

301
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,011
you can rest your head on my arm.

302
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,310
I'm sure

303
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,355
I'll come back to this moment someday.

304
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm really happy right now.

305
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,827
This is nice.

306
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,414
Do you want to…

307
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,001
go on a trip?

308
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,880
Sure, let's do it.

309
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,721
All right.

310
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,932
Let's do it.

311
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,283
Perfect weather for the beach.

312
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,494
I could really use some coffee though.

313
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,290
Hold on.

314
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,877
This will do the trick.

315
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,262
-It's so good.
-Good thinking.

316
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,473
Don't worry.

317
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,809
Why don't you let me drive?

318
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,020
I love driving in the rain.

319
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,024
But I am getting a little chilly.

320
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,400
Are you cold?

321
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,236
It's okay. Just hand me my jacket.

322
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,703
-Let me put it on you.
-Oh my.

323
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,708
Thank you.

324
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,379
Do you remember this jacket?

325
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,424
Hey, it's the one I bought you.

326
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,509
What? As if.

327
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,969
Well, I paid for it.

328
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,221
After you ruined my blouse.

329
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,682
Hey, you were smiling then.

330
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,559
No, I wasn't.

331
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,644
Yes, you were.

332
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,023
That was the first time
I'd ever seen you smile.

333
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,777
I just remember being really annoyed
by some weird lady.

334
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,406
Go back and see for yourself.

335
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,574
You can do that, right?

336
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,243
Sure, I'll be right back.

337
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,369
See you.

338
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,666
Let me help you.

339
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,563
Give me that.

340
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,447
Did you see it? Was I right?

341
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,574
I guess I smiled.

342
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,617
I told you.

343
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,701
My bad.

344
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,579
Do you like the color yellow?

345
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,126
There's this movie that I love,

346
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,920
and the female lead
wears a yellow cardigan.

347
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,550
I can't remember the title right now.

348
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,971
The man runs a photo studio,
and the woman is a parking attendant.

349
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,473
-Have you seen it?
-Hold on.

350
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,435
-The man's terminally ill, right?
-Yes.

351
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,105
And he disappears
without saying anything to her.

352
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,523
-Yes.
-Leaving a picture behind.

353
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,691
Exactly.

354
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:07,779
The woman is wearing
a yellow cardigan in that picture.

355
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,491
Wasn't it a blue sweater?

356
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,952
It was yellow.

357
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,496
It was blue.

358
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,832
I'm positive it was yellow.

359
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,750
-No, it was blue.
-What?

360
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,044
I've watched that movie so many times.

361
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,338
I was a huge fan of that actress.

362
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,633
Wanna bet?

363
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,928
-Winner gets a wish.
-You're on.

364
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,849
-Let me look it up.
-Hold on.

365
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,643
Why don't you go back
and see for yourself?

366
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,022
You should be able to do that
if you were such a fan.

367
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,233
Maybe I will.

368
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,030
I watched it at my friend's
in high school.

369
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,408
-I never cry during movies, okay?
-Okay.

370
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,493
But with that one,

371
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,872
I bawled my eyes out with my friends.

372
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,584
That's great.
You'll get to see your friends too.

373
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,214
Fine. I'll be right back.

374
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,840
See you.

375
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,407
I won…

376
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,837
Da-hae.

377
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,172
Da-hae.

378
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,057
Da-hae.

379
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,437
What…

380
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,208
The passenger saw nothing.

381
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,837
He just keeps saying it happened
in the blink of an eye.

382
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,381
It must have happened that quickly.

383
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,216
The shock may have fried his memory.

384
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,719
But he doesn't seem injured at all.

385
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,305
Not even a scratch.

386
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,015
The dashcam is broken too.

387
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,308
It doesn't make sense.

388
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,936
There's an accident around here
every time it rains or snows.

389
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,565
Let's find that missing person.

390
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,482
Yes, sir.

391
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,371
Search everywhere!

392
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,833
From the river mouth to the bushes!

393
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,710
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

394
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,379
It's dangerous here.

395
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,550
Get closer to the river!

396
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,974
Report every little thing you find!

397
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,020
-We can't let you through.
-Step back, sir.

398
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,022
-I have to…
-We're sorry.

399
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,410
Make sure to search every corner!

400
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,787
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

401
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,017
What do we have so far?

402
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,227
We're still searching,

403
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,521
but we've found nothing.

404
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,565
Seriously?

405
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,275
We haven't found a thing.

406
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,404
We've searched along the entire river,

407
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,696
but nothing's turned up.

408
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,829
Not again.

409
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,746
Stop him.

410
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,541
-Stop, it's dangerous here!
-Stop him!

411
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,962
Grab him!

412
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,132
Grab him!

413
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,266
-It's dangerous here!
-Get him out of here!

414
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,894
Get him out!

415
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,860
It's not safe for you to be here!

416
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,362
-You, call an ambulance.
-Yes, sir.

417
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,950
I found something!

418
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,893
Is this what she was wearing?

419
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,116
We found something.

420
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,072
Good work, everyone.

421
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,240
Let's move out.

422
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,583
PALACE SAUNA

423
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,751
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

424
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,180
It was you, wasn't it?

425
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,564
You did this to Da-hae.

426
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,232
Answer me, damn it!

427
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,234
Let him go.

428
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,450
I heard the car skidded in the rain.

429
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,624
But I don't remember having
some superpower that controls rain.

430
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,250
You made it look like an accident.

431
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,880
And what were you doing right next to her?

432
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,051
I heard she was thrown
through the windshield

433
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,178
and fell into the river.

434
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,306
Didn't you even buckle her up?

435
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,604
Where the hell were you taking her
in the pouring rain?

436
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,898
You even made her drive.

437
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,654
I don't understand
how I'm responsible for any of that.

438
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,247
And now you show up here
without a scratch on your body

439
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,540
and say that?

440
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,627
Don't put the blame on me.

441
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,383
I thought you had superpowers.

442
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,468
What were you doing?

443
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,804
Why can't you find her?

444
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,182
Why couldn't you save her?

445
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,222
Are you…

446
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,184
Yes.

447
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,729
I'm drinking again.

448
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,441
I thought I was finally back on track,

449
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,277
but nothing's changed.

450
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,363
Gwi-ju.

451
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,282
I thought it'd be different this time.

452
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,827
I thought I could make a difference.

453
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,080
But I ended up like this again.

454
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,500
I can't do anything.

455
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,670
Da-hae is gone.

456
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,549
I have to go back and find out…

457
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,011
how it all happened.

458
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,893
I have to find her.

459
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,001
Ms. Da-hae.

460
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,255
You're alive, aren't you?

461
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,758
I can't believe this.

462
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,595
It's exactly like seven years ago.

463
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,306
I know.

464
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,683
I can't believe it either.

465
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,104
But if I'm being honest,

466
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,899
I'm kind of relieved.

467
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,652
Watch your mouth.

468
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,782
Look, I feel sorry for Da-hae,

469
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:22,453
but if Gwi-ju loses his power
to go back to the past,

470
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,874
he might not die just yet.

471
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,880
Could Gwi-ju's future have changed?

472
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,354
I was foolish.

473
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,734
It was only natural
that we lost our powers.

474
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,611
In modern society,

475
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,782
superpowers don't mean anything anymore.

476
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,370
The fact that we lost our powers
due to lifestyle diseases proves it.

477
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,416
Even I-na was born without powers.

478
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,793
It's just natural selection.

479
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,753
You were so obsessed with superpowers.

480
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,257
-Why the sudden change of heart?
-I'm tired.

481
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,719
My insomnia must have been
a blessing from our ancestors.

482
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,846
They were telling me to stop dreaming.

483
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,472
That it was okay to stop.

484
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,268
You don't have to try
to go back to the past either.

485
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,146
Let's live in the present from now on.

486
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,190
We'll live a normal life,

487
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,609
adapting to the times like everyone else.

488
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,486
Stop looking back.

489
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,003
Wow.

490
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,757
Welcome back, Dong-hee.

491
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,593
You look gorgeous.

492
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,054
Hey.

493
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,724
Can we postpone our wedding?

494
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,770
What for?

495
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,314
My brother's going through a lot.

496
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,359
Can we wait until he's feeling better?

497
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,446
Didn't you say
he was always a bit depressed?

498
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,407
Aren't you concerned about him at all?

499
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:27,370
Of course, but I'm also upset.

500
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,289
We already sent out invitations,
and it's just around the corner.

501
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,667
Our business is on the line too.

502
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,961
Hold on.

503
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,632
See? My phone's been blowing up.

504
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,968
This franchise wants to
open a store in our building.

505
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,053
I'll be right back, okay?

506
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,555
Hello?

507
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,025
Will you give me a break?
I'm not going anywhere, babe.

508
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,947
I'll open a salad café for you,

509
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,283
so you just think about what to call it.

510
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,951
Got it?

511
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,223
Over there.

512
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,185
Why does he keep coming to the scrapyard
looking for his car?

513
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,270
That's him.

514
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,024
Sir.

515
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,402
You really need to stop coming here.

516
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,281
Like I told you,
we scrapped that car ages ago.

517
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,076
We have work to do, so please leave.

518
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,995
Show him out.

519
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,039
-Let's go, sir.
-It's not safe here.

520
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,915
-We'll have to call the cops on you.
-Come on.

521
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,917
There you are!

522
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,504
Hello, sir.

523
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,049
I'll get him out of here. I'm his sister.

524
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,344
Please hurry up.

525
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,221
Okay. Have a nice day.

526
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,473
Bye.

527
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,608
Dad.

528
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:23,861
I-na.

529
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,452
Why are you looking for the car?

530
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,537
You'll never find it.

531
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,414
Even if you did,
it wouldn't change a thing.

532
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,501
Da-hae is alive.

533
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,378
They searched everywhere.

534
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,088
Even to the bottom of the river.

535
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,590
Mother dreamt about me

536
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,176
saving Da-hae.

537
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,054
It hasn't come true yet.

538
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,139
Mom is getting old.

539
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,518
We've lost all our superpowers for good.

540
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,685
No.

541
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,479
We have you.

542
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,940
You can fly now, can't you?

543
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,149
Please find the car.

544
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,819
There might be some clues left in it.

545
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,154
Me?

546
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,834
I never should have come here.

547
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,612
Let's go home.

548
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,948
Let's just go.

549
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,868
Take I-na home.

550
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,244
Get a hold of yourself!

551
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,663
You're not the only one struggling.

552
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,207
The whole family is in shambles.

553
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,002
Do you even know
that I'm getting married next week?

554
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,636
We're never going to change.

555
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,098
We'll always be like this.

556
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,685
Let's go, I-na.

557
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,701
Some things have changed.

558
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,879
For one thing,

559
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,299
I've grown up a bit.

560
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,138
She was the first person

561
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,391
I wasn't scared to look in the eye.

562
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,564
And she was the one
who brought you and me closer.

563
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,360
She's our family.

564
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,365
So you have to find her.

565
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,451
Go back to the past.

566
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,287
You can do it, Dad.

567
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,073
Are you having fun, I-na?

568
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,074
Yeah!

569
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,581
Da-hae.

570
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:05,791
Da-hae.

571
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,501
Da-hae!

572
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,631
Do Da-hae!

573
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,679
Da-hae!

574
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,453
-How's this one?
-It's so cute.

575
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,045
I'm gonna…

576
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,504
check out some other ones.

577
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,505
Pick out some more.

578
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,675
Da-hae.

579
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,636
Da-hae!

580
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,014
How's this one?

581
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,224
It's so cute.

582
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,312
I think…

583
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,772
I'll go with these.

584
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,731
How do I look?

585
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,279
Did it feel like
she was avoiding eye contact?

586
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,367
Come to think of it,

587
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,496
when I looked into her eyes,

588
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,749
she suddenly started singing

589
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,086
the national anthem in her mind.

590
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,048
I just found it funny at the time,

591
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,008
so I laughed it off.

592
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,721
What was she hiding?

593
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,390
Go back to another time.

594
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,774
Da-hae.

595
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,580
You're actually here.

596
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,135
Why are you crying?

597
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,140
Are you here to let me borrow your arm?

598
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,853
Why are you crying?

599
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,025
It's just…

600
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,240
I had a nightmare.

601
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,252
What's wrong?

602
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,553
Listen carefully.

603
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,346
Don't go on that trip.

604
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,640
And don't drive.

605
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,934
No, don't get in the car at all.

606
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,061
All right?

607
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,483
What's this all about?

608
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,531
There will be an accident.

609
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,992
The car will skid in the rain

610
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,037
on our way to the beach.

611
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,164
And you…

612
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,458
You…

613
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,463
So do as I say.

614
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,964
Don't go on that trip.

615
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,759
Please don't go anywhere.

616
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,263
Promise me.

617
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,891
Please, Da-hae.

618
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,936
You can't go.

619
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,486
What happened to Da-hae?

620
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,073
-What do you mean?
-I told her everything.

621
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,450
-I told her about the accident.
-Really?

622
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,424
DRIVER IN HER THIRTIES MISSING IN RIVER
AFTER A WET ROAD CRASH

623
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,551
How come…

624
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,761
nothing has changed?

625
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,763
Are you sure you told her?

626
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,057
Did she understand what you said?

627
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,771
Is it impossible to change…

628
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,191
what's already happened?

629
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,531
This doesn't make sense.

630
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,575
I think…

631
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,828
she knew there would be an accident.

632
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,333
She knew?

633
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,670
But why would she…

634
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,053
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

635
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,145
Hey!

636
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,732
We need to talk.

637
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,276
-Please.
-What?

638
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,619
-What?
-You know something, don't you?

639
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,829
What was Ms. Da-hae hiding?

640
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,207
You knew there'd be an accident,
didn't you?

641
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,626
Shut up. Go away.

642
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,636
Hey, wait!

643
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,101
Was Da-hae hiding something?

644
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,771
Kid's talking nonsense.

645
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,359
Did you take care of everything
like I said?

646
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,903
Yes.

647
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,780
Hey.

648
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,865
Look what I got in the mail.

649
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,209
TRAFFIC TICKET

650
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,962
The accident happened at the river.
What were you doing at the beach?

651
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,007
I felt uneasy after finishing the job,

652
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,676
so I went for some air.

653
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,597
Give me your phone.

654
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,023
NO CALL HISTORY

655
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,317
NO MESSAGES

656
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,153
It's clean.

657
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,863
Almost too clean.

658
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,744
Get the car.

659
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,917
-Where are we going?
-To the beach you were at.

660
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,421
I could use some air too.

661
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,676
Ms. Da-hae is alive, isn't she?

662
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,761
I know you didn't kill her.

663
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,304
You're not that kind of person.

664
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,276
Listen, kid.

665
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,034
If you show up here again,

666
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,120
you're dead.

667
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,748
Let's go.

668
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,476
Dad.

669
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,854
I know where Ms. Da-hae is.

670
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,689
What?

671
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,775
She's alive.

672
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,573
Are you serious?

673
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,242
Hurry.

674
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,952
We have to find her first.

675
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,079
Give him a perfect moment of happiness.

676
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:27,834
Think of it as the last scam
you pull on him.

677
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,963
No, we can't make him happy.

678
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,007
Not if we want him to live.

679
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:36,968
I'll…

680
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,346
save Gwi-ju.

681
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,517
I was the one who got him his power back,

682
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,477
so I should be the one to take it away.

683
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,231
Do you mean to make him
unable to go back in time?

684
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,150
The last scam I pull on Gwi-ju…

685
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,654
won't make him happy.

686
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,990
It'll make him miserable.

687
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,868
You want to fool someone
who has a superpower?

688
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,787
I can do it with your help.

689
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,956
Bok Gwi-ju can return to the past.

690
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,707
He could just go back in time

691
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,084
and see what happened.

692
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,794
He won't be able to go back.

693
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,882
The accident will happen
while he's in the past.

694
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,178
And once I'm gone,

695
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,597
it won't be easy for him
to return to the past.

696
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,684
That's what I'm trying to do.

697
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,727
He came to you from the future

698
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,689
and warned you about the accident.

699
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,276
When he realizes he can't change anything,

700
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,112
it will destroy him.

701
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,700
He'll fall into depression again.

702
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,793
What happens to you
if he can't go back to 13 years ago?

703
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,087
Wouldn't that make you disappear?

704
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,755
Has that ever occurred to you?

705
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,429
Do you think I'll slowly vanish
into thin air or something?

706
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,765
You've seen too many movies.

707
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,145
Plus…

708
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,109
I actually wouldn't mind vanishing.

709
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,132
Help me.

710
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,426
It's my one last job.

711
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,642
Fine.

712
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,518
I'll do it.

713
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,191
Thanks.

714
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,320
Fine. I'll be right back.

715
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:01,947
See you.

716
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,645
Be careful.

717
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,559
Uncle.

718
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,144
Are you okay?

719
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,148
Uncle!

720
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,620
That was scary.

721
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,289
It's been a while.

722
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,973
Goodbye, Bok Gwi-ju.

723
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,520
I wish you all the misery in the world.

724
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,292
Are you okay?

725
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:08,836
Yeah.

726
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,422
Let's go.

727
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,819
Hurry.

728
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,531
We have to find her
before the sauna lady does.

729
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,806
Is that your family?

730
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,309
No.

731
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,727
Yes, they are.

732
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,188
No, they're not.

733
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,691
I'll never see them again.

734
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,068
You're lying.

735
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:18,740
You've been looking at them over and over

736
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,909
and over and over

737
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,580
and over and over

738
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:29,250
and over and over again.

739
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,812
You have missed your turn. Recalculating.

740
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,910
Step on it.

741
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,787
We don't have all day.

742
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,098
BED AND BREAKFAST

743
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,561
I knew you were her family.

744
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:32,397
What?

745
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,190
Are you here for the lady from Seoul?

746
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,817
Yes, where is she right now?

747
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,069
She's out on the beach.

748
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,279
Thanks.

749
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,783
Da-hae!

750
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,618
Do Da-hae!

751
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,246
Do Da-hae!

752
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,347
Do Da-hae!

753
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,478
Da-hae!

754
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:15,690
Da-hae!

755
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:18,693
Do Da-hae!

756
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,327
Gwi-ju isn't in his room.

757
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,704
He isn't?

758
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,458
Is he at the river again?

759
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,375
No.

760
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,298
Actually…

761
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,095
he went to find Ms. Da-hae.

762
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,015
-What?
-What do you mean?

763
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,267
He went to Da-hae?

764
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:57,064
She must've been hiding
from the sauna lady.

765
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,983
What are you talking about?

766
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,611
Are you saying she's alive?

767
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,237
How did he find out?

768
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,492
He went to the past and saw--

769
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,119
He went back to the past?
He couldn't have.

770
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,122
-He can't do that anymore.
-He's okay now.

771
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,957
And he'll bring Ms. Da-hae back.

772
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,544
-So don't worry--
-He can't do that.

773
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,546
This wasn't supposed to happen.

774
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,467
-Honey.
-Mom.

775
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,594
Are you okay, Grandma?

776
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:55,790
Da-hae.

777
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,711
Don't come near me.

778
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,925
-What?
-Why are you here?

779
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,261
What the hell are you doing here?

780
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,562
I could ask you the same thing.

781
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:19,981
I…

782
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,525
After you disappeared,

783
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,445
I searched everywhere for you.

784
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,197
How did you find me?

785
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,412
You've been alive the whole time.

786
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,956
Is this about Ms. Baek?

787
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,750
You should have just told me!

788
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,210
Did you…

789
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,007
manage to go back to the past?

790
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,341
What's going on?

791
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,760
Why did you pull something like this?

792
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,596
Why did you do this to me?

793
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:52,513
Because…

794
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,517
you're going to die.

795
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,481
Dad is…

796
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,528
going to die?

797
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,043
-What?
-So just go back.

798
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,878
You can't be with me!

799
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,589
You should be with I-na.

800
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,966
You promised you'd be there for her.

801
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,469
Go to her.

802
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:42,855
So you did this…

803
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,902
to stop me from going back to the past?

804
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,283
But this is a bit too cruel,
don't you think?

805
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,870
You know what I was like before I met you.

806
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,122
I can't go back to that.

807
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,085
Not after I've met you.

808
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,587
I can't give this up.

809
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,424
You're the reason
I can breathe, walk, and run again.

810
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,802
I finally feel like myself.

811
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,973
How can I live on
when all that's taken away?

812
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,809
Can you even call that living?

813
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,646
I can't be there for I-na like that.

814
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,523
You're right.

815
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,734
I-na might just be an excuse.

816
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,530
I guess I'm just being selfish.

817
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,408
Even if you can't walk or run,

818
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,869
even if all you can do is breathe…

819
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:42,873
I just…

820
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,795
want you to be alive.

821
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,967
That's better than you being gone.

822
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,679
I don't think…

823
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,309
I can handle that.

824
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,234
I thought you were a clever scammer,

825
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:12,820
but you're an idiot.

826
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,532
Go.

827
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,868
Get away from me.

828
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,871
Go!

829
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,789
You're telling me to do what you can't.

830
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,711
I'm sorry, but I can't lose you either.

831
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,303
I won the bet.

832
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:39,930
Let me have my wish.

833
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:44,560
Bok Gwi-ju…

834
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,405
I love you.

835
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,969
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

836
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:49,500
I'm not done yet.

837
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,378
I'll find another way.

838
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,713
There's no way to change the future.

839
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,091
I put my life on the line.

840
01:08:57,591 --> 01:09:01,011
So whoever comes after Da-hae

841
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,472
better be ready to do the same.

842
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,432
Tell Mom

843
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,476
that I'm looking forward to it.

844
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,230
I'll save Da-hae,

845
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,899
Da-hae will save our family,

846
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,402
and you'll make my dream come true.

847
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:18,279
Come here.

848
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,531
This may look like the end,

849
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:23,200
-but there's always a tomorrow.
-Thank you for the food.

850
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,702
My happy moment will

851
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,538
bring everyone happiness.

852
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,085
