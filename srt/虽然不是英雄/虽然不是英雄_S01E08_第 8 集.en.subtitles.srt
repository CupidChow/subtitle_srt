1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,232
It's the same dream again.

3
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,754
Could it be that it hasn't happened yet?

4
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,131
Are you suggesting we collaborate?

5
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,592
I can only return to the moments
I spent with Da-hae.

6
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,137
With a little cooperation from her,

7
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,642
my power can be quite useful.

8
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,018
What's in it for us?

9
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,023
Real estate, lottery, stocks, crypto…

10
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,192
I'll help you steal the future.

11
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,904
If you let me borrow Da-hae.

12
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,449
And what exactly does that entail?

13
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,409
I'd like to share moments of her time.

14
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,286
Preferably, happy ones.

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,413
Ew, that's so cheesy.

16
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,125
Let me get this straight.

17
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,794
Are you asking for my blessing?

18
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,422
It seems like a pretty good deal for you.

19
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,508
You must be forgetting something.

20
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:18,805
We know how your family has been
accumulating wealth

21
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,765
all these years.

22
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,225
Exactly.

23
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:27,021
It'd be a lot quicker
to extort money from you people

24
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:32,735
by threatening to tell the press
all about the family with superpowers.

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,070
Don't you think so?

26
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,616
You want to slaughter the goose

27
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,118
just for a few golden eggs?

28
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,787
Suit yourselves.

29
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:54,048
Shall we discuss the terms in detail then?

30
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,508
You're talking about my time.

31
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,179
It's not as simple as it sounds.

32
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,349
He's basically saying

33
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,977
that he'll use my time
as a checkpoint whenever he wants.

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,688
And he's willing to pay for it.

35
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,608
Do you know what that's like?

36
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,444
He appears and disappears out of nowhere,

37
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,072
traveling back in time
from the future I don't even know of.

38
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,991
It's like seeing a ghost.

39
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,247
Do you think we can take advantage of him?

40
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,415
He has superpowers.

41
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,877
Wake up.

42
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,171
He's the one taking advantage of us.

43
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,882
And I'm not going to let him.

44
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,554
Never.

45
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,517
Good night.

46
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,274
What's her problem?

47
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,153
This is our chance
to cash in on their superpowers.

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,419
What are you getting at?

49
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,629
It's simple.

50
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,216
You just need to spend some time with me.

51
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,718
As often and as much as possible.

52
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,015
I don't think so, Gwi-ju.

53
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,519
Is this how you reestablish relationships?

54
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,562
I'm fine with that.

55
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,480
Da-hae.

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,524
Bok Gwi-ju.

57
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,195
It's all over now.

58
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,113
I know.

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,572
Speaking of which,

60
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,659
I have to undo the past.

61
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,829
I'm going to undo the moment…

62
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,249
things ended for us.

63
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,686
Where's Gwi-ju?

64
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,482
Did you let him go?

65
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,609
Why?

66
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,237
He's a golden goose
that can win us the lottery every week.

67
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,033
You're not scared of anything.

68
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,702
I doubt their powers freaked you out.

69
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,165
So why do you keep
making ridiculous choices?

70
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,465
Are you getting soft because--

71
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,050
I have feelings for Bok Gwi-ju.

72
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,013
Yes, I got soft.

73
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,348
I was crazy.

74
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,144
I don't know what I'm thinking either.

75
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,065
But that's why I crashed the wedding.

76
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,233
Like you said,

77
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,695
it's dangerous to mix
business with pleasure.

78
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,825
You said the last time you flirted
with your business partner,

79
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,285
you did time for three years.

80
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,621
That was just an occupational hazard.

81
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,042
What if this is a trap?

82
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,713
Why would he reach out
to the scammer who lied to him?

83
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,591
We need to keep it together.

84
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,304
But I don't know
if I can do that around him.

85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,350
Does he mean that much to you?

86
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,233
Guess so.

87
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,777
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,320
I'll get it together.

89
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,948
So I need you to help me…

90
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,742
move on.

91
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,492
I had no idea we had a rat in our house.

92
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,245
I'm talking about Do Da-hae.

93
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,622
How do you think
she managed to steal the ring?

94
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,376
We paid a fortune for that safe.

95
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,962
Are you sure you didn't
leave it open after cleaning?

96
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,721
Change the passcode.

97
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,146
She never even told me the passcode.

98
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,657
-How long will you be here?
-Here you go.

99
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,825
Until Chae-yun's class is over.

100
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,702
-When's that?
-Around 4:30 p.m.

101
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,329
-Let's go in.
-Thank you.

102
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,040
-Welcome.
-Sauna on a hot day like this?

103
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,708
-It's already summer.
-Welcome.

104
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,168
Hello.

105
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,628
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

106
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,756
Lucky number 77 for you.

107
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,342
Number 88 for you, also a good one.

108
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,593
And number 70 for you.

109
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,178
Just a second, please.

110
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,304
Here are your clothes.

111
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,190
I'm just trying to make a checkpoint
I can come back to.

112
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,109
Never seen him before.

113
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,027
Is he new?

114
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,820
He has a long way to go.

115
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,156
Let me give you new keys.

116
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,663
Here you go.

117
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,250
-Thank you.
-You're the best.

118
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,001
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

119
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,378
Thank you.

120
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,465
Odd numbers for top lockers,
even for bottom ones.

121
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,967
Odd for taller customers,

122
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,843
even for the elderly.

123
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,598
-This place always makes me feel better.
-I know.

124
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,100
Welcome.

125
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,310
Have a good time.

126
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,603
Excuse me.

127
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,272
-I'll pay today.
-Are you sure?

128
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,023
You're the best.

129
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,071
Hello.

130
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,204
Time to eat.

131
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,964
That's good stuff.

132
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,134
Another mouth to feed.

133
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,973
Are you sure you want to
eat our humble food at our shabby table?

134
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,226
Thank you.

135
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,026
You're supposed to help me, Mom.

136
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,528
Let's just see how this goes.

137
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,156
We're here to help if things go south.

138
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,452
What does that mean?

139
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,746
It's a mother-daughter thing. Eat up.

140
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,166
Check this out, Gwi-ju.

141
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,084
"Gwi-ju"?

142
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,130
Well, what should I call him?
It'd be weird if I got all formal.

143
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,967
This stock just hit the moon this week.

144
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,680
Can you go back to last week
and let Dodari know?

145
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,151
Let me give it a try.

146
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,146
I guess I wasn't that happy last week.

147
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,607
My wedding was broken off then.

148
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,819
Happiness is so vital to our lives,
don't you think?

149
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,113
So…

150
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,075
He's not going to give away
his golden eggs so easily.

151
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,619
He's screwing with us.

152
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,501
Da-hae isn't cooperating.

153
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,419
Eat your food.

154
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,422
Happiness starts from eating well.

155
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,134
Man, that was refreshing.

156
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,719
-What do you want?
-Let's have some rice punch.

157
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,346
-Let's get some eggs too.
-Sounds good.

158
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,058
Hey.

159
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,810
Where are you going?

160
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,645
To work.

161
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,380
I'll have what he's having.

162
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,298
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,469
I'm sorry I'm late.

164
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,475
You're 30 minutes late.

165
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,146
Have a seat.

166
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,028
I was picking out
a gift for your daughter.

167
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,956
You didn't have to.

168
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,752
I just love kids.

169
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,756
Actually,

170
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,759
I only had 30 minutes to spare,

171
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,594
so I have to get going.

172
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,848
I promised my mother
I'd stay for exactly 30 minutes.

173
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,810
To be honest,
I'm not interested in getting married.

174
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,815
That makes two of us.

175
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,692
What a relief.

176
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,531
Your mother has been
asking me to meet you every Sunday,

177
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,325
but I couldn't tell her
I planned to remain single.

178
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,411
She thinks it's against God's will.

179
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,502
My bad.

180
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,886
Thank you.

181
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,767
Don't worry about me. You can go.

182
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,311
I'll stay here and enjoy my coffee.

183
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:16,981
Right.

184
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,482
Okay then.

185
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,080
What are you doing?

186
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,716
-Did I do that?
-Are you okay?

187
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,969
Wait, you'll hurt yourself.

188
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,141
Don't move. It's not safe.

189
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,520
I'm so sorry.

190
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,897
Let me buy you a meal.

191
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,857
Actually, you need new shoes first.

192
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,319
It's okay now.

193
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,154
You should get going.

194
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,576
I guess I wasn't the one
who spilled the wine.

195
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,497
Who is this?

196
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,583
Me?

197
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,919
I'm her third husband.

198
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,088
-You said you planned to remain single.
-I do.

199
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,548
Well, I was about to be.

200
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,926
But she broke it off.

201
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,560
Nice meeting you.

202
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,276
What was that?

203
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,153
Now that I messed up my third marriage,

204
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,156
I'm looking for a fourth husband.

205
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,743
Does anyone fall for
such an old-fashioned method?

206
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,621
The third one sure did.

207
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,374
You seemed a lot more sincere with me.

208
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,960
That's exactly
what I wanted you to believe.

209
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,670
You fell right into my hands.

210
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,092
And don't read too much into
being able to find me in the past.

211
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,636
You were just confused and misled.

212
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,137
You weren't really happy.

213
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,223
So you can look elsewhere

214
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,975
for your happy times.

215
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,103
There must be some moments in your life

216
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,896
that made you happy.

217
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,492
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,411
Oh my.

219
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,037
Hello.

220
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,207
Don't you remember me?

221
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,126
Do I know you?

222
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,044
Yes, we met at the beach.

223
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,256
Don't you remember?

224
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,842
Let me think.
We met at the Haeundae Beach.

225
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,305
I think I remember.

226
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,265
Right?

227
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,021
What did you do with my husband?

228
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,106
Did you hit it off by the beach?

229
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,652
Another business trip to the nightclub?

230
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,198
Are you the one who's been
messaging him every night?

231
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,825
-No, I'm--
-Excuse me for cutting in.

232
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,203
I'm her third husband.
Or I was going to be.

233
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,373
But you can't park here because…

234
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,751
-Run.
-Excuse us!

235
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,335
Hey, get back here!

236
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,587
-Hold on.
-Damn you.

237
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,589
-Wait.
-Let go!

238
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,272
Having fun?

239
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,651
Let's go to dinner, Da-hae.

240
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,945
I don't want to.

241
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,489
What about our deal?

242
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,200
Just work with me here. Please?

243
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,876
Ten million won per hour,

244
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,753
and I'll think about it.

245
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,887
Okay.

246
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,273
This is where you really got me.

247
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,693
Have a seat.

248
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,575
Make your ten million won.

249
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,932
If you're worried about me,
you don't have to be.

250
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,810
I'm only choosing to spend time with you

251
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,729
because I can benefit from it.

252
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,190
This is just business.

253
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,652
If you're trying to save me,

254
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,070
you don't have to.

255
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,700
I stay with the people at the sauna
because I benefit from it.

256
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,703
I chose them as my family.

257
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,372
I'll leave them when I want to.

258
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,591
But how did you end up
being family with those people?

259
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,926
You mean, how did I get involved
with scum like them

260
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,429
and become a criminal?

261
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,557
I'm sorry, but I'm scum too.

262
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,685
You talked about happy moments
that you couldn't forget.

263
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,730
The day you learned to ride a bike.

264
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,566
The first time you tried shaved ice.

265
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,235
You didn't lie then, did you?

266
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,363
You looked really happy

267
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,033
when you talked about that.

268
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,791
I wanted to ride a bike
just like other kids.

269
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,711
But unlike them,

270
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,756
I didn't have parents who could teach me.

271
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,218
I fell again and again

272
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,679
until I finally managed.

273
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,641
It was a brutally happy moment.

274
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,560
And the shaved ice?

275
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,063
It was the boring, old-fashioned kind.

276
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,734
It was from a bakery
near South Gangneung Terminal.

277
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,030
Those tiny little moments were

278
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,658
the only happiness I ever felt.

279
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:51,083
But I bet you've always had everything.
You even have a superpower.

280
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,877
That's probably why moments like that

281
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,630
seem like real happiness to you.

282
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,053
The first thing my power taught me
was frustration.

283
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,223
I realized that I couldn't be happy

284
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,976
if I was the only one who was happy.

285
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,187
That's why I became a firefighter.

286
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,440
Although I didn't last long.

287
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,652
Are you that desperate to save others?

288
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,950
Just so you can feel superior
by helping the less fortunate?

289
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,829
You know what I think?

290
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,748
You let your power get to your head.

291
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,045
Maybe.

292
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,607
He went to the restroom.

293
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:18,295
Way to go, you idiot.

294
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,921
Hyeong-jin.

295
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,803
Here are your meds, newbie.

296
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,434
How could you fall off a tree
on your first day?

297
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,102
Aren't you even embarrassed?

298
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,938
Why would you climb the tree

299
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,191
when the team wasn't even ready?

300
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,026
Do you have a superpower or something?

301
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,071
So…

302
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,655
Is she okay?

303
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,741
How should I know?

304
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,289
Don't get up.

305
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,417
Thank you so much.

306
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,002
Thank you.

307
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,006
The kitty is like her little sister.

308
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,342
I see.

309
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,052
I'm relieved that everyone's okay.

310
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,846
Except for this one.

311
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,642
Are you laughing?

312
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,269
Do you think you're Tarzan or something?

313
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,314
You looked like an idiot,
climbing the tree with rubber gloves on.

314
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,858
I couldn't tell who was saving whom.

315
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,945
-"Come here, Happy!"
-I didn't sound like that.

316
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,113
That was spot on.

317
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,365
You're exaggerating.

318
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,179
This is nowhere near enough.

319
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,933
Hey.

320
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,854
Your father's debt is yours now,
so you'll have to pay me back.

321
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,938
Come here.

322
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,527
I said come here.

323
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,702
Sign this.

324
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,539
BENEFICIARY: BAEK IL-HONG
INSURED: DO DA-HAE

325
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,985
Who are you?

326
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,397
I'm home.

327
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,984
Did you have a good time with Gwi-ju?

328
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,778
I was on a date
with my potential fourth husband.

329
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,405
The deaconess's son.

330
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,284
I didn't tell you to do that.

331
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,495
I need to move on.

332
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,791
I'll get married
without a problem this time.

333
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,918
I know I threw a wrench in our plan.

334
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,464
We were supposed to part ways
after my third marriage.

335
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,886
Do you think Dodari is up to something?

336
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,973
Even if Gwi-ju brings golden eggs
from the future,

337
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,267
he'll only be visible to her.

338
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,021
How much do you trust her?

339
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,984
We shouldn't leave the future
of the two families to those two.

340
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,196
Let's see what we can do.

341
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:42,827
Where's Ms. Da-hae?

342
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,080
She has nothing to do with us now.

343
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,761
You were with her all day.

344
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,777
It's the same dream again.

345
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,657
I was just about to get a good look.

346
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,958
Honey, get me some water.

347
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:35,922
Honey?

348
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,633
Honey?

349
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,364
Sun-gu.

350
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,411
Don't be so disheartened
that your family doesn't get you.

351
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,790
It's always the ones closest to you
who understand you the least.

352
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,004
Even some saints weren't acknowledged
in their own hometowns.

353
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,674
But I bet people remembered
their wives' names.

354
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,719
I'd like to be remembered for something.

355
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:29,058
I'm just the shadow to her bright light.

356
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,060
Nothing more.

357
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,609
Don't say that.

358
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,198
The way I see it,
you're the brightest light there is.

359
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,586
Oh my goodness!

360
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,256
Are you the light of my wife's life?

361
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,134
Honey.

362
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,969
This is a misunderstanding.

363
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,348
Ms. Shin and I just meet up
to work up a sweat--

364
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,810
Work up a sweat doing what?

365
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,813
-Answer me!
-It's not what you think!

366
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,648
We're just buddies

367
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,108
who enjoy a hobby together
in a respectable manner.

368
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,903
There's no romance between us whatsoever.

369
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,030
-What?
-Am I right?

370
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,449
Say something, Ms. Shin.

371
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,159
Oh my goodness.

372
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,163
Stay away from my wife, you bastard!

373
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,499
I don't know if you're buddies or lovers,

374
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,586
but we'll let the court decide
once I file charges against you.

375
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,380
You bastard.

376
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,840
Let's go, honey.

377
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,717
-Okay.
-No, wait.

378
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,636
I'll pay you.

379
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,763
Please don't press charges.

380
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,184
Someone definitely pushed me.

381
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,382
Hey there, I'm here to work out.

382
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,884
Can I get a one-day pass?

383
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,094
I've been to other gyms,

384
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,598
but this one's the least crowded.

385
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,807
It was you.

386
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,977
You pushed me off the edge.

387
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,687
What?

388
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,033
-Stupid CCTV!
-Get over here!

389
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,619
I'm sorry, Dong-hee. I really am.

390
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,997
I thought you'd elegantly float
like on the day of the wedding.

391
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,248
What if I did?

392
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,375
Were you going to film it
and blackmail me?

393
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,129
-Oh my gosh!
-You little…

394
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,507
Stop right there!

395
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,678
-Damn it!
-Come here!

396
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,158
Please forgive me just this once.

397
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,956
I'll do anything.

398
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,967
You better fix everything.

399
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,355
Our deal isn't going to fly.

400
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,899
What do you mean?

401
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,112
Da-hae just won't cooperate.

402
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:13,074
I can only follow her around for so long.

403
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,576
Don't worry.

404
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,872
She'll have no choice
but to accept the deal.

405
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,585
Where are you going?

406
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,047
Hey.

407
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,508
The guy I'm meeting today

408
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,051
is a devout Buddhist.

409
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,053
We're getting some temple food for lunch.

410
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,348
How about some barbecue for dinner?

411
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,228
Hyeong-tae.

412
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,568
Help them spend some happy times together.

413
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,217
Are you happy yet?

414
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,095
Not really.

415
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,350
That's not good.

416
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,581
How about now?

417
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,543
Not really.

418
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,852
How about now?

419
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,355
Not at all.

420
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,151
Not with my companion
looking so miserable.

421
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,783
What?

422
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,380
Hey, bro.

423
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,132
Let's get some shaved ice.

424
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,551
"Bro"?

425
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,344
The best shaved ice Da-hae ever had.

426
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,139
I'm wondering if that'll make her happy.

427
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,650
Lead the way.

428
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,694
Right now?

429
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,114
You don't even know--

430
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,073
We'll be right back.

431
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,243
But…

432
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,579
I don't think you will be.

433
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,384
Are we still not there?

434
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,738
SEOUL TO GANGNEUNG

435
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,607
BLANCHE BAKERY

436
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,786
Here's your shaved ice.

437
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,999
Can I get this to go?

438
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,875
Sorry, but that's not possible.

439
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,303
I'll return the bowls later.

440
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,097
Sure, go ahead.

441
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:42,820
Hey.

442
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,072
Can you go get us bus tickets?

443
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,742
Me?

444
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,077
Hurry up.

445
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,121
Before the ice melts.

446
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,334
Come on, bro.

447
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,893
WINNING NUMBERS

448
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,388
You don't even know--

449
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,722
We'll be right back.

450
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,640
But…

451
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,309
I don't think you will be.

452
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,570
I finally ditched him.

453
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,375
This is it, right?

454
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,545
Yeah.

455
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,396
Guess it melted a little.

456
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,695
-Can you check me out?
-Sure.

457
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,949
I'll pay double for this one.

458
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,411
Okay.

459
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,292
That'll be 7,000 won.

460
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,555
Why don't you stay a while, dear?

461
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,102
Try some of this shaved ice.

462
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,521
Here.

463
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,023
Go on.

464
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,239
Here, dig in.

465
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,987
Seonjae Girls' High School, right?

466
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,367
I saw the news.

467
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,579
There was a fire at your school.

468
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,623
You poor thing.

469
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,585
You must have been so scared.

470
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,799
I'm sorry. Eat up.

471
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,054
I could only find happiness
by selling out my misfortunes.

472
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,349
So I'm not quite sure

473
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,645
if I was happy or not.

474
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:33,611
I know what that day 13 years ago…

475
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,031
means to you.

476
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,077
But I was never grateful
that I survived that day.

477
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,582
I survived with nothing left in my life.

478
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,126
It was exhausting.

479
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,756
Maybe that's why I conned people
using the person who saved me.

480
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,051
To spite him for saving me.

481
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,060
Do you still have my stuff at home?

482
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,437
There's something

483
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,065
that the person who saved me left me with.

484
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,446
Hyeong-jin left you something?

485
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,367
The ring that he was wearing.

486
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,621
Please give it to his family.

487
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,268
Wow.

488
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,647
Is this what superpowers feel like?

489
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,944
I feel like I just went back in time.

490
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,434
Maybe not.

491
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,316
Maybe I haven't moved on
from my past at all.

492
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,580
This week's winning numbers.
For 2.3 billion won.

493
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,334
Take it.

494
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,258
Are you really going to
join hands with my mom?

495
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,929
It's for you. Pay off your debts.

496
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,434
Stop selling out your misfortunes.

497
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,479
If you must sell something,

498
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,772
sell your happiness.

499
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,649
To me.

500
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,067
For ten million won per hour.

501
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,029
Go buy a lottery ticket first.

502
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,449
And do it before 8 p.m.
You know that, right?

503
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,328
Why are you going this far?

504
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,292
Why are you doing this to me?

505
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,754
I'm paying up.

506
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,258
Like I said, this is just business.

507
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,525
Hey.

508
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,318
Did you get the tickets?

509
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,740
I'll go return the bowls.

510
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,222
What's wrong?

511
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,267
He was right there.

512
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,519
But then he wasn't.

513
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,480
When he came back,

514
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,983
the shaved ice was gone.

515
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,819
I mean…

516
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,280
Where did it go?

517
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,056
WINNING NUMBERS

518
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,246
Please review it and get back to us.

519
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,331
I will.

520
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,208
I'll be in touch as soon as possible.

521
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,627
-Thank you.
-Drive safely.

522
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,853
Ms. Bok, can we get a picture with you?

523
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,690
-Stand over here, please.
-You're beautiful!

524
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,334
Excuse me.

525
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,920
These are on the house.

526
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,630
-Sorry?
-Enjoy.

527
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,965
Thank you.

528
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,134
Ji-han.

529
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,761
What a coincidence.

530
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,096
Dong-hee.

531
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,895
I've been thinking about you today.

532
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,357
Can we talk?

533
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,944
I can't believe we met here.
What are the chances?

534
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,156
Please.

535
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,838
I've been wanting to
talk to you for a while.

536
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,592
So…

537
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,139
I don't know

538
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,475
how to say this.

539
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,521
What is it?

540
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,736
Come on, you can tell me anything.

541
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,241
It's about…

542
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,868
our marriage.

543
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:05,539
Marriage?

544
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,595
Remember how you said

545
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,182
we'd be getting
that 50-billion-won building?

546
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,603
Is that offer still valid?

547
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,648
Right.

548
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,778
Yes.

549
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,739
Of course.

550
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,083
No matter how hard I try,

551
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,419
my feet are glued to the ground.

552
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,718
I thought I hit rock bottom,

553
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,596
but I keep on falling.

554
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,518
When will I be able to fly again?

555
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,322
You haven't eaten, have you?

556
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,240
Drink this.

557
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:23,992
I'm fine.

558
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,915
You could actually die.

559
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,810
The floor's cold.

560
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,729
Let's lie down somewhere else.

561
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,095
Feel any better?

562
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,764
Yes, kind of.

563
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,728
By the way,

564
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,399
why couldn't you fly the other night?

565
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,778
I clearly saw you floating
on the day of the wedding.

566
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,656
Like you said,

567
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,075
I'm fat.

568
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,328
I never said that.

569
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,497
You're Bok Don't Eat.

570
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,502
Don't worry.

571
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,006
I'll help you lose weight

572
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,507
and get married.

573
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,180
You will?

574
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,600
I'll get you that building.

575
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,728
We can split it.

576
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,979
What do you think?

577
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,315
That sounds great.

578
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,485
But there's one problem.

579
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,825
I don't like you.

580
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,457
Rice punch.

581
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,294
Use your own hands.

582
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,601
DANCE CLUB ONCE

583
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,560
I'm leaving.

584
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,520
HAN JUN-WOO LEFT THE CHAT.
GOH HYE-RIM LEFT THE CHAT.

585
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,241
Hey.

586
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,328
I just bumped into something.
What could it be?

587
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,924
-You broke my phone.
-Wait.

588
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,134
I think I just heard something.

589
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,720
Guys, did you hear that?

590
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,806
I think so, but I don't see anything.

591
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,724
But I think I heard something.

592
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,601
What? I didn't hear anything.

593
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,812
Are you guys hearing things?

594
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,530
Do you see it now?

595
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,909
Let's go, guys.

596
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,395
Where's Ms. Da-hae?

597
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,241
She went to the market.

598
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,787
When will she be back?

599
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,247
Soon.

600
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,045
Are you bored?

601
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,806
One, two, three.

602
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,434
You lost.

603
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,311
Now you get flicked.

604
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,854
Flick.

605
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,249
One, two,

606
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,002
three.

607
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:33,843
My turn.

608
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,682
One, two,

609
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,768
three.

610
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,777
See you around.

611
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,840
-Who was that?
-My guest.

612
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,510
-Bok Dong-hee?
-Go on in.

613
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,886
You have a guest too.

614
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,185
One, two,

615
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,770
three.

616
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,191
One, two…

617
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,819
three.

618
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,783
-One, two--
-Hold on.

619
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,745
Something's not right.

620
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,456
Hey, I-na.

621
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,548
-Ms. Da-hae.
-What are you doing here?

622
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,683
Sometimes,
you just don't feel like going home.

623
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,893
Especially at her age.

624
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,620
Did you call them over?

625
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,871
No way.

626
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,374
I guess they come here

627
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,252
to find what the Boks don't have.

628
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,297
What do they not have?

629
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,383
Happiness, for example.

630
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,804
You seem to be cooking up something new.

631
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,556
Care to share?

632
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,517
What's the genre this time?

633
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,563
If I had to say,
I guess it'd be a family drama.

634
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,024
What?

635
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,443
You're not the only one getting soft.

636
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:56,778
Gwi-ju has feelings for you too.

637
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,865
Mom.

638
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,868
You're making this harder for me.

639
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,787
I'm trying to move on, so why--

640
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,289
You're the only one he can reach
and vice versa.

641
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,252
But you care so much about each other
that you push each other away.

642
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,381
I felt so sorry for you
that I had to step in.

643
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,133
Family is the answer.

644
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,764
So we're taking the family hostage?

645
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,810
There's a nicer way to put it.
It's called "familial love."

646
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,562
Who knows?

647
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:34,857
We might actually end up
becoming one family.

648
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,735
Then we'll be in the same boat forever.

649
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,153
Forever?

650
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,199
Are you never going to let them go?

651
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,284
This is a win-win.

652
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:50,623
There's nothing in this world
that I want to see more than you two

653
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,208
being happy together.

654
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,427
He seemed to love seaweed soup.

655
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,081
Here.

656
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,250
Take it.

657
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,544
I'm short on cash at the moment,

658
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,962
so take the car for now.

659
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,797
And leave Gwi-ju--

660
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,966
Please keep him away from me.

661
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,180
He's trying to cut a deal with my mom.

662
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,600
If that goes through,
it'll endanger all of you.

663
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:55,188
You're the only one
who can settle the situation.

664
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,648
Why are you telling me this?

665
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,902
Are you betraying your own
to join hands with me?

666
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,653
He's just annoying.

667
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,491
He thinks he's some superhero in spandex,

668
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,117
meddling with people's businesses.

669
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:10,411
You know how he is.

670
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,123
He never listens to me.

671
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,374
You know how he is.

672
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,003
But you have a powerful weapon.

673
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,004
Use it to your advantage.

674
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:24,258
I can't dream if I can't sleep.
You know that.

675
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,770
Are you drugging me right in my face now?

676
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,107
Would you rather
I replenish your energy with my hands?

677
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,151
Don't you lay a finger on me.

678
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,156
It was sleeping pills

679
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,033
that put you to sleep.

680
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,662
I don't have some special energy,

681
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,373
and I'm not some special person
who can save your family.

682
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,086
Drugs couldn't have given me
such special dreams.

683
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,967
Well, how about this?

684
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,724
It's the winning ticket.
Worth 2.3 billion won.

685
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,643
You're lying.

686
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,271
How would you…

687
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,400
Wait, was it Gwi-ju?

688
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,154
Perhaps it was hope

689
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:30,491
that put you to sleep.

690
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,492
Hope?

691
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,163
Hope that the Bok family
can get back on its feet.

692
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,708
This should give you

693
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:42,295
much more hope than the words of a fraud.

694
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:48,092
Why are you giving me this?

695
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,470
Take it

696
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,389
and leave me alone.

697
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,274
Get some sleep.

698
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,484
If you want to save your family.

699
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,344
I told you not to call me.

700
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,720
You're right.

701
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:35,556
Talking on the phone feels too impersonal.

702
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,308
Should I come over?

703
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,394
I'd love to meet your wife.

704
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,854
Fine.

705
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,941
I'll do as you say, so give me some time.

706
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,666
Honey.

707
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,216
Are you asleep?

708
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,841
She's sleeping.

709
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,012
Did you get rid of Da-hae's stuff
in the guest room?

710
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:59,682
Yes, your mom kept pestering me
to throw everything away.

711
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,978
Why? What are you looking for?

712
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,063
A ring.

713
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:07,606
A ring?

714
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,069
Do you mean that one?

715
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:17,116
Dong-hee found it in Da-hae's suitcase

716
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,993
on the day your wedding fell through.

717
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,164
Da-hae must have stolen it from the safe.

718
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,206
What?

719
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,958
She stole what?

720
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,030
The family ring.

721
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,944
Do you still have my stuff at home?

722
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,405
There's something

723
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,075
the person who saved me left me with.

724
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,703
The ring that he was wearing.

725
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:27,037
Do Da-hae…

726
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,374
I don't get it.

727
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,211
The person who saved Da-hae left her with

728
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,130
our family ring?

729
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:37,965
That means

730
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,426
the person who saved her

731
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,137
wasn't Hyeong-jin.

732
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,115
I should charge you extra for overtime.

733
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,245
Is this it?

734
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,710
-The ring you were left with?
-Yes.

735
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,671
You found it.

736
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,006
Are you sure?

737
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,968
That the person who saved you
gave you this ring?

738
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,055
Yes.

739
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,306
Did you see his face?

740
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,726
It's like there was
something over his face.

741
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,687
I was also dizzy from all the smoke.

742
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:37,524
But I do remember him
putting the ring on my finger.

743
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,610
He asked me to hold onto it.

744
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:08,973
Gwi-ju!

745
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,436
I'll be damned.

746
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,984
I think I'll have to save you.

747
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,569
What?

748
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:23,737
My power must have…

749
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,366
really gotten to my head.

750
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,497
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

751
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:02,860
Now it's time to save you

752
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,653
using that happiness.

753
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,031
You've fooled me all this time.

754
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,283
Stop pretending you care about me.

755
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,785
Everyone tiptoes around you
because of your dreams.

756
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,412
How do you not know that?

757
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:16,790
I wish I stayed invisible.

758
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,252
I don't know what went wrong.

759
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,920
Why don't we fly together?

760
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,672
Fly with me.

761
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,049
Just once.

762
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,302
You should save your family, not me.

763
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,555
Turns out, I can change the past
without using my powers.

764
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,974
By doing what I can right now.

765
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,976
Stay away from the Bok family.

766
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,436
I won't…

767
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,730
be your daughter anymore.

768
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:46,278
