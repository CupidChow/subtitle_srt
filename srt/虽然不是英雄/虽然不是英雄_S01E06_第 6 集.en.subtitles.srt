1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,795
I'll save you.

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,674
I only kept doubting you

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,843
and kept asking you about it…

5
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,223
because I was that desperate.

6
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,562
I was desperate to save someone.

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,275
I'll do everything I can

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,486
to find you in my past.

9
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,237
And then

10
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,615
I'll save you.

11
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,386
I'm okay now.

12
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,354
HOMEROOM TEACHER

13
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,399
Have a seat.

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,217
Hello, sir.

15
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,011
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

16
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,639
There was a bit of an emergency.

17
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,268
Yes, I'm at the school right now.

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,228
I'm on my way.

19
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,730
See you there.

20
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,318
That was…

21
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,842
Do you believe me?

22
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,803
You don't, do you?

23
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,306
Come on.

24
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,975
Do you think I'm making this up?

25
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:04,976
Yes.

26
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,227
Elaborately, at that.

27
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,939
It's different this time.

28
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,733
They're a family of superpowers.

29
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,984
Are you serious?

30
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,028
I'm telling you.

31
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,863
They actually have superpowers.

32
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:17,947
No.

33
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,491
I'm asking if you're serious about him.

34
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,662
What do you mean?

35
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,540
Honestly,

36
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,293
I don't know about some superpower.

37
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,337
But either way, you got him fooled.

38
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,005
He even said he'd save you.

39
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,135
-So what's the problem?
-I could get caught any minute.

40
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,720
They see right through me.

41
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,388
Do you not want to get caught?

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,682
Because you have feelings for him?

43
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,809
Is that why you want to stop?

44
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,105
Or isn't it?

45
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,858
Have you been listening at all?

46
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,364
Don't say anything stupid.

47
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,874
Is everything okay?

48
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,045
I'm done for.

49
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,757
After you showed up,
Ms. Bok's attitude completely changed.

50
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,095
-So?
-There's no point in me staying there.

51
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,304
Nothing will come of it.

52
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,807
I'll take care of it myself,

53
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,600
so stay out of it.

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,436
Okay?

55
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,357
Oh, I get what you're saying.

56
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,484
A strategic withdrawal?

57
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,402
Yeah.

58
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,282
I see.

59
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,586
I-na.

60
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,643
There must've been a misunderstanding.

61
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,645
The watch was a birthday present.

62
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,440
The girl's name is Hye-rim,

63
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,692
and you don't have to worry about her.

64
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,194
She's actually been very nice to I-na.

65
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,447
She even invited I-na into her club.

66
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,033
What kind of club is it?

67
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,409
It's a dance club.

68
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,077
-Dance?
-Didn't you know?

69
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,997
Do you not talk to I-na a lot?

70
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,000
No, not really.

71
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,836
We need to talk.

72
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,131
Is there anything I should know
besides what you told your teacher?

73
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,801
The teacher asked me
if I was bullying you.

74
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,178
I thought we were friends.

75
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,099
-I-na.
-Sorry. It's my dad's fault.

76
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,229
You had me scared.

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,482
But we're good, right?

78
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,192
Are we still friends?

79
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,862
Of course.

80
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,707
Look, I-na.

81
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,045
Just talk to me for once.

82
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,006
I'm still your dad.

83
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,549
What's there to talk about?

84
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,220
You already ruined my school life.

85
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,264
I was just--

86
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,559
But who cares? I was an accident anyway.

87
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,191
Where's Ms. Da-hae?

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,110
She was at school earlier.

89
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,945
I'd rather talk to her.

90
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,594
The phone you are trying to reach
is switched off.

91
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,263
Please leave a message…

92
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,937
Gosh, my wrist.

93
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,647
Let me help.

94
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,233
What do you want?

95
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,489
Well, the thing is…

96
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,575
I was wondering

97
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,077
if Ms. Do was here.

98
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,165
I was hoping my past wouldn't hurt Da-hae,

99
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,416
but you accused her of stealing.

100
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,878
Well…

101
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,671
Let go.

102
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,757
-And let go of Da-hae.
-I'll get those.

103
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,445
Goodness. I'm sorry.

104
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,574
Hyeong-tae!

105
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,159
Clean this up.

106
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,296
The phone you are trying to reach
is switched off.

107
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,548
Please leave a message after the tone.

108
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,383
Hey, you.

109
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,151
What do you want?

110
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,117
I-na was the one

111
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,411
who stole the watch.

112
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,246
I think it's her classmate.

113
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,540
She says it was a birthday present,

114
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,626
but I don't see why she'd go that far
unless she was forced.

115
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,711
Something's not right.

116
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,714
Can you talk to her?

117
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,346
Talk to her yourself.

118
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,765
She's your daughter.

119
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,726
Why are you being like this?

120
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,019
This is it for us.

121
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,063
I find it unpleasant

122
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,983
that someone knows my future
that I don't know of.

123
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,985
And it makes me uneasy

124
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,322
that another Bok Gwi-ju
might show up out of nowhere

125
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,368
to look into my past
that I'd rather forget.

126
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,870
To be honest,

127
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,456
it's just too much.

128
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,167
Think about what I've seen your family do.

129
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,003
Floating in the air,

130
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,757
appearing and disappearing out of nowhere,

131
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,966
and now, I-na…

132
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,221
What about her?

133
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm just an average person.

134
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,269
I'm actually below average.

135
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,356
I can't deal with all these superpowers.

136
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,025
I understand that it's confusing.

137
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,819
But you're the one
who brought them all back.

138
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,074
And I'm going to save you with mine.

139
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,286
Are you?

140
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,996
Really?

141
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,624
Don't you find that odd?

142
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,877
I'm alive and well right in front of you.

143
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,671
Who exactly are you saving?

144
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,094
I think I was mistaken.

145
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,137
You can't be the one

146
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,139
who saved me.

147
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,478
You said you couldn't even go back
to the moment I-na was born.

148
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,813
That proves it.

149
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,525
Could you send my stuff over?

150
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,821
And please say goodbye
to your family for me.

151
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,364
I know it's not proper,

152
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,450
but I can't do it myself.

153
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,931
Hello?

154
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,308
Mom, something's wrong with Gwi-ju.

155
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,560
What's going on?

156
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,019
Well, he's…

157
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,104
What about him?

158
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,316
He's working out.

159
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,242
Are you trying to get in shape
to have another child?

160
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,830
You must be determined
to make this building yours.

161
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,103
I'd forgotten how bright
this room could be.

162
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,224
That's hot.

163
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,033
Ms. Do is away, so I thought I'd…

164
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,078
whip something up.

165
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,970
Dig in.

166
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,018
I'm late.

167
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,105
Have a nice day.

168
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,653
Did I burn them?

169
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,085
Jeez.

170
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,047
Mr. Bok.

171
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,758
What are you doing here?

172
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,052
I'll take that.

173
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,221
Come on.

174
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,775
I got it.

175
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,531
Hey!

176
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,242
Who threw these away?

177
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,872
They're still usable.

178
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,377
Where's my stuff?

179
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,856
Is that it?

180
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,232
Ms. Do.

181
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,859
Can we talk for--

182
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,782
I guess not.

183
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,433
PAIN RELIEF

184
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,155
What's the point of buttering me up?

185
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,422
Get out of here.

186
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,215
Who said you could come in here?

187
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,176
I don't remember you asking for permission

188
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,805
when you came into my life out of nowhere

189
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,933
and interfered with my future.

190
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,523
Get out.

191
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,108
Go already.

192
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,443
Fine.

193
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
I will.

194
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,252
Who spilled water here?

195
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,837
It's a safety hazard.

196
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,714
Hold on!

197
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,218
The floor's slippery, ma'am.

198
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,970
-Okay.
-Thank you.

199
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,138
No problem.

200
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,896
The floor's slippery, sir.

201
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,355
Thanks.

202
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,315
Sure.

203
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,947
Come on.

204
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,785
What do I have to do for you to leave?

205
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,829
You could come with me.

206
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,667
I'm not the only one waiting for you.

207
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,056
I-na.

208
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,902
You told Dad about it, didn't you?

209
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,907
I should tell everyone you're a fraud.

210
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,623
Are you listening?

211
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,503
I thought you could hear my thoughts.

212
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,550
Right, it's a secret.

213
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,387
I'll be discreet.

214
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,728
-Did you get that?
-No.

215
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,741
I can't hear you with my glasses on.

216
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,659
Huh?

217
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,704
And you need to get a lot closer.
I'm severely nearsighted.

218
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,750
Is that right?

219
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,545
What did you say to Dad?

220
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,672
I didn't say anything.

221
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,094
Hey now.

222
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,766
Fine, read my mind
if you don't believe me.

223
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,684
Go ahead.

224
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,274
Then why did he come
all the way to school?

225
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,234
You don't need a superpower to know that.

226
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,445
He's just looking out for you.

227
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,575
Listen.

228
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,119
About that girl, Hye-rim.

229
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,496
It's not her fault. I wanted to do it.

230
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,916
Don't you think you're doing
too much to please her?

231
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,837
It's not like that.

232
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,179
How long have you been able to read minds?

233
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,513
It's been a while.

234
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,433
Why did you hide it?

235
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,360
When are you moving back in?

236
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,405
How can I scam anyone
with a mind reader around?

237
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,907
You have to revise your plan.

238
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,661
Becoming our legal guardian
doesn't seem very feasible.

239
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,996
Why don't you make use of our superpowers?

240
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,706
Start a circus. It'll be a hit.

241
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,707
Oh my.

242
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,170
Thanks for the advice
on how to scam your family.

243
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,546
Just keep our secret.

244
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,927
How long do you plan on hiding it?

245
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,598
I understand it can be scary
to know what people think.

246
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,351
You probably heard things
you'd rather not hear.

247
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,769
But I-na.

248
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,814
Isn't it hard to keep it all to yourself?

249
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,524
Sounds like you got me all figured out.

250
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,150
Now it's my turn.

251
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,152
Hey, stop.

252
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,362
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,032
I'm sorry I acted like
I had you figured out.

254
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,992
I mean it.

255
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,827
See you at home, scammer.

256
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,911
What?

257
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,513
Thanks.

258
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,057
I don't think she's being bullied.

259
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,309
Just keep an eye on her.

260
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,102
It's just not like her.

261
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,855
The dance club, the watch…

262
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,065
She finally made her first friend.

263
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,775
She just wanted to do well.

264
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,030
Especially because she's never celebrated
her own birthday properly.

265
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,408
She just got a little ahead of herself.

266
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,119
She's just a kid.

267
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,788
Are we done now?

268
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,832
I'm gonna go.

269
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,500
Wait.

270
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,711
Come home with me.

271
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,005
I only agreed to help you one last time.

272
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,550
You're the only reason I found out

273
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,093
that I-na stole the watch.

274
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,220
I went back to a moment

275
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,431
we were together.

276
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,807
Which time?

277
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,731
That's not important.

278
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,234
My point is,

279
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,613
you led me to I-na.

280
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,741
I should be able to go back
to when she was born

281
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,368
with your help.

282
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,376
Watch over I-na.

283
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,629
Stealing the watch

284
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,381
might just be the tip of the iceberg.

285
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,843
She needs her dad, not me.

286
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,102
I don't know how to be a dad.

287
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,394
Neither do I.

288
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,855
I've never had a proper dad.

289
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,327
Ms. Do.

290
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,459
All I wanted

291
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,420
was for my dad to be happy.

292
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,678
I'll give that a try.

293
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,265
I'll find my way back
to the moment I-na was born.

294
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,850
I'll go back!

295
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,935
And I'll save you!

296
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,927
Gwi-ju just went out
for another early morning workout.

297
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,471
Ms. Do must be helping him
recover from depression.

298
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,146
Try to relax and get some sleep.

299
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,941
Ms. Do must be busy
helping out at the sauna.

300
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,195
I bet she ran away
because we found out about her scheme.

301
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,865
The smell makes me sick.

302
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,451
At a time like this,

303
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,370
Ms. Do's tea always worked like a charm.

304
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,082
You haven't gotten any sleep
ever since she left.

305
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,209
That's not it.

306
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,795
It's since that ex-convict
from the sauna was here.

307
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:10,842
Do you want me to do some probing?

308
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,801
Don't bother.

309
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,304
I was dying to get rid of her anyway.

310
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,513
Good riddance.

311
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,862
Let Dong-hee do it.

312
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,993
That was so refreshing.

313
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,746
-Thank you. That hit the spot.
-Sure.

314
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,084
Number 88!

315
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,131
I'll pay extra. Let me go first.

316
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,676
-Wait for your turn.
-Just let me go first.

317
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,394
I guess she wasn't lying.

318
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,854
She makes quite a bit of money.

319
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,491
What is going on today?

320
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,660
We have so many customers.

321
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,373
I know. Your wrist hurts, doesn't it?

322
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,959
Why is Dodari dragging this out?

323
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:31,965
At this rate, you'll be scrubbing
people's bodies until you die of old age.

324
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,059
Grace, that little…

325
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,394
Are you number 88?

326
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,021
No.

327
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,066
I thought I saw someone I knew.

328
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,944
That was Grace, wasn't it?

329
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,373
What are you doing?

330
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,464
Were you trained to use your right hand
although you were left-handed?

331
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,715
Yes. What?

332
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,383
Your calves must cramp up all the time.

333
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,218
-Especially the left side.
-They do.

334
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,180
Your shoulders are uneven,
and so are your hips.

335
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,766
No wonder
your lymph nodes are all clogged.

336
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,935
How do you know all that?

337
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,942
Lie down.

338
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,196
I can take 3 kg right off of you.

339
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,451
What is this?

340
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,872
It feels like

341
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,458
I'm flying.

342
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,971
My body feels so light.

343
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,146
Was it to your liking?

344
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,106
Yes.

345
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,026
Let's see.

346
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,362
Do you take credit?

347
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,157
Actually,

348
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,784
we're cash only.

349
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,370
Consider it a freebie.

350
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,499
And tell your mother

351
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,585
that I'm not sending Da-hae back

352
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,005
until they make the marriage official.

353
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,758
Hold on.

354
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,635
How did you…

355
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,352
Guess who I saw there.

356
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,562
Scoot over.

357
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,319
Just what I needed.

358
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,283
Who did you see?

359
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,994
Grace.

360
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,833
The new trainer at the gym.

361
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,129
She showed up
at the exact same time as Do Da-hae.

362
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,964
Can't she go to a sauna?

363
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,009
She was talking about someone
she called Dodari.

364
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,803
Who do you think that is?

365
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,597
They're all in on it together.

366
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,351
It was no coincidence
that Grace showed up at Ji-han's clinic.

367
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,478
All the pieces
are falling right into place.

368
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,314
They were worried
that I might get the building,

369
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,317
so she lured Ji-han to a hotel.

370
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,985
Did he cheat on you?

371
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,488
And you spent so much money on him.

372
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,658
Stop.

373
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,451
Ji-han is a victim too.

374
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,996
Grace came onto him
to sabotage my marriage.

375
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,289
Or is that what you want to believe?

376
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,626
Are you sure it was Grace?

377
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,253
I'm positive.

378
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,589
At least I heard her voice.

379
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,179
Was I too quick to trust Do Da-hae?

380
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,014
But you saw her in your dreams.

381
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,311
You don't usually try to deny

382
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,522
what you see in your dreams.

383
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,316
But it was all so blurry.

384
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,445
-I must've been wrong this time.
-What?

385
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,324
No, you weren't.

386
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,435
He used his power.

387
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,524
What the…

388
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,696
Gwi-ju.

389
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,533
What just happened?

390
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,036
How long has it been back?

391
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,787
Since he met Da-hae.

392
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,207
Did you know about this?

393
00:31:59,083 --> 00:31:59,959
-Yes.
-What?

394
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,879
Where did you go? Or when?

395
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,173
To Do Da-hae.

396
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,218
I can only return to the moments
I spent with her.

397
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,638
Just like you only dream about her.

398
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,806
All this talk about Do Da-hae…

399
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,310
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

400
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,229
And why did you hide it from us?

401
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,106
Well, that's because…

402
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,029
Gwi-ju can do more than
return to the past now.

403
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,155
What else?

404
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,202
What is it? Tell us.

405
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,788
We were waiting

406
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:41,709
until every one of us experienced changes.

407
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,545
-Whatever.
-Come to think of it, Dong-hee.

408
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,298
-Did you lose some weight?
-Huh?

409
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,135
Really?

410
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,141
This is just the result of my hard work.

411
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,144
Do Da-hae had nothing to do with it.

412
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,400
I-na might be going through
some changes too.

413
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,862
-Welcome.
-Let's try these on.

414
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,532
-That's so cute.
-So cute.

415
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,909
It's perfect for you.

416
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,828
Let's take a selfie.

417
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,747
Look at the camera.

418
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,416
One, two…

419
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,961
Come on. Look at the camera.

420
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,130
What are you doing, I-na?

421
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,298
Join us.

422
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,011
Yes, I-na. Come on.

423
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,775
One, two, three.

424
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,778
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

425
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,030
Let's take a picture.

426
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,656
That's a good backdrop. Let's go.

427
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,657
Welcome.

428
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,825
How's the cotton candy?

429
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,619
-Do you like it?
-I got something even better.

430
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,121
-Here you go.
-Wow.

431
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,582
-Show it to Mommy.
-Let me see.

432
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,958
-Let me hold it.
-No.

433
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,710
Give it a name and show Mommy.

434
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,628
It's Toto.

435
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,756
-Toto? Let me see Toto.
-Show Mommy.

436
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,591
Let me have a look.

437
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,060
Why…

438
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,402
Thanks.

439
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,783
I'll meet you guys there.

440
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,120
I-na.

441
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,292
Can you bring Jun-woo to the carousel
without anyone else knowing?

442
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,923
I'm going to ask him out.

443
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,302
What?

444
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:10,983
I thought you wanted to ride.

445
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,777
Who are we waiting for?

446
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,741
Hye-rim has something to tell you.

447
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,998
What about you?

448
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,583
Do you have anything to tell me?

449
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,794
What?

450
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:37,009
Why are you so nice to me?

451
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,513
-Isn't it obvious?
-But…

452
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,850
the other day…

453
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,936
at the convenience store…

454
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,646
You mean when you called me a jerk?

455
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,440
I know you didn't mean it.

456
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,318
I can tell by your eyes.

457
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,450
By any chance,

458
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:07,081
do you have any ancestors
with the last name Bok?

459
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,166
What are you talking about?

460
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,004
I mean,

461
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,048
can you read people's minds

462
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,385
when you look into people's eyes?

463
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,390
You can tell…

464
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,643
by my eyes, can't you?

465
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,478
Huh?

466
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,023
That I like you.

467
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,467
Here she comes.

468
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,558
She's here.

469
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,394
-Mr. Bok?
-Oh, hey.

470
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,979
Why are you here again?

471
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,190
Are you working out?

472
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,318
I wouldn't call it a workout.

473
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,653
It's more like a warm-up.

474
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,321
It gets stuffy in the gym.

475
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,618
But I did start working out recently.

476
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,038
Although it'll take me a while

477
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,707
to get back into my old shape.

478
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,542
I'm almost there though.

479
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,504
Man, that's tiring.

480
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,547
She's gone.

481
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,934
Teach me how to make seaweed soup.

482
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,936
Come on.

483
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,272
I want to make some
for I-na's birthday next year.

484
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,731
Leave before my mom sees you.

485
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,442
Come on. I love seaweed soup.

486
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,569
My mom is

487
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,615
a lot scarier than you think.

488
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,492
-Talking about me?
-Oh my.

489
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,702
Hello.

490
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,376
You should get the basics down
before you make seaweed soup.

491
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,116
I feel like we're digging our own graves.

492
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,535
Just focus on Da-hae.

493
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,205
She's clearly the one who will
get the Bok family back on its feet.

494
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,041
I'll take the lead.

495
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,792
Just stand behind me and stay quiet.

496
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,711
Come on.

497
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,677
PALACE SAUNA

498
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,595
Enjoy.

499
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,096
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

500
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,140
Hello.

501
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,225
I'm Gwi-ju's dad.

502
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,561
-Hi.
-Last time,

503
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,897
I was away when you visited.

504
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,690
As the head of the family,

505
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,193
I wanted to formally greet you.

506
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,239
I'm not big on formalities.

507
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,825
You don't even want to be here.

508
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,037
Ms. Bok clearly seems unhappy.

509
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,872
Not at all.

510
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,375
She's just badly sleep-deprived.

511
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,961
By the way, where's Ms. Do?

512
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,131
Didn't your daughter relay the message?

513
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,927
You can't meet Da-hae
until you make it official.

514
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,011
Right.

515
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,597
But who cares about formalities?

516
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,349
Plus, our kids are in love.

517
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,352
We can't break them up.

518
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,561
That is true.

519
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:02,775
We can't seem to get rid of
that clingy son of yours.

520
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,152
Come on in.

521
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,659
All the way over there.

522
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,834
Gwi-ju!

523
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,711
Honey.

524
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,671
Oh my.

525
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,214
-Come this way.
-My gosh.

526
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,507
-Come on.
-Ms. Bok.

527
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,591
My eyes.

528
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,998
It's so humid in here.

529
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,259
She needs to get her sleep somewhere.

530
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,596
She looks like
she could drop dead any minute.

531
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,184
Thank you for the gesture,

532
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,770
but she's a fussy sleeper.

533
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,773
Pick up your son on the way out.

534
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,905
We're ready to…

535
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,575
register their marriage.

536
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,753
The real head of the Bok family
is finally talking.

537
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,548
We've already got the papers ready.

538
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,372
She's going to be a while.

539
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,415
She's sleeping.

540
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,500
What?

541
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,418
My mother?

542
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,345
Did you put her to sleep?

543
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,105
That's not good.

544
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,288
This is incredible.

545
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:21,765
Just so you know,
we've all agreed to the marriage now.

546
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,648
Hey.

547
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,317
Let me get you some more soup.

548
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,401
I got it.

549
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,948
-Thank you.
-No problem.

550
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,703
Ms. Do puts my wife to sleep
just by the touch of her hands.

551
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,746
I see.

552
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,914
Now I know where she got that from.

553
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,168
Is the kimchi to your liking?

554
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,252
Yes.

555
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,296
-It's perfect.
-Great.

556
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,048
You should take some home.

557
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,549
Thank you so much.

558
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,183
Careful, it's hot.

559
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,734
Everything tastes great.

560
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,402
Thank you. Help yourself.

561
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,538
Honey.

562
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,665
Honey!

563
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,166
Honey!

564
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,753
Honey!

565
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,546
You're up.

566
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,341
-Did you have a dream?
-Yes.

567
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,218
Are you okay?

568
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,553
What did you see?

569
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,890
I saw Da-hae.

570
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,853
Honey.

571
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,037
I'll be in touch.

572
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,981
Never set foot in that place again.

573
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,482
What did you dream about?

574
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,568
I'm absolutely sure this time.

575
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,737
-I saw everything clearly.
-So what exactly did you see?

576
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,328
Did you even have a dream?

577
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,040
You had your doubts too.

578
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,542
You haven't registered your marriage

579
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,169
because you weren't sure.

580
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,547
What if that's changed?

581
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,924
I'm sure now.

582
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,634
What?

583
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,306
I just saw how all of this ends.

584
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,849
Do you really have to do this?

585
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,269
I have to see this through myself.

586
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,897
There's something I have to see.

587
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,159
What did you see anyway?

588
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,212
These are your favorite, right?

589
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,923
You saw what?

590
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:24,925
For real?

591
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,511
Gwi-ju and Do Da-hae…

592
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,305
Are you sure?

593
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,057
Yes.

594
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,353
It was a grand wedding.

595
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,273
Marry you?

596
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,066
Why are you surprised?

597
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,195
Didn't you know this would happen

598
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,490
when I brought you
the marriage registration from the future?

599
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,161
Did Ms. Bok really

600
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,664
dream about our wedding?

601
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,710
The future's already decided.

602
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,878
And I'm quite excited about it.

603
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,549
Just accept it, Ms. Do.

604
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,603
What if I don't want to?

605
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,772
Like I said, you don't have to save me.

606
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,817
Even if you don't,

607
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,653
-I'm right here, and I'm just fine.
-I know.

608
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,780
You're alive.

609
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,116
And that's what keeps me going.

610
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,830
The fact that you're alive

611
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,417
proves that I'll save you one day.

612
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,421
You're right here by my side.

613
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,590
If that's not hope,

614
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,343
I don't know what is.

615
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,263
I decided to hold on to that hope.

616
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,141
Even if the future's been decided,

617
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,227
I can't just sit around
waiting for it to arrive.

618
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:02,814
So I'm going to do

619
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,484
what I can do now.

620
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,446
Be it getting married…

621
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,783
or falling in love.

622
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,080
To 50 billion won!

623
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,253
Dodari.

624
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,882
You go, girl.

625
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:32,386
I guess playing hard to get paid off.

626
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,721
No, her sincerity paid off.

627
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,225
There's no sincerity in a marriage fraud.

628
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,436
But your groom-to-be
seems totally serious.

629
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,439
He started working out,

630
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,775
and he doesn't reek of alcohol.

631
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,235
He's like a new man.

632
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,948
I think I'm going to turn in
for the night.

633
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,157
I'm not feeling well.

634
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,446
Congratulations, scammer.

635
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,054
Have you gotten attached
to the Bok family or something?

636
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,517
Hardly.

637
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,729
Just by the way,

638
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,525
you don't have to marry him
if you don't want to.

639
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,030
You'd just have to be
stuck with me a little longer.

640
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,743
But I'm actually pretty sad to let you go.

641
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,331
Think about all we've been through.

642
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:31,087
And all the insurance money
that's been stacking up.

643
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,601
WEDDING VOWS

644
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,771
The weather is lovely today.

645
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,231
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

646
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:53,235
Could you move the big table over here?

647
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,195
-Yes, sir.
-Put the flowers over here.

648
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,488
-Yes, sir.
-Be careful.

649
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,572
-Yes, sir.
-Careful.

650
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,160
I assume you only used
the top-shelf produce?

651
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,119
Yes, of course.

652
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,579
I love the colors.

653
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,472
Yes?

654
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,811
Did you pick one out?

655
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,396
Well…

656
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,818
I don't think they'd suit me.

657
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,737
I've been there.

658
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,241
I felt so suffocated in my tuxedo
that I wanted to rip it off.

659
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,578
But listen.

660
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,706
I've witnessed my wife's dreams come true

661
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,208
time and time again in my life.

662
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,919
But they didn't always
come true on their own.

663
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,298
At times, someone had to
make those dreams come true.

664
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,133
Were you…

665
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,095
My wife had me by her side.

666
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,390
And you're the one for Gwi-ju.

667
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,061
I'd like to tell you

668
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:14,149
what it is like
to be a part of the Bok family.

669
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,575
Let me see that.

670
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,748
This is going to hurt.

671
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,294
But some steps are inevitable

672
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,798
in order to reach your destination.

673
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,179
Think of it as ripping off a Band-Aid.

674
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,139
It'll be over soon.

675
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,398
You can have these back.

676
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,195
-But why?
-Why do you think?

677
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,667
I never know what you're thinking.

678
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,835
But you seem to see right through me.

679
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,673
Honestly, it's kind of creepy.

680
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,899
Oh my goodness.

681
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,403
You said it'd be a small ceremony,

682
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,571
but look at all this.

683
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,661
We just wanted to
make it as official as we could.

684
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,789
Just like you wanted.

685
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,752
Did you get some sleep last night?

686
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,463
I was so excited about the wedding

687
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,298
that I tossed and turned.

688
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,010
Would you like a massage?

689
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:10,390
Your massage the other day
really cleared my head.

690
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:16,021
Thanks to you,
everything's become crystal clear.

691
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,689
I can't thank you enough.

692
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,817
Everything's as clear as day.

693
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,617
Please excuse me while I freshen up.

694
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,411
Sure.

695
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,525
I-na.

696
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,069
Was it you?

697
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,333
Is this about your dad getting married?

698
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,210
Not really.

699
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,462
So you didn't feel like
you were losing your dad?

700
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,090
He was never around to begin with.

701
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,720
Anyway, don't worry.

702
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,056
No one's taking your dad away.

703
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,780
I'll work out with you.

704
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,117
I'm expensive.

705
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,702
Where are you going?

706
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,871
Demonstrate for me.

707
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,164
I'm putting on some weights.

708
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,258
All right.

709
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,094
You go down

710
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,888
and then up.

711
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,516
Seen enough?

712
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,185
I thought you were just a power,

713
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,729
but you're pretty good.

714
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,814
Nice form.

715
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,984
I have strong legs.

716
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,486
You can go heavier then, right?

717
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,077
This should be easy for you.

718
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,626
Show me what you've got.

719
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,754
I think this is a bit too heavy for me.

720
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,672
I'll spot you.

721
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,060
Right.

722
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,562
Did you hear?

723
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,772
My brother's getting married today.

724
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,858
So why aren't you there?

725
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,151
I'll go soon.

726
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,111
I'm going to crash that wedding.

727
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,822
I have evidence that the woman is a fraud.

728
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,824
What evidence?

729
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,369
Guess what I found in her room.

730
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:20,622
Drugs.

731
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,208
No way.

732
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,834
Drugs?

733
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,628
Probably just sleeping pills.

734
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,546
Sleeping pills?

735
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,090
Oh.

736
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,844
So that's what she's been giving my mom.

737
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,932
Wait. Come back!

738
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,726
Please help me.

739
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,362
What's taking her so long?

740
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,990
I'm sorry, Ms. Baek.

741
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,325
Please wait a moment.

742
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,161
We have to get started soon.

743
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,457
No.

744
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,968
Mom.

745
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,931
Bad news.

746
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,016
-It's really bad.
-Can I help you?

747
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,315
Hello, I'm a trainer at The Bok's Gym.

748
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,818
I'm here to congratulate Mr. Bok.

749
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,237
Yes, I do remember you.

750
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,447
You have a good memory.

751
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,700
We only briefly crossed paths at the gym.

752
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,411
No, I saw you in my dream.

753
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,121
Your dream?

754
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,664
See you around.

755
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,962
Bok Don't Eat found out.

756
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,230
I'm going to prove she's a fraud.

757
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,025
No matter what.

758
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,856
She's beautiful.

759
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:38,986
Just like she was in my dream.

760
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,291
Gwi-ju lost his power

761
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,294
because of a certain moment
from many years ago.

762
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,673
It was the happiest moment of his life.

763
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,259
Do you mean the moment I-na was born?

764
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:06,806
That moment gave him hope.

765
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,811
But his hope soon turned into despair.

766
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:18,067
The happiest moment of his life
turned into a monster

767
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,486
and swallowed him up.

768
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,744
He kept being pulled back
into that moment.

769
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:33,249
Day in, day out.

770
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,213
Eventually, he ceased to exist anywhere.

771
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:43,009
In the present,
he was consumed by the past.

772
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,887
In the past, he was like a ghost

773
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,139
who couldn't touch anything.

774
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,349
And eventually…

775
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,726
Se-yeon.

776
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,645
Se-yeon!

777
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,982
There was a door in that moment,

778
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,526
and it was just like you.

779
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,529
It was a glimmer of hope
that glowed with vivid colors.

780
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,994
If he loses his hope again,

781
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,954
he might not be able to recover.

782
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,891
Ms. Do.

783
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:34,852
Yes?

784
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,562
What were you thinking about?

785
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,764
Gosh, I'm tired.

786
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,643
There has to be something.

787
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,678
This is…

788
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,223
I found it.

789
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,477
The evidence that Do Da-hae fooled us all.

790
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,150
Bok Don't Eat!

791
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,071
Damn it.

792
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,282
Wait a minute.

793
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:13,075
Wait.

794
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,202
I said wait!

795
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,456
What's that?

796
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,876
It's all over, Grace.

797
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,961
Get out of my way.

798
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,008
-Just a second.
-Let go!

799
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,509
-Please.
-What's wrong with you?

800
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,969
Wait a minute.

801
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,764
You're making a huge mistake.

802
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,641
Look at this, Mom!

803
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,852
Look what I found in Do Da-hae's suitcase!

804
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,106
Let go.

805
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,399
I said let go!

806
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,526
Give it here!

807
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,251
I did it.

808
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,014
Did you just hear that?

809
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,100
Not now.

810
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,810
This is a crucial moment.

811
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,105
What exactly did you see in your dream?

812
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,482
It wasn't just the wedding, was it?

813
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,275
You'll see soon enough.

814
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,634
Take a look around.

815
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,054
You might see me

816
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:58,764
somewhere around here.

817
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,267
What do you mean?

818
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,893
I think I'll remember this moment

819
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,396
for a long time.

820
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:13,738
As a happy moment.

821
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,713
No, you're not here.

822
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,634
-What?
-Your future self isn't here.

823
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:37,970
You won't be here.

824
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:39,805
Because…

825
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,604
I'm actually a fraud.

826
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,948
What did you say?

827
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,911
You were my mom's third target.

828
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,205
You jumping into the water

829
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:06,665
was the golden opportunity
we'd been waiting for.

830
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,794
The suspicious guy in front of
the ladies' room I-na was in

831
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,088
was one of us.

832
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,215
-Ms. Da-hae.
-Just as your sister suspected,

833
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:16,634
I spiked Ms. Bok's tea
with sleeping pills.

834
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,138
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Ms. Bok?

835
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,432
You can see the future.

836
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,191
I'm sorry.

837
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,072
You can't save me.

838
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,084
Hey.

839
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,642
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

840
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,214
You were…

841
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,427
the only one I could reach in the past.

842
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:44,805
I can only go back
to the times I spent with you.

843
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,849
You're the only one
who can see or touch me.

844
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,227
I can see him.

845
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,731
I can even touch him.

846
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,525
I'm not sure why.

847
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,155
It's all over now.

848
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:03,908
I will never

849
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,536
go back to a moment
I spent with Do Da-hae.

850
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:14,126
