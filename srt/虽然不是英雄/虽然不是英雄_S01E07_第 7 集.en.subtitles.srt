1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,730
Take a look around.

3
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,233
You might see me

4
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,818
somewhere around here.

5
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,029
What do you mean?

6
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,615
I think I'll remember this moment

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,784
for a long time.

8
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,917
As a happy moment.

9
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,753
What an idiot.

10
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,591
No, you're not here.

11
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,356
Such a waste of energy.

12
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,733
Why have a wedding
if you knew it would be ruined?

13
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,237
What happens in my dreams is inevitable.

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,279
You know that.

15
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,074
You could've at least given us a heads-up.

16
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,369
We wasted so much money on these flowers.

17
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,164
And what about the dress she ran away in?

18
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,041
We rented that out, right?

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,376
How much did that cost?

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,003
It's a small price to pay
to ditch the swindlers.

21
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,173
And this was the wake-up call
that Gwi-ju needed.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,718
Why haven't you put all of these away yet?

23
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,636
Get to it!

24
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,306
Are you sure about this?

25
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,184
Whatever her intention was,

26
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,229
she gave you back your dreams
and Gwi-ju his past.

27
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,315
What's the point of going back
to a moment of being fooled?

28
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,735
And what's the point of dreaming
about the woman who fooled us?

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,530
What about her wearing the family ring?

30
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,366
How will you explain that?

31
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,785
I can explain that.

32
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,330
Look what I found

33
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,291
in Do Da-hae's suitcase.

34
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,465
She stole it.

35
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,467
I told you.

36
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,052
The dream was warning you

37
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,345
to beware of that woman.

38
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,850
But…

39
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,604
Gwi-ju isn't simply
going back to his past--

40
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,522
Just clean this up already.

41
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,493
That was a close one.

42
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,248
But at least it's all over now.

43
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,083
Right?

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,045
I was hoping for a clean break.

45
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,465
I didn't see you fly in my dream.

46
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,383
Why did you have to fly in front of her?

47
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,345
You never could
when I constantly begged you to.

48
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,429
What?

49
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,556
Would you rather I broke something

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,642
-by falling on the floor?
-Quiet.

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,607
Those crooks are the last people
who should find out about our secrets.

52
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,818
There's just no pleasing you.

53
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,843
-Mom!
-Mom!

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,761
-Mom!
-Mom!

55
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,845
Come here!

56
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,849
-Mom!
-Mom!

57
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,601
She's a fraud.

58
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,270
She can fly.

59
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,437
Get over here.

60
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,356
Where's Dodari?

61
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,816
Did she run away alone?

62
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,194
Where do you think you're going?

63
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,947
She's working with Do Da-hae.

64
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,242
She can fly, Mom.
I saw it with my own eyes.

65
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,369
-Shut up.
-Let go!

66
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,620
Let her go.

67
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,372
We can't just let her go.

68
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,082
We have to call the police.

69
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,130
Please stop causing a scene.

70
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,382
If you leave now,

71
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:04,429
I'll let you off the hook
for making a fool of all of us.

72
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,807
This is why you insisted
on holding the ceremony here

73
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,351
without inviting any guests, isn't it?

74
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,061
You already knew.

75
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,147
That the wedding would be ruined.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,821
So you really have been
hiding it in your house.

77
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,866
A toad that lays golden eggs.

78
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,870
I think you mean a goose.

79
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,546
Mom!

80
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,888
What the hell is this?

81
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,475
It's just like I said.

82
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,727
How much of it was a lie?

83
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,104
Did you lie about
the marriage registration too?

84
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,858
What about the fire 13 years ago?

85
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,113
You weren't lying about that, were you?

86
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,160
You were…

87
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,289
the only one I could reach in the past.

88
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,709
I can only go back
to the times I spent with you.

89
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,503
You're the only one
who can see or touch me.

90
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,672
That was real.

91
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,302
Your past is my future.

92
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,888
What has happened to you
will happen to me.

93
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,933
I saved you 13 years ago.

94
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,101
No, I will!

95
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,229
That's my fate.

96
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,903
That has to be real.

97
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,531
Right?

98
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,411
Answer me.

99
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,831
Say something!

100
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,671
It's my repertoire.

101
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,882
-What?
-A pitiful high school girl

102
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,759
who survived a fire.

103
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,223
Nothing melts a person's heart
faster than that.

104
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,643
So I'm not the first--

105
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,727
Didn't I tell you?

106
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,771
You were my third.

107
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,154
Does that mean

108
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,739
you've said the same thing

109
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,825
to others before?

110
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,285
It wasn't exactly the same.

111
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,911
I used to say,

112
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,415
"You look like the person
who saved my life."

113
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,084
So that's different.

114
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,006
Are you saying…

115
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,134
you lied about everything?

116
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,325
And I kept going back

117
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,411
to those moments of lies

118
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,164
over and over again.

119
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,834
Like an idiot.

120
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,099
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

121
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,831
Explain yourself.

122
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,375
I just want to know.

123
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,087
Why did you sabotage the wedding
that you had in a bag?

124
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:54,176
And it seemed like Ms. Bok knew
that you would ruin the ceremony.

125
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,386
So what?

126
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,179
Does she really have a superpower?

127
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,142
Or are you one of the Boks now?

128
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:05,980
Let's stop here.

129
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,986
I want to quit.

130
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,366
Is this what I get for taking you in
after that fire?

131
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,414
If you regret saving me,

132
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,915
just kill me here and now.

133
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,422
Or I could do it myself
and save you some trouble.

134
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,923
Oh, right.

135
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,010
Then you wouldn't get a penny out of it.

136
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,804
What if they really have superpowers?

137
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,391
Maybe they're not delusional.

138
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,103
Maybe she can really see the future.

139
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,106
Precognitive dreams?

140
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,524
Da-hae didn't screw up.

141
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,402
Their superpowers got in our way.

142
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,198
Superpowers?

143
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,452
Yeah, I saw it too.

144
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:49,041
That chubster was floating in the air.

145
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,589
Mom, we could make a fortune off of this.

146
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,970
I have to see it for myself.

147
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,621
I thought you'd be knee-deep in booze.

148
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,208
You're clearly knee-deep
in something though.

149
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,128
Please don't tell me it's that scammer.

150
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,091
Don't go back anymore.

151
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,303
Not that I think you can anyway.

152
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,640
Where did he go?

153
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,977
Are you okay?

154
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,104
So heavy.

155
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,357
It was me.

156
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,234
I'm fine.

157
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,444
Don't mind me.

158
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,538
What are you doing?

159
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,166
You'll catch a cold if you don't dry off.

160
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,889
I'd rather he started drinking again.

161
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,309
Why is he brooding over it?

162
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,687
It might take him a while to get over her.

163
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,607
Just like that door.

164
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,901
The door from 13 years ago?

165
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,653
What's that got to do with anything?

166
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,738
What does it have to do with Do Da-hae?

167
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,114
Honey.

168
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,449
To Gwi-ju, Do Da-hae--

169
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,825
I don't want to hear it!

170
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,160
Don't bring her up ever again.

171
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,580
What's going on at the sauna?

172
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,124
Nothing yet.

173
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,879
We don't know
what her mother will do next.

174
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,340
I'd better get some sleep.

175
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,593
And you'd better lie low.

176
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,554
They don't scare me.

177
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,142
You keep an eye on I-na.

178
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,004
Are you in?

179
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,800
Do you want to get malatang?

180
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,345
No.

181
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,849
But you like spicy food.

182
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,058
No.

183
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,894
Not with you.

184
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,400
What about with Hye-rim?

185
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,154
She asked me to bring you.

186
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,449
She was worried you seemed down all day.

187
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,243
Really?

188
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,332
Let's go, I-na.

189
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,084
-What's taking so long?
-I know.

190
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,503
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

191
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,963
You want me to come?

192
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,883
-Can I do that?
-What?

193
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,009
Why would you ask that?

194
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,095
Wait.

195
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,972
Something's off.

196
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,682
Is everything okay?

197
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,351
Are you sick?

198
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,439
Do you have a fever?

199
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,110
Don't come.

200
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,908
You're coming, right?

201
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
No.

202
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,913
What?

203
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,123
-Give her back her glasses.
-Right.

204
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,250
I shouldn't touch her glasses.

205
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,460
Sorry, I-na.

206
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,212
Let me put them on you.

207
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,299
Get lost.

208
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,096
-What the hell?
-Are you okay, Hye-rim?

209
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,222
-Are you okay?
-Are you hurt?

210
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,475
What a freak.

211
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,519
Why would she do that to Hye-rim?

212
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,562
She's such a weirdo.

213
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,147
That's enough.

214
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,817
She must be feeling under the weather.

215
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,027
You're so understanding, Hye-rim.

216
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,613
She takes you for granted.

217
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,457
I-na.

218
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,545
Do you want to move to a prettier house?

219
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,715
What about Daddy?

220
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,343
Daddy…

221
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,764
can't come with us.

222
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,543
Hey, kid.

223
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,295
Are you okay?

224
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,590
Are you hurt?

225
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,550
Today just keeps getting worse.

226
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,389
What's wrong?

227
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,892
Oh my.

228
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,519
Are you hurt?

229
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,813
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay, kid?

230
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,858
-Are you hurt?
-Should we call your parents?

231
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,068
Stay there.

232
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,695
Are you okay?

233
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,238
Do you need an ambulance?

234
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,156
What's wrong with her?

235
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,157
Are you okay, kid?

236
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,367
Watch where you're going.

237
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,827
Is she out of her mind?

238
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,287
Kids these days are scary.

239
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,123
-Are you hurt?
-She must be in too much pain to talk.

240
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,208
What should we do?

241
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,592
The number you are trying to reach…

242
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,552
Why won't she pick up?

243
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,809
Is this the academy?

244
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,979
I'm calling to ask
if Bok I-na is done with her class today.

245
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,357
Pardon?

246
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,610
Honey.

247
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,625
Gwi-ju.

248
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,127
I-na is missing.

249
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,045
She didn't go to the academy.

250
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,434
Where in the past
are you wandering around now?

251
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,867
This can't be right.

252
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,245
There, I got you. Watch your step.

253
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,455
Hold on.

254
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,958
Oh my goodness.

255
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,835
I wasn't happy then.

256
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,594
Could it be

257
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,514
that you came from the future
and held my hand?

258
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,183
It was all a lie.

259
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,977
Enjoy.

260
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,353
Enjoy, I-na.

261
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,821
I almost forgot. Just a second.

262
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,826
Why do I keep

263
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,329
coming back to these moments?

264
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,130
Where could he be?

265
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,381
Are you looking for me?

266
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,721
You're back.

267
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,979
Why do you keep looking back
at the ruins of the past?

268
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,522
I don't know.

269
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,567
It just happens whenever I close my eyes.

270
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,611
Get it together.

271
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,821
While you were wandering in the past,

272
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,657
I-na went missing.

273
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,119
What?

274
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,166
-That felt nice.
-It was great.

275
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,668
-How refreshing.
-The meal's on you, right?

276
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253
Sure, it's my treat.

277
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,505
What do you want to eat?

278
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,137
My goodness.

279
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,766
Look who's here.

280
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,812
I-na.

281
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,507
Here you go.

282
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,803
Want me to peel it?

283
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,561
I heard you're the one

284
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,023
who told Da-hae
your family lost their superpowers

285
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,649
to lifestyle diseases.

286
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,070
I wonder how they got their powers back.

287
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:08,118
Your grandma can see the future,
your dad can go back to the past,

288
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,287
and your aunt can fly.

289
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,499
What about you, sweetheart?

290
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,669
What's your superpower?

291
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,840
Well?

292
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,009
Didn't Ms. Da-hae warn you

293
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,635
not to look me in the eye?

294
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,313
What will you do?

295
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,732
Turn me into stone?

296
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,610
Or make me vanish, like "poof"?

297
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,992
Go on then.

298
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,703
Do it.

299
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,467
Poof.

300
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,731
Come out.

301
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,128
They actually have superpowers,

302
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,755
and we're the only ones who know that.

303
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,593
And now, that little gem
just walked in here on her own.

304
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,100
She doesn't have any powers.

305
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:59,855
Guess what the most common cause
of lifestyle diseases is?

306
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,235
Family.

307
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,029
And you're the one

308
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,907
who got that kid out of that hellhole.

309
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,243
Am I right?

310
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,415
What's your point?

311
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,418
I'll give you a second chance.

312
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:27,007
If the Bok family accumulated wealth
using their superpowers,

313
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:32,304
we could squeeze
a lot more out of them than we planned.

314
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,349
They wouldn't dare to call the police.

315
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,855
This is your chance to redeem yourself.

316
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,323
Are you out of your mind?

317
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,158
No, just blind.

318
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,455
What are you doing here?

319
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,253
Hey.

320
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,216
You can't be here.

321
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,134
Were you locked up?

322
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,766
Where are your glasses?

323
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,685
I lost them.

324
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,481
What happened?

325
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,693
I'm not being bullied.

326
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,285
-Stop looking at my eyes.
-You can yell, but you can't scare me.

327
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,501
You were the only one I could think of

328
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,003
when I lost my glasses.

329
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,965
You're the only person
I can look in the eyes

330
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,467
without being scared.

331
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,519
Does your dad know you're here?

332
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,939
I bet he's gone again.

333
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,942
Gone? Where?

334
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,443
He's been stuck in the past lately.

335
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,283
When in the past?

336
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,994
When do you think?

337
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,462
I looked the other way for you.
Why did you screw it up?

338
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,804
Jeez. What?

339
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,640
Could it be that you left him

340
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,726
out of love?

341
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,644
Look me in the eyes.

342
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,148
I've never had such a cheesy thought.

343
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,777
-Come on.
-I think you might have.

344
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,070
This isn't going to work.

345
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,866
Let's get you a new pair of glasses.

346
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,242
Enjoy.

347
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,837
Are you heading out?

348
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,380
What?

349
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,676
She needs a new pair of glasses.

350
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,889
I-na.

351
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,975
You still haven't shown me

352
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,144
how you shoot lasers out of your eyes.

353
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,655
She can't see anything right now.

354
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,908
All right.

355
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,248
Don't mind us.

356
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,377
-Get her a nice pair of glasses.
-Okay.

357
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,003
See you later.

358
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,755
See you.

359
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,475
Do you like those?

360
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:11,981
How much are they?

361
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,027
780,000 won.

362
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,994
Are they too expensive?

363
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,789
Not at all.

364
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,375
They look great on you.

365
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,629
Just a second.

366
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,842
Here you go.

367
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,266
Wow.

368
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,143
You look great.

369
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,776
Are you expecting someone?

370
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,361
What?

371
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,823
I-na! Bok I-na!

372
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,369
Did you call Dad?

373
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,082
I'm done coddling you.

374
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,626
Don't come back again.

375
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,671
I heard that old lady's thoughts.

376
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,217
She's testing your loyalty.

377
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,179
This is your last chance.

378
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,639
If you just let me go,

379
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,224
you'll be in huge trouble.

380
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,061
What… Hey.

381
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,690
She's far too dangerous
for you to look her in the eyes.

382
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,026
And I thought you were
scared of eye contact.

383
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,529
I-na.

384
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,114
Are you okay?

385
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,577
Are you wearing new glasses?

386
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,872
Ms. Da-hae got them for me.

387
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,750
Did you lure her with new glasses?

388
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,418
What did you do to her?

389
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,586
She didn't do anything.

390
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,588
And I went to the sauna on my own.

391
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,590
Why?

392
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,800
What for?

393
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,261
To eat some eggs,

394
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,639
drink some rice punch,

395
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,682
and play some games.

396
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,194
I was fattening her up
so I could eat her later.

397
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,740
Dad.

398
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,493
-She's not such a bad person.
-Go wait in the car.

399
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,995
Now.

400
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,998
Come on.

401
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,821
I returned her safely this time,

402
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,823
but I won't next time.

403
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,534
You don't want to find out

404
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,536
what will happen then.

405
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,706
Let me ask you one last question.

406
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,380
Is it true that you survived a fire

407
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
thirteen years ago?

408
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,888
What about the fifth-floor storage?

409
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,229
One of my colleagues
who took my shift that day

410
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,440
died in that fire.

411
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,069
He heard someone was locked up in there

412
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,489
and dashed into the collapsing building.

413
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,243
If I wasn't the one who saved you,

414
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,704
it might have been him.

415
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,584
He had a family.

416
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,920
A wife

417
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,922
and a toddler son.

418
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,928
I can't believe
he gave his life to that girl

419
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,430
for her to end up like this.

420
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,311
Live a meaningful life.

421
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,563
I'm begging you.

422
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,777
It seems like our time
has come to an end, Ms. Do.

423
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,072
I'll erase all the moments
we spent together,

424
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,200
and I'll never think about them again.

425
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,869
I will never

426
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,914
go back to a moment
I spent with Do Da-hae.

427
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,005
Ms. Da-hae.

428
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,209
Don't let me go.

429
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,424
Jeez.

430
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,473
Is this how you ask for a favor?

431
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,727
-What the hell?
-You can do the talking yourself.

432
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,811
Go ahead.

433
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,483
What are you doing? Out of the way!

434
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,778
Okay. Just a second.

435
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,365
What the heck?

436
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,707
At least tell me why I have to stop you.

437
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,167
I don't want to.

438
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,169
-Talk to me.
-I don't want to!

439
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,297
It looked like someone just yanked her.

440
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,256
Fine.

441
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,091
I'll talk to you.

442
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,760
-Really?
-Yes.

443
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,303
Okay.

444
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,275
Is it a ghost?

445
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,237
Stay still. I'm leaving.

446
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,532
Come on.

447
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,327
You're fast.

448
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,329
Do you have something to say?

449
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,667
No, I don't.

450
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,672
What was that?

451
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,466
Go on.

452
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,719
You can leave.

453
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,387
Just say it.

454
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,056
You don't have to yell.

455
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,311
Is it…

456
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,815
me?

457
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,196
No way.

458
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,281
Why would I come back?

459
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,539
You should go check on your sister.

460
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:26,916
And why is that?

461
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,714
Apparently, she's in danger.

462
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,383
Well done.

463
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,229
Hey.

464
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,648
I'm just working out.

465
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,442
Of course I'm okay.

466
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,405
What is this about? You never call me.

467
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,116
I was just worried about you.

468
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,994
You should worry about yourself.

469
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,081
Hello?

470
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,292
Hello?

471
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,547
Was he really worried about me?

472
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,179
He must be really out of it.

473
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,850
All right.

474
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,854
Keep going.

475
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,647
You've got this.

476
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,531
She's fine.

477
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,618
What kind of danger is she in, exactly?

478
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,119
You're gone.

479
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,954
You said you should go see her.

480
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,247
How convenient.

481
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,667
You can say I'm here whenever you want.

482
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,129
You don't have to believe me.

483
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,382
I don't care what's going to happen.

484
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,508
For what it's worth,

485
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,678
I told you exactly what you told me.

486
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:08,851
Wait!

487
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,562
Are you leaving just like that?

488
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,982
You can't just go!

489
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,193
Hey!

490
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,198
Wow.

491
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,533
You've lost so much weight.

492
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,160
Look at you.

493
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,245
Hey, you.

494
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,540
What's the point of running?

495
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,584
You can literally fly.

496
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,379
You're so fly, Bok Don't Eat.

497
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,005
You've got some nerve coming here.

498
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,383
I was just getting my stuff.

499
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,676
These are expensive.

500
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,596
How dare you come here
after ruining my relationship with Ji-han?

501
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,267
If I were half as good as you,

502
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,644
I'd never be hung up on a guy like him.

503
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,397
Why date such scum
when you can fly anywhere you want?

504
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,567
I used to dream of flying
when I was a little girl.

505
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,238
Can you take me up in the air
like Superman just once?

506
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,073
You're in spandex already.

507
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,412
Get lost.

508
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,914
Or I'm calling the cops.

514
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,282
Hi, Ji-han. It's me.

515
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,617
Hi, Dong-hee.

516
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,534
Can we meet?

517
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,453
We need to talk.

518
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,164
Well, what's this about?

519
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,375
You won't believe it.

520
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,959
You were a victim too.

521
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,378
You were set up.

522
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,588
Anyway,

523
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,424
-I'll tell you the details--
-Should we talk at my clinic?

524
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,343
-What?
-Can you come over?

525
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,302
Right now?

526
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,305
Sure.

527
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,015
I'll be right over.

528
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,522
I have to hurry.

529
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,529
Should I have waited
until I've lost more weight?

530
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,573
It's under maintenance.
Let's take the stairs.

I can't keep Ji-han waiting.

535
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,877
Should I just fly over?

536
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,216
Dong-hee.

537
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,345
Gwi-ju.

538
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,514
Are you okay?

539
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,501
-Dong-hee.
-Oh no.

540
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,086
Bok Dong-hee! Hey!

541
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,172
Did she hurt her head?

542
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,425
She needs to go to the hospital.

543
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,513
Are you hurt?

544
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,853
Stay with me, Dong-hee.

545
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,993
You're not driving.

546
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,328
I'm fine.

547
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,580
Get in.

548
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,249
Come on.

549
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,175
Mom.

550
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,470
Guess what Dodari is doing with whom.

551
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,513
I know.

552
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,418
It looks like malnutrition.

553
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,087
Sorry?

554
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,759
Jeez.

555
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,511
She should have taken it easy.

556
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,139
There doesn't seem to be
any visible trauma.

557
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,059
If she fell on you from a height,

558
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,269
the impact must have been significant.

559
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,313
Are you in pain?

560
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,106
Not really.

561
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,443
Let's have a look anyway.

562
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,861
This way, please.

563
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,083
How did you know
Aunt Dong-hee was in danger?

564
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,170
Something…

565
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:34,922
just felt wrong.

566
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,930
Hey, put them back on.

567
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,391
I'm sorry. Put them back on.

568
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,602
Did you do it?

569
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,905
No one can see your dad
in the past, right?

570
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,241
And no one can touch him?

571
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,910
But I can see him.

572
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,829
I can even touch him.

573
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,873
I'm not sure why.

574
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,753
Wow.

575
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,413
The number you are trying to reach…

576
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,249
They should be back by now.

577
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,293
Who should be back?

578
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,548
Did you get some sleep?

579
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,635
Did you see anything in your dream?

580
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,847
What's going on?

581
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,183
The thing is,

582
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,061
-I-na is with Do Da-hae right now.
-What?

583
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,522
Gwi-ju went to pick her up
when Da-hae called him,

584
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,899
but I can't reach him.

585
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,488
-Hey.
-Mom.

586
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,406
I'm at the hospital.

587
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,324
What happened?

588
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,951
I fell from a height.

589
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,787
How did that happen?

590
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,414
I tried to fly,

591
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,416
but I couldn't.

592
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,668
But Mom.

593
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,546
Do you know who I saw before passing out?

594
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,049
Do Da-hae.

595
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,176
Do Da-hae was there.

596
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,720
She kidnapped I-na,

597
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,430
and she tried to hurt you?

598
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,807
What are you talking about?

599
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,060
Did you call the police?

600
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,147
Do you still care so much
about our secret being exposed?

601
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,236
They're coming at us because they know
we can't go to the police.

602
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,154
Calm down. Which hospital are you at?

603
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,197
Let me see.

604
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,701
Where am I?

605
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,622
Is Dong-hee hurt?

606
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,581
Is it serious?

607
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,086
Give it back. I'm calling the cops.

608
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,797
Do you even know where I-na is?

609
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,881
She's with Do Da-hae.

610
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,132
Exactly, she's with…

611
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,764
And you're okay with that?

612
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,978
She's the one who hurt me.

613
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,730
I felt someone push me over the edge.

614
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,107
It's the opposite.

615
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,694
She's the one who saved you.

616
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,072
What are you talking about?

617
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,159
It's a long story.

618
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,395
I-na!

619
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,275
I-na.

620
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,735
Are you okay?

621
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,195
Stay away from my family.

622
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,325
How dare you try to
put your filthy hands on her?

623
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,576
She's just a child.

624
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,707
Maybe…

625
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,669
you should have kept a closer eye on her.

626
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,504
It was too easy.

627
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,174
All I did was look her in the eye.

628
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,053
The kid without powers
must have been your easiest target.

629
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,473
I guess superpowers aren't all that.

630
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,311
You can see everything
in the future or in the past,

631
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,480
but you can't see
what's right under your nose.

632
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,065
What?

633
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,359
What a shame.

634
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,447
If I'd known you'd be so easy,
I would've held out longer.

635
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,244
Be prepared.

636
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,829
Once my mom bites,

637
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,790
she never lets go.

638
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,801
What did she say to lure you?

639
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,262
I went to her.

640
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,058
How could you be so immature?

641
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,227
Did you get sick of being spoiled

642
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,437
and finally decide to break bad?

643
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,482
You sure picked up
some bad habits early on.

644
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,650
You little thief.

645
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,235
You're a thief too.

646
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,447
-What?
-The lottery numbers and stock prices.

647
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,242
You stole the future.

648
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,203
I just used my power--

649
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,746
Join hands with Ms. Da-hae.

650
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,624
Then you can steal the future again.

651
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,085
What are you talking about?

652
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,883
You knew, didn't you?

653
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,678
That Ms. Da-hae can see
Dad from the future.

654
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,389
What did you say?

655
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,486
The mothers are so in sync
with each other.

656
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,030
She slapped me in the exact same spot.

657
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,081
Hop on.

658
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,063
I've been meaning to tell you.

659
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,610
You should've told me from the beginning.

660
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,155
I was worried it'd keep you up at night.

661
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,741
Gwi-ju's power wasn't exactly stable.

662
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,035
I wanted to be sure before I told you.

663
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,746
Who are you to decide that?

664
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,956
What do you know?

665
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,667
Get out. I need to think.

666
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,378
I know.

667
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:34,549
You think I'm a good-for-nothing
who doesn't know anything.

668
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,302
I've always lived in your shadow,

669
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,639
pretending to be oblivious
to everything I see.

670
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,809
Maybe that's why I kept it from you.

671
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,187
That's how I've always protected you.

672
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,357
I don't have time
for your whining right now.

673
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,026
Where did it go?

674
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,210
Listen, honey.

675
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,547
You don't have to know everything.

676
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,799
And you can't know everything.

677
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,595
What do I not know?

678
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,431
Nothing gets past me.

679
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,602
The mutation of powers…

680
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,233
always comes at a price.

681
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,380
I stood Ji-han up.

682
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,591
He must be so worried.

683
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,594
Something came up. Sorry.

684
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,803
Let's take a rain check.

685
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,443
What?

686
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,945
Are you okay?

687
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,573
Are you here to gloat?

688
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,241
About you saving me?

689
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:25,994
You're fine.

690
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,371
I'm gonna lose weight.

691
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,835
I was too heavy to fly.

692
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,087
Take it easy, or it'll backfire.

693
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,839
And don't skip your meals.

694
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,551
I told you to worry about yourself.

695
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,223
Is your arm feeling any better?

696
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,227
Bok Gwi-ju.

697
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:57,943
I have a question.

698
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:03,365
How come that fraud is the only one
you can touch in your past?

699
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,660
Physical contact between a man and a woman

700
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,495
can be a dangerous thing.

701
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,042
Bok Gwi-ju!

702
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,128
Thanks.

703
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,465
When I inherit the building,

704
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,093
I'll give you a discount on rent.

705
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,390
Good night.

706
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,064
That little brat.

707
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,401
I guess he's changed a bit.

708
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,404
You did it.

709
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,366
You saved someone with your power

710
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,659
like a superhero.

711
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,417
Save Ms. Da-hae too.

712
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,877
She must be locked up again.

713
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,964
-Locked up?
-Or even worse.

714
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,633
First, she ruined the wedding,

715
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,468
and now, she let me go.

716
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,846
That's none of your business.

717
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,306
Don't go near those people again.

718
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,394
Do you still not get
why she ruined the wedding?

719
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,481
Even after reliving it so many times?

720
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,508
Why are you back?

721
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,260
It's all over now.

722
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,805
I ruined everything.

723
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,848
Exactly.

724
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,768
Kind of seemed like you overdid it.

725
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,021
You could've run away quietly,

726
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,941
but you decided to make a huge scene.

727
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,777
As if you wanted to sabotage your scheme.

728
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,321
Was I just…

729
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,657
saved by a con artist?

730
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,911
What did you get in return
for letting the kid go?

731
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,543
You've gotta have something.

732
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,795
I have very high expectations for you.

733
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,800
What is it?

734
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,428
Are you being shy or modest?

735
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,473
The Bok family's been hiding

736
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,516
a toad that lays golden eggs.

737
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,936
And you're the one
who ended its hibernation.

738
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,938
On top of that,

739
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,150
you're the only person
Bok Gwi-ju can reach in the past.

740
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,237
Why have you been keeping

741
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,323
such important information from me?

742
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,409
You shouldn't keep
secrets from your mother.

743
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,163
I'm hurt.

744
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,629
Someone's here.

745
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,552
The toad is here.

746
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,721
I think you mean the goose.

747
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,975
Let's cut a deal.

748
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:44,604
I never lose out on a deal.

749
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,608
Even at a glance, my family has suffered
more damage than you have.

750
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,569
Compensation for emotional distress aside,

751
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,990
the wedding actually cost a fortune.

752
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,867
But I'll call it even.

753
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,333
If you agree
to reestablish our relationship.

754
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,128
We clearly need each other.

755
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,339
So from now on,

756
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,841
let's be business partners.

757
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,143
Are you suggesting that we collaborate?

758
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,854
I can only return to the moments
I spent with Da-hae.

759
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,026
With a little cooperation from her,

760
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,239
my power can be quite useful.

761
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,110
-What are you getting at?
-It's simple.

762
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,614
You just need to spend some time with me.

763
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,533
As often and as much as possible.

764
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,538
I don't think so, Gwi-ju.

765
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,958
Is this how you reestablish relationships?

766
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:30,960
I'm fine with that.

767
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,670
-Da-hae.
-Bok Gwi-ju.

768
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,092
-It's all over now.
-I know.

769
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,219
Speaking of which,

770
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,181
I have to undo the past.

771
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,601
I'm going to

772
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,728
hold on to you.

773
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:56,027
-What?
-I'm going to undo the moment…

774
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,447
things ended for us.

775
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,839
It seems like our time
has come to an end, Ms. Do.

776
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,635
I'll erase all the moments
we spent together,

777
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,513
and I'll never think about them again.

778
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,182
I will never

779
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,227
go back to a moment
I spent with Do Da-hae.

780
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,814
What do you want?

781
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,569
You said…

782
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,823
you'd never come back.

783
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,244
But here I am.

784
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,587
Why me?

785
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,884
Why do you keep looking back
at times with me?

786
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,847
I need your help.

787
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,393
With what?

788
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,336
Don't let me go.

789
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,983
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

790
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,513
Let's go to dinner, Da-hae.

791
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:12,807
I don't want to.

792
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,852
I'll help you steal the future.

793
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,270
If you let me borrow Da-hae.

794
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,898
I chose them as my family.

795
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,150
I'll leave them when I want to.

796
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,152
Another mouth to feed.

797
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,573
Why would he reach out
to the scammer who lied to him?

798
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,242
I don't know if I can
keep it together around him.

799
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:32,743
I've been wasting my time

800
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,745
for the past few years.

801
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,330
It's a bit late,

802
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,957
but I want to put it to better use.

803
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,501
I think I found my way

804
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,086
back to happiness.

805
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:48,801
