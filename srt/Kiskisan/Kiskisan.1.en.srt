1
00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:00,059
You both seem too quiet.

2
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,609
Did an evil spirit pass by?

3
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,210
Rener, do you have
anything for milling later?

4
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,223
There’s a batch ready, Auntie.

5
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:09,804
My goodness!

6
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,739
Then set it on the machine already.
Are you waiting for Christmas?

7
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,669
It’s not yet 7AM.

8
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,490
How about you?

9
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:19,999
Do you wanna say something?

10
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:23,235
You’ve been looking at me.
What do you want? I’ll be leaving soon.

11
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:26,969
Uh, Auntie Luring...

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,801
We need to get married soon.

13
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:32,992
What?

14
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:37,372
You haven’t even told me you are together,

15
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,286
and now you tell me
you need to get married?

16
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,324
The two of you, listen up,

17
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:45,340
don’t think I've never noticed,
but I know you’re together.

18
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,567
I’m not stupid.

19
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,482
Any why get married?
You’re pregnant, aren’t you?

20
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,790
Yes, Auntie.

21
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,961
You promiscuous idiots!

22
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:00,541
Have you no restraint?

23
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:01,741
What? Was it good?

24
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,016
Because of this?

25
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,041
Huh?

26
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:06,883
Because of this? Did you have fun?

27
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:12,493
Geez...

28
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:14,519
I will never understand you kids.

29
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,149
[sighs]

30
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:20,953
Argh!

31
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,128
It’s as if I can do something about it.

32
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:32,495
Listen, the two of you...

33
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,664
You better not be
expecting a church wedding.

34
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,959
You’d be kidding yourselves if you do.

35
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,190
A civil union’s more than enough.

36
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,059
Breakfast was great.

37
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
Yeah.

38
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:59,814
Auntie Luring’s morning special, however...

39
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,901
But, oh well...

40
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,735
Ouch! That hurt.

41
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,336
- That was my foot.
- Oh, sorry, my Love.

42
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:09,425
Auntie Luring can really be too much.

43
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:11,534
She’s got daggers for words.

44
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,203
I honestly thought

45
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:15,407
she was gonna smack you... Kidding!

46
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:19,976
If her words could kill, I tell you.

47
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,211
- She’s like a...
- She’s like a rapper.

48
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:24,404
- Oh, she’s a rapper now?
- Right?

49
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,775
One can’t catch up

50
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,520
- with how fast she speaks.
- I know, right?

51
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:31,235
She even snuck in a fondle.

52
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,094
- Oh, she touched you?
- She did.

53
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:36,852
Come here.

54
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,666
It all started here...

55
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,291
here...

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,877
from grinding.

57
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,337
What?

58
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:06,422
And kissing.

59
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:10,549
What was that?

60
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:11,848
Grinding...

61
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:13,193
and...

62
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:14,847
kissing.

63
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,089
Hello, Bea?

64
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,814
Hey, sis.

65
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,028
How have you been?

66
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:19,059
I’m getting married.

67
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,149
What?

68
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:22,854
To whom?

69
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:23,996
To Rener?

70
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,911
Well...

71
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,593
Yes, of course.

72
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,018
Why?

73
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,621
But you know Auntie Luring thinks

74
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:34,903
we’re not being serious.

75
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:36,840
Is that so?

76
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,197
What’s your plan then?

77
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,551
I’ll keep you posted.

78
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:24,856
Hello?

79
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,095
Sis, we’re nearby.

80
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:30,769
Umm... “We”? Who’s “we”?

81
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:32,504
Well...

82
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,572
You’ll see later.

83
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:35,558
Fine.

84
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,003
You take care.

85
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,305
- Rener, where’s my sister?
- She’s inside.

86
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,457
Adelle!

87
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,261
That’s Rener?

88
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:16,718
Yup.

89
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,324
Oh, he looks so...

90
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,349
- What?
- Adelle!

91
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:20,568
Nothing.

92
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:28,998
Bea!

93
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:36,789
Adelle!

94
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,580
Sis, this is Cheska.

95
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:41,926
- Hi.
- Hi.

96
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,562
Oh, here’s Auntie.

97
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:44,629
You’re finally here.

98
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:46,582
Hi, Auntie.
How are you?

99
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:48,693
Auntie, this is my friend, Cheska.

100
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,223
Good morning, Auntie.

101
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:55,950
Shall we go in and eat?

102
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,598
I just finished cooking.

103
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:58,623
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

104
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,237
You can go ahead.

105
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,021
I’ll just finish this.

106
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:05,048
- You sure?
- Yeah, I’ll catch up.

107
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:06,657
- Go ahead, guys.
- Alright.

108
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:08,392
- Bye, Love.
- Bye.

109
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:10,448
- Oh!
- You good?

110
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:12,258
Do you need help? Okay.

111
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:14,449
- How have you been?
- I’ve been good.

112
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:17,137
The trip was quite long.

113
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,355
And this is quite heavy.

114
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,242
You know, Bea.

115
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,473
I still have some humility
left in me...

116
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,027
That’s why I won’t allow
your sister to bear a child

117
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,126
without a husband.

118
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:39,956
Back in the day,

119
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,957
I got myself pregnant
out of wedlock.

120
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:46,473
But my Inang had me get an abortion.

121
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:47,918
Yes, your grandmother.

122
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:52,449
I guess if she didn’t
make me get the abortion,

123
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:54,353
I’d have a bunch of grandkids by now.

124
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,519
Adelle here...

125
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:02,262
and Bea...

126
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,692
They’re like my own children.

127
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:09,105
If you must know, they were
orphaned pretty early in their lives.

128
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:11,205
My brother was their father.

129
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:15,152
This rice field
and the rice mill...

130
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:16,183
I tell you...

131
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,252
This was popular back in the day.

132
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:22,785
Our family was the first to own
a rice mill in the town.

133
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,894
I inherited this from my
grandfather, Grandpa Bien.

134
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,754
It’s been here since 1940’s
during the Japanese Occupation.

135
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,941
And it’s still here...

136
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:39,341
Grinding and plowing.

137
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:48,433
Later, I’ll give you a tour.

138
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:55,746
Hi, Love.

139
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Yes, Love?

140
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,699
Hey, who’s that girl

141
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:04,253
Bea brought along?

142
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:06,425
Ah...

143
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:10,426
You mean Cheska?

144
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,918
- She’s pretty, isn’t she?
- I see.

145
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:18,121
She’s actually the owner
of the condo Bea’s staying at.

146
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:24,887
They met at the travel
agency they’re working at.

147
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,152
- Really?
- Mhm!

148
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:28,446
- Ouch!
- Oh, sorry.

149
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:37,107
- Is it good?
- Do you want some?

150
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,495
Shot!

151
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,186
Bottom’s up!

152
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,755
- Cheers.
- You getting sleepy?

153
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,321
[sighs]

154
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:53,365
Wow.

155
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,998
It’s so nice here in the province.

156
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,375
It's peaceful.

157
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,725
And the fresh air?

158
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,970
I think my lungs got cleaner.

159
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:08,366
If you ask me,

160
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,404
I want to get out of here.

161
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,530
I had a boyfriend before.

162
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,982
He wanted to elope with me.

163
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,108
And he said that
we’d live in Manila.

164
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,261
Ah, Jimmy.

165
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,568
Yeah.

166
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:24,036
I got scared.

167
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:25,756
I was too afraid.

168
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,078
So, here I am,

169
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:29,355
still stuck in this farm.

170
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,600
And it feels like

171
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,466
I’ll be turning gray here.

172
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:36,153
Oh, come on.
You’re still young.

173
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:37,387
Who knows?

174
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:40,991
- Let me have some more.
- Here.

175
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,326
Go ahead. It’s your turn.

176
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,507
So, Rener,

177
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,795
have you always
been great at grinding?

178
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,754
That’s so funny!

179
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:55,992
Grinding, you say?

180
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,017
What, why?

181
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,901
That’s what he does, right?

182
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:00,052
He grinds for a living.

183
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,426
- Let me have some more.
- Here.

184
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:06,451
Come on.

185
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,560
I used to be a male stripper.

186
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,540
Really? A stripper?

187
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:12,762
Mm-hmm.

188
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,730
That was years ago.

189
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:15,946
Hold on.

190
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,041
I think you haven’t mentioned that before.

191
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:22,344
- It’s embarrassing, my Love.
- Aw, come on!

192
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,976
Show us some moves.

193
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:26,428
That’s what I’m talking about.
Come on, Rener.

194
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:28,746
- Show us!
- I don’t want to.

195
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,141
- Come on, Rener.
- Let’s go!

196
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,267
Show us how it’s done.

197
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,543
- Come on, Rener.
- There we go!

198
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:34,860
Play some music!

199
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:35,885
Oh, my...

200
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,048
Damn!

201
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:42,431
- Wow!
- [cheering]

202
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:44,510
Okay, okay.

203
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:46,736
- Wow!
- Whoa!

204
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,048
Hey!

205
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:53,174
Wow!

206
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:59,086
- Whoa!
- [cheering]

207
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,988
Damn, boy!

208
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,468
Okay, that’s enough.
It’s embarrassing.

209
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,995
Stop it!
You’re embarrassing yourself.

210
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,163
Love, stop it, please.

211
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:13,649
- Okay, okay. I believe you.
- That's enough.

212
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:16,283
The male stripper who grinds.

213
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,799
Oh, dear.

214
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,193
Pour me a drink.

215
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:23,760
- I want to get wasted.
- Fine.

216
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:26,221
- Hand it over.
- Let’s just drink some more.

217
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:27,650
Give it here.
Come on.

218
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:29,282
- More!
- Want some?

219
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,307
Go ahead.

220
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:31,705
Oh, no.

221
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:33,619
- We’re all out.
- Huh?

222
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,097
- Wait, really?
- I still have a bottle in my stash.

223
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:38,244
It’s over by the rice mill.

224
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:40,432
- Nice. There’s more.
- My love, I’ll be back.

225
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:43,547
Let me come with you!

226
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,470
- I wanna go with you! Let’s go.
- Are you sure, my love?

227
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,107
- Mm-hmm. Let’s go!
- Love, take it easy.

228
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:52,174
- It’s slippery.
- Let’s drink. Come on.

229
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:56,119
- Here. It’s yours. Drink up.
- Let’s go.

230
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:58,463
- You’re drunk already?
- No more drinking...

231
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:01,187
No more.

232
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,901
- Love, slow down.
- Come on.

233
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:33,809
Come on.

234
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,235
Where is that bottle?

235
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:49,848
Just a sec.

236
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:50,873
We're almost there.

237
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,719
Over there.

238
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:55,888
Where, love?

239
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,043
Right here.

240
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,884
- Let’s go back later.
- Huh?

241
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:06,362
- Let's go back later...
- Let’s go over there.

242
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:07,597
This is mine.

243
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,070
Hey.

244
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,302
Why aren’t you dressed?

245
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:28,249
We’re meeting the judge today, remember?

246
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,980
My head still hurts.

247
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,349
Geez. I drank too much last night.

248
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,244
Me too, actually.

249
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,887
But don’t you think something
strange happened last night?

250
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,257
You just fell asleep on me.

251
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:47,650
- I did?
- Come on, we’re running late!

252
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:48,737
What are you waiting for?

253
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,252
After this, teach me how to drive, please?

254
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:54,862
- Sure.
- You girls!

255
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:57,680
Before you teach each other to drive,
get me home first.

256
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:59,629
I don’t wanna die on the road.

257
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:01,610
Let’s go. It’s late!

258
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:02,997
Yes, Auntie.

259
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:30,421
Phew.

260
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:33,623
What a day.

261
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:00,956
Is that banana?

262
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,323
Sweetened.
This is yours.

263
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:06,138
- You wanna taste?
- Sure.

264
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:20,113
- Oh no!
- Ah!

265
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:21,895
Oh...

266
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:25,294
Sorry.

267
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,996
Sis! Stop here!

268
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:52,373
This is fine!

269
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:53,398
Okay!

270
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,375
See that?

271
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,555
- See?
- You two idiots!

272
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,228
I told you

273
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:10,796
to drive around later!

274
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:12,912
I’m gonna die because of you two!

275
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,246
Told you you can do it.

276
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:16,289
Just a little more practice.

277
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,876
Well, I got to park, at least?

278
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,278
You’ll get better soon.

279
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:23,851
- Anyways, I’ll go find Rener.
- Okay.

280
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,474
- Mwah! Bye!
- Bye! See you.

281
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,499
Thank you!

282
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:56,664
Love?

283
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,543
Rener?

284
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:07,949
Love?

285
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:36,605
Love?

286
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:42,733
Love?

287
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:56,629
Oh, Love.

288
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:58,849
What happened?

289
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:01,141
The faucet got busted.

290
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,005
And I got wet.

291
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,063
Me too, actually.

292
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:10,714
I’m dripping wet.

293
00:37:19,312 --> 00:37:20,312
Really now?

294
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:25,734
You...

295
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,444
- Yeah?
- There!

296
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:30,727
You want this?

297
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:32,664
Give me that!

298
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:34,468
Here!

299
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,558
What are you doing?

300
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,132
Getting more sleep.

301
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:52,053
I’m still sleepy.

302
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,390
So?

303
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:58,118
- How’s the meeting, by the way?
- It’s okay.

304
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,309
We got a wedding date now.

305
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:00,985
So, our two weeks here is enough.

306
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:02,682
Nice.

307
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:05,249
Actually...

308
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:08,153
I want to stay here longer.

309
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:14,416
If you want, I can resign from my job.

310
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:17,145
And we can live here.

311
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:19,377
You can provide for me, right?

312
00:38:21,021 --> 00:38:22,384
Sure, yes.

313
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,093
No, give me that!

314
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:33,427
You want this, huh?

315
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,071
Give me that dipper!

316
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,355
Go ahead then.

317
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,451
Give me...

318
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:56,355
In the name of the father, the son,
and the holy spirit. Amen.

319
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:57,494
Let’s eat.

320
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:00,148
Here.

321
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:06,567
Half of my heart is very happy because...

322
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,896
you’ll be having your children
and your own family soon.

323
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:15,524
But of course,

324
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:18,156
I can’t deny that

325
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:21,609
half of my heart’s upset with you.

326
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,713
You chose to keep this from me.

327
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,652
We’re together everyday
yet you never mentioned a word.

328
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:38,424
I’m sorry, Auntie.

329
00:42:41,845 --> 00:42:43,472
Go on, eat.

330
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,653
As for you, Beatricia.

331
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,881
Are you hiding something from me?

332
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,110
Um...

333
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:09,344
No, Auntie.

334
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:13,203
[scoffs]

335
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,532
Shhh!

336
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,309
Keep still.
And be quiet.

337
00:44:56,423 --> 00:44:57,797
Don't move.

338
00:44:57,822 --> 00:45:00,042
- Wait, I need to pee.
- Stay there.

339
00:45:04,157 --> 00:45:06,365
Wait. I really need to pee.

340
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
Wait.

341
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:12,137
Stay here, come on!

342
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:13,220
No, no. Stay here.

343
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,028
Ah!

344
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:02,234
Rener!

345
00:47:02,259 --> 00:47:03,392
It’s Adelle!

346
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:05,761
- Rener?
- Where should I hide?

347
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:07,747
- Rener?
- Over there!

348
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,692
Rener?

349
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:14,418
Love?

350
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:18,340
Rener?

351
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,024
Love?

352
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:27,031
Love?

353
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:01,434
Love?

354
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:09,502
Cheska!

355
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,224
Please don’t leave.

356
00:54:14,403 --> 00:54:15,403
Bea...

357
00:54:15,988 --> 00:54:17,823
I can’t show my face anymore.

358
00:54:19,614 --> 00:54:21,699
I need to distance myself.

359
00:54:23,237 --> 00:54:24,732
I’ll call you, okay?

360
00:54:25,877 --> 00:54:26,877
Okay.

361
00:54:27,671 --> 00:54:28,671
Okay.

362
00:54:28,696 --> 00:54:29,781
I’ll go ahead.

363
00:55:20,843 --> 00:55:21,927
Hey, Sis.

364
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,381
I’m sorry.

365
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,491
I think I went insane again.

366
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:27,612
It’s okay.

367
00:55:27,768 --> 00:55:30,479
I’m used to your insane ways already.

368
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:36,424
Adelle.

369
00:55:36,987 --> 00:55:38,052
Yes, Auntie?

370
00:55:38,424 --> 00:55:42,095
This is what your mother wore
when she got married to your father.

371
00:55:44,163 --> 00:55:45,163
Try it on.

372
00:55:50,032 --> 00:55:51,580
