1
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:02,579
[Previously on Guardians of the Dafeng]

2
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,719
Since ancient times,

3
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,400
if we have to choose someone
to represent the Dafeng,

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
it would definitely be him.

5
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
The Guardian, Mr. Xu,

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
Xu Ning Yan, Xu Qi An.

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,380
He popped up someday from somewhere.

8
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,419
He became a Guardian, and upheld injustice,
even to punish the Silver Gong.

9
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:23,359
And he solved strange cases,
clearing names of the wronged souls.

10
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,560
In times of crisis,

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,260
he alone fought against
formidable enemies of the Heaven Domain

12
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,349
and won a great victory.

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,205
Choosing him as the Star of Dafeng
is in favor with the public.

14
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:34,700
But there is someone who doesn't think so.

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,400
It's so unfair.

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,959
He is the one and only Formation Master
of the Bureau of Astronomy in Dafeng.

17
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,139
Off you go.

18
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,400
Again.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,605
All of you.

20
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:47,625
I am the most outstanding warlock
who can represent the Dafeng.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
Listen well, all of you.

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,940
In today's battle, I shall take the lead merit.

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,540
To Xu Qi An, he has never submitted.

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,339
Today, I must soar high into the sky
and make a name for myself.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
As for the imperial astronomer
in the Bureau of Astronomy,

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,724
he also doesn't take him seriously.

27
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:09,694
The Capital City hides talents.
There's always someone better than you.

28
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:11,680
You must know how to hide your flaws.

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,060
The imperial astronomer holds me down.

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,960
Don't you use magic?

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,300
Since from someday,
he insisted on showing his back to others.

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,080
I can hardly remember what he looks like.

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,619
Showing my back to others
demonstrates my demeanor of a master.

34
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:32,020
Yang Qian Huan, are your eyes on your back?

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,944
I act as I please.
I don't care about anyone's opinion.

36
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,980
You weren't like this before.

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,860
No one knows what happened in the past
that made him become like this.

38
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,300
After being away from the capital
for several months,

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,779
and his illness is getting worse.

40
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,379
[Guardian, Yang Yan]
How about getting him a physician?

41
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,140
[Guardian, Jiang Lv Zhong]
Don't bother with him.

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,680
[Guardian, Nangong Qian Rou]
Let him die of illness.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,885
Perhaps, he has never changed.

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,479
This is my senior brother,

45
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,280
who claims to be the top Formation Master
of Dafeng, Yang Qian Huan.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,833
I can hold the sun and moon
and reach for the stars.

47
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,853
There is no one like me in the world.

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,987
[Back to others, face myself]
[This is a story of Yang Qian Huan]

49
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,459
Yang Qian Huan.

50
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,067

[Warlock of Bureau of Astronomy, Yang Qian Huan]

52
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:32,744
Yang Qian Huan!

53
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:34,721
Yes, Senior Sister.

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
We are out of salt.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,360
I'll go get it right away.

56
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:43,106
Wait.

57
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,600
By the way,

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,040
buy a yellow croaker.

responsible for the maintenance of magic tools
after reaching the battlefield.

Please come in if you want to enjoy the music.

67
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,424
Twenty taels. Seat at first floor.

68
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:36,320
Thirty taels. Private room at second floor.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,684
One, two.
[Guardian Yamen]

70
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:41,284
Wait for me.

71
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
They start fighting over Xu Qi An's poetry again.
[Yunlu Academy]

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,060
- Go check it out.
- Go and take a look.

73

[One Year Ago]

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,419
Here's the edict of the Bureau of Astronomy.

75
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,959
The Wizard Cult is harassing Dafeng's borders.

76
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,199
They come and go unpredictably.

77
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,260
They burn, kill, rob, and loot,
harming the citizens of Dafeng.

78
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,099
They are indeed a grave threat to us.

79
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,299
The Emperor is wise.

80
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,764
And the imperial astronomer is great at assigning.

81
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:38,004
He appointed Xu Qi An as the Chief Commander.
[Imperial Astronomer]

82
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,199
[Guardian Yamen]
Thus,

83
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,120
all warlocks of the Bureau of Astronomy
should assist the Guardians

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,784
to eliminate the Wizard Cult
and ensure the peace of Dafeng.

85
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:47,925
Good!

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,806
Xu Qi An. Why him again?

87
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,066
Old man must have made a mistake. Why not me?

88
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:12,344
Senior Brother, the imperial astronomer
is receiving guests and can't see you.

89
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:15,680
Senior Brother, you can't change
what he has decided.

90
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
Senior Brother.

91
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,817
Senior Brother, don't do anything stupid.

92
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:20,840
- Step aside.
- I can't.

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,980
If you break in, he will punish me too.

94
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,060
Let's leave.

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,280
Leave?

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,605
Sure. You leave first.

97
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,480
Old man, give me an explanation.

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,920
Yang Qian Huan, what's wrong with you?

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,821
Get out.

100
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,920
I am the only Formation Master
of the Bureau of Astronomy.

101
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,680
Why did you appoint Xu Qi An
as the Chief Commander against the Wizard Cult?

102
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,105
- Why not me?
- Ridiculous!

103
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,600
- Do you realize your mistake?
- I did nothing wrong.

104
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,580
I am the only Formation Master.
Is he stronger than me?

105
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,639
Stubborn and foolish.

106
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,160
Fine then. Old man, you want to suppress me.

107
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,300
Vastness and Depth. All things transform in shape.

108
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,179
Break through great forces.

109
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,719
Get out!

Senior Brother.

113
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,639
Xu Qi An concerns the fate of Dafeng.

114
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,500
It is caused by the world's fortune.

115
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,620
As a warlock of the Bureau of Astronomy,

116
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,759
you should stick to your Tao mind.

117
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,580
Remember, I have long divined
the fortune of everything known.

118
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,820
Yang Qian Huan, if you continue to be obstinate,

119
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,961
I will not spare you.

120
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,800
Caused by the world's fortune?

121
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,117
Long divined the fortune of everything?

122
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,720
Sir, why can't I be that person?

123
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,139
Maybe you have made a mistake.

124
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,960
Senior Brother.

125
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:17,828
You got them all?

126
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,440
I gave you all the materials
for the last experiment.

127
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,524
What are you going to do
with such a large amount of it?

128
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,860
You don't understand.

129
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,680
Senior Brother.

130
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,564
You know that I only passed the exam
last quarter to be promoted to the sixth rank.

131
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:37,699
It's tough for me.

132
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,569
Recently, your relationship with Master...

133
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:44,465
Senior Brother, please don't tell others
that I gave you these.

134

135
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,939
This is really the last time.

136
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:52,399
Don't worry.

137
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,540
This has nothing to do with you.

138
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,304
If there is anything wrong, I will bear it.

139
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,480
Rise.

140
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,478
Off you go. Come over.

141
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,539
Impossible.

[Yang Qian Huan]

143
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,639
Chun, I finally got in touch with you.

144
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,960
What's wrong?

145
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,961
I heard that the Guardians

146
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:40,340
recently in order to strictly prevent
the invasion of the Wizard Cult,

147
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,179
take shifts day and night,
being extremely exhausted.

148
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,280
I'll get busy then.

149
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,759
Wait, Chun.

150
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,380
Listen. I have an immature idea.

151
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,020
Just suppose...

152
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,540
Suppose there is a magic tool
combining with a formation,

153
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,980
can automatically detect the movements
of the Wizard Cult.

154
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:07,299
Luckily, I can provide this formation
and magic tool.

155
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:11,740
I think I should go to the front line
and demonstrate it to the Guardians.

156
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,340
I decided to set off tomorrow.

157
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,340
No. I'll set off right now.

158
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,120
About the Wizard Cult,

159
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,280
it's not something that one formation
and one magic tool can solve.

160
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,519
I can't explain it to you now.

161
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,799
Anyway, the imperial astronomer said

162
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,639
the Guardians are fully responsible for this,
and you don't need to worry.

163
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,665
Bye then.

164
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,485

The Guardians are fully responsible for this?

166
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,600
Yet I haven't seen you
catch any from the Wizard Cult.

168

Tell me your location.

He's right beside you?

171
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,320
Don't tell him that I contacted you.

172
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,484
Jiang, it's Qian Huan.

173
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:53,340
Yang Yan is not beside you, right? Alright then.

174
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,366
Li Yu Chun is right beside you? Then go get busy.

175
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,840
You don't let me go, then I'll go myself.

Fine. I will explain it one last time.

Each red dot is a magic tool

Once there is a presence of the Wizard Cult,

215

the magic tools will alert,
and the red dots will flicker.

In this way, we can always
track the movements of the Wizard Cult.

Right.

537
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,164
The Wizard Cult
has been troubling Dafeng for years,

538
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:03,084
yet the Guardians have not defeated them
for three years.

539
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,742
The priority is to find the headquarters of the Wizard Cult

540
01:00:09,742 --> 01:00:14,864
and launch a decisive attack, so Dafeng can secure victory once and for all.

541
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:18,239
But where is the Wizard Cult?

542
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,264
Exactly.

543

Sir, could you tell us more about the Wizard Cult?

546
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,780
- Tell us more.
- Talk us more about the Wizard Cult.

547
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,300
Sir, you taught well today.

548
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,060
One day, I will definitely be with you
to compete with the Wizard Cult.

549
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,297
Everyone, go back. Stay safe.

550
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:40,103
Sir, I've noticed you always wear this bracelet.

551
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,860
Is it some powerful magic tool?

552
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,544
Yes, sir. Why don't you show it to us?

553
01:00:44,544 --> 01:00:46,283
Yes.

554
01:00:46,283 --> 01:00:50,223
This is just a memento left to me by Dafeng.

555

Hey, where are my dried bamboo shoots?

556
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,140
What dried bamboo shoots?

557
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,619
I dried them here yesterday. Why are they gone?

558
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:11,619
Don't worry, think carefully and search well.

559

Open your eyes and see.

560
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:15,700
I dried them here yesterday.

561
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:19,099
Did some brat steal them from me?

562
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:21,939
Just some dried bamboo shoots,
who wants to steal them?

563
01:01:21,939 --> 01:01:27,439
I wanted to make a dried bamboo shoot soup
for Qian Huan.

564
01:01:27,439 --> 01:01:28,805
Well...

565
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:30,892
For making soup for our son?

566
01:01:30,892 --> 01:01:32,780
Who stole them?

567
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,939
I'm asking you.

568
01:01:33,939 --> 01:01:37,044
As soon as it's for your son,
look how anxious you get.

569
01:01:37,044 --> 01:01:38,813
Don't be anxious.

570
01:01:38,813 --> 01:01:45,059
This morning, Ning came here
to help with the cleaning.

574

I thought it would rain, so I brought them in.

575
01:01:54,012 --> 01:01:55,973
I place them here.

577
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:15,285
Mother, we can't just have soup.

578
01:02:17,374 --> 01:02:20,139
I'll stew the ribs for you.

579
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:22,914
Don't stew the ribs, I'm tired of eating them.

580
