1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,040
(Previously)
There's one rule of mine you should know.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,560
I don't…

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,119
do “seconds.”

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,200
but I think it was too fast.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,360
Who told you… that I like him?

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Jimmy did.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Did you tell P'Toh that I like Fah?

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,400
Something felt off back at the resort.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,160
You started this game, Teh.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,840
Can you drop the…

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,520
“no seconds” rule?

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,560
But I'm a man of my word.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
But every rule…

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,280
has an exception.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,520
I want them to have a partner.

16
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
May I?

17
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,480
Please don't hurt me.

18
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,400
I would never.

19
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,680
You're too precious...

20
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
And yet...

21
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
so tempting to break.

22
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Then… break me. I'm yours.

23
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,560
I'll be gentle with you.

24
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
"Love Alert"
(Episode 4)

25
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,400
You're cute.

26
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,920
What's that sound?

27
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,480
Just a message.

28
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,920
Who's texting you this early?

29
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
It's Jimmy.

30
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,640
Can't we cuddle a bit longer?

31
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,080
I need to step out for a bit.

32
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,800
And I'll give you more than just a hug.

33
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,840
Bastard!

34
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,920
What the hell did you do to my brother?!

35
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,560
Are the photos not clear enough?
Or do you want the full video?

36
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,400
God damn you!

37
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
It's good that you're mad, Teh.

38
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,880
Now you know how I felt

39
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,560
when you were screwing Fah next to me.

40
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,240
You stabbed me in the back.

41
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,520
You knew I like Fah, but you still did it.

42
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,120
But this has nothing to do with P'Toh.

43
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,120
I've made it his business now.

44
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,560
Stay away from Fah,

45
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
and I'll leave your brother alone.

46
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,040
Even if I leave him,
You'll never have a chance with him anyway.

47
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,000
End it or not?

48
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,080
I won't let you hurt my brother!

49
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
I'll stay away from Fah.

50
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,320
You'd better keep your word.

51
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
Otherwise, I'll keep using your brother…

52
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
until I'm bored.

53
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,720
Then I'll throw him back to you.

54
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,080
My brother is a human being!

55
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,560
How can you be such a cold-blooded...

56
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Son of a bitch!

57
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
Stay away from Fah,

58
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,280
and I'll leave your brother alone.

59
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,360
You'd better keep your word.

60
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,600
Otherwise, I'll keep using your brother…

61
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
until I'm bored.
Then I'll throw him back to you.

62
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,400
P'Toh, what's that burning smell?

63
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,880
Well, I…

64
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,520
wanted the egg to be crispy.

65
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
Can I have mine like that too?

66
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Please?

67
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
P'Toh,

68
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,200
what's your secret?

69
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,640
I've never had a fried egg this good.

70
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
There's no secret.

71
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,640
I just… want the person
eating it to be happy.

72
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,440
That's why it turned out well.

73
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
I see.

74
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
You see what?

75
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,640
You wanted me to be happy.
That's why it's so good.

76
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,760
Now that you know.

77
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,960
I hope you'll do the same for me.

78
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,160
Or at least…

79
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
please don't hurt me.

80
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,480
Why say that?

81
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,320
Was I too rough on you last night?

82
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,720
You were my first.

83
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
P'Toh,

84
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,840
do you know how important a “first” is?

85
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
How?

86
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,920
You can have as many people as you want,

87
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,080
But you only ever… have one “first.”

88
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
And I'm so glad …

89
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,640
that it was me.

90
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,800
I guess I'm not your first, right?

91
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't really care about that.

92
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,640
Because I'd…

93
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,080
rather be your “only one.”

94
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
P'Toh,

95
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,440
thanks for everything. For the fried egg…

96
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,720
and for youself.

97
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Anyway, I have to head to class.

98
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,760
Get it over with. I'm gonna be late.

99
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,599
Punch me! Do it if you have the balls!

100
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,640
You bastard!

101
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,440
You're even worse.

102
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,800
I hope this is the last time
I see you near my brother.

103
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,000
I expect the same from you…

104
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,400
Stay away from Fah.

105
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Fine,

106
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,520
I can do it.

107
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,640
Keep your end of the deal too,

108
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,400
or I'll beat you up.

109
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Oh.

110
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,760
If you don't want your brother
suicidal from a broken heart,

111
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,680
you'd better not be all talk.

112
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,920
See you later, “bestie.”

113
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,760
How long have you been standing there?

114
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,320
Oh, Teh. You're home.

115
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

116
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,320
P'Toh…

117
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm telling you again.

118
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
Jimmy's a player who's
incapable of loving anyone.

119
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,320
Why do you keep bringing it up?

120
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,040
I wanna keep reminding you,

121
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,120
so you don't fall for him.

122
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
I'm just worried about you.

123
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,600
You've got this, Toh.

124
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,720
Stay strong.

125
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,720
You can make him love you for real.

126
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,440
Then break me. I'm yours.

127
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Fah!

128
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Teh.

129
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,560
It's about our date tonight.

130
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,600
I already booked movie tickets,
but drinks are on you. Deal?

131
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,400
I can't… I have to study.

132
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,200
Oh. What about another day?

133
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,720
But you're paying for tickets and drinks.

134
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Name a day.

135
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,800
I don't know… Maybe after exams.

136
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
And when is that?

137
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,000
The professor hasn't announced the dates.

138
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,440
You should invite someone else.

139
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,680
You really want to watch this movie, right?
Do it before it out of theathers.

140
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,080
- But...
- I need to go to class.

141
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Let's talk later.

142
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,840
Fah.

143
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,080
Oh, Jimmy. What's up?

144
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,160
I… accidentally bought
an extra movie ticket.

145
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,840
Everyone's talking about it.
Want to go with me?

146
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,200
I want to see that one.

147
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,440
But… you should find someone else.

148
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Thanks anyway.

149
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,680
Why? You don't want to go with me?

150
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Nope.

151
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,800
I already have someone specific in mind.

152
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,080
Besides, you're a hot shot.
You'll find a date in no time.

153
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,880
You only want Teh, don't you?

154
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,280
Hello?

155
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,400
Mr. Jimmy! Saensee's been hit by a car!

156
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
What?!

157
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,560
Jimmy, what happened? Tell me.

158
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,320
Saensee, my cat, he's been hit.

159
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,720
How… is he now?

160
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,480
I don't know. A vet is examining him.

161
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,040
P'Toh, what am I going
to do if he doesn't make it?

162
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
P'Toh,

163
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm so sorry…

164
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,800
I didn't know who else
to call, so I called you.

165
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
It's okay.

166
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Take a deep breath.

167
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Sit down.

168
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,600
Will Saensee be okay?

169
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Take it easy.

170
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,240
Don't worry so much, Jimmy.
The vet said Saensee's going to be fine.

171
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,880
He wasn't hit by the car.

172
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,760
He was just in shock.

173
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,320
He's in good hands tonight. Don't worry.

174
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
I know.

175
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,840
I can't help being worried.

176
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,400
We normally cuddle on the bed.
It's just me and him.

177
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,440
Let Saensee cuddle
with the vet for tonight.

178
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,760
If anything happens, the vet's right there.

179
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,160
If Saensee is ready to come home,
I'll go with you and pick him up. Deal?

180
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,760
Thank you so much, P'Toh.

181
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't know how to thank you.

182
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,040
I would've been a mess if you weren't…

183
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
here by my side.

184
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,880
Don't mention it.

185
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,360
Just let me know if you need anything.

186
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,720
We're not exactly strangers.

187
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,520
Thank you so much.

188
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
Mmm, smells so good.

189
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,720
Which one? The cabonara or me?

190
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,440
Both the chef and the meal.

191
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm all sweaty. Stop sniffing me.

192
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,240
I don't smell any sweat. You smell nice.

193
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,440
You're teasing me again.

194
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,440
You're just so fun to tease.

195
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
I thank you for…

196
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
being here with me.

197
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,400
I'll plate this.

198
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,000
Put it on the plates for me.
I need to take this call.

199
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Yes, Teh?

200
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,120
Where are you?

201
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,400
Why aren't you home yet?

202
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,280
Oh, I'm… out with my friend…
Someone who just got back from the US.

203
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,640
What's up?

204
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,440
I'm just worried.

205
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,960
It's already late. When
are you coming back?

206
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,800
Come on, I'm a grown-up.
Let me have some space.

207
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,520
How can I? You'll run into bad people.

208
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,560
By the way…

209
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,320
has Jimmy contacted you?

210
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,800
Ah…

211
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
No.

212
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Why?

213
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Nothing.

214
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,800
That's it.

215
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
Just get home soon.

216
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,520
Got it, young master.

217
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,160
(Get well soon, Saensee.)

218
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,240
I didn't know I was living in the US.

219
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,880
You heard that?

220
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,120
I thought I was being quiet.

221
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Well…

222
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,960
I lied because I didn't want Teh to worry.

223
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,240
You said you were out with your “friend”…

224
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,120
Stay the night.

225
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,520
So I can hug you in Saensee's stead.

226
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
But I...

227
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,000
Please.

228
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,280
- But I...
- Please.

229
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,000
Just one night.

230
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,559
Jim, I must...

231
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
P'Toh,

232
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,560
Stay with me.

233
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Jimmy?

234
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,840
When did you get in here?

235
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,920
Just now.

236
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Let me help you wash up.

237
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,480
(Plaifah: You up?)

238
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,480
(Plaifah: I thought you said
you wanted to pursue me?)

239
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,560
(If you've changed your
mind, just be direct about it.)

240
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,560
It's not like I want to quit.

241
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,480
(Read)

242
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,280
What's with him?

243
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
He didn't reply.

244
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Did he…

245
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,800
have a fight with P'Toh?

246
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Who's calling?

247
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Oh,

248
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
it's Fah.

249
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,840
You're not going to answer him?

250
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,960
He probably called me to ask where I am.

251
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm afraid if I keep
lying, Teh will catch on.

252
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,160
He didn't pick up.

253
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
You're cute.

254
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,720
You're that scared of your brother.

255
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
It's your fault.

256
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,640
You're making me a liar.

257
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,800
Is a lie for your peace of mind…

258
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
wrong?

259
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
And…

260
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,840
have you ever lied to me?

261
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,600
What would I even have to lie about?

262
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
I don't know.

263
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,720
I was… just wondering.

264
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I hope…

265
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,440
you won't hurt me.

266
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,400
Don't be cruel to me.

267
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,880
Hello there! I'm all better now!

268
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,480
Strong and healthy as ever!

269
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,480
Glad to see you're okay, Saensee.

270
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,680
Feeling great and ready to go!

271
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,240
Stay healthy, okay?

272
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,120
There you go, into the bag you go.

273
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Hello?

274
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,400
Got it. I'll be there.

275
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
P'Toh,

276
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,120
I have to rush to uni.
Can you take Saensee back to the condo?

277
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Of course.

278
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,680
Stay with mama for now.
Daddy will be home soon.

279
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
See you later.

280
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,480
P'Toh didn't come home last night.
Where did you take him?

281
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,360
Saensee got hit by a car and
was admitted. How should I know?

282
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Bull.

283
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,720
Believe what you want.
I need to go check on Saensee now.

284
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,720
Are you sure you're
staying away from P'Toh?

285
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
Yeah.

286
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,720
What about you?

287
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,560
Stay away from Fah?

288
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,880
I've stayed away from him.

289
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,200
How's… Saensee?

290
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,920
A vet said it was just shock

291
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,080
and had to stay overnight for observation.

292
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Good.

293
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,880
I'm glad it's nothing serious.

294
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,520
There you are. I've been looking for you.

295
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,120
Are you free, Jimmy?

296
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,480
Come with me for a bit?

297
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,800
Sure thing.

298
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,280
P'Toh…

299
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,920
Has Jimmy contacted you?

300
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,360
Ah…

301
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
No.

302
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,640
Why?

303
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,160
(Get well soon, Saensee.)

304
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,840
(Get well soon, Saensee.)

305
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,840
You're not on my level, Teh.

306
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,416
(Next Episode)
Are you here to spy on me now?

307
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,320
I couldn't get a hold of you.

308
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,360
Don't call me. And don't come
here again for a while.

309
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,319
Are you spacing out?
Don't tell me you miss Jimmy.

310
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,760
Are you in love with Jimmy?

311
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,000
There's really nothing between us, I swear.

312
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
It's fine if you don't
want to tell me the truth.
