1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,760
(Previously)
I've got a new target.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,560
P'Fah?!

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,880
Teh.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,480
Jimmy, my brother, Toh.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,960
Don't fall for Jimmy.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,360
Jimmy is a certified player.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,480
I don't want you getting hurt.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
Come on!

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,040
I wasn't thinking of anything.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,280
I don't want my brother to fall for you.

11
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:29,193
I haven't thought of him that way at all.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,000
You bastard, Jimmy!

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,920
What's your problem, Teh?

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,000
Look at this.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,120
What the hell is this?!

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,840
It's obviously your house's camera.

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,440
Don't forget that I'm your
friend who knows you really are.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,200
So what?

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,000
I just bought desserts to
thank your brother for dinner.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,480
Didn't I tell you to stay away from my brother?!

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
- I don't trust you!
- So what?!

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,200
- Didn't I tell you?!
- What the hell?!

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
What's your game?!

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,880
I don't have a plan!

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,600
- Calm down, man!
- Spit it out!

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,840
- Just tell me, damn it!
- Take it easy!

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Calm down!

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,080
Calm down!

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,440
What's wrong with you?

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,240
Both of you are too worked up. Let's talk later.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,160
Move it.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
- Come at me!
- Stop!

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,800
Come at me!

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,720
- Enough.
- Let me go!

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
Run, let go.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,600
If you don't even like Teh's brother,
then why do all this?

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,840
What?

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,160
You jealous?

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,640
Please.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,240
I've already moved on.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,440
It's Book, a model.

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
That was fast.

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,160
Look who you're talking to.

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,960
I dragged you here to
talk some sense into you.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,320
Teh's your best friend. Think about
things before you do something stupid.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,880
I understand that you'd…

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,160
screw anything that moves.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,040
But he's your friend's brother.

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,320
Leave him out of this.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,240
Oh,

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
I heard that you're…

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,400
hitting on P'Fah?

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,880
How'd you know?

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,040
Ah…

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,520
Good luck with that.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
He's way out of your league.

57
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah! Just watch me!

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,040
I'll make him mine.

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
Or didn't Jimmy think of P'Toh that way?

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,560
Forget it.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
It already happened.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
"Love Alert"
(Episode 2)

63
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Teh is being such a pain about his brother.

64
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,360
How can I get close to Plaifah?

65
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,640
Maybe I can use P'Toh to get to him.

66
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah, P'Toh.

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,600
He's my best bet.

68
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,320
But how do I handle him?

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,440
This looks amazing, Jimmy.

70
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,760
It sure does.

71
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,720
You say it looks good,
but you're not looking at the food.

72
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,600
Did I ever say I was talking about the food?

73
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,960
P' Toh,

74
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,200
could you spill some
of the drink on your lips?

75
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,040
So I can wipe it off for you.

76
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,160
Just like this.

77
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,160
P' Toh,

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,480
there's something I must tell you.

79
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
It's important.

80
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,040
What… is it?

81
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,640
Teh's in love with P'Fah.

82
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,400
I don't know what to do about it.

83
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,720
R-really?

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,920
Yes.

85
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
Can you do me a favor?

86
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,280
Yes. What do you need me to do?

87
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,760
What's with the sudden party?
Aren't you supposed to be an “inverter”?

88
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,600
It's “introvert”.

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,720
An “inverter” is a part of an AC.

90
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Fine, my bad. Excuse me.

91
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,920
What's the reason?

92
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,160
Nothing much.

93
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,120
I just want to cook for some
friends before the cafe opens.

94
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,840
Sure?

95
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,680
Are you a detective or something?

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,520
And who exactly are these “friends”?

97
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,640
Well, there's… Fah.

98
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,240
And that's it.

99
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,240
You have the nerve to call
that a party? That's a date.

100
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,160
You're coming too, so it's not a date anymore.

101
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,400
Unless... you're not joining?

102
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,720
No way! Half of the money
is mine. I need to eat my money's worth.

103
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,560
I'm heading out.

104
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,280
See ya.

105
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
Okay.

106
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,640
Study hard.

107
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,640
Hey,

108
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,320
What's with the long faces?
What are you guys doing?

109
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,913
How can I not be stressed?

110
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,033
I've been working on the group report
all night and it's still not finished.

111
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,840
Which report?

112
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,840
This one. For Professor Boss.

113
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,200
- Crap…
- I knew it.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
- We're toast.
- We're screwed.

115
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,320
What am I going to tell him?

116
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
Will he let me turn it in late?

117
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,360
What do I do?!

118
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,640
Mr. Teh?

119
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Yes, professor?

120
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,440
Do you want to revise your report? I can't let
you make changes after it's been submitted.

121
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,480
S… Submitted?

122
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
Yes, Mr. Jimmy dropped it off this morning.

123
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,600
I've had a quick look at it.
You guys did a solid job.

124
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,600
Yes.

125
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,800
Why did you put my name on the report?

126
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,920
Weren't you still pissed at me?

127
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,960
I don't take our problem personally.

128
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,920
Stop overthinking it, dumbass.

129
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,600
If I'm a dumbass, then you're a total moron.

130
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,000
I totally get you…

131
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,640
for being protective of your brother.

132
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,840
I can't help it. He's so cute.

133
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,640
Hey, watch it…

134
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,520
Chill out.

135
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm just telling the truth.

136
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,640
You should know that
I'm worried about him.

137
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,200
I don't want him to get hurt.

138
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,640
As long as you don't mess with him,

139
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,160
we're good.

140
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,760
Need anything else? I'm running late.

141
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,960
Nothing.

142
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,240
I'm off then.

143
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,480
Wait!

144
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,160
We're having a party at
my house. You should come.

145
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,680
But no flirting with my brother.

146
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,840
I got it. See ya there.

147
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,160
Whatever.

148
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
Whoa!

149
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Hi there, P'Toh!

150
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,840
I can smell it from the street!

151
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,760
Go wash your hands first.

152
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,200
Feed me then?

153
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,200
My hands are messy too.
Go wash yours and help yourself.

154
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,320
Meanie.

155
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
I won't eat then.

156
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,880
Gonna take a shower first.

157
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,800
Everything looks amazing.

158
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm so jealous of Teh.

159
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,880
Oh, P'Toh,

160
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,840
I bought some drinks.

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,560
Thanks.

162
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,440
You said the food looks good,
make sure you eat a lot.

163
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,800
Of course.

164
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,080
I'll check it for you.

165
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,920
You're here for P'Toh?
You've got the right house.

166
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,160
I thought so.
I was sure I remembered the way.

167
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,760
So… is P'Toh inside?

168
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,840
Yep.

169
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,320
P'Toh.

170
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,760
Fah.

171
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,840
I told you not to bring anything.

172
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,392
I heard we're having roasted beef.

173
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:08,432
It goes well with
this wine. I even “borrowed” it from my parents.

174
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,120
That sounds like a killer combo.

175
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,000
Do you need any help?

176
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
Not at all. Wait for Teh to finish
his shower, then we can dig in.

177
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,280
Are you hungry?
I can go and hurry him up.

178
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,680
No need to rush him.

179
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,280
P'Toh, where's the toilet?
I want to use it.

180
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,560
It's near the kitchen.

181
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,200
Need my help?

182
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Don't worry. Have a seat.
I'll take care of the rest.

183
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,520
P'Fah?

184
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
Hello.

185
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
Let's eat! I'm starving!

186
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,600
“P”?

187
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,200
So we're still at “P”?

188
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,280
Challenge accepted.

189
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,160
Yeah, you had a fever at the volunteer camp.

190
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,680
I still remember. If I hadn't sponged you down,
you wouldn't have made it off the mountains.

191
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,080
Yeah.

192
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,160
That camp was so much fun.

193
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm going to wash my hands.

194
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,160
Do you like the beach?

195
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,200
Not really, I'm more of a mountain person.

196
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,600
P'Toh, let's go on a trip soon.
I'm craving a chill barbecue night.

197
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,840
Sure. Just name the date.

198
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,200
You said it.

199
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,080
I'll clear my schedule.

200
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,600
(Ask him.)

201
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,120
Is it “date” schedule for a boyfriend?

202
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
Study schedule.

203
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,200
Since my last breakup, I haven't been looking
for anything serious. Just one-night stands.

204
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,240
(Ask him more.)

205
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,120
So, is it true that you're seeing a girl now?

206
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,320
Yeah.

207
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,440
It's more comfortable than being with men.

208
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,360
Because all I ever met were players.

209
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,480
They act sweet to your face, then go screw
someone else behind your back. I hate that.

210
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,040
If you ever date someone,
I have to screen them first.

211
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,520
Okay?

212
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,240
Okay.

213
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Are you full?

214
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,200
Yes. What about you?

215
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,160
Thanks for tonight.

216
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,760
Say bye to Teh for me. He knocked out
right after dinner and hasn't moved since.

217
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,840
Want me to wake him up?

218
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,840
It's fine.

219
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,840
I'll head out now.

220
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,040
Go home safe.

221
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,360
See ya, P'Toh.

222
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,160
See ya.

223
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,080
P'Fah?

224
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,560
Hello.

225
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,440
Let's eat! I'm starving!

226
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,200
“P”?

227
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,640
This is going to be fun.

228
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,080
That's the last of them.

229
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,840
Thanks. Go hang out with Teh.
I've got the rest.

230
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,560
No way.

231
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,240
We ate together, we clean together.

232
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,480
No. In this house, we don't
let our guests do the dishes.

233
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,720
P'Toh.

234
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,640
In my house, we don't sit around
while the host cleans up.

235
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,320
It's okay.
P'Toh.

236
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,480
It's fine.
P'Toh.

237
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,760
- Come on.
- I mean it.

238
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,160
- No...
- P'Toh...

239
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,040
P'Toh!

240
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,480
Why didn't you tell me to sleep upstairs?

241
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,840
My whole body is stiff
from sleeping on a couch.

242
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Why are you still here?

243
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,600
I was helping P'Toh with the dishes.

244
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,080
Good.

245
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,480
You can be grateful.

246
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,880
Finish the rest for us.

247
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
You're leaving me to do it all by myself?!

248
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,800
Duh, I took a shower and
don't want to get messy.

249
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,320
And what about P'Toh?!

250
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,840
He must sing me a lullaby!

251
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,480
Any questions, moron?

252
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,320
Why is my heart racing?

253
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,680
I like Fah, I like Fah…

254
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,320
I like Fah.

255
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,960
You like Fah, Jimmy.

256
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,360
You like Fah.

257
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,240
Finally! We're here!

258
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,240
Fah,

259
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
Are you okay back there?
I tried to drive as smoothly as I could.

260
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,520
I took some meds beforehand.

261
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,800
Here, let me get that for you.

262
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,840
It's okay. I can manage.

263
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,000
You carry the cooler.

264
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,240
Fine…

265
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,040
Fah's barely talking to me.

266
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,320
You're being way too clingy.

267
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,120
What am I supposed to do?

268
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,160
Play it cool. Make him wonder about you.

269
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:16,726
Like your advice ever works.

270
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm being this “extra”,

271
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,480
but he still ignores me.

272
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,680
If I “stay still”, I'd be…

273
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,360
invisible.

274
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,320
Whatever. That's all I can help.

275
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,440
Sure…

276
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,080
An advice from a single guy.

277
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,920
I'm single not because my methods don't work,

278
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,720
but by choice. Period.

279
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
Is there a problem between us?

280
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,800
Not at all.

281
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,080
I saw you taking photos and
didn't want to get in your way.

282
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,720
P-P'Fah?

283
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,840
Did you take a picture of me?

284
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,640
Yeah. Now, you're the subject.

285
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,720
But I'm not photogenic.

286
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,240
Come take a look.

287
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,040
I think…

288
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm really into you.

289
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,600
And next time, drop the “P”.

290
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,400
Just call me Fah.

291
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,640
Got it?

292
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,120
Damn…

293
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,800
My heart's fluttering.

294
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,360
What are you up to?

295
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,720
Marinating the pork.

296
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,160
You startled me.

297
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,793
What do I have to do? Need a hand?

298
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,320
Put all the ingredients in and massage them.

299
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,040
Your hands are so soft.

300
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,640
Then… you finish the rest.

301
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm going to… wash the vegetables.

302
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,320
Hold on, Jimmy.

303
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,360
You like Fah.

304
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,520
Want me to feed you?

305
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,840
So your hands are free for the guitar.

306
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,360
It's fine.

307
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,080
I wanna eat barbeque.

308
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,000
Then help yourself.

309
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,280
(What are you laughing at?)

310
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,440
(Good luck with that, moron.)

311
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,960
P'Toh.

312
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Are you drunk?
You should head up to bed.

313
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm not drunk...

314
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,400
You can barely keep your head up.
I'll take you to your room.

315
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm getting sleepy anyway.

316
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,520
Don't worry. I'll take him.

317
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,880
You're still having fun. Just stay here.

318
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,880
I'll take my...
Stay right where you are.

319
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,200
If you go up, I know you'll
ditch me and go to sleep.

320
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,200
I've got this.

321
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,360
Come on, P'Toh.

322
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,640
Let's go.

323
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,960
Easy does it.

324
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,720
My head's spinning.

325
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,560
It's because you're wasted.

326
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,640
Get some sleep. You'll feel better.

327
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,640
Well…

328
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,240
I'm going.

329
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,680
Stay with me.

330
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,920
I'm scared of ghosts.

331
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,720
I had no idea you were a scaredy-cat.

332
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,120
Stay until I fall asleep.

333
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,560
If you're worried, just check on him yourself.

334
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I don't want to leave
you here by yourself, P'Fah.

335
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,800
Just call me “Fah”.

336
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,440
“Just Fah”.

337
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,520
Much better.

338
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,480
I think that you've…

339
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
been avoiding me.

340
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,400
I haven't.

341
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,640
Don't you want to kiss me?

342
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,400
Fah,

343
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,000
Jimmy likes you.

344
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,640
But I don't like him.

345
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,760
And I'm not looking for anything serious.

346
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,040
It's late. We should head to bed.

347
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,480
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

348
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,360
Teh, don't give me that look.

349
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,080
P'Toh was scared of ghosts
and asked me to stay with him.

350
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,360
Why are you two headed back?

351
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,880
Run out of snacks?

352
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,640
No, we're heading to bed.

353
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,280
I'm driving tomorrow.
Can't risk a headache.

354
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,840
Let's go.

355
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,760
We're off to bed.

356
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,960
Goodnight.

357
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,800
Move it.

358
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,560
Now.

359
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,400
Damn!

360
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,600
Fah said goodnight to me.

361
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,720
What did you tell him?

362
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,560
Just that you like him.

363
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,680
For real?

364
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,640
What did he say?

365
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,760
He didn't say anything.

366
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,360
You've got to be kidding me!

367
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,240
Tell me. I wanna know.

368
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,120
Go ask him yourself.

369
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,600
I'm dead tired.

370
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,120
And turn down the AC.
It's frickin' hot.

371
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,360
It's already at 19.

373
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,000
Why is it still hot?

374
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,240
What should we do?
We're going to be baked alive in here.

375
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,680
You better compensate us tomorrow,
or I'm leaving a nasty review.

376
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,640
Well? Can't they fix it?

377
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,040
It's past midnight.
The technicians are all gone.

378
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,480
Now what?

379
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,520
Sleep naked like me.

380
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,880
Hell no.

381
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,560
Or…

382
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,800
crash in P'Toh's room.

383
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,680
No, too cramped.

384
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,920
That's what I want.

385
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,000
Grab your blanket!

386
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,120
Hey,

387
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,360
I'll sleep next to Fah.

388
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,640
Whatever.

389
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,320
I'll crash on the floor.

390
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,160
Sleep next your crush like a K-drama.

391
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,880
Make sure your body
stays “stiff”. Nothing else.

392
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,800
Screw you.

393
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,240
I'll tell your brother the real you.

394
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,160
Go to sleep already.

395
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,440
Teh.

396
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,920
Now what?

397
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,720
I can't sleep next to Fah.

398
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,680
P'Tohs in the way.

399
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
And you're next to him.

400
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,440
Just sleep here with me.

401
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,520
Nah, my back will be trashed.

402
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,000
Teh.

403
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,160
What now?

404
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,280
I'll sleep next to your brother.

405
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,120
Yeah, fine. I'm out.

406
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,000
And stop bothering me.

407
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,160
I'm sleeping.

408
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,320
Can I sleep here with you?

409
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,200
My blanket got snatched.

410
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,440
I saw you at the club once.

411
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,200
But I guess you didn't notice me.

412
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
Really?

413
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,440
You're so charming.

414
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,160
No wonder you're always with someone new.

415
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,960
Can I ask you something?

416
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,560
Do you ever want something serious?

417
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,320
I used to,

418
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,960
but I don't really know what love feels like.

419
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,880
Every relationship I've had was just a thrill.

420
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,800
Once the spark is gone, I'm done.

421
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,320
So…

422
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,440
just one-night stands then?

423
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,480
I just feel…

424
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,040
if I can't love someone with my whole soul,

425
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,200
it's better to be alone.

426
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,320
How can it be love without devotion?

427
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,960
What if…

428
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,680
you finally find the one…

429
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,400
you can give all your heart to…

430
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,360
but they don't feel the same,

431
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,280
wouldn't that destroy you?

432
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,200
Well… At least I got to “love” someone.

433
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:02,880
Jimmy?

434
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,240
P'Toh.

435
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,960
Let me cover your ears.

436
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,640
Jimmy? Are you okay?

437
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,600
P'Toh…

438
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

439
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,600
I just…

440
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,240
need a hug right now.

441
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
Damn…

442
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,320
You're…

443
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,200
so tempting like what Teh said.

444
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:32,800
No.

445
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,640
This isn't right.

446
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,360
At least he respects you, Toh.

447
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,440
(Next Episode)
There's one rule of mine you should know.

448
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,120
Do you realize you haven't
been yourself since the trip?

449
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,040
Did you tell P'Toh that I like Fah?

450
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,640
- How could you...
- I like Fah.

451
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,320
Or do you like him too?

452
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,440
Why don't you trust us?

453
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,480
I've been his friend for a long time.

454
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,600
I know exactly what he's capable of.
