1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,496
(Previously)
What the hell did you do to my brother?!

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,720
Now you know how I felt.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,599
I'll stay away from Fah.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,040
You'd better keep your word.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,440
Otherwise, I'll keep using your brother…

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,560
until I'm bored.
Then I'll throw him back to you.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,080
You've got this, Toh.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,000
You can make him love you for real.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
There you are.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Are you free, Jimmy?

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Come with me for a bit?

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Smile.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,320
One, two, three.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,520
I think I got the shot.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Yeah, this one.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,720
I like this one the best.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,720
One, two, three.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Change your poses.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,440
One, two, three.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,119
Give me something more vibrant.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,320
Sure, I'll give you a full
thirty-two-tooth smile.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,520
One, two, three.

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
How is it?

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,400
Your face is getting oily.
Let me blot it for you.

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,400
Should we keep going?

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Okay.

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,320
One, two, three.

28
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,600
Here, we're home.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Peek-a-boo.

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,200
Stay with mama for today, Saensee.

31
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Mama…

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
Stay with mama for today.

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
Thanks a lot for today.

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,760
The union member voted for you,

35
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,640
so I had to ask.

36
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Oh, don't mention it.

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,360
You can always disturb me anytime.

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Fah,

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
I want to get to know you better.

40
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,840
Can you … give me a chance?

41
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,640
I've never closed my door to anyone,

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,760
no matter who they are.

43
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,080
But I don't just let anyone in,
especially when I'm not ready.

44
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,960
Still…

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
thanks again for today.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,480
I'll treat you to some snacks later.

47
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,080
Can't it be today?

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,880
Sorry, I already have plans.

49
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Catch you later.

50
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,280
Serves you right.

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Even without me, you'd never
stand a chance with him, moron.

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I think…

53
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
we need to talk, Teh.

54
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,500
"Love Alert" (Episode 5)

55
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't worry.

56
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,080
No one can see us here.

57
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,040
What did you want to talk about?

58
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
Why did you do that?

59
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,840
If I didn't care about the truth,
I would've hit you harder.

60
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,160
What truth?

61
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,760
The reason why you've been avoiding me.

62
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Ignoring my calls,

63
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
leaving my texts on read...

64
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,920
Is this about Jimmy?

65
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,360
I'm giving you one last chance.

66
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,920
What's going on between you two?
And what does it have to do with me?

67
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,280
It's nothing.

68
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,680
I gave you a chance.

69
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Then…

70
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,360
we have nothing to say to each other.

71
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
Thank you for looking after Saensee.

72
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,000
I was happy to do it.

73
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,240
What's wrong?

74
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,400
Scared Teh will catch
us? He's not even home.

75
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,880
I don't want any trouble between you two.

76
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,160
I guess I can't sleep over tonight then?

77
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,080
You definitely can't.
You know how protective Teh is.

78
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,240
I was just teasing.

79
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,520
Good night.

80
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Good night.

81
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Drive safely.

82
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
Text me when you get home.

83
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm going.

84
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Good night.

85
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,240
Good night.

86
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
I'm really going.

87
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Off you go.

88
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,200
I'll text you when I'm home.

89
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm going.

90
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
Bye bye.

91
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Come here.

92
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Good night.

93
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,040
I've already known the truth.

94
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
Have you seen Jimmy?

95
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
He's in that room.

96
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,920
Are you sure you stay away from P'Toh?

97
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,920
What about you?

98
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
Stay away from Fah?

99
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,440
I've stayed away from him.

100
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,760
That's why you've been avoiding me.

101
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,640
But I want to know…

102
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,800
Do you still want to be my boyfriend?

103
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,040
Can you say it for me?

104
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,120
Whenever I'm with you,

105
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm so happy.

106
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
I can't even stop smiling.

107
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,720
You're the one who taught me
what it's like to love someone.

108
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,520
And it's only you who
makes me feel that way.

109
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
I love you, Fah.

110
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,840
Still worried about P'Toh?

111
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,200
It's not that complicated.

112
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,240
Just don't let Jimmy finds out.

113
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,840
When I want to see
you, I'll go to your place.

114
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,400
When you want to see me, you come here.

115
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,200
On campus, we'll just act normal

116
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,880
like two celebrities dating in secret.

117
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,640
Isn't that thrilling?

118
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,640
Does this mean we're officially "us" now?

119
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,400
(Jimmy: I'm home. Gonna
take a shower and sleep.)

120
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,920
(Don't forget to dream about me.)

121
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,360
(Toh: Good night.)

122
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
Hey, is it my turn?

123
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
Taste them for me.

124
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,197
This is an Americano.

125
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:27,377
Espresso.

126
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,915
This is a latte.

127
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,099
Cappuccino and

128
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:36,663
Mocha.

129
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:48,273
Hey, it's a coffee tasting,
not an exam. Why so serious?

130
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,000
Well,

131
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,760
I have to be thorough!

132
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,760
Otherwise, how am I supposed
to know which one is actually good?

133
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,080
But after tasting them all,
I think they’re all pretty decent.

134
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
You flatter me.

135
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm not flattering because
you're my brother. I mean it!

136
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,266
I'll get it!

137
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
Fah, You came all the way here.
Missed me that much?

138
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
In your dreams. I'm here to see P'Toh.

139
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,240
Something you wanted to talk to me about?

140
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,760
Do you like Jimmy?

141
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,360
No way! That's crazy.

142
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,680
What has The been telling you?

143
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,160
He's over-protective and obsessed with me.

144
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,040
It's fine if you don't
want to tell me the truth.

145
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,160
My friends went out
last night and took these.

146
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,240
They know Jimmys been hitting on me.

147
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,120
And…

148
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,440
why are you showing me this?

149
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,240
Teh and I are worried about you.
We see him flirting with you all the time,

150
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,720
and you might fall for him.

151
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,160
Jimmy is a certified player.

152
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I don't want to see you get hurt.

153
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,400
I appreciate it.

154
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,560
But… there's really nothing
between us, I swear.

155
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,520
Woah, you were that direct with him?

156
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Why beat around the bush?
Being direct is better.

157
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
You're the man.

158
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,640
But… you and I are just outsiders.
All we can do is warn him.

159
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,720
The final decision has to be P'Toh's.

160
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
I can't stand seeing Jimmy
mess with people' feelings.

161
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,880
Using someone's secret for his
own gain… that's unacceptable.

162
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
And how was P'Toh?

163
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,880
Putting a brave face.

164
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,720
But I know he was hurting inside.

165
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,320
I'm sure Jimmy still going
after P'Toh behind your back.

166
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,720
That son of a bitch.

167
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
I'm gonna kill him...

168
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,920
I know you're furious,
but punching him won't solve anything.

169
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,520
Do you say I should do nothing?

170
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,840
No. There are better ways than violence.

171
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm home. Gonna take a shower and sleep.

172
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,680
Don't forget to dream about me.

173
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,840
My friends took these photos last night.

174
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
P'Toh.

175
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,080
Have you eaten yet? I
bought you some lunch.

176
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Not yet, I got carried away
with work. Is it noon already?

177
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,000
Yep, it is.

178
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,320
I knew you got carried away.

179
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,800
You shouldn't do that.
You'll end up with a stomach ache.

180
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
P'Toh,

181
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,520
what's on your cheek?

182
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
So refreshing.

183
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Jim…

184
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
thank you.

185
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,800
Why don't you stay and eat with me?

186
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,920
Of course. I'd love to.

187
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Seriously?

188
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
You're his brother, but you
don't know how he operates?

189
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I guess so.

190
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,440
P'Toh has always been like this.

191
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,240
Fully committed when it comes to love.

192
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,280
If he doesn't listen, we have to let
him get hurt until he's had enough.

193
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,880
The goal isn't to make Jimmy leave him.

194
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,880
But to make P'Toh walk away on his own.

195
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,640
Trust me. This won't just save P'Toh,

196
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
it'll teach Jimmy a lesson.

197
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
How?

198
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,520
A player like Jimmy

199
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,320
might lose his heart
to a nice guy like P'Toh.

200
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,280
Oh, P'Toh,

201
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,440
my exams are coming up soon.

202
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,720
I must hit the books pretty hard.

203
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,840
So…

204
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm thinking of turning off my phone.

205
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,920
P'Toh? You there?

206
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,720
It's good that you told me.

207
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,160
I won't disturb your study.

208
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,240
P'Toh…

209
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,480
you don't mind me, right?

210
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I understand.

211
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,760
Just focus on your exams, okay?

212
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,960
You're the best.

213
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Well…

214
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
See you.

215
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
P'Toh…

216
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
Are you okay?

217
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
What's on your mind?

218
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Huh?

219
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,120
I was… going over the
inventory for the cafe.

220
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,160
Hey, my exams are almost over.
Where should we go for a trip?

221
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
You should go without me.

222
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,800
I'll be swamped with the cafe opening.

223
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,760
I want to open on an auspicious date.

224
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
Why don't you ask Jimmy?

225
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Oh…

226
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,320
His queue is longer
than the distance to Pluto.

227
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,440
Everyone's dying to hang out with him.

228
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,120
Right, I'm not going anywhere!

229
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll help you open the cafe instead.

230
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,560
So what if he lied?

231
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,760
As long as he's still here with you.

232
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,280
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

233
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,560
I… I…

234
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,760
Are you here to spy on me?!

235
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,016
Did you think I'd sneak out somewhere?

236
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,440
It's not like that. I just
couldn't get a hold of you.

237
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,560
I told you already!

238
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,040
My phone was off because I had to study!

239
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,360
And I find you doing this?!

240
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,400
How would you feel if you were in my shoes?

241
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm…

242
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,080
I'm so sorry.

243
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,360
It's too late for that.

244
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,640
Don't call me. And don't come
here again for a while.

245
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
Unless you want to see me get angrier.

246
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,920
P'Toh! You're going to
drown it before it grows!

247
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Huh?

248
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Oops.

249
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,560
Are you spacing out again?

250
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,080
Don't tell me you miss Jimmy.

251
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Ridiculous!

252
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,960
Why would I miss him?

253
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,560
I was thinking about the
staff interviews tomorrow.

254
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,640
I'm heading out for my exams.

255
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Good luck with that.

256
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,800
The last exam is over.

257
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,480
Where's the party at tonight?

258
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
I'm not in the mood.

259
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Did you fight with one of your flings?
You looked grumpy since this morning.

260
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,560
Yes, it sucks.

261
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,640
He keeps tracking me like a detective.

262
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,240
I want to see the person who
could get under the skin of Mr. Jimmy.

263
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,280
Who's gonna apologize?

264
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,520
I don't crawl back to anyone.

265
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,600
Even if I'm in the wrong.

266
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,400
You guys go ahead. I'm out.

267
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,920
Are you seriously not coming?

268
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,559
Dang.

269
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
What a buzzkill.

270
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,839
Just you and me then. "Buy 2 Get 2" promo?

271
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
- Yep.
- Okay.

272
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,440
Jim.

273
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,360
I'm so sorry.

274
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,400
I shouldn't have doubted you.

275
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,920
I won't ever do it again. I promise.

276
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,520
Promise me…

277
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,720
you'll never do that again.

278
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
I can't stand it.

279
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
P'Toh!

280
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Take that!

281
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
P'Toh!

282
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
P'Toh,

283
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
you should head back now.

284
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,760
I can't concentrate with you around.

285
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
I need to study.

286
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,800
Oh, right.

287
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,120
I forgot you still have exams.

288
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
P'Toh,

289
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,040
can you…

290
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,360
feed Saensee for me?

291
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,000
Sure, I can.

292
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,600
Do you have anything to eat?
Want me to order something for you?

293
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,680
I've already stocked up on everything.

294
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,520
I'm so sorry, Teh. I didn't cook for you.

295
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,439
I was taking care of some business
I'll whip something for you.

296
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,560
Hey, that's okay. I'm stuffed.

297
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,520
I finished several packs of noodles.

298
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,680
So, what "business" were you busy with?

299
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,440
It's like your soul has been
sucked out of your body.

300
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,960
Do I… really look that bad?

301
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,040
Yes. Like you've been through a war.

302
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,920
Seriously, where were you?

303
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,720
I'm feeling sticky. I
going to take a shower.

304
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,600
Still clinging to my brother?

305
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,000
You should go ask your brother that.

306
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,720
You've fallen for him, haven't you?

307
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
But you don't realize it.

308
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,600
What are you talking about? No way.

309
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,960
It's okay if you don't want to admit it.

310
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:52,120
But let me tell you something, Jimmy.
Nobody has unlimited patience.

311
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,120
The day my brother finally has enough,

312
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,440
you'll end up looking
worse than a stray dog.

313
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,800
And I'll be right here,
enjoying every second of it.

314
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,600
Don't call me. And don't come
here again for a while.

315
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,840
Unless you want to see me get angrier.

316
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,080
Was I too harsh?

317
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Is he really gone?

318
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You should head back now.

319
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,200
I can't concentrate with you around.

320
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
I need to study.

321
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,440
Oh, right.

322
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,840
I forgot you still have exams.

323
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,120
Peace and quiet.

324
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,120
It's always like this

325
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,560
whenever he's near me.

326
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,679
Study, study, study, study, study.

327
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,680
Study, Jimmy.

328
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,320
(Next Episode)
Can we get back together?

329
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,240
Are you looking for Jimmy?

330
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,200
He's…

331
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,360
P'Toh, give your love to
someone who deserves it.

332
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,280
Don't waste it on a man like Jimmy.

333
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,040
He treats you like a sure thing.
