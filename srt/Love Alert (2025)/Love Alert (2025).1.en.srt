1
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,480
It's too lonely to drink alone.

2
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,000
Wanna hang out with me?

3
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,360
No.

4
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,880
I have a boyfriend.

5
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Oh, do you have one?

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,520
But he broke up with me.

7
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,000
He's not coming back.

8
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,520
I have to fix this…

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,840
I miss him so much,

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,720
but I don't know what to do.

11
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,600
Then I wish you can win him back.

12
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
Stealing my girl like that?

13
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
You think you're hot?

14
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,120
You want some, punks?!

15
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,720
- Come at me!
- I'll get you.

16
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,440
So much for Mr. Hotshot.

17
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,600
P'Toh.

18
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,480
Did you see that?

19
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,200
I didn't go with another guy.

20
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,880
Am I a good boy?

21
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,880
Good boy, your ass!

22
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,120
You wouldn't hurt my brother
if you were actually good!

23
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
Please help me, man.

24
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
I beg you.

25
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
Since I've broken up with him,

26
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,920
I've always missed him.

27
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,120
If I could've turned back time,

28
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
If I could've turned back time,

29
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
I would've done everything better.

30
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
I wouldn't have disappointed him.

31
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,160
I wouldn't have loved you like this.

32
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
"Love Alert"
(Episode 1)

33
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,920
(Three months earlier)

34
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,760
You can stay if you want.

35
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,920
I'll take a bath.

36
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
Let me think.

37
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
That smells amazing.

38
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
What're you making for me today?

39
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,360
Here.

40
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,280
Why the long face?

41
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
You just said it smelled good.

42
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,120
Don't you like it now?

43
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,120
No.

44
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,840
Just the thought of…

45
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,320
some guy taking you away from me

46
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,000
puts me in a bad mood.

47
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,040
Oh, come on.

48
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm here all day. Who would I meet?

49
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,440
I'll put a sign out front that says:

50
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,160
“Hands off the owner.

51
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,600
His brother bites.”

52
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, right.

53
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,560
People will think you're crazy.

54
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm serious.

55
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,120
I won't let you date anyone without my permission.

56
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,200
Deal?

57
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Alright…

58
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
Just eat up. You'll be late.

59
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,680
See?

60
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,000
Knowing I hate whole oranges,
you juiced them for me.

61
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,840
Who else could I love if not you?

62
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,960
Cheeky.

63
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
You didn't let me date, did you?

64
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,400
What about you? You've had many
boyfriends and never introduced them.

65
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,840
It's true I have many,

66
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,280
but they weren't good enough to see you.

67
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,760
I dumped them first.

68
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,840
I'd love to see someone who can handle you.

69
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,360
Will you forget about me

70
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680
if you really love someone?

71
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,800
No!

72
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm not sure about it.

73
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,080
Still, you're not allowed to date.

74
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,480
Wow…

75
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,400
What a gatekeeping.

76
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,880
If you won't let me date,

77
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,880
you'd better take care of
me for the rest of my life.

78
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,040
I thought you'd sleep in.

79
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,320
What's the hurry?

80
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Texting someone else again?

81
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,920
What do you mean?

82
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,160
Someone just texted your phone.

83
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,120
Did you snoop through my phone?

84
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,280
I didn't.

85
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,560
It was on the screen.
Planned to hook up again, didn't you?!

86
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,520
It's just for fun.

87
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,520
No strings attached.

88
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,480
Why so serious?

89
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,160
This is the third damn time!

90
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,040
Do you even know what loyalty is?!

91
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
I was like this before we even dated.

92
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,120
Why can't you handle it now?

93
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,560
God damn…

94
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
You selfish asshole.

95
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,320
If you can't keep it in
your pants, we're done!

96
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,760
Fine!

97
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't come crawling back to me!

98
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,640
You've been broken up
with Run so many times.

99
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,640
When can you stop being a mess?

100
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Look who's talking.

101
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,560
You're not that different.

102
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't compare me to a jerk like you.

103
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,960
I date one man at a time.
I break up first, then move on.

104
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,480
Unlike you!

105
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,640
I told him before I dated him
that this is who I am.

106
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,040
Oh, wow.

107
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,000
No remorse at all.

108
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,520
So, it's really over this time?

109
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,200
I don't care at all. You know I never beg.

110
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,880
Can't handle me? Go.

111
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,680
Also,

112
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,320
I've got a new target.

113
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
Who?

114
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
P'Fah?!

115
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,800
He's a campus heartthrob.

116
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,680
So what?

117
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
I'm hot stuff too.

118
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,520
Mark my words,

119
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm gonna make Fah mine.

120
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,640
You've got some nerve.

121
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
That's me.

122
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,920
Have some nerve like me sometimes.

123
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,240
You're a total asshole.

124
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,960
Just watch me.

125
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,560
Hey!

126
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,040
Have you seen Fah?

127
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,480
Oh, he might be in the building.

128
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,560
Thanks.

129
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,920
Fah,

130
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,840
can I talk with you?

131
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
What's up, Amy?

132
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,480
I heard you're single now, right?

133
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,040
Yeah.

134
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,200
The rumor's true. Can I hit on you?

135
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,080
If it's you,

136
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't mind.

137
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm kinda over guys lately.
Thinking of dating a girl for a change.

138
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,800
Ooh, sounds good.

139
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
But I'm not that...

140
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
easy.

141
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,280
Not impossible…

142
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,280
if you want to try.

143
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,200
Drop your Line and IG, then.

144
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,240
Some friend you are,
kicking me while I'm down.

145
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,320
That's right, my best friend.

146
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,960
Don't cry.

147
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,680
Teh.

148
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Oh, P'Toh.

149
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,480
You forgot your iPad at home.
Didn't you say you need it?

150
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,800
And you didn't even answer my call.

151
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,760
It seems I turned it off.

152
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,480
Thank you so much, my dearest bro.

153
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,880
Jimmy, my brother, Toh.

154
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,600
Toh, Jimmy.

155
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,360
The friend I keep telling you about.

156
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,480
Hello, P'Toh.

157
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,360
You don't have to be formal with me.

158
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,920
Just saying hi is enough.

159
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,480
P'Toh,

160
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,760
don't believe everything your
brother says. I'm a good guy.

161
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,640
Get defensive already?

162
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
Shut up.

163
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,280
Toh?

164
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,920
Fah!

165
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,120
When did you get back?

166
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,360
It's been a while.
I'm busy getting cafe ready at home.

167
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,840
Just come by once it opens. Coffee's on me.

168
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,800
No way. I want to support you.

169
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,960
Oh.

170
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,680
Fah was a freshman in the
union when I was a senior.

171
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Nice to meet you.

172
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,480
Don't need for that. Just call me Fah.

173
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm Teh, Toh's younger brother.

174
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm Jimmy, Teh's friend.

175
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,560
So you don't remember me?

176
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,640
Looks like it.

177
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,240
You met Fah when you visited
me on campus back in high school.

178
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,440
Guess you've forgotten...

179
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,080
Really?

180
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,000
I remember you.

181
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,040
I knew you studied here but
never ran into each other.

182
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,240
I was here to give Teh his stuff.

183
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,640
Need to head back now.
Appointed with a plumber.

184
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,960
You can use me car.

185
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,280
I can walk back.

186
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll walk you to the car.

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm going.

188
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,800
Fah and P'Toh.

189
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,640
They knew each other.

190
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,200
P'Toh and Fah.

191
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,560
Teh,

192
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,480
I'll walk you home today.

193
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,720
Fine.

194
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
Let's go.

195
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,200
P'Toh!

196
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,360
Jimmy walked me home,
so I let him in for a bit.

197
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,560
Sorry to bother you.

198
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,880
What are you working on?

199
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,880
Oh, browsing cafe references.

200
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,640
Gonna shower first.
Played basketball. I'm reeking now.

201
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
Have a seat.

202
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm such a bad host.

203
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,880
I forgot to offer you a drink.
I'll get a glass for you.

204
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,280
I don't mind that at all.

205
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,400
I insist.

206
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,880
I'll make you one of the cafe's
special drinks. Sounds good?

207
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,280
Thank you.

208
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,720
I'll be quick.

209
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,240
What's wrong with the faucet?

210
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,560
Oh, that's your drink.

211
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,760
The water won't run.
Must be the valve acting up again.

212
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,480
Let me take a look.

213
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,520
Please, no.

214
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,120
You're our guest.

215
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm the one disturbing you at this hour.

216
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,880
Let me help you.

217
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Well, I'll get the call now.

218
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Hello, Mr. Wet.

219
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,280
Oh, please tell me the total budget.

220
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,840
Yes, thank you. See you.

221
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,640
Where's Jimmy?

222
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Fixing the faucet for me.

223
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,640
What the…

224
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,320
What the hell did you break in my house?

225
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,960
I fixed the faucet for
your brother. All Done.

226
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,760
What was wrong with it?

227
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,840
The valve wasn't tightened.
I took it out and put it back.

228
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,040
I see.

229
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,200
Thanks so much.

230
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,400
You're soaked. Go change first.

231
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,200
It's okay. It'll be dried soon.

232
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,600
You must!

233
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,240
You're soaking wet.

234
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,600
You're not wearing my shirt.

235
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,680
I don't wanna wear yours anyway.
Just the thought of it creeps me out.

236
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,120
I'll lend you one of mine.
Let me find if there's a bigger shirt.

237
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,160
Give me a minute.

238
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,600
Go change in the bathroom.

239
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,920
Just go already!

240
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you!

241
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,880
Just say it.

242
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,520
Don't fall for Jimmy.

243
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,160
Come on!

244
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,520
I don't think of anything.

245
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
He's your friend.

246
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,960
Jimmy is a certified player.

247
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,720
He's my friend. Don't ever cross
that line. It's for your own good.

248
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,000
That bad?

249
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
I don't want you getting hurt.

250
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,640
Keep your distant from him,
or you're asking for trouble.

251
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,560
Nothing's gonna happen.

252
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,840
You're overthinking.

253
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
Everything's delicious.
I'll come by and eat here again sometime.

254
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
My house's not a restaurant!
Go eat somewhere else!

255
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,400
Teh,

256
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,520
Jimmy's your friend!

257
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,600
Yeah, P'Toh.
Teh's always so mean to me.

258
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,840
P'Toh,

259
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,760
your food's amazing.
And will open a cafe soon?

260
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,040
Your desserts must be tasty too.

261
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,240
If I come to have your food again,

262
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,360
what should I bring you next time?

263
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,160
You don't have to.

264
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,200
Just come over.

265
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,280
I can't do that. If I eat for free,

266
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,600
I should give something back.

267
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,040
If anything, maybe some Thai desserts.
That's one thing I can't make.

268
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,920
My go-to shop is right across from campus.

269
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,000
But don't get too much.
I don't wanna gain weight.

270
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,280
Roger that!

271
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,960
Enough with the flirting!

272
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,280
You're banned from my house.

273
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,760
Frickin' eat up and go home.

274
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,840
Sue Teh!

275
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,160
Yes, P'Toh. Tell him off.

276
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,680
He's always like this.

277
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,080
You'll hurt your friend's feelings.

278
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,960
(Serves you right.)

279
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,120
What's with the face?

280
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,120
Toh, try this.

281
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,640
You should eat more too.

282
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,480
Come here!

283
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,280
Teh! That hurts!
What's wrong with you?!

284
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
I did mean it!

285
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,160
About what?

286
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,520
Banning you from my house.

287
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,640
Why?

288
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,480
I don't want my brother to fall for you.

289
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,120
And I'm also sure you'd hurt him.

290
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,560
You're exaggerating.

291
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,360
My brother is such an…

292
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,720
‘easy target'.

293
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,800
And I know exactly what you're like.

294
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,000
I haven't thought of him that
way at all. You're overthinking.

295
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm cutting you off right now.

296
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,200
If you cross the line, you're dead.

297
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,360
Brother-obsessed freak.

298
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,120
Fine.

299
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,040
I promise not to touch your brother.

300
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Catch ya later.

301
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,040
See you at the uni.

302
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,520
Don't fall for Jimmy.

303
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,840
Jimmy is a certified player.

304
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,600
He's my friend. Don't ever cross
that line. It's for your own good.

305
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,920
That bad?

306
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,400
I don't want you getting hurt.

307
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,840
Keep your distant from him,
or you're asking for trouble.

308
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,080
Who falls for him?

309
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,200
Teh was just talking.

310
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,880
Time to sleep.

311
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,520
Jimmy, my brother, Toh.
Toh, Jimmy.

312
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,120
The friend I keep telling you about.

313
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Hello, P'Toh.

314
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,760
You don't have to be formal with me.

315
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,200
Just saying hi is enough.

316
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,320
Teh,

317
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
your brother…

318
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,960
is really ‘tempting'.

319
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,160
Zip it properly.

320
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,080
Got everything?

321
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,600
Here.

322
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,280
If I do, I'll just call you to bring it over.

323
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,080
I'm not your rider.

324
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,680
If there's next time, I'll charge you a fee.

325
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Don't forget to tell me
what you want for dinner.

326
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,960
Let me think. I'll tell you later.

327
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm heading out.

328
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,480
Focused on studying.

329
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,560
Can't you zip your bag?

330
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,720
Drive safely.

331
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,200
P'Toh!

332
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,200
Oh, Jimmy.

333
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,800
Teh just went out.

334
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm not here for Teh.

335
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,040
Thai desserts from your favorite shop.

336
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,560
Thank you so much.

337
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,800
Don't tell me you bought
these just to bring them here.

338
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,520
To thank you for dinner last night.

339
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
And…

340
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,960
And…?

341
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,640
Can I have a free cup of coffee?

342
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,400
Oh, sure.

343
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,240
Of course.

344
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,160
Let's get inside the house.

345
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,360
This is exactly my taste.

346
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,360
Tell me when your cafe opens.

347
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,400
I'll be your first regular customer.

348
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,480
I'll call and nag you if you don't show up.

349
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,480
By the way…

350
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,600
That shop opens really early.

351
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,480
It's always crowded

352
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
and sells out fast.

353
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,880
What time did you go?

354
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,640
So early.

355
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,240
I'm not a morning person,

356
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,680
but I can…

357
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,120
manage for you.

358
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,960
Your lips have crumps.

359
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,160
You're treating like a kid.

360
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,520
To me, you kind of are.

361
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,480
As adorable as a little kid.

362
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,680
P'Toh,

363
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,240
About the shirt I borrowed,
I'll wash it and bring it back later.

364
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,960
Oh, that's all right.

365
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,800
Anytime's fine.

366
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,400
That's good.

367
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,560
Can I keep it for now?

368
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,360
It smells like you.

369
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,240
How about I keep it for good?

370
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,480
Is it good?

371
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,800
Thanks for buying desserts for me.
It's been a long time. I'm satisfied now.

372
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,080
Please, don't yet.

373
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,400
What?

374
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,880
Don't get over this place too fast.

375
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,280
If you do, what excuse will
I have to come see you again?

376
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,600
Uh…

377
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,240
P'Toh,

378
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,000
you know you're cute when you blush?

379
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,120
It's Teh.

380
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,120
Don't answer him now!

381
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,200
Don't tell him I'm here.

382
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,160
I must work on a presentation
with Teh, but I came to see you first.

383
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
I see.

384
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,880
You should head out. I'll call him later.

385
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,760
Well… I'm off then.

386
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Before Teh kicks my ass.

387
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

388
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,080
Bye bye.

389
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,360
Forgot something, young master?

390
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,200
A rider delivered something,
so I came out to get it.

391
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,880
Don't forget to tell me
what you want for dinner.

392
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,400
Okay.

393
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,800
Fah.

394
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,480
I bought you desserts.

395
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,240
Thank you.

396
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,560
Okay…

397
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,560
See you later.

398
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,280
Hope you enjoy it.

399
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,880
You can have them.

400
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,840
Thank you.

401
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,360
You bastard, Jimmy!

402
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,240
What's your problem, Teh?

403
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,520
Look at this.

404
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,840
What the hell is this?!

405
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,360
It obviously your house's camera.

406
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,920
Don't forget that I'm your
friend who knows your nature.

407
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,680
So what?

408
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,560
I just bought desserts to
thank your brother for dinner.

409
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,840
Didn't I tell you to stay away from my brother?!

410
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,720
- I don't trust you!
- So what?!

411
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,480
- What's your game?! Spit it out!
- I don't have a plan!

412
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,240
You're soaked. Go change first.

413
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,760
I'll lend you one of mine.
Let me find if there's a bigger shirt.

414
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,640
Give me a minute.

415
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,640
(Next Episode) I totally get you for being
protective of your brother.

416
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,040
You should know that I am.
I'm worried about him.

417
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,600
I don't want him to be hurt.

418
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,400
I can't help it. He's so cute.

419
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,680
P'Fah!

420
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,320
Hello.

421
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Still call me ‘P'?

422
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,880
You'll see.

423
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
P'Toh.

424
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,720
I have something to tell you.

425
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,560
It's important.
