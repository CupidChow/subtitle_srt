1
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,310
Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up!

2
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,020
He's so excited. Okay, be right there.

3
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,360
Like I said, our hospital can't take any more patients in.

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,190
This man was sent here because of the coldness in his right leg.

5
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,730
No, we can't take him.

6
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,460
We're afraid that he's got peripheral vascular disease.

7
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,430
(Episode 9)

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,770
But why did you have to try that hard?

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,410
You could've just walked away and ignored it

10
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,040
in a situation like that.

11
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,750
Because I didn't want to become a klutz like you.

12
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,990
I would be mad at myself

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,360
if I couldn't do anything but watch

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,800
a patient dying in front of me.

15
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:35,610
I didn't want to experience that horrible moment again.

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,479
Go Seung Tak.

17
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,210
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,979
He's got arterial blockage in the right leg, right?

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,220
Take him to the treatment room. I'll treat him.

20
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,890
What?

21
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,190
What are you doing?

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,860
You said no operating room was available.

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,520
So I'll take a look at him at the treatment room. Take him over there.

24
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,460
He doesn't even have an ID.

25
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,289
So what?

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Don't you see that his leg is turning pale?

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,130
We can't afford any further delay,

28
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,670
or he can't be saved anymore if his leg turns blue.

29
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,370
Take him over there.

30
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,600
Hey, what are you doing?

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,240
Why are you taking him in?

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,610
As doctors, we can't just…

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,680
We can't just send patients away.

34
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,150
We… Well…

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,850
Especially the doctors in my hospital.

36
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,920
Then…

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,620
Take him in. Come on.

38
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,630
Hey. Hey!

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,070
They can't do anything to me

40
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,000
because of my special identity.

41
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,840
But a poor intern suddenly turned

42
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,410
into a talented super intern

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,740
and caught everybody's attention.

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,050
The world wouldn't have just let you off easily, right?

45
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,980
No.

46
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,920
You are right about that.

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,090
Hey, brat!

48
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,760
How dare you ignore our order?

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,330
You think you are the only talented one?

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,890
You think you are a genius, don't you?

51
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,960
What a genius!

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,130
You have no respect for us.

53
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,070
You should've sent the patient back as we asked!

54
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,000
Who do you think you are to operate on a patient?

55
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,370
Life was already tough enough.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,740
But that made it harder.

57
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,610
I just wanted to save patients' lives.

58
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,680
I was just a nobody, so I couldn't argue.

59
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,620
Therefore, I did what I could.

60
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,760
No matter what, I needed to survive.

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,130
What about you?

62
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,060
Why did you do it?

63
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,000
You were the only one whom I could possess.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
I didn't have a choice.

65
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
But you could've said no.

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,170
Why didn't you?

67
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,010
Weren't you afraid I'd bring you bad luck?

68
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,670
I'm still afraid of that.

69
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,670
Darn it.

70
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,440
Because

71
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,050
I saw it with my own eyes

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,290
and I could imagine

73
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,460
how you grew from an intern to a highly-skilled specialist.

74
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,460
How do I put this?

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,700
You were like an extremely competitive warrior.

76
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,640
Let's begin.

77
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,370
Be focused.

78
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,110
Scalpel.

79
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,450
Suction.

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,580
Forceps.

81
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,260
Retractor.

82
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,500
That's why you want to be a doctor,

83
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,430
no matter you are alive or dead,

84
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,930
you always do.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In that case,

86
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,740
you should keep fighting like you used to.

87
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,010
Press.

88
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,690
Needle holder.

89
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,350
Well done.

90
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,409
Of course.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,220
My golden hands are…

92
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,320
Golden…

93
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,290
So,

94
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,230
this operation record which should've been written by Go Seung Tak was actually written by Cha Yeong Min?

95
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,360
And Go Seung Tak didn't even know it was done?

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,200
And it was erased later when you checked it,

97
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,900
yet you don't know it was erased by Go Seung Tak or Cha Yeong Min?

98
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,610
What the heck are you talking about?

99
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,010
I know it sounds ridiculous,

100
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,340
but…

101
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,540
Are you drunk?

102
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,080
I just had a drink.

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,810
I've been keeping it to myself.

104
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,080
It's not the only strange thing about Go Seung Tak.

105
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,390
But if we presume it's true,

106
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,220
then it'd all add up.

107
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,320
Presume what? What?

108
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,200
That Cha Yeong Min became a ghost and possessed Go Seung Tak's body?

109
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,670
How could you say such thing when you are a doctor?

110
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,310
Why are you calling me this late?

111
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,980
Who's there?

112
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,820
Alright, I see.

113
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,360
You'd better do a checkup.

114
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,300
Not in our hospital though. Go to another one.

115
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,470
Stop drinking and take some medicine.

116
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,500
I've got enough problems. How could you…

117
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,940
Then what about Go Seung Tak's surgical skills?

118
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,480
How do you explain that?

119
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,650
O Su Jeong, how dare you?

120
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,190
Well, I'm still learning.

121
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,860
Oh, you are still learning so you can call whoever you want without asking for permission?

122
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,060
What's wrong with you?

123
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
You think the emergency room is a call center

124
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,100
where you can let everybody in

125
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,700
and call anybody you want?

126
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,500
But

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,870
neither is it a grocery store

128
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,470
where you can send a patient back like returning goods.

129
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,640
R-returning…

130
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,510
How could you say such rude words?

131
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,010
My apologies. I'll go back to work now.

132
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,510
Gosh,

133
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,010
young people nowadays are so…

134
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,250
They should test your manners during the medical exams.

135
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,390
Can't believe it. How did such a rude person become a doctor?

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,460
What are you doing?

137
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,320
Disinfecting.

138
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,430
Something's been lingering around here.

139
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,390
And it smells.

140
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,430
Smells like either cow, or dog, or chicken, or horse.

141
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,330
Oh, it's right here. Smell it.

142
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,270
No. It's here.

143
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,100
Bad manners!

144
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,470
You've got to test it.

145
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,600
Take off your white coat.

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,470
Those who don't look like doctors can all wear it anyway.

147
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,380
Whole-body disinfection. Here we go!

148
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,320
Enjoy.

149
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,159
Wow,

150
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,590
thank you so much

151
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,860
for the drink.

152
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,570
By the way, our pretty doctor

153
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,929
looks quite happy today.

154
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,670
Any good news?

155
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,700
Is it that obvious?

156
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Yep.

157
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,170
I do have good news.

158
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,850
Is it because

159
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,550
that Dr. Go

160
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,920
stood up for the patient?

161
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,720
You saw that? He did very well, didn't he?

162
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,590
It's not something I can understand though.

163
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,560
But why do you feel happy

164
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,760
that Dr. Go did a good job?

165
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,590
Doesn't he still owe you a lot?

166
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,360
About that…

167
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
He has begun to pay it back little by little.

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,270
Really? Congratulations!

169
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,640
I've told you that.

170
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,970
He's not a bad person.

171
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,380
But why do you know him so well?

172
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,210
Well…

173
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,020
I'm old so I know what people are like.

174
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,090
That is called discernment.

175
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,990
My grandpa would also like Dr. Go if he saw him.

176
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,470
You got lucky this time.

177
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,240
Please be careful next time.

178
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,990
I don't know your grandpa, but he must be a great man.

179
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,020
He would be happy to see you like this.

180
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,060
What?

181
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,100
I still have work to do.

182
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,570
Thank you for your coffee.

183
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,600
Okay.

184
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,100
So you should be tough

185
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,440
and grow strong.

186
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,740
Come on.

(Operating Room)

189
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,260
Grandpa, why did you come so late?

190
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,130
Someone is worrisome.

191
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
So I stopped by.

192
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,710
Good, you are very good.

193
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,780
As Vice President of Administration,

194
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,840
how could you smell so drunk?

195
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,750
I had a meal with others today.

196
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,920
Sorry, grandpa.

197
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,750
But why are you sitting here?

198
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,390
I think of the past

199
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,620
and I am curious if it's still the same.

200
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,760
Grandpa, please go to my office.

201
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,530
No, I have to go.

202
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,760
Oh, President.

203
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,570
We didn't expect you to come.

204
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,900
You should contact us in advance.

205
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,370
Is chief a sinecure?

206
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,080
Why don't you run to our patients?

207
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,150
Chief Ban, I heard you've been working hard lately.

208
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,980
What?

209
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,920
I heard that Thoracic Surgery Department has had a hard time lately.

210
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,620
Tell me, is there any problem?

211
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,100
Since you mentioned it, I would report some.

212
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,800
Ever since the car accident

213
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,700
of Professor Cha Yeong Min,

214
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,440
we've found it hard to meet all the operation appointments.

215
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,500
Wait, you can talk to me about it later.

216
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,670
It's not suitable to say it here…

217
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,270
What does that mean?

218
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,080
Hasn't the vacancy of Professor Cha been filled yet?

219
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,280
Grandpa, I'm…

220
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,920
No. President, I'm paying attention to Professor Cha's situation.

221
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,790
It's okay to pay attention to that.

222
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,260
But you should find a new doctor for the patients.

223
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,590
That's what your job is.

224
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,900
To assist medical personnel and keep the hospital running well.

225
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,700
If you neglect your duty and focus on something else,

226
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,100
just give the post to a better man.

227
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,640
Did he understand me or not?

228
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,480
When will this boy pull himself together?

229
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,650
This old brother is still so rigid

230
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,760
and so sprightly.

231
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,730
It's been long. Hello, bro.

232
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,600
Don't worry too much about them.

233
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,560
I heard that she had got the inheritance.

234
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,860
Then why is she still working?

235
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,570
It seems to be just temporary.

236
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,100
Professor Cha is still lying in bed.

237
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,540
Perhaps she won't leave until he dies.

I haven't… called him Dad.

254
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,910
I haven't told him that I've forgiven him.

255
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,950
I haven't told him to stop feeling sorry for me.

I haven't told him… I love him.

I have so many things to say to him.

258
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,970
But I said nothing when he was alive.

259
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,910
However, I wrote his death report.

260
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,480
Will you do this to me again?

261

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,050
so you came into my dream, right?

No.

How did you know…?

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,960
I didn't tell anyone. Who told you that?

Like a dream, but not a dream. A foreseeing dream.

It shows strong waves.

which didn't show before.

which didn't show before.

That means…?

313
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,150
That means…?

314
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,790
The amplitude of brain waves means it begins to work.

315
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,760
That is to say, he's likely to wake up.

316
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,830
How long is there…?

317
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,930
It's not sure.

318
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,140
There is no other way but to wait.

319
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,870
To wait for his brain waves to get better.

320
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,780
Reason.

321
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,550
What's the reason for the change of brain waves?

322
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,280
I'm also not very clear…

323
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,920
What?

324
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,660
In fact, this change is difficult to explain medically.

325
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,420
But…

326
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,390
-But what?
-But what?

327
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,060
Based on his situation, the happy hormone is at work.

328
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,770
Medically it's hard to explain,

329
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,100
but this hormone

330
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,870
can do good to the patient.

331
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,010
Happy…

332
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,510
What's going on in his mind?

333
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,880
What good thing is it?

334
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,320
Waves were not there before last night.

335
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,960
While I'm away…

336
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,730
What the hell are you thinking now?

337
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,700
Go Seung Tak, I didn't.

338
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,250
Seung Tak.

339
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,990
Be careful, okay?

340
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,820
You are already a professional.

341
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,490
It's clearly a mistake on both sides.

342
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,930
But what is it?

343
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,730
What?

344
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,740
Didn't you hear it? Happy…

345
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,540
I see, yesterday.

346
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,470
Did you use my pure body to…

347
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,480
Are you nuts? Would I use others' bodies to do it?

348
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,080
I'm not that crazy.

349
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,720
Not that crazy?

350
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,390
What else did you use? Which part?

351
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,860
This. I used this to tuck her in.

352
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,460
Secretly while she was sleeping.

353
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,220
Are you sure she didn't know?

354
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,660
Yeah, sure.

355
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,030
What now?

356
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,030
I'm saying it just in case.

357
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,300
Don't use me for romance.

358
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,140
Of course, I won't use others' that thing.

359
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,610
I know your blood is boiling now.

360
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,780
Anyway, resist it now. Later you can use yours.

361
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,310
It's time to show your temperance.

362
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,350
Act like an adult.

363
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,510
So have you never used that thing

364
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,420
because you act like an adult?

365
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
Pure body. Seriously?

366
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,620
Is that the point now?

367
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,360
Oh, forget it. Let's find your happy moments.

368
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,260
When are you the happiest?

369
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,860
My happy moments…

370
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Hang out with my friends.

371
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,170
Watch Jessica's concert video.

372
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,400
Have a hand mask. Drink good coffee.

373
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,900
So happy. Are you a fool?

374
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,970
Say something recent.

375
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,250
Recent… Let me think.

376
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,650
Recent.

377
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,790
I seem to know what it is.

378
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,860
Good. Cut.

379
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,290
Surgery?

380
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,890
Sure it is.

381
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,930
Surgery also requires techniques.

382
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,970
What a happy life!

383
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,840
What do you say?

384
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,480
OK, it's settled then.

385
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,510
Deal.

386
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,350
This side. Darn it. Hey!

387
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,260
I got this. One-time payment for this line.

388
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,620
By the way, I need an assistant.

389
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,990
Are you sure so many?

390
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,930
They are all Professor Cha's patients.

391
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,360
That explains

392
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,930
the large number of patients in a month.

393
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,200
The number doesn't matter.

394
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,170
The thing is that these are all difficult cases.

395
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,370
I've heard that Professor Cha may wake up.

396
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,540
When he wakes up...

397
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,970
Doctors can wait for patients.

398
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,110
But it doesn't work the other way round.

399
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,750
What a moving motto!

400
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,980
By the way, didn't the president say anything?

401
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,190
President Go Se Sik

402
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,990
wishes our hospital prosperity.

403
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,530
He thinks highly of you, Chief Ban.

404
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:46,500
Is this the direction of his home? Thank you, president.

405
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,510
Patients can't wait for doctors.

406
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,340
I'll rally the doctors tomorrow.

407
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,380
You really don't know?

408
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,280
Right, I really don't.

409
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,620
You told me it's God's plan before.

410
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,850
Now you don't know?

411
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,960
We were talking about other things back then.

412
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,330
Besides, show some respect, boy!

413
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,890
As far as I can collect.

414
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,200
"You'll never wake up if you keep getting in and out."

415
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,570
Once.

416
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,440
"Your weak life is already in danger."

417
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,070
Twice.

418
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,470
Come on. Stop the counting.

419
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,010
It's good that you won't die.

420
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,980
Ah, congratulations!

421
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,280
Is it okay to spread rumors

422
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,810
and pretend that nothing happened?

423
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,950
It's a crime now. Aren't you aware?

424
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,620
Is there a crime like that?

425
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
Oh, how cold people have been now.

426
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,220
During that period,

427
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,990
how nervous and wronged I was!

428
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,930
Heartbroken.

429
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:48,130
Anyway, I'll leave myself to God.

430
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,000
It's God's plan to let Cha Yeong Min wake up.

431
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,240
Repeat that sentence every time you see me.

432
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,410
I'll give it a try.

433
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,340
You… Ridiculous.

434
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,250
Look at that guy.

435
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,720
I also see this the first time.

436
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,360
Has God's plan changed?

437
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,030
Though rules exist to be broken,

438
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,360
you should give me a notice.

439
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,500
Use the defibrillator every morning and evening.

440
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,800
As for Mannitol and systemic corticosteroids,

441
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,870
use them twice today and stop it the day after tomorrow.

442
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,240
Increase anticholinergic drugs to three times a day.

443
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,880
Okay, Dr. Jang. It's really great. Congratulations!

444
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,350
It's just the beginning. Please take care.

445
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,810
Okay.

446
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,340
You always prefer the sky to the sea.

447
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,170
Do you remember

448
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,110
our arrangement to visit the Alps?

449
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,410
If I wake up, let's take a ride before autumn.

450
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,950
Doesn't it feel great? And my car…

451
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,380
I'll buy a new car. I can make lots of money.

452
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,090
Do you still keep my passbook?

453
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:19,560
We will go definitely, with our own money.

454
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,290
And not just in dreams.

455
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,240
Is it time to chat?

456
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,200
Not now. I've had enough of you.

457
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,310
Do you think your brain waves…? Whoa!

458
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,050
I'm not chatting.

459
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,020
Is there any urgent matter?

460
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,020
Have you had lunch?

461
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,760
No, I have no appetite now.

462
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,130
You can't keep being like this. Secretary Gim.

463
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,440
Secretary Gim, you should fulfill your duty.

464
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,240
This dark-circle boy. I'm speechless.

465
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,740
Se Jin, calm down. Ignore him.

466
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,780
What should I do with him?

467
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,830
Now start the tissue valve surgery.

468
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,300
Prepare a 25cm rotor.

469
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,870
Is Professor Cha getting better?

470
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,510
Not yet. He can't get better in such a short time.

471
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,350
Yes, that is the reason.

472
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,780
Got to be more confident.

473
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,150
Hurry up!

474
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,620
Fine.

475
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,870
Still the same.

Seung Tak, don't you think my hands are too big?

477

No. You are amazing.

479
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,940
What about Go Seung Tak's medical skills?

480
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,080
Can you accept it?

481
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,340
It was major surgery, over 12 hours.

482
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,110
It's a patient of Professor Cha's.

483
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,250
These days, Go Seung Tak's been performing operations

484
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,980
that even professors generally find difficult.

485
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,890
There are also types of surgery that only Professor Cha Yeong Min can perform.

486
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,190
If I'm wrong about this,

487
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,730
then how to explain Go Seung Tak's medical skills?

488
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,170
The pericardium is thickening. Deal with the stasis.

489

Take two black lines.

would we be living like this now?

I'm doing leg exercises.

Thoracic surgery requires physical strength. Don't you know?

I can't believe you look like a doctor now.

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,530
You've been very active lately. I hear compliments about you all the time.

503
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,500
It's the first year.

504
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,070
Compliments?

505
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,900
Oh. Surgery?

506
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,840
I didn't do that. The professors did that.

507
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,710
I'm just an assistant.

508
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,680
I'm busy. I'm gonna go.

509
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,810
A first-year doctor, after all.

510
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:13,980
I remember that illness you had when you were a kid.

511
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,190
Do you still see strange things now?

512
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,960
Strange things? What strange things?

513
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,600
You can see Professor Cha's ghost. Am I right?

514
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,470
You were possessed by Professor Cha Yeong Min and then operated on...

515
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,700
No way.

516
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,580
The Vice President of Administration is more relaxed than expected.

517
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,840
Going around saying things that don't make sense.

518
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,650
I hear Professor Cha's getting better.

519
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,250
So what? Are you scared?

520
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,220
After all, you've done a crime. It's natural to be scared.

521
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,390
Do you have any proof?

522
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,330
You…

523
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,600
Brother, your restless mind

524
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,860
is calculating

525
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,570
whether Cha Yeong Min waking up is a blessing or a curse.

526
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,870
Go Seung Tak.

527
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,800
You have to pray for him to wake up.

528
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,770
So, the punishment can be reduced.

529
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,870
But the truth will not be buried.

531
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,790
During his first dissection,

532
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,830
he ran out without touching the scalpel once.

533
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,230
He made excuses and left

534
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,060
in every dissection.

535
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,800
His peers were talking about him.

536
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,100
They said he was a professor in theoretical knowledge

537
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,900
and a pupil in practice.

538
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,780
Go Seung Tak, what are you doing?

539
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,590
Lee Seon Ho, you'll be the first assistant.

540
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,030
Cut.

541

Cut.

542

Was it you that night?

543
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,640
Were you in my dream?

544
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,380
I heard you singing.

545
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,690
That's our

546
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,920
favorite song.

547
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,640
Just the two of us know that.

548
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,250
Doctor, here I am again.

549
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,360
It's warm soup today.

550
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,190
Western-style.

551
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,830
Why…

552
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,780
Why do you drink hot soup every day?

553
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,780
We agreed to have beef today.

554
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,950
I took you out for dinner and wanted to order something nutritious.

555
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,980
Why soup again?

556
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,590
A doctor needs a warm heart.

557
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,590
For me, hot soup makes me feel warm.

558
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,430
It's kind of a soul food.

559
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,000
What soul food?

560
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,070
Wow, that's really refreshing.

561
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,740
Uncle, why don't you go somewhere else to neutralize drink?

562
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,270
Speaking of drink,

563
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,300
why don't we order a bottle of soju?

564
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,340
Auntie.

565
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,310
Soju?

566
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,810
You can't even drink a glass of beer.

567
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,040
We want a bottle of soju.

568
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,610
No, we don't.

569
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,820
Eat more meat instead of soup.

570
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,680
Boiled pork slices.

571
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,650
Auntie, we'd like the boiled pork slices.

(EunSang University Medical Center)

573
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,030
Did you get enough sleep? Did you sleep well?

574
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,240
What's going on? Why didn't you come in?

575
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,340
I was afraid you'd wake up if I went in.

576
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,640
So, I'm waiting for you here.

577
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,110
I want you to relax and get some sleep.

578
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,010
What's going on? There's always something fishy about that.

579
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,280
There's no surgery today.

580
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,050
You need a good rest.

581
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,420
You were already weak.

582
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,380
A fragile creature.

583
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,590
Are you afraid I'm gonna die?

584
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,460
Well, then wake up soon.

585
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,260
Did you wind down again so soon?

We don't have time to rest right now.

If you insist,

588
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,400
then let's go to work.

589

It's not about the living.

I have a favor to ask of you.

593

Take good care of my friends.

It's Bergeson.

632
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,960
PhD?

633
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,560
No wonder there are so many books.

634
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,530
Do you remember the consultation in the intensive care unit

on your first day at work?

636
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,600
To miss the one that's still alive

637
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,930
in order to save the one that's already dead?

638

What a great life is it?

639

Trying so hard to save it.

640
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,410
When it's time to go, be cool to leave.

641

And as I said before, it's over.

642
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,710
Give up when there's no hope.

643
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,010
So am I.

644

I'm struggling here.

646
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,420
I agree with that idea.

647
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,350
What?

648
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:04,990
I looked at it and realized

649
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,360
it wasn't just about saving the living.

650
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,960
Make them turn over a new leaf.

651
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,460
That's what it's all about.

652
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,400
It doesn't have to be that way.

653
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,630
OK, cool.

654
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,200
We are now operating on both sides.

655
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,570
We need to attack both the living and the dead.

656
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,770
Wait.

657
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,610
You said "turn over a new leaf"? What's wrong with me?

658
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,140
Wait.

659

She staggered as she got up from lack of sleep

661
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,520
and hit her head on the table.

662
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,820
Then?

663
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,120
Radiologic examination

664
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,420
shows no fracture or bleeding.

665
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,160
She was expected to wake up soon,

666
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,490
but

667
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,160
she didn't, and she got worse and worse.

668
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,930
And then she was like that.

669
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,230
You don't know why.

670
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,970
That…

671
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,640
We did a lot of CT, MRI

672
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,740
and stress tests.

673
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,040
But we still can't figure it out.

674
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,180
Why are you asking this patient out of the blue?

675
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,410
Is she your friend?

676
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,810
Will it be better for her if she is?

677
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,280
OK, she's my friend.

678
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,380
Please lend me this one.

679
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,650
So, after working on a paper all night,

680
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,290
you passed out when you got up.

681
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,290
Anything else? Didn't any of the food

682
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,420
or medication you took before that

683
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,890
cause any discomfort?

684
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,960
You can say whatever you remember.

685
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,230
I had a nosebleed shortly before that.

686
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,230
Nosebleed?

687
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,570
I often get nosebleeds.

688
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:28,540
But that day, it didn't stop.

689
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,670
I just covered it up with a tissue. I got up

690
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,780
and passed out.

691
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,010
What is it this time?

692
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,650
As you can see, this is the patient's chart.

693
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,720
She had a traumatic brain injury, but the tests showed no bleeding or fractures.

694
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,560
Why didn't she wake up for three months?

695
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,190
Why did you give this to me?

696
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,860
Because Dr. Jang is the person

697
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,530
I trust and respect the most in this hospital.

698
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,660
You can't do that.

699
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,530
Don't play tricks.

700
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,670
What?

701
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,070
She had a nosebleed before she fainted. A lot of nosebleeds.

702
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,200
I think

703
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:02,870
it's an infection.

704
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,370
Right.

705
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,910
She has an underlying disease. Confirm it.

706
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,280
What does that mean?

707
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,910
The patient had a nosebleed before fainting.

708
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,450
She had a lot of nosebleeds, and she usually gets nosebleeds.

709
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,780
The underlying disease in this patient is HHT.

710
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,120
Frequent nosebleeds in this condition…

711
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,290
can be an infection of the central nervous system.

712
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,130
OK. Do me a favor.

713
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:27,830
I'm gonna go.

714
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,170
What do we do next?

715
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,130
Dr. Go.

716
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,370
He said the last thing to me.

717
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,840
Don't get it wrong. Do me a favor, too.

718
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,700
Come here.

719
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,570
Who told you to look at her like that? Don't play tricks.

720
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,740
Go Seung Tak.

721
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,940
Who are you playing tricks with? What's with that look in your eyes?

722
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,520
Professor Jang, what's going on with you?

723
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,830
Why are you examining patients without my permission?

724
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,000
Aren't there any rules at work in America?

725
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,640
Professor, you didn't do a spinal cord exam.

726
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,070
What?

727
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,610
Why do we need that test?

728
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,740
I heard the patient had a nosebleed before she fainted.

729
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,540
You seem to have completely ignored the possibility of an infection.

730
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,010
(HHT disease is a genetic blood vessel disorder)

731
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,780
Not to mention that this patient has underlying HHT disease.
(HHT disease is a genetic blood vessel disorder)

732
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,150
What are you talking about? Nosebleed?

733
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,950
Who said that? I haven't heard that before.

734
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,060
After she collapsed, her mother found out that very late.

735
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,060
No one had seen her nosebleed.

736
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,730
She was unconscious. She can't talk.

737
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,000
How did you know that?

738
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,930
Now that we know,

739
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,930
let's see what the tests show, and then we can start antibiotics.

740
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,950
Okay, I'll be there now.

741
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,590
What's the matter?

742
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,460
Who is she? Why did she look at him with that look of attachment?

743
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:40,900
It's Dr. Jang Se Jin, the new neurosurgeon.

744
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,870
I heard that she was also Professor Cha Yeong Min's attending physician.

745
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,970
Professor Cha's attending physician?

746
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,550
Professor Jang.

747
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,370
Are you working hard?

748
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,440
Ah. Crystal.
(Note: Su Jeong is pronounced same as "crystal" in Korean)

749
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,410
Don't hit me with your hands. Give me a prize.

750
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,340
What prize? Come here and treat the patient.

751
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,710
Please take this off for me.

752
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,280
Take it off yourself.

753
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,980
I'm sweating a lot.

754
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,680
Oh, really.

755
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,150
Oh my god.

756
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,290
(No Entry & No Exit)

757
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:40,920
There must be something going on between Go Seung Tak and O Su Jeong.
(No Entry & No Exit)

758
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,460
There must be something going on between Go Seung Tak and O Su Jeong.

759
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,060
Go Seung Tak will come whenever he has time.

760
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,930
O Su Jeong called him whenever she could.

761
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,270
Ah. I can't take this off.

762
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,000
Really…

763
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,210
Where did he go?

764
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,780
Are you looking for someone?

765
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,090
No one. What's wrong?

766
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,960
Are you looking for someone?

767
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,530
I think I was looking for you.

768
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,060
This is how we wanted to meet.

769
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,730
I thought about what you said yesterday.

770
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,170
Yesterday?

771
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,470
What did I say?

772
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:25,770
You don't remember?

773
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,000
In front of the Operating Room.

774
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,240
Did we meet there?

775
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,980
What did I say when we met?

776
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,080
I guess I didn't ask you to give me a treat.

777
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,520
You really don't remember anything about that?

778
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,390
I have been terribly busy these days.

779
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,660
Let me think about it.

780
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,960
I seem to be recalling something.

781
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,460
See? Duty always calls. How can I think straight?

782
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:03,310
Anyway, have you thought it through, cousin?

783
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,110
What are you talking about?

784
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,810
I mean whether you think it's all right for Professor Cha to wake up.

785
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,450
With restlessness in heart, make a deep self-examination.

786
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,220
You are running out of time.

787
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,250
I am leaving.

788
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,620
I have been so busy.

789
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,690
He has been doing useful things these days.

790
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,140
That boy is playing games with me.

791
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,270
Why does Cha Yeong Min possess Go Seung Tak?

792
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,880
Such nonsense made me…

793
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,650
I lost my mind briefly because of you.

794
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:46,880
Forget about me.

795
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,450
You can't work in this hospital anymore if you keep saying that.

796
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,120
Got it?

797
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,320
What made you talk the bollocks?

798
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,630
I will prove it to you.

799
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:06,970
What will you prove?

800
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,340
(To be played in 60 seconds)
What will you prove?

801
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,370
I will prove that Go Seung Tak is Cha Yeong Min.
(To be played in 60 seconds)

802
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,110
I'll show you I'm right.

803
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,750
(EunSang University Medical Center)

804
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,250
What did you say?
(EunSang University Medical Center)

805
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,420
What are you going to do?

806
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,150
The external ventricular drainage.

807
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,620
(EVD: External ventricular drainage)
The external ventricular drainage.

808
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,860
Since the antibiotic treatment didn't work,
(EVD: External ventricular drainage)

809
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,720
Since the antibiotic treatment didn't work,

810
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,860
I suggest injecting the antibiotic into the brain directly.

811
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,390
Also, the dose will be increased.

812
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:37,530
I think colistin sulfate will be more potent than vancomycin and meropenem.

813
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,500
You don't know that's the last resort?

814
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,400
Besides, it will put the patient in danger easily.

815
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,870
Now the patient's vital signs are stable, right?

816
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,940
What if you give the patient colistin sulfate

817
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,280
and the patient gets worse?

818
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,580
Do you know any other way?

819
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,350
Because there is no other way, I have to give it a try.

820
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,910
I will take care of the patient.

821
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,120
Professor Jang!

822
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,720
Actually, Dr. Go Seung Tak entrusted me with the patient.

823
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,990
Dr. Go?

824
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,460
So they are really friends?

825
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,230
Please schedule the surgery.

826
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,330
I will explain to her guardian.

827
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,560
Are you sure?

828
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,600
Doctor, can Chun Hui come round if she has the surgery?

829
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,570
We'll know for sure only after we give her the postsurgical antibiotic treatment.

830
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,910
Though it's a bit risky,

831
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:17,110

This is Professor Cha's patient, right?
