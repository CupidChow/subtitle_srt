1
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,580
(Note: The character Hyeong Gil is written as Hoon Gil)

2
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,500
Make it wider.

3
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,400
Retractor.

4
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,880
Are… Are you okay, Go Seung Tak?

5
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,760
Give me another retractor.

6
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,009
What's wrong with him?

7
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,340
You got me. He's never been like this.

8
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,890
Get ready to remove.

9
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,400
Done.

10
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,700
The old catheter has been removed.

11
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,540
Now we need to drill a hole and connect it to pulmonary artery.

12
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,110
The key to this operation

13
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,210
is to locate the right ventricle to the catheter.

14
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,080
Here.

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,650
You need to find it without touching the internal and external arteries on the left.

16
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,720
What?

17
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,390
It's not what you said before.

18
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,690
Professor, you can do this, right?

19
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,200
Um, yes… sure.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
I can do this…

21
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,300
Scalpel.

22
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,079
Then drill a hole around here...

23
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,380
To the right a little. A little more.

24
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,880
Yes. Right there. Good.

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,260
Professor Bang will do it personally?

26
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,090
Oh, of course.

27
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,560
The operation should be performed by the chief surgeon.

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,530
Right, President?

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,770
Give me another one.

30
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,670
That, too.

31
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,150
The hole is drilled.

32
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,820
And now is the most important step, connecting the catheter.

33
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,230
Seung Jo, you know who I am, right?

34
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,500
I promise I'll let you see your mom again.

35
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,110
Suture pliers.

36
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,750
I've never done this kind of operation on a kid.

37
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,780
Hold on. Sew it up at here.

38
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,250
Give me the suture pliers.

39
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,590
(Episode 11)

40
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,730
Where's Seung Jo? Is he gone?

41
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,330
Seung Jo… He's coming.

42
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,070
Doctor.

43
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,870
He said he should be clean when he sees his mom,

44
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,710
so he went to wash his face.

45
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,150
What? You two failed in saving the kid's life again?

46
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,360
The operation went very well.

47
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,990
He should be gone by now.

48
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,290
He should've returned to his body.

49
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,930
Why didn't he? Was there any problem?

50
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,490
I've never seen you like this before.

51
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,560
Like what?

52
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,330
So restless after an operation.

53
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,770
All I've got used to seeing your conceited face.

54
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,100
It was the right place for connecting the catheter.

55
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,270
It pressed against neither the coronary artery

56
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,970
nor the main artery.

57
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,040
You also saw that, right?

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,970
His vital signs are stable.

59
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,440
What's the problem then?

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,040
The operation was just over.

61
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,280
It'd take some time for him to regain his consciousness.

62
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,780
I'll keep an eye on Seung Jo over there.

63
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,650
And you can take care of this Seung Jo.

64
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,520
Don't worry.

65
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,510
Hey, Go Seung Tak, I heard the operation went smoothly.

66
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,950
Does it mean our mission is accomplished?

67
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,880
How is he doing?

68
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,180
Blood pressure, 110 / 70, pulse is 90,

69
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,250
CVP is 6.

70
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,180
(CVP Central venous pressure)
CVP is 6.

71
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,150
Everything is fine.
(CVP Central venous pressure)

72
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,620
So the operation was successful.

73
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,390
Why? Is there anything we should be worried about?

74
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,260
Well, there's nothing to worry.

75
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,990
He should wake up soon. Very soon.

76
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,530
But it's still too early to be overconfident.

77
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,960
Though the operation went well,

78
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,830
it's still hard to say when he'll wake up.

79
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,030
Then forget about "over", just be confident.

80
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,170
That guy… Oh, no.

81
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,740
Just trust me. Don't you know who I am?

82
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,270
Of course, I know who you are.

83
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,110
Please keep an eye on him.

84
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,840
Call me if there's anything.

85
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,110
Thank you, buddy.

86
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,650
My hands trembled, right in the middle of an operation!

87
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,090
Has this happened to you before, Jeo?

88
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,720
Never.

89
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
Then why did it happen to me?

90
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,860
How would I know?

91
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,290
It could be God's will.

92
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,860
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

93
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,400
Neither am I.

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,930
And I cannot tell you even if I know.

95
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,530
What if my guess is wrong?

96
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,800
There's a lot of fake news these days.

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,300
And…

98
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,670
are the sleeves too short?

99
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,840
Should I fix them?

100
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,280
Why does he always have trouble?

101
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,220
I thought things would go well with him.

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,020
Is it because of that?

103
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
What's wrong?

104
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,140
What happened?

105
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,580
He said he wanted to get his mom a gift,

106
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,710
yet he chose all the things he likes.

107
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,020
I heard the operation went well. Why is he still here?

108
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,350
Even if the operation went well, it doesn't mean he'll be gone right away.

109
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,060
And there's no example anyway.

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,190
How could you say that in front of him?

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,960
Exactly. Someone doesn't look so happy.

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,770
Why are you all picking on me?

113
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,560
-Seung Jo. -Where's Seung Jo?

114
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,230
Seung Jo is doing well over there.

115
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,690
How about Seung Jo here? Hasn't he gone yet?

116
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,630
I shouldn't have operated.

117
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,059
I should've stopped.

118
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,530
Why do you say that?

119
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,799
Professor Cha! Professor Cha!

120
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,700
Professor Cha! Professor Cha! Professor Cha!

121
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,280
Doctor.

122
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,330
It's okay. Seung Jo will see mom soon.

123
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,500
Will you come with me?

124
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,600
I'll go visit you in the future.

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,240
You need to be strong even if you have to go by yourself.

126
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,650
You've washed your face. Don't cry.

127
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,620
Be happy when you see mom.

128
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,390
I'll be with you very soon.

129
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,530
We'll meet in a new way soon.

130
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,630
It's my turn this time. I'll be there first.

131
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,530
The two of them

132
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,730
finally made it.

133
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,510
Seung Jo… Seung Jo…

134
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,350
What? What's wrong?

135
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,650
Has Seung Jo woken up?

136
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,390
Not yet.

137
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,290
Seung Jo, are you awake?

138
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,730
Can you see me?

139
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,260
Do you know who I am?

140
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,630
Great.

141
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,930
Wow, Go Seung Tak.

142
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,540
You said so confidently that Seung Jo would wake up soon.

143
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,100
I didn't expect you to be serious.

144
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,310
Surely I was serious. I did the surgery, okay?

145
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,140
Didn't I tell you

146
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,310
that we could succeed?

147
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,480
Oh, I have such a great brain.

148
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,080
No… It should be my hands.

149
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,510
They should take the credit.

150
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,650
Look, my hands really did a great thing.

151
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,480
Stop showing off.

152
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,450
Oh, right.

153
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,720
I'll get his mother here.

154
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,320
Hi, Seung Jo.

155
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,030
Welcome back to the real world.

156
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,460
You know who I am, right?

157
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,630
Seung Jo, maybe…

158
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,540
Can you still see me?

159
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,840
I'm the only one he can see

160
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,980
and the only one who can touch his hands.

161
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,680
So what?

162
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,150
You're very happy, aren't you?

163
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,760
Are you so glad that he can only see you?

164
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,820
Have you started drinking recently?

165
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,750
No, I don't drink at all.

166
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,820
Or have you been overdoing any exercise?

167
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,360
No, I never exercise.

168
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,560
Follow me and do this.

169
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,160
Why do you suddenly let me do this…?

170
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,000
Go Seung Tak.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,270
Take good care of your body in the future.

172
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,800
Is it worth showing off not to do sports?

173
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
Are you a deaf man?

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've told you so many times

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,570
that thoracic surgery requires physical strength.

176
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,840
Especially your powerful hands to be proud of.

177
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,110
Don't you know that our hands are our life?

178
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,920
In other words, patients' lives are in your hands.

179
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Even a slight mistake

180
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,620
can put a patient's life in danger, in particular in the OR.

181
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,020
What happened in the operating room?

182
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,860
Right…

183
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,370
Why am I telling you this?

184
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,670
You're not the one who operates anyway.

185
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,240
So…

186
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,140
Are you happy?

187
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,310
Take sleep and wake up to find that the operation is over.

188
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,150
You must be happy to see a patient survive, right?

189
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,880
Another person operates for you

190
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,450
and then you can show off.

191
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,650
You must be happy, right?

192
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,850
Sure…

193
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,620
You are the only one they can see

194
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,290
and the only one who can touch them.

195
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,490
But I am just an invisible man.

196
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,560
There's nothing I can do about anything.

197
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,100
I can do nothing alone.

198
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,400
Only through your hands,

199
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I can do a little…

200
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,970
I wish I could do even a little thing myself.

201
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,440
So listen up.

202
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,610
Try to do some exercise.

203
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,750
Take magnesium supplements on time.

204
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,250
Do you hear me?

205
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,090
Do what I just said.

206
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,310
Alas…

207
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,110
It's time for him to get mad.

208
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,380
The tougher one looks,

209
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,680
the more grief and sorrow he has on the inside.

210
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,190
He has been repressing himself for long.

211
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,520
Unexpectedly, the little boy broke him down.

212
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,590
You…

213
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,050
Why are you still here like this…

214
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,850
Can't you have a good rest

215
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,350
or go outside for fresh air?

216
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,690
Get outside and take a break.

217
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,830
Today is the weekend.

218
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,740
Why are you being so stubborn?

219
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,650
When will you stop being like this?

220
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,890
Please.

221
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,120
Please, Se Jin.

222
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,560
I'm begging you.

223
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,000
When will you stop being like this?

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
Hello. Patient Lee Ji Woo?

225
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I'll be right there.

226
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,890
Get up.

227
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,670
Wake up now.

228
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,140
Don't lie here like this. Please wake up.

229
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,970
Come on, wake up.

230
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,850
When will things get better?

231
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,080
Okay, enough.

232
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,720
It's enough. Get up!

233
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,190
Get up now!

234
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,090
It's time to wake up.

235
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,530
How many more people do you want to suffer for you?

236
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,830
Wake up!

237
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,830
Please.

238
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,370
It's enough…

239
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,079
Yes, what's wrong?

240
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,910
It's said the boy is having surgery today.

241
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,710
Is it over?

242
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,020
How did it go?

243
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,720
It's over. The operation was successful.

244
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,050
The patient has just woken up.

245
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,190
Really?

246
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,619
Great!

247
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,460
But why do you sound so depressed?

248
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,590
Shouldn't you be dancing with joy?

249
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,430
Yeah.

250
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,500
I was happy until just now.

251
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,530
What's wrong? Anything happened?

252
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,030
It's all right…

253
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm just a little tired.

254
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,900
Why are you tired? You did nothing.

255
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,870
The operation…

256
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,910
was done by Professor Cha.

257
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,780
Anyway, it's good news.

258
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,020
Take a break, Go Seung Tak.

259
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,560
Right, I did nothing.

260
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,160
Ma'am.

261
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,830
Did you just get off work?

262
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,330
Yes, what's the matter?

263
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,100
The boy had surgery today.

264
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,100
It was successful.

265
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,240
He has woken up.

266
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,710
You must be happy to hear it.

267
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,640
What?

268
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,080
At that point, a tragedy might have happened if it were a little late.

269
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,640
Thank you for finding him in time.

270
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,510
It's such a silver lining.

271
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,410
It was you who saved the kid's life.

272
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,850
Thank you very much.

273
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,380
Me?

274
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,890
I don't understand what you said at all…

275
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,920
You told me that a kid fainted on the ground

276
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,460
and asked me to have a look.

277
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,790
I think you have the wrong person.

278
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,860
I may miss the bus… Goodbye.

279
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,370
It's true.

280
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,810
The background activities

281
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,240
are better than the previous EEG.

282
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,650
Isn't it surprising?

283
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,980
Do you remember the case from three years ago?

284
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,820
The patient who was thought to be releasing the happy hormone we didn't know.

285
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,850
(Neurosurgery Department Choi * Su)
The patient who was thought to be releasing the happy hormone we didn't know.

286
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,990
The patient who was thought to be releasing the happy hormone we didn't know.

287
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,660
How long did it take the patient to wake up?

288
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,630
Oh, that's right.

289
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,430
This patient will wake up faster.

290
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,430
I'm sure he will.

291
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,400
Michael, I'll call you later.

292
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,980
You came again.

293
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,040
You always come without telling me in advance.

294
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,980
I didn't find you in the ward.

295
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,080
I've been here for a while.

296
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,750
You were on the phone so you didn't see me.

297
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,790
I'm here to ask if Professor Cha is getting better.

298
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,390
I think I've heard the answer.

299
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,920
As you just heard,

300
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,620
Professor Cha's EEG is doing better markedly.

301
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,160
Now that his EEG has improved,

302
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,890
why hasn't he woken up?

303
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,530
Normally doctors don't believe in miracles.

304
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,700
You mean…

305
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,300
Does it take a miracle for him to wake up?

306
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,940
But some cases I met with occasionally

307
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,010
make me feel that there are unknown areas that humankind can't get in.

308
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,040
Even if 99% of a miracle relies on God's will,

309
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm convinced that the remaining 1% requires people's will and sincerity.

310
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,250
Dr. Jang, you are doing your best.

311
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,250
So is Professor Cha.

312
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,230
Sometimes I have this idea.

313
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,560
Maybe he's taking revenge on me this way.

314
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,830
That's why he has built a wall and keeps everyone away from him.

315
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,340
Um, it's not true.

316
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,970
He will get pissed off if he hears it.

317
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,610
He's now in a hurry

318
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,240
to smash through all the walls and get to you.

319
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,540
It's not like what you said.

320
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,410
I can guarantee that.

321
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,380
Why are you so sure?

322
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,920
How can you guarantee that?

323
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,120
What?

324
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,320
You've said it many times.

325
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,990
As if you were him.

326
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,290
Isn't your department busy?

327
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,800
Thank you for being so worried about him.

328
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,270
But you come here several times a day.

329
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,270
Don't you think it's a little too frequent?

330
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,540
If you trust me as his attending physician,

331
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,610
please focus more on your own patients.

332
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,640
It's both a ward and my research room.

333
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,210
I hope in the future you come only when necessary.

334
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,820
Of course, including Secretary Gim.

335
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,490
I think you understand what I mean, right?

336
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,960
What happened?

337
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,670
Why was I attacked in succession?

338
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,100
Have I done something wrong in front of her?

339
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,170
Why did she build walls against me suddenly?

340
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,540
Walls?

341
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,080
That is to say,

342
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,560
there is a man who makes you feel like he's your ex.

343
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,460
Like his words, behaviors, and occasional looks.

344
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,790
He even seems to know

345
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,560
some of your preferences only known to your ex

346
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,100
and the memories from the past of you two.

347
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,270
Am I being too sensitive?

348
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,640
Such cases often appear.

349
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,910
It usually happens to someone who goes through difficult times with us.

350
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,410
Especially when this person is close to the one we care about.

351
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,550
Then we will project our emotions on this person.

352
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,610
Without knowing it,

353
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,880
we may start to rely on this person.

354
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,720
Have you been through a series of events recently

355
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,050
so that you get tired physically and mentally?

356
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,160
If so, it's natural for you

357
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,520
to add meaning to some trivial things

358
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,360
and sometimes even magnify them.

359
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,160
If that's the case…

360
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,170
You might as well keep your distance.

361
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,270
By doing so,

362
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,510
you will be able to quietly feel your heart

363
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,880
and examine the reality calmly.

364
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,380
Walls…

365
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,650
Walls.

366
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,630
In the sound of fallen leaves one day,

367
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,770
I looked through my suddenly empty heart.

368
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,080
Seung Jo came and left. I feel so lost.

369
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,680
Wasn't it said to be three hours yesterday?

370
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,950
But he was just so disobedient.

371
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,790
Kids are all the same.

372
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,020
My son was naughtier at his age.

373
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,160
Do you have a son?

374
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,200
What…? Can't I have a son?

375
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,330
My son, Jin Yeong, must have grown up a lot.

376
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,140
Have we lost it?

377
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,780
Is it too late?

378
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,920
Does the old guy do it on purpose?

379
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,390
Can't he make himself look more graceful?

380
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,960
As long as

381
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,290
we can find the passing years.

382
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,360
You shouldn't have put up with him.

383
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,630
Just call the police.

384
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,070
He's taking the initiative to talk to us now.

385
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,600
What kind of life did he have on earth?

386
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,010
I really live like a fool.

387
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,710
Does anyone of you know

388
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,180
his job when he was still alive?

389
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,410
Ah, well…

390
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,110
I've never asked him.

391
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,750
Why do you want to dig into his past?

392
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,980
What did Jeo do when he was alive?

393
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,390
... like a fool, like a fool.

394
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,190
(EunSang University Medical Center)
... like a fool, like a fool.

395
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,690
Like a fool.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

396
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,690
(EunSang University Medical Center)

397
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,660
Ooh, what's this?
(EunSang University Medical Center)

398
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,530
What a ridiculous notice!

399
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,700
What's the matter?

400
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,240
(Notice on Temporary Suspension of Subsidy for the Thoracic Surgery Department)

401
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,270
It must be a mistake.
(Notice on Temporary Suspension of Subsidy for the Thoracic Surgery Department)

402
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,210
(Notice on Temporary Suspension of Subsidy for the Thoracic Surgery Department
Notice
Dear colleagues of the Thoracic Surgery Department,
Thank you for your continued efforts at work.
We are sorry to tell you that due to the issues we are facing, EunSang University Medical Center is having trouble in operating. We'll temporarily suspend the subsidy for the Thoracic Surgery Department. Thank you for your understanding. We'll notify you when the subsidy is reissued. For details, please contact the Admin Office.
Thank you!)
It must be a mistake.

403
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,380
Why is our department's medical outlay this month cut?

404
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,480
The hospital is not in a very good state recently.

405
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,250
We plan to tighten the financial expenditure.

406
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,880
But that doesn't cost a lot.

407
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,280
No matter how much it costs,

408
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,920
don't you know that many a little makes a mickle?

409
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,620
Isn't it more for show than for real?

410
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,560
Hey.

411
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,690
I need to keep my authority and face.

412
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,830
I can't let my doctors cooperate to go against me again.

413
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,600
Your department is just the beginning.

414
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,670
Just wait for more.

415
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,140
Cousin, you were not like this in the past.

416
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,370
No.

417
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,310
In fact, you were also narrow-minded before.

418
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,210
It's been years.

419
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,710
Why do you put it so sincerely?

420
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,710
I've told you to wait.

421
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,580
I'll cut more budget and expand the scale.

422
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,190
Oh, Professor Cha.

423
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,060
Look how scared you are.

424
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,890
Didn't you say that you got prepared?

425
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,100
It wasn't your doctors who did it.

426
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,730
Don't stop them from doing surgery.

427
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,300
Do you know why Cha Yeong Min wants to do surgery so much?

428
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,100
You can't understand it even if I tell you.

429
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,440
If you could, you wouldn't have put our patients at risk.

430
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,980
I'm leaving.

431
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,750
I haven't swiped my credit card enough this month.

432
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,780
That black card.

433
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,480
How much is our department's outlay?

434
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
Hello.

435
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,130
Which floor and ward?

436
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,530
Are you sure?

437
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,000
Jang Min Ho is here.

438
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,240
Do you two have an appointment?

439
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,480
He's not walking towards your office.

440
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,510
If he's not here for me, then who?

441
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,510
Never mind. Let him be.

442
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,150
Maybe he came for another business.

443
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,920
What's this guy up to this time?

444
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,130
Hello, Hoon Gil.

445
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,730
Isn't he the son of President Jang?

446
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,960
Why is he here?

447
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,730
Where does this jerk think this place is?

448
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,830
How dare he still come? Darn it.

449
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,600
The ninth floor.

450
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,370
What's on the ninth floor?

451
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,380
It's a thank-you gift, not a bribe.

452
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,220
Thank you for finding Seung Jo in time.

453
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,390
I've told you it wasn't me.

454
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,450
But I did help a little.

455
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,420
Now that you took my gift,

456
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,120
how about helping me solve a problem?

457
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,360
You know the wall, right?

458
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,090
Wall, what wall?

459
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,230
A cliff, a rampart, or a concrete wall?

460
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,300
Go on.

461
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,930
It's better to be something invisible to the naked eye.

462
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,370
For example, in medicine.

463
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,270
The outer vessel wall, inner vessel wall,

464
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,840
abdominal wall, chest wall…

465
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,010
Why?

466
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,110
Why do you ask this?

467
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,140
The 1% that can contribute to a miracle.

468
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,010
What are you saying?

469
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,450
What a romantic scene!

470
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,750
What good doctors you are!

471
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,860
Even wandering between life and death,

472
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,560
you can still find time to date?

473
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,260
Hey, keep going. Finish your words.

474
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,630
Be more specific.

475
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,400
But now I really want to punch someone…

476
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,700
Ah, that's when you want to smash the wall.

477
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,300
Wall.

478
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,900
That jerk is here.

479
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,340
The son of President Jang.

480
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,710
I saw him go to the ninth floor.

481
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,680
Dr. Jang.

482
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,980
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

483
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,950
What's wrong with him?

484
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,380
Has that person come again?

485
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,720
Hello.

486
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,520
Hello?

487
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,990
Hello?

488
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,690
Maybe I'm wrong.

489
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,600
Dr. Jang.

490
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,140
Yeong Min. Time to eat.

491
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,620
You used to remind me to eat every day.

492
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,990
Do you know that I delayed my meals on purpose

493
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,090
so I could eat with you?

494
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,760
I haven't eaten yet.

495
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,400
What?

496
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,360
You haven't eaten yet?

497
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,500
Why? It's so late already!

498
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,570
Have some meat.

499
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,040
Don't drink soup all the time.

500
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,400
Oh, that's so refreshing.

501
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,070
Wow, the soup.

502
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,180
You must be sick of this. It doesn't taste good.

503
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,010
So, you'd better wake up soon.

504
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,950
When you wake up, I'll take you to something delicious.

505
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,020
Wow.

506
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,960
So, this is where you live.

507
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,860
What's going on?

508
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,370
What are you doing here?

509
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,540
Oh, Professor Cha.

510
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,900
Go out!

511
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,570
Let's talk outside.

512
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,740
It's not like I don't know him.

513
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,780
I have to say hello.

514
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,910
What are you doing here? You jerk!

515
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,890
Oh, Professor Cha.

516
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,390
What is this? Is it meal time?

517
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,060
It looks like you're eating regular meals.

518
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,730
You look good.

519
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,160
Didn't you hear me tell you to go out?

520
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,730
The proud Jang Se Jin is feeding porridge to this kind of people here.

521
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,640
How come you haven't changed at all from 11 years ago?

522
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,640
How could I not be interested in this guy?

523
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,210
He means the whole world to you.

524
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,810
Hey.

525
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,910
Did he know that?

526
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,250
You went to America because someone

527
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,080
threatened you with him.

528
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,330
Why ninth floor?

529
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,070
I remember what I said back then.

530
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,200
"If you don't want to see his promising career go down the drain,

531
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,340
you're gonna leave Korea."

532
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,540
Did he know about it?

533
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,780
Get out of here before I call someone. Get out now.

534
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,810
Let me see.

535
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,650
Was that hand

536
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,750
left or right?

537
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,390
What are you doing?

538
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,170
Who are you? Don't touch my hand.

539
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,340
Don't touch my hand.

540
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,410
Don't.

541
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,540
No. No. No.

542
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,150
This is all for today.

543
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,490
I hope we'll never meet again.

544
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,330
As a doctor, you need to protect your hands.

545
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,040
What should I use this time?

546
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,480
His hands are useless now anyway.

547
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,150
Right.

548
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,850
Will you be good if he dies?

549
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,850
Do you want me to help you kill him?

550
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,290
Where are you going?

551
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,960
I haven't gotten to the point yet.

552
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,270
Application for restitution of share of estate.

553
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:17,270
It's not for you though.

554
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,740
You need to transfer it to me when you get it.

555
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,250
You're really funny.

556
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,010
What?

557
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,450
I have no intention of disobeying the President's will.

558
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,620
Even if I sigh it,

559
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,250
I'll transfer it to a passing dog over you.

560
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,320
Judging by what you've done,

561
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,990
you're worse than a dog.

562
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,730
You're not afraid of anything, are you?

563
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,990
That's right.

564
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,630
There's only one thing in the world I'm afraid of right now.

565
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,130
You're lucky I'm not afraid of you.

566
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,070
Get out quietly.

567
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,500
Do you want me to call police or a reporter for you?

568
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,340
-Come on. -Let go.

569
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,770
-Fingerprint. -No.

570
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,010
Press your finger.

571
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,740
Let me go.

572
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,810
No.

573
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,280
Don't do that.

574
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,080
Let go.

575
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,210
No. You jerk!

576
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,350
Let go.

577
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,120
Come on.

578
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,690
Who is he?

579
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,020
What a pain.

580
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,260
This is a family matter. Get out of here.

581
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,429
Press your finger.

582
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:08,830
No.

583
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,389
Press it.

584
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,199
Give me your hand.

585
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,370
You dog!

586
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,469
Can't you hear your father's soul crying?

587
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,139
Does someone like you count as a son?

588
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,810
If it weren't for the President's instructions, you'd be dead by now.

589
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,850
I can't believe you made threats.

590
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,650
Who do you think you are? How dare you threaten Se Jin?

591
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,679
How could you do that? You jerk!

592
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,590
Hey, are you crazy?

593
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,949
Oh.

594
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,889
Do you have two boyfriends?

595
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:43,530
Are you Jang Se Jin's lover?

596
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,860
Whatever.

597
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,330
Dr. Go.

598
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,239
How dare you hit me?

599
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,909
I'm gonna sue you.

600
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,080
What's going on?

601
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,590
Why did you take me out of there?

602
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,590
I was the one who got beaten up.

603
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,260
Are you already on their side?

604
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,190
Do you take the girl's side?

605
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,230
What do you take me for?

606
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,600
You're in the hospital. You just made a fool of yourself.

607
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,630
Why are you here?

608
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,400
Because

609
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm the only son in the family.

610
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,170
I can't just give up my property.

611
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,640
Do you think that girl will do nothing?

612
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,840
She will definitely pocket the money.

613
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,340
How could I let that happen?

614
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,740
So little money.

615
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,840
So little money?

616
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,910
You're always calculating. What's wrong with you?

617
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,240
Am I just doing this for my own good?

618
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,510
What you've been calculating is long gone.

619
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,820
And that's why Cha Yeong Min is...

620
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,220
Cha Yeong Min is what?

621
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,750
What does that mean?

622
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,220
You'll only think I'm crazy if I tell you.

623
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,190
Please don't come here again.

624
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,110
Mr. Han Seung Won. You can't do this to me.

625
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,810
You seem to forget that

626
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,040
I never laid a finger on the old man.

627
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,550
I did keep my mouth shut

628
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,680
and gently soothed everyone.

629
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,020
First, you helped them.

630
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,720
Then, you hit them.

631
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,620
Those were all your work.

632
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,030
And was it I who caused the accident of Professor Cha?

633
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,630
If you remember, then you have to work with me.

634
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,240
Since we started it together, we should end it together.

635
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,670
That's good for all of us.

636
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,940
Our game isn't over yet.

637
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,990
We don't have any cameras or bugs in here, do we?

638
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,620
What?

639
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,120
You always get here at the right time.

640
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,220
How did you know that?

641
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,630
Well…

642
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,630
Why risk your precious hand in such a trivial matter?

643
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,940
Don't you know that hands are a surgeon's life?

644
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,850
No, it's true.

645
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,950
Two drunks punched each other on my way here.

646
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,820
If you're drunk, go home and go to bed early.

647
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,390
They kept fighting.

648
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,900
It's true. My hand is fine.

649
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,300
The vessels are fine and nerves are intact.

650
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,600
Muscles are also fine.

651
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,440
Why risk your precious hand in such a trivial matter?

652
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,280
Don't you know that hands are a surgeon's life?

653
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,020
My life is

654
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,520
you, Se Jin.

655
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,050
You are far more important than these hands.

656
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,920
Do you know what you're talking about?

657
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,130
I say the doctor's hands are life,

658
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,330
because these hands are related to patients' lives.

659
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,560
If you're working with this mindset, you might as well quit right now.

660
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,330
Just quit.

661
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,530
I know, I know.

662
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,770
Oh, it hurts. Blow it for me.

663
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,540
Come on.

664
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,270
A doctor's hand should not look like this. It breaks my heart.

665
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,010
Why are you crying for this?

666
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,550
Don't cry. It's okay.

667
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,450
You had a deal with me.

668
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,180
You're a thoracic surgeon and I'm a neurosurgeon.

669
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,050
We should take care of our hands. And what did you do?

670
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,050
What rough hands you have.

671
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,090
Where's the hand cream I gave you?

672
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,390
Why don't you wear hand cream? Why?

673
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,760
Why are you crying?

674
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,330
Don't cry. I'm fine. Come on.

675
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,410
So... You knew everything then and there.

676
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,510
Why would you do that?

677
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,510
Why?

678
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,530
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

679
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,840
Misunderstanding?

680
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,870
So that wasn't you but Professor Cha?

681
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,940
Professor Cha was there too.

682
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,440
What about the guy who just ran out of the Emergency Room?

683
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,210
It was also... me.

684
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,780
Oh, was it?

685
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,380
Dr. Jang said a word, and you ran out like the wind.

686
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,220
(EunSang University Medical Center)
Dr. Jang said a word, and you ran out like the wind.

687
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,250
You reached out your hand and looked at her lovingly.

Dr. Jang said a word, and you ran out like the wind.

688
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,590
You reached out your hand and looked at her lovingly.

689
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,120
What were you going to give her?

690
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,630
I wasn't giving her anything.

691
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,960
Wait.

692
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,830
Don't tell me you're…

693
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,770
-No, why would I be jealous?
-… jeal…

694
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,370
I can't believe you're jealous.

695
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,940
If you weren't jealous, why would you observe what I did?

696
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,540
You need to get your mind right.

697
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,210
A doctor should care about the patients.

698
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,310
Why do you care about the guardian?

699
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,020
Well, of course that's wrong.

700
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
I will be good.

701
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,220
What is the relation between Professor Cha and Professor Jang?

702
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,930
Are they related to each other?

703
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,090
Well…

704
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,230
This is private for both of them.

705
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,230
What about Professor Cha and you?

706
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,470
Professor Cha and me?

707
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,370
Professor Cha can only possess you.

708
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,410
And you can only be possessed by him.

709
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,440
What's the relation between you two?

710
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
That can't be a coincidence.

711
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,210
Right.

712
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,410
Exactly.

713
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,820
It brings me to a quick question.

714
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,120
People might say I'm crazy. But why would you believe that?

715
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,120
I…

716
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,660
I saw something 20 years ago.

717
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,400
You should have told me. Why did you undertake it alone

718
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,040
and leave by yourself?

719
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,240
Why would you go all the way out there by yourself?

720
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,450
I should have beaten

721
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,920
Jang Min Ho to death.

722
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,820
I'm sorry I acted the way I did.

723
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,400
I shouldn't have left like that.

724
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,530
I miss you every day.

725
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,600
I know you hate me.

726
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,740
I know you don't want to forgive me.

727
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,940
I hope you get over me soon.

728
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,050
No.

729
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,780
I hope you don't forget me completely.

730
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,660
When we met again,

731
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,630
the way you looked at me looked painful.

732
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,300
But on the other hand, I feel happy.

733
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,540
You hate me,

734
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,810
but you're not over me.

735
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,810
Se Jin. That's not true.

736
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:22,620
It must be tough for you. You hate me so much,

737
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,890
and you can't forget me.

738
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,630
I can't believe I said the word "jealous".

739
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,170
What... I must be crazy.

740
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,070
I heard the baby woke up.

741
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,410
You scared me.

742
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,280
That's great.

743
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,320
Is it because the doctor and I worked together

744
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,750
that the baby woke up?

745
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,050
Yes.

746
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:05,260
I have a lot of respect for doctors for saving lives.

747
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,730
I kind of saved someone's life this time.

748
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,340
It's an honor to work in a hospital.

749
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,670
I'm going to work hard.

750
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,080
I am such a fool...

751
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,220
What's going on? Twins?

752
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,690
(EunSang University Medical Center)

753
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,200
I thought about it, and I think we should follow the rules.

754
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,570
The soul and the body should follow the rules.

755
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,510
What?

756
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,580
I know your body is getting better.

757
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,010
So?

758
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,280
It means that the power of the soul outside is weakened.

759
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,420
What happens when the power of the soul weakens?

760
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,890
Listen to me.

761
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,460
Possession means that

762
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,060
my soul goes into someone else's body

763
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,330
by driving out the original soul.

764
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,100
What happens when the power of the possessing soul is weakened?

765
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,140
Look at the two of you.

766
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,110
When the power of the possessing soul is weakened,

767
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,180
the soul and the body tend to separate.

768
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,990
How did you two get to be doctors

769
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,090
with your stupid brains?

770
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,160
Really.

771
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,130
Does that mean we can't perform surgeries anymore?

772
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,170
Do you still want to perform surgeries? Go ahead, then.

773
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,210
If you keep being naughty,

774
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,710
you'll get the living in trouble.

775
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,420
You've never listened to me.

776
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,460
Believe it or not.

777
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:19,030
I already told you. I'm gonna go.

778
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,250
It means that after the brain waves get better,

779
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,820
the soul gets weaker and then there's a delay in possession.

780
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,150
At that moment,

781
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,290
I had that visual residue in my head.

782
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,530
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

783
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,760
You didn't give me that chance.

784
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,060
It's just an old signal anyway.

785
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,030
Your brain waves are getting better.

786
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,040
But why am I not waking up?

787
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,940
I understand your urgent heart.

788
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,780
Just relax and enjoy some sweet latte these days.

789
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,680
Maybe yesterday…

790
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,580
Let's just be cautious and wait and see what happens.

791
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,020
So, are you happy?

792
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,660
Because you're the only one who saw it.

793
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,060
The surgery was done by someone else. You took credit for it.

794
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,630
So let's do not operate for a while.

795
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,860
I can't even I want to. Didn't you see this?

796
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,370
I can't go to the Operating Room with this injury.

797
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,900
It's not your body. You deliberately...

798
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,070
Because it's not your body, so you...

799
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,210
You should have a rest, too. It's been a hard time.

800
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,480
Rest? I need to work out and complement magnesium.

801
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,710
I've got a lot of work to do.

802
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,520
Life is always filled with this.

803
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,010
I haven't been this serious in a long time.

804
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,080
♫ I've been defeated and hurt ♫

805
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,720
♫ And I've suffered ♫

806
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,060
♫ Want to start over ♫

807
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,300
♫ My heart is full of hope again ♫

808
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,670
♫ After a long wait ♫

809
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,570
♫ And I start to run ♫

810
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,170
♫ I'm still far away ♫

811
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,640
Oh, the happy hormones.
♫ I'm still far away ♫

812
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,040
♫ You and I will find a way ♫
Oh, the happy hormones.

813
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,710
♫ You and I will find a way ♫

814
00:47:50,710 --> 00:48:00,760
♫ Hope I can get over the sadness and smile happily ♫

815
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,110
I'll have an iced Americano, lots of ice.

816
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,540
Oh, and I'll have a sweet latte, too.

817
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,180
A latte with double syrup.

818
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,320
I'll have an iced caramel macchiato.

819
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,320
I'd like hot chamomile tea.

820
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,560
You should eat on time. Why do you always skip meals?

821
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,660
I can't take care of you right now.

822
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,510
Can you smile? I want to see your smile.

823
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,050
Oh, what a nice room.

824
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,810
Look at the light.

825
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,950
What can I do for you?

826
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,420
Here comes your coffee.

827
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,020
The new guy wants you to drink this to replenish your strength.

828
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,620
Something about duck and dried radish…

829
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,430
It's not a sugar supplement.

830
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:14,830
Well…

831
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,630
I can't believe we haven't visited once.

832
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,640
We are so bad.

833
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,970
You're stable. Your vitals are good.

834
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,610
I thank you guys for being here,

835
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,440
but it's a tight space.

836
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,410
And she is still working.

837
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,850
I see. We're leaving.

838
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,750
She can't hear or see us. What does it matter?

839
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,690
Where did Bo Mi go?

840
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,030
She was right here. Where did she go?

841
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,460
Just like Seung Jo…

842
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,640
Professor Jang.

843
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,940
Here comes the doctor.

844
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:06,680
Doctor, Bo Mi seems to be waking up.

845
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,750
Miss, are you conscious?

846
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,920
Can you hear me?

847
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,960
Im Bo Mi.

848
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,230
The patient is conscious.

849
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:27,240
Can you see me?

850
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,040
Bo Mi woke up and you saved her.

851
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,280
Thank you, doctor.

852
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:42,720
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

853
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,660
Is the patient awake? Is she awake?

854
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,220
She woke up. Bo Mi woke up.

855
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,190
Bo Mi went in.

856
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,160
Yeah, she's in.

857
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:58,470
Welcome to the real world.

858
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:06,340
You're not alive. Why are you so happy?

859
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,910
It would be nice to have one of us alive rather than all dead.

860
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,680
How could you speak like that?

861
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,790
Watch your mouth. He's been very sensitive lately.

862
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,360
Let's go. It's time.

863
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,230
This guy keeps pretending.

864
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,730
Confession would be better while Bo Mi's around.

865
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,830
He has been suppressing his feelings. I go there with you.

866
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,010
Congratulations.

867
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:57,060
They come here at least three times every day.

868
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,630
Consultation time. Interview time...

869
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,160
But mostly it was a waste of time.

870
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,730
When I was a kid, I always came here first in the hospital.

871
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,540
That way I would know if I could see ghosts.

872
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:16,680
Sometimes there was one person.

873
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,610
Sometimes two people just sat there.

874
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,420
I always made a wish when I came to the hospital.

875
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,350
I wished I wouldn't see anyone.

876
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,890
But when I didn't see them, I was curious.

877
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,500
What happened to those guys who sat there before?

878
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,160
It must be one of two scenarios.

879
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,830
Wake up or die.

880
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,200
I didn't know that then.

881
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,000
I did know that when I got older.

882
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,910
In this space where new patients arrive every day,

883
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,940
those patients have no choice but to be put off.

884
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:54,150
Even so, they still wait

885
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,080
with a glimmer of hope.

886
00:52:56,850 --> 00:53:00,320
Three people, five people,

887
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,620
nine people.

888
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,860
The people I see.

889
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,730
Their families you meet.

890
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,840
When the ghosts disappear,

891
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,710
people who love them so much laugh or cry.

892
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,310
When you ran away out of fear of ghosts,

893
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,920
I ran away in fear of those people.

894
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:34,160
I don't think I want to save these patients as much as those people do.

895
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,860
Can I save the patients?

896
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,960
What if I can't save them?

897
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,740
Those patients should have something to say to their loved ones, too.

898
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:51,410
What if they can't deliver those words because of me?

899
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,820
I've been afraid of the fact

900
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,590
that a doctor's hands are not only just about a patient's life

901
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,560
but also the lives of other people.

902
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,540
Let's get in.

903
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,150
Vital signs s are good.

904
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,820
My hair is washed.

905
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,360
My clothes are changed.

906
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,160
The catheter is very clean.

907
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,230
Good. It seems a smooth switch.

908
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,300
Did they change the pad?

909
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,000
They did.

910
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,770
Oh, nurses, thank you very much.

911
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,540
Thank you.

912
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,210
Who can hear you?

913
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,580
We'll thank them when we wake up.

914
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,010
Impossible.

915
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,630
Who did this?

916
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:22,700
Who inserted this C-line?

917
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,830
(C-line: Central Line)
Who inserted this C-line?

918
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:24,370
Who inserted this C-line?

919
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,870
This patient had a fever from UTI.

920
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,070
(UTI: Urinary tract infection)
This patient had a fever from UTI.

921
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,570
He needs antibiotics, but the original C-line was used for a long time.

922
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,240
So, a new C-line was inserted yesterday.

923
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,880
That intern did it.

924
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,920
Are they crazy?

925
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,620
Who will allow an intern to insert C-line?

926
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,250
What's wrong? Is there anything to worry about?

927
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,930
What's going on? What are you doing?

928
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:50,790
What else can I do, you brat?

929
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,860
I need to see the patient's medical records.

930
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,260
(Patient information query Name Choi Hoon Gil Operation Record Operation Record on February 11, 2021)
I need to see the patient's medical records.

931
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,460
(Patient information query Name Choi Hoon Gil Operation Record Operation Record on February 11, 2021)

932
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,260
Didn’t you say I shouldn't give up?

933
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,630
And you also told me to follow them to the end and find a way.

934
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,200
Didn't you say that's what a doctor should do?

935
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,370
Isn't that what you taught me?

936
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,370
I need you to follow up and report to me every day.

937
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,240
Now go do your things.

938
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,550
(Emergency Medical Center)

939
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,220
It's a little quick to turn over a new leaf in this case.

940
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,920
(EunSang University Medical Center)
It's a little quick to turn over a new leaf in this case.

(EunSang University Medical Center)

942

You're just in time.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

943
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,920
I was just about to call you here.

944
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,790
Hey! What?

945
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,790
I'm here alone. I can't see a patient.

946
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,930
You are the patient.

947
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:26,900
What?

948
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,000
You don't have to change it.

949
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,730
I have to.

950
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,140
Oh, you don't like this adhesive bandage.

951
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,740
You want it to be yours.

952
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,480
I know, I know, I know.

953
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,780
I may not do other things well. But I am good at applying medicine.

954
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,110
Oh, Intern O, good at applying medicine.

955
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,220
Take CT scanning first.

956
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,120
Okay.

957
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,210
(To be played in 60 seconds)

958
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,040
What's wrong with this patient?

959
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,040
Nurse Jeong!

960
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:42,800
Pneumothorax.

961

(Pneumothorax: A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall)
Pneumothorax.

962
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,640
(Pneumothorax: A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall)

963
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,610
By the way, have you solved the problem?

964
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,010
Wall or something?

965
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,250
What? Ah, not yet.

966
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,690
Didn't you say it was a medical problem?

967
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:59,450
Is there anything you can't solve?

968
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:03,530
Yeah, I don't even know if there's an answer.

969
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,560
There you are. There you are.

970
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,960
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

971
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,430
Well, a calling… A blue alert.

972
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,700
Hoon Gil!

973
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,240
Ah.

974
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,070
Hey, where are you going?

975
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,710
What do they say? Who will be here?

976
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,480
The specialists are all operating.

977
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,420
What? No one?

978
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,480
What about Dr. Go?

979
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,220
Why isn't he here yet?

980
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,790
Am I going to die?

981
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:41,430
I'm gonna die?

982
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,340
I'm gonna die, right?

983
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:51,370
Wait a moment. I'm on it.

984
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,950
What's the matter? How is the patient?

985
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,060
Hoon Gil.

986
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,390
Oxygen saturation is up.

987
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,530
The heart rate drops.

988
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,950
What's the matter?

989
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:25,100
But when I didn't see them, I was curious.

990
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,000
What happened to those people who sat there before?

991
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,340
It must be one of two scenarios.

992
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:33,540
Wake up or die.

993
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,660
What's the matter now?

994
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,490
I told you to stay away as much as possible.

995
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:53,960
When did the happy-hormone patient wake up?

996
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,600
Last time you talked to someone in America on the phone.

997
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,800
I didn't hear the reply.

998
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,300
You saw me?

999
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:06,340
Yeah, I did it. I'm amazing, right?

1000
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,280
Hoon Gil was almost scared to death.

1001
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,990
I've been watching doctors do it for years, so I gave it a try.

1002
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,550
Being here for so long,

1003
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,320
I've seen and heard a lot, haven't I?

1004
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,190
I am a doctor.

1005
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,200
I know that you learn it by watching or something.

1006
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,100
Hey! I've been here for 20 years.

1007
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,140
Even a dog that has stayed in a medical school for 20 years could do CPR

1008
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,240
and also stitch the wound.

1009
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:43,210
Didn't you say you do not interfere with the life and death of the living?

1010
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,880
Come on. Is that guy alive?

1011
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,620
Leave him alone. Mind your own business.

1012
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,250
Don't run around just because your brain waves turn better.

1013
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,250
What?

1014
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:59,990
Can you guarantee that what happened to that guy won't happen to you?

1015
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,600
Look at you!

1016
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,280
What can I do for you?

1017
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,450
I thought you'd never contact me again.

1018
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:33,630
Dr. An, your words are very hurtful.

1019
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:37,930
Do you think it's over when you get out of it alone?

1020
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,370
Professor Cha is still alive.

1021
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,470
These patients who were rare but existed occasionally…

1022
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,810
Did they wake up?

1023
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,950
Well...

1024
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,120
Aren't you a doctor?

1025
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,950
You should know it clearly.

1026
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,590
A normal patient

1027
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:02,460
may die in one night.

1028
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,390
What?

1029
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,030
Medical advice?

1030
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,100
It's no big deal.

1031
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,130
There was a minor incident in the hospital today.

1032
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:16,970
Thanks to you, I get favorable information at this time.

1033
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:23,650
Like a patient in a coma

1034
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:26,010
who is gonna wake up but has an accident

1035
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,480
and finally dies.

1036
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,760
It's Cha Yeong Min.

1037
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,270
What does that mean?

1038
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,770
As you heard,

1039
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:53,170
my words and actions during this time have thrown you into confusion.

1040
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:01,280
Actually, that's not me. That's Professor Cha.

1041
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,190
Go Seung Tak!

1042
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,390
Are you crazy?

1043
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,430
What are you doing here?

1044
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,460
I am confessing.

1045
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,030
I'll do it this time.

1046
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,900
I… No...

1047
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,870
It's who we are.

1048
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,540
Hey! Go Seung Tak!

1049
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,860
(Preview of the next episode)

1050
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,400
Isn't there anything you're anxious to tell her?

1051
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,800
I don't want to let go anymore.

1052
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,600
So I'm getting up my courage.

1053
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,600
Guess what I find.

1054
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,200
What?

1055
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,400
The blocked wall.

1056
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,240
I found a way to make Professor Cha get better.

1057
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,940
Does that mean Professor Cha will wake up?

1058
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,140
You guys are...

1059
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,210
How should we do an operation in this situation?

1060
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:40,110
Is there a doctor who wants to save your life more than yourself right now?

1061
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,850
If my hands shake during the operation…

1062
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,920
Pay last respects to your master.

1063
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,920
Go Seung Tak!
