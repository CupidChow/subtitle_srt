1
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,540
Professor Cha.

2
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,610
Why are you looking so shocked?

3
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,450
It's not the first time anyway. Why the surprise?

4
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,920
Why do you let me be responsible for your operation?

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,780
How could you even trust me?

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,250
I always trust you.

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,990
I trust you the most because of your strength

8
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,520
and your dedication to your job.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,160
Although you lost one of them.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,690
Which one do you think is more important?

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,660
You can get better in strength through practice,

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,970
but can you find the dedication back?

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,230
You should know better on that point.

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,340
But why…

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,010
why do you let me do the operation?

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,370
You want me to stop you

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,410
and save you, don't you?

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,480
Besides, sometimes

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,080
patients might die on the operating table during operation.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,810
Don't you think so?

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,980
Don't screw it again like last time.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,390
Make sure to get it done once and for all this time.

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,300
I forgot you.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,830
You are the one who put President Jang

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,300
in misery.

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,340
I forgot you for a while.

27
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,910
So, it's my turn now, isn't it?

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,440
What?

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
Are you going to put me on the operating table

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,180
and end my life with a scalpel?

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,780
Sure.

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:42,830
It'll all come to a clean end

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,400
(Cha Yeong Min)
It'll all come to a clean end

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,020
It'll all come to a clean end

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,450
when you get rid of the original owner.

36
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,289
You jerk.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,530
Professor.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,900
Please make me stop.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,880
Please help me.

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,180
No. I can't do it.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,850
Was that how Yu Dong Sik's accident…

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,390
Doctors' hands are always covered with blood.

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,690
The blood

44
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,860
symbolizes the patients' lives that they hand over to the doctors

45
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,900
due to their trust-based relationship.

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,530
To save and prolong people's lives,

47
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,829
we touch flesh and bones every day,

48
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,740
through which we can feel their lives,

49
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,010
their precious and special lives.

50
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,340
So when the operation is over,

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,810
we can wash the blood off our hands.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,780
But there's a type of blood in this world that can't be cleaned.

53
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,720
So you won't be qualified anymore to wear the white coat again.

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,250
You've changed.

55
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,230
You once said that doctors were highly-skilled technicians.

56
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,930
Tae Hyeon.

57
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,200
An Tae Hyeon.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Why don't you trust me?

59
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,370
Why don't you trust me and wait for me?

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,410
Go into my operating room.

61
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,510
I'll give you this one last chance to get your hands covered with blood.

62
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,940
No matter what the blood symbolizes,

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,250
since you started it, you should finish it.

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,380
What does that mean?

65
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,440
An Tae Hyeon will operate on Yeong Min?

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
(The End)
An Tae Hyeon will operate on Yeong Min?

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,120
An Tae Hyeon will operate on Yeong Min?

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,790
That's insane.

69
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,960
Dr. Go, do you know what kind of person he is?

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
I know.

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,290
He's the one who harmed President Jang.

72
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,560
Since you knew it, why do you still let him do the operation?

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,790
Because of him, Yeong Min

74
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,800
became like this.

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,300
But it's also thanks to him

76
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,670
that Yeong Min survived.

77
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,370
The day when Professor Cha did cardiac tamponade surgery,

78
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,900
he was pushed out from my body during the operation.

79
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,370
I could do nothing but watch helplessly.

80
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,980
He almost died because of me.

81
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,640
An Tae Hyeon showed up in time and saved him.

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,250
It was different back then.

83
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,350
Now we all know what he's done.

84
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,450
Will he still save Cha Yeong Min's life?

85
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,550
Why do you trust him?

86
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,050
I don't.

87
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,650
The one I trust is Professor Cha,

88
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,760
not him.

89
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,060
Even if the miracle you said happened 99% because of God's will,

90
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,200
you've still seen the willpower

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,870
and the determination of a person in it.

92
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,370
I'm sure he'll come back.

93
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,000
Back to who he used to be.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,410
Because there are too many things that he needs to protect

95
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,210
and find back.

96
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,280
Professor Cha.

97
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,930
There you are.

98
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,180
It's my name.

99
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,130
(Thoracic Surgery Department O Ju Myeong)
It's my name.

100
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,970
This white coat was brand new

101
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,710
20 years ago.

102
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,510
Now it's all worn out.

103
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,250
You still keep it.

104
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,550
Of course.

105
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,190
Although people were all born naked,

106
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,790
they should leave the world decently.

107
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,830
Not everyone is lucky enough to leave the world

108
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,030
wearing something that has their own names on.

109
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,570
What was I like when you first saw me?

110
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,940
Why do you ask this suddenly?

111
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,380
Fear that you'd forget everything after you wake up

112
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,150
and turn into that arrogant man again?

113
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,050
Besides yours,

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,920
I entered many people's bodies,

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,790
but only one of them

116
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,760
caught my attention especially.

117
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,470
I still remember how he struggled

118
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,630
to get over his fear of ghosts.

119
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,870
But on the other hand, it makes me wonder

120
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,840
why you always focus on your skills

121
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,010
instead of truly caring about your patients as a doctor.

122
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,050
What's the point of talking this much?

123
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,390
You won't remember anything when you wake up anyway.

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,040
Yeong Min,

125
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,010
please don't forget.

126
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,870
After you wake up,

127
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,980
you've got to be a doctor who truly cares about the patients.

128
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,880
Got it?

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,390
Also, keep up a good work in doing operations.

130
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,190
Hope we won't see each other again.

131
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,910
There's one more thing.

132
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,010
Since we won't see each other again, I'll be straight to you.

133
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,210
I'm not Socrates,

134
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,480
but Hippocrates.

135
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,380
It's such a big honor that Professor Cha

136
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,990
is here to see me off.

137
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,540
This is the furthest I can go.

138
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,040
You know what I mean.

139
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,210
Of course.

140
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,110
Your boundary is here.

141
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,880
And mine is over there.

142
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Chief Ban can finally be relieved.

143
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,650
The day he operated on me,

144
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,920
he left in such a hurry

145
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,390
because his daughter had an accident.

146
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,059
When he learned that I was in danger,

147
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,130
he felt so sorry and cried.

148
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,289
And he convinced the hospital

149
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,789
to let me stay here.

150
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,360
As a result, he was isolated

151
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,070
and looked down upon by the others.

152
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,740
Yeah?

153
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,430
(Entrance)

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,150
I told him not to see me off. This guy.

155
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,780
I'm leaving.

156
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,690
Remember to give me your autograph in the future.

157
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,630
I don't know if I still have a chance to see the movies he stars in.

158
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,770
Oh, I'll miss my ride.

159
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,400
I haven't gone out for two years.

160
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,540
I'll enjoy the views on the way.

161
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,440
Then I'm leaving, Professor Cha.

162
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,440
Promise me to stay alive.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,550
Live a good life.

164
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,210
I'm leaving.

165
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,660
I'm leaving.

166
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,670
Bye.

167
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,680
Take good care.

168
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,420
Sorry. I'm the only one who survived.

169

(Thoracic Surgery Department Cha Yeong Min)

171
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,070
You come and go like ghost.

172
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,930
Don't be like that anymore.

173
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,640
Let's meet each other as two men in the future.

174
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,240
A professor and a rookie.

175
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,840
Buy me food every day and take shifts for me.

176
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
You must be very nice to me.

177
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,780
Make sure you'll erase your memory.

178
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,610
I'll keep mine.

179
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,380
Hope you won't be as quick-tempered as you were after you wake up.

180
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,620
Don't worry. I'll only keep you busy and make you full of confidence.

181
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,380
Let's go. Our last operation together.

182
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Let's finish it beautifully.

183
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,020
Finish it perfectly.

184
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,990
To the degree that no one can ever forget.

185
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,890
Go Seung Tak, let's do it.

The operative sites are right pineal gland and peritoneal cavity.

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,180
Estimated length of operative time is one to two hours.

194
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,020
Estimated loss of blood is 50 to 100.

195
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,220
Is that correct?

196
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,280
-Yes, correct. -Yes, correct.

197
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,420
Let's begin.

198
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,590
Scalpel, please.

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,680
(Operating Room)

200
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,390
This is not an operation I can manage.

201
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,560
Even the professors can't do it, how can I…

202
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,790
Who said you were the chief surgeon?

203
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,960
Well…

204
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,660
I'll be the chief surgeon.

205
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,170
You'll be my assistant.

206
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,800
We did the same operation last year, didn't we?

207
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,470
What if something unexpected happens,

208
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,540
like hands tremble or separation that happened before?

209
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,340
I'll try my best. If I can't do it, An Tae Hyeon will replace me.

210
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,110
He can deal with that.

211
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,810
Will he do that?

212
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,680
The An Tae Hyeon I know will do it.

213
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,230
What are they doing?

214
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,110
Cha Yeong Min.

215
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,280
Yeah? Then there's no other way.

216
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,480
You've got to protect well this hand.

217
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,750
Not only should a doctor care about patients' lives,

218
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,020
but he also considers what's the best for their lives and makes the right judgement.

219
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,260
To protect the things that are precious to the patient.

220
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,890
I'm now both the patient and the doctor.

221
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,800
As a doctor, I'll make the best judgement

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,360
for this patient.

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,970
Cha Yeong Min,

224
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,400
38, male patient.

225
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,100
Innmoninate artery replacement

226
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,840
and median costotomy will be performed

227
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,010
for right innmoninate artery adhesion.

228
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,380
Innmoninate artery replacement?

229
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,380
I thought it was bypass operation.

230
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,220
The patient is in a state of infection

231
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,460
with inflammation symptoms.

232
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:37,910
His organs are fragile. Operate with caution.

233
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,010
(Friable)
His organs are fragile. Operate with caution.

234
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,430
An Tae Hyeon.

235
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,530
Yes, Professor.

236
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,400
Let's begin.

237
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,660
Scalpel.

238
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,970
Let me.

239
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,970
Suction.

240
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
(Operating Room)

241
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,820
Cut.

242
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,790
Cut.

243
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,360
I found it.

244
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,870
It's here.

245
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,430
Now focus.

246
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,000
It's the most dangerous part.

247
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,500
So we can't make any mistake here.

248
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,610
When connecting the innmoninate artery

249
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,110
and suturing native and craft,

250
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,850
we must go deeper if native tears.

251
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,180
Then the surgery will get harder and riskier.

252
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,950
And if the suture fails…

253
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,320
Then we're screwed.

254
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,760
Focus.

255
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,030
Now start suturing native and craft.

256
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,260
5-0 proline.

257
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,000
No.

258
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,480
Calm down. Be cool.

259
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,150
Professor.

260
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:19,650
It's okay now.

261
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,349
Suction.

262
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Darn it, I can't see it at all.

263
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,900
Keep calm. Keep calm.

264
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,410
I see it. Now we can do the suture.

265
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,640
Be quick.

266
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,630
I must find the up bleeding point.

267
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,660
Come on, come on.

268
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,740
I found it.

269
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,340
5-0 proline again.

270
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,970
Hang on. Just hang on a little longer.

271
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,100
Cha Yeong Min, come on, please.

272
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,680
What's wrong with him?

273
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,360
Cut.

274
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,530
Cut.

275
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,680
The operation is over. Thank you, guys.

(Operating Room)

277
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,930
What's wrong with Dr. Go?

278
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,630
What's happening?

279
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,500
Seung Tak.

280
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,040
You do it.

281
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,240
Do it with your own hands.

282
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,740
Are you crazy?

283
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,910
How could I…

284
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,110
You just need to close it up.

285
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,280
You can do it.

286
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,250
It's also…

287
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,920
Boy, isn't that what you've been practicing recently?

288
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,800
Match spacing…

289
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,800
It's time to apply it into practice. I believe in you.

290
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Unreliable hands.

291
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,170
I trust you with my body.

292
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,940
And I'm right here to help.

293
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,310
Are you also going to stand by this time?

294
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,570
Will you leave me to that guy?

295
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,560
Prepare a guide wire.

(EunSang University Medical Center)

299
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,120
The guide wire should be clamped at an upper part than a needle.

300
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,350
Right.

301
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:58,060
The right angle part close to sternum is easy to penetrate.

302
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,600
The spacing and depth must be accurate.

303
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,410
If it's not accurate enough, I'll have a hernia, you know?

(Hernia)
If it's not accurate enough, I'll have a hernia, you know?

If it's not accurate enough, I'll have a hernia, you know?

Unreliable hands.

307
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,380
You're such a novice.

308
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,650
If I get a keloid, you'll be responsible.

309

(Keloid: A raised growth of scar tissue at the site of an injury)
If I get a keloid, you'll be responsible.

If I get a keloid, you'll be responsible.

311
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,630
Don't use surgical staples. Do an everting suture.

312
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,960
Clean and beautiful.

313
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
I want beautiful sutures.

314
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,440
Am I doing it well?

315
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,480
Yeah, well done.

316
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,750
Why didn't you tell me in advance so that I could get prepared?

317
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,120
Boy,

318
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,260
you should be honored

319
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,890
that I'm your first surgical patient.

320
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,730
Why should I always feel honored?

321
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:16,300
Seung Tak, thank you

322
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,470
for everything from the first day to this moment.

323
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,620
It's over.

324
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,960
It's okay.

325
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,930
Is it okay?

326
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, it's okay now.

327
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,510
The heartbeat and pulse are stable.

328
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,910
No drop in blood pressure.

329
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,710
The operation went well.

330
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,210
Yeah!

331
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,950
Go Seung Tak succeeded!

332
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,350
Go Seung Tak did it!

333
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,360
Thank you, Dr. Gim. Thank you, Director Go.

334
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,780
He's not here, right? I'm not kidding.

335
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,940
The ghost has disappeared, right?

336
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,550
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

337
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,180
Is the operation over? How's the result? Has it gone well?

338
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,020
Intern O.

339
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,450
Pro… Professor Cha.

340
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,690
The operation is over. It went well. The ghost has disappeared.

341
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,930
The ghost has disappeared for good.

342
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,410
Those guys have finally won over the God.

343
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,680
You are great!

344
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,050
Professor Cha let me not tell you before he made it happen. So I never said it.

345
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,650
He recommended you to be a clinical professor twice.

346
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,920
But both failed because the Vice President picked on you.

347
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,590
Professor Cha broke in his office and questioned him,

348
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,090
“Do you discriminate Dr. An because he graduated from a local university?”

349
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,600
But every time the Vice President would say your performance was not good.

350
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,070
Professor Cha got angry and that's why he was very strict with you.

351
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,900
He wanted to improve your performance first anyway.

352
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,100
He's cold on the surface, but warm inside.

353
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,510
Like a brown sugar cake.

354
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,280
What's wrong with you? Are you nuts?

355
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,580
How could you stab others in the back?

356
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,290
What did I do?

357
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,220
Who did I stab in the back?

358
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,760
What?

359
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,890
I said I would get blood on my hands, and I did.

360
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,360
I said I would end the game, and the game is over now.

361
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,200
A doctor operated on a patient. Anything wrong about it?

362
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,500
I'll never let this pass.

363
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,270
Don't worry.

364
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,010
A successful operation doesn't necessarily wake him up.

365
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,340
Even if he wakes up, he won't remember it.

366
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,610
It will be fine as long as I keep my mouth shut.

367
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,690
You must be the only one who operated on himself.

368
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,800
Yeong Min, well done.

369
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,930
You really did your best.

370
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,240
Please wake up this time.

371
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,040
Well, he will. No worries.

372
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,210
I know that you performed the surgery well.

373
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,580
But it's hard to say this time.

374
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,480
Even if the surgery went well…

375
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,550
I'm 100% sure. Trust my eyes.

376
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,980
Don't you know that I have good eyesight?

377
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,790
Eyes? Why not your hands?

378
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,390
It will take him a couple of days to regain consciousness.

379
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,160
After all, he has slept for too long.

380
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,530
He has been too tired lately.

381
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,960
He needs a good rest.

382
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,630
-So handsome. -Yeah, right.

383
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,900
How can a person be so good-looking?

384
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,070
Is he an idol? Or an actor?

385
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,570
He must be an actor.

386
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,870
An ordinary person can't be so cute.

387
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,910
His eyes are like grapes.

388
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,250
Hello, welcome back to the real world.

389
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,850
Do you know who I am?

390
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,020
Oh, I'm rejected again. I'm always rejected.

391
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,330
You had an accident three years ago

392
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,960
and took a CT in another hospital.

393
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,360
This doctor found that CT.

394
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,830
Because of that, we found the cause of your disease and operated on you.

395
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,500
How did you know…

396
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,140
I seldom say that to other men except myself.

397
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,410
You are just as handsome and hot as me.

398
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,580
You can be an actor.

399
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,850
You've lain in bed for too long so you must feel feeble and dizzy.

400
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,650
Now you are in rehabilitation and observation.

401
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,450
Don't force yourself too hard at the beginning.

402
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,420
You'll feel much better in a few months.

403
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,160
Well, thank you.

404
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,430
Um, was that a rejection?

405
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,530
I've been used to it anyway.

406
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,670
So is Yeong Min.

407
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,040
Here comes another one.

408
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Another person who rejected me.

409
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,010
Doctor, I've gone through the discharge formalities.

410
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,880
Thank you for taking care of me in this period.

411
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,080
Congratulations on your discharge.

412
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,910
Remember the subsequent visit a month later.

413
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,750
I hope to see a healthy you then.

414
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,820
Okay, doctor.

415
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,950
I'm going on a trip next week.

416
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,490
I hope that through this travel, I can figure out what I want

417
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,890
and what I'm willing to do.

418
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,660
Are you going with your fiancé?

419
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,530
Oh, you can't do that.

420
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,460
No, I'll go myself, alone.

421
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,700
Maybe I'll reconsider marriage this time.

422
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,140
Yeah, that's a good idea.

423
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,640
But you'd better not get married.

424
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,940
Well, have a nice trip.

425
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,680
Don't push yourself too hard, okay?

426
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
I won't, doctor.

427
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,450
Well, by the way,

428
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,280
the unconscious patient who just had an operation…

429
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,250
Over there.

430
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,250
Ward 708.

431
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
It's so nice. He finally woke up.

432
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,340
But he looks so familiar.

433
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,270
Have I seen him somewhere before?

434
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,430
Darn it. Don't touch me.

435
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,560
I don't want a girl.

436
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,700
Get a male doctor here.

437
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,870
Ouch, it hurts! Darn it!

438
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,440
How dare you? Who are you yelling at?

439
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,570
She is an intern in your eyes.

440
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,410
But she's my baby daughter.

441
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,410
Mom, stop.

442
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,040
What's going on?

443
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,240
Let me go.

444
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,780
Doctors are all the same, aren't they?

445
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,180
What do you mean by male doctor or female doctor?

446
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,680
Mom, that patient acted like that because he's drunk.

447
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,120
After he gets sober…

448
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,720
Then deal with him after he gets sober.

449
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,520
Eat this first.

450
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:20,990
What?

451
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,960
In order to face that kind of patients, you must have strength.

452
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,860
Drink this and you'll be strong.

453
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,930
Grow up quickly and let that kind of person beg you for treatment.

454
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,770
You must become a doctor like that, okay?

455
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,270
Mom.

456
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,980
Go home to sleep from now on.

457
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,210
Even it's a nap, you can feel comfortable.

458
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,880
It's said that sleep is restorative.

459
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,420
Don't doctors in thoracic surgery department need physical strength?

460
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,320
Mom, I knew that you would understand me.

461
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,490
Thank you, Mom. Thank you so much.

462
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,560
Eat this.

463
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,070
I cooked it the whole morning for you.

464
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,740
I'll eat it all.

465
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,200
Down to the last morsel.

466
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,510
Oops.

467
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,280
Ma'am.

468
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Yes.

469
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,420
Wow, this is what I like.

470
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,250
Eat the pickled cucumber. Don't you like it a lot?

471
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,250
I like this one.

472
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,430
No chance for today.

473
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,290
When will we have lunch together?

474
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,470
Why is there not even a group photo?

475
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,170
Oh, ghosts can't be caught by the camera.

476
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,710
I should have asked him to write a pledge.

477
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,750
Well, what's this?

478
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,580
Um, is it okay now?

479
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,820
Cha Yeong Min, look at me.

480
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,360
You think I'm Go Seung Tak, right?

481
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,560
I'm Cha Yeong Min.

482
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,790
What's wrong with him to film such a video?

483
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,490
This message is left

484
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:10,670
when Cha Yeong Min possesses Go Seung Tak.

485
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,570
It must be hard to believe. But it's true.

486
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,770
You might take it as Go Seung Tak's joke.

487
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,410
Okay, I understand.

488
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,050
Because you hate Go Seung Tak.

489
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,890
What's going on? I feel so shy.

490
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,460
Last fall, in the Morocco Market in Gangnam,

491
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,160
you bought a burgundy suit in six-month installments.

492
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,230
But you were dissatisfied with it after the first wearing.

493
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,170
So you went back to return it and made a fool of yourself.

494
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,630
Because they found coffee on your butt.

495
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,500
Yes, right.

496
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,670
It's an embarrassing story only known to yourself.

497
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,410
Do you trust me now?

498
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,910
Yes, right. I'm now you, Cha Yeong Min.

499
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,120
Therefore,

500
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,220
remember what I'm going to say.

501
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,620
You've been unconscious for a long time.

502
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,389
As for why you became like that, ask Go Seung Tak.

503
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,690
He may tell the story incoherently and make it sound complex.

504
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,699
But if you listen carefully, you will understand.

505
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:16,400
I'll get to the point now.

506
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,540
During this period, you exist as an unconscious ghost.

507
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,810
A ghost who doesn't know whether he'll survive.

508
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,739
You might be horrified and scared after hearing that.

509
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,810
But it doesn't matter.

510
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,020
Being a ghost has many benefits.

511
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,889
You can hear a lot of things.

512
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,320
You can understand a lot of things.

513
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
But

514
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,030
you're not gonna remember anything when you wake up.

515
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,400
I'm gonna tell you

516
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,000
the hardest and most precious memories

517
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,670
in the past three months of your life,

518
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,340
what kind of person you love,

519
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,150
what kind of promises you made,

520
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,120
and what is the thing...

521
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,460
…that caught you and brought you back.

522
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,730
The existence and the meaning that you must remember,

523
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,000
I'll tell you one by one from now on.

524
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:35,450
And finally... Just remember that, Cha Yeong Min.

525
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,790
Yeong Min.

526
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeong Min, you're awake.

527
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,570
Do you recognize who I am?

528
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,410
Yeong Min, you're awake.

529
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,480
Yeong Min, you're back.

530
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
Thank you.

531
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,150
Thank you so much, Yeong Min.

532
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,160
Is Professor Cha awake?

533
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,200
Are you awake? Yes, you are.

534
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,630
I can hold his hand.

535
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,440
Look at that. I can hold his hand.

536
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,040
His hands are still beautiful.

537
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,010
That's right. These hands have been in bed for months.

538
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,910
I did all the work.

539
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,480
Hey! Unreliable hands.

540
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,820
What?

541
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,890
Get your hands off me.

542
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,790
And you get out of my sight.

543
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,260
Did I get rejected again?

544
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,530
It's me. How could you do this to me?

545
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,110
Professor!

546
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,970
Professor Cha!

547
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,810
-Professor. -When did he wake up?

548
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,080
Oh, so great!

549
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,350
Are you really awake?

550
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,650
I really missed you.

551
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,880
Professor, you're awake.

552
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,460
Professor, you're awake.

553
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,470
Is there any discomfort?

554
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,600
Lee Seon Ho.

555
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,310
How long have I been sleeping?

556
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,470
A little over three months.

557
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,080
Three months? That long?

558
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
I heard it was An Tae Hyeon who did the surgery.

559
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,380
But where is he?

560
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,750
He was in charge of consulting service that day.

561
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,420
So he left after the surgery.

562
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,690
Consulting service?

563
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,160
What does that mean?

564
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,560
Did he resign from this hospital?

565
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,960
Why?

566
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,330
Well, that's a long story.

567
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,530
By the way,

568
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,840
how is Patient Jang Gwang Deok?

569
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,800
(EunSang University Medical Center)
how is Patient Jang Gwang Deok?

570
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,610
(EunSang University Medical Center)

571
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,050
Yeong Min, the flowers in your ward are withered.

572
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,220
I went to get some new ones.

573
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,220
Aren't they nice?

574
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,700
You know lying down for too long

575
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,570
makes your leg muscles much weaker.

576
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,270
Take it easy. Just be patient.

577
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,900
You'll probably be able to walk normally in two days.

578
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,710
Jang Se Jin,

579
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,710
shouldn't you be in Seattle right now?

580
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm sorry about your father.

581
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,050
In the end, I couldn't save his life.

582
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,350
I know you tried your best.

583
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,890
It's not your fault, Yeong Min.

584
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,390
I hear you're working as an exchange doctor in this hospital.

585
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,720
Is this because of me?

586
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,930
Why didn't you just leave me as you did before?

587
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,330
I don't go.

588
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,630
I want to be with you.

589
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,240
I have an appointment with you.

590
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,440
Do you still think I'm the same silly guy 12 years ago?

591
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,210
Yeong Min…

592
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:07,580
So, you are not willing to leave this time

593
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,490
because I have become an excellent doctor?

594
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,520
Or

595
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,830
you think I'll accept you as long as you get back?

596
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,030
Go back,

597
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,770
to America or anywhere.

598
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,340
Go back to where you came from.

599
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,600
I'll tell him if he doesn't remember.

600
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,830
What's so hard about that?

601
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,450
What are you doing here?

602
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,650
I'm going to disinfect and bandage your wound.

603
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,620
I know how to do that right now.

604
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,490
Hey! Unreliable hands.

605
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm gonna ask you one more time. What are you doing here?

606
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,060
Where else would a doctor be other than the hospital?

607
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,090
And you'll find out soon enough

608
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,290
that my hands are not unreliable anymore.

609
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,900
You might be surprised.

610
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,170
How much better could you be?

611
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,210
I don't trust you. Go get Gim Jae Won here.

612
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:32,370
(To be played in 60 seconds)
I don't trust you. Go get Gim Jae Won here.

613
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,200
I didn't want to take this out.
(To be played in 60 seconds)

614
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,110
What is that?

615
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,840
Whatever. I'm giving you goosebumps.

616
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,810
What the hell is that, Go Seung Tak?

617
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,950
Okay, I get it.

618
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,890
I heard that he asked about President Jang and Dr. An Tae Hyeon.

619
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,060
He seems to have no memory of the accident.

620
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,890
No memory?

621
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,150
It's so nice to see you again, Professor Cha.

622
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,810
Congratulations on regaining consciousness.

623
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,680
You didn't have to visit me specially.

624
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,790
You are the best doctor in our hospital.

625
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,220
I must come to see you.

626
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:29,360
Do you know how happy I was when I heard that you woke up?

627
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,330
You have heard about President Jang, haven't you?

628
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,200
I'm sorry about that, too.

629
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,170
I know you are upset.

630
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,530
But don't beat yourself up about it.

631
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,940
You must have something urgent at the time of the accident.

632
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,010
You were also the victim of an accident

633
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:47,380
on your way back.

634
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,780
I've already made peace with the family.

635
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,180
You just put the past behind you.

636
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,220
Just focus on getting better.

637
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,020
Although it's not good to say that,

638
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,120
at least you have waken up like this,

639
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,820
I can't be more grateful.

640
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,540
Ouch! My chest.

641
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,180
If so, why did you show up empty-handed?

642
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,350
You should have brought some champagne.

643
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,750
Han Seung Won.

644
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,550
I told you to wait for me.

645
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,220
Judging from the fact that you're here in person,

646
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,220
you must be anxious.

647
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,930
Are you here to see what I remember?

648
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,730
If something goes wrong,

649
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,800
you will put the blame on the surgeon next time, won't you?

650
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,830
How can these memories...?

651
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,440
That's my privacy. You don't need to know that.

652
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,640
So what are you gonna do?

653
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,780
Do you expect people to believe

654
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,110
the words of a man waking from a coma?

655
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,050
Of course,

656
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,480
they don't believe.

657
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,280
But

658
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,320
I guess people always believe what a party involved says.

659
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,220
Didn't I tell you?

660
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,820
The truth will never be covered up,

661
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,160
as long as one of us has a trace of sincerity.

662
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,960
One more thing.

663
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,730
You should be thankful that I woke up.

664
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,240
After all, it reduces one penalty for you.

665
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,670
When you get jailed,

666
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,940
there'll be plenty of time. What are you supposed to do?

667
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,080
Think about it.

668
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,510
Reflect on how heavy and awe-inspiring

669
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,550
the life you play with is.

670
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,820
Get out. I'm sleepy.

671
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,440
He's been getting scared a lot lately.

672
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,070
He's getting used to it.

673
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,710
What is this, Go Seung Tak?

674
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,450
I'm asking you what this is.

675
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,880
Do you see that?

676
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,120
The top is not aligned.

677
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,820
I told you to make it look good.

678
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,790
I'm not married yet.

679
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,320
I said you'd be responsible for my scar.

680
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,100
Besides,

681
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,660
why are you still here?

682
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,900
Didn't I tell you that

683
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,870
you must enter the Operating Room

684
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,900
at least once a day,

685
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,140
visiting or being an assistant?

686
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,970
Boy, you only know how to loaf on the job.

687
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,740
Didn't you say it yourself

688
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,880
that your hands needed more practice and surgeries?

689
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,880
I sacrificed my body to give you an opportunity.

690
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,020
You should be pushing harder.

691
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,380
Professor!

692
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,960
Professor!

693
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,790
Stop that. Don't touch me. You've never been like this before.

694
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,660
I can't believe I can hold you and touch you.

695
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,360
My wound, my wound, don't touch me.

696
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,970
So why did you do that to me?

697
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,930
How could you play a trick on me?

698
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,770
The rules of the living can't be broken.

699
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,170
Of course, I have to follow it.

700
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,180
These two guys

701
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,750
have changed everything.

702
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,980
How will they fool the divinities in the future?

703
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,020
They're right though.

704
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,050
Rules are made to be broken.

705
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,390
The more desperate side will win.

706
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,390
The subscriber you dialed cannot be reached.

707
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,060
Your call will be transferred to voice mail.

708
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,460
Why isn't this guy answering his phone? Darn it.

709
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,570
Hello?

710
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:31,870
The police station?

711
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,240
There was a man named An Tae Hyeon

712
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,670
who turned himself in for a case about Jang Gwang Deok.

713
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,940
In the course of the investigation,

714
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,480
we have got a statement saying that you abetted him to murder.

715
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,610
Nonsense!

716
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,710
Anyway, there are statements and evidence,

717
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,320
so you have to be investigated.

718
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,890
Please show up voluntarily.

719
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,960
If not, we'll have to get a warrant.

720
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,460
What evidence?

721
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,570
Just give me Professor Cha's position.

722
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,900
When I gave President Jang the injection,

723
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,970
I crossed the bridge and pulled the trigger.

724
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,470
I already had blood on my hands once.

725
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,740
What difference does it make to do it twice?

726
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,650
I guess that's why I kept that position unoccupied until today.

727
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,990
Professor, I'm at the police station.

728
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,590
I originally wanted to see you first before I came.

729
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,620
But when I got to the hospital,

730
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,460
I felt... I felt ashamed to see you.

731
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,460
So I came straight here.

732
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,430
I can't wash the blood off my hands.

733
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,270
But after I take my punishment,

734
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,840
I'll visit you.

735
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,070
Please get well soon.

736
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,910
Thank you for believing me.

737
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:50,250
And thank you for saving my life.

738
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,960
I'm gonna keep my promise of demanding nothing.

739
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,830
I've already applied

740
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,360
to donate my part when I get it.

741
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,130
And you will never get your part.

742
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:13,340
Because I'm gonna use every way and every means

743
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,970
to make sure the murderer who killed my dad pay

744
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,810
in the name of his daughter.

745
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,440
What? Murd...

746
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,540
The murderer?

747
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,250
Hey! You mean I killed dad?

748
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,820
I didn't even touch a finger of his.

749
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,520
Frankly speaking, he would have had only one year left even if I hadn't done anything.

750
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Rather than let him toil,

751
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,390
what's wrong with sending him away early?

752
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,460
What's more,

753
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,330
you're the one who took dad's oxygen mask off.

754
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,300
Not to mention one year, even if it is one day,

755
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,560
it's a murder.

756
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,330
Because one day

757
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,100
is enough for me to call him dad,

758
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,700
instead of declaring his death.

759
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,440
That's why even dad forgives you

760
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,940
I will never forgive you.

761
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,850
We're the police.

762
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,550
Jang Min Ho,

763
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,720
you're under arrest on suspicion of abetting someone to murder Jang Gwang Deok.

764
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,950
The position will be filled by the right person.

765
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:08,160
When the date for you to go to the police station is fixed,

766
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,930
just tell me.

767
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,770
On the way there...

768
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,900
I will be with you.

769
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,920
-You have the right to remain silent... -What?

770
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,790
What are you talking about? What murder?

771
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,820
You seem to have made a confession about it just now.

772
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,760
A few more accusations will be added.

773
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,660
When you were Vice President of Tianming Group,

774
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,490
you embezzled public funds, neglected your duty,

775
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,400
committed an atrocity to Go Seung Tak,

776
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,700
etc.

777
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,700
I'm sorry. Go on.

778
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,670
What is that?

779
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,010
Do you have any proof?

780
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,310
Anything you say from now on

781
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,040
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

782
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,210
You have the right to an attorney.

783
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,280
Let me go.

784
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,960
What's the matter? Do you want to mess with me, too?

785
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,330
You weren't always like this.

786
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,100
No.

787
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,400
You used to be petty and get back at people.

788
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,540
How dare you...

789
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,910
You got back at the kids who bullied me

790
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,640
and the grown-ups who talked behind my back

791
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,010
about my dad's death.

792
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,180
At that time, I was very fond of you.

793
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,990
I meant it when I said I didn't want things to go bad with you.

794
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,290
Before Professor Cha woke up,

795
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,030
I really hoped you could repent and reflect on yourself.

796
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,960
But

797
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,700
it's too late, right?

798
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,370
I'll wait for you.

799
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,130
No matter how long it takes,

800
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,670
I will wait for you to be the elder brother you were before.

801
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,610
I'll wait.

802
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,550
Wow, your back is so wide.

803
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,420
What are you doing?

804
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,020
I just want to touch you all the time.

805
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,530
It feels real.

806
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,730
We're so short on intimacy these days.

807
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,130
You are so happy.

808
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,530
Go away.

809
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,330
Won't you go away?

810
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,770
Be careful, be careful.

811
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,740
You know I have a stake in your body, right?

812
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,610
You don't even care about my body. Why are you touching me?

813
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,440
You look disappointed.

814
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,140
Because I'm not her?

815
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,180
No.

816
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,710
So, why did you refuse her?

817
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,410
How long are you gonna refuse?

818
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,850
Didn't I tell you?

819
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,020
I'll start from scratch.

820
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,720
With my body.

821
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,390
I don't want a sad romance right now.

822
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,520
I want a sweet romantic comedy.

823
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,890
Romantic comedies start out as enemies

824
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:01,960
and end up as lovers.

825
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,690
There will be misunderstandings and hard-to-get.

826
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,530
Even after a quarrel,

827
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,600
they pull together in a moment of crisis.

828
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,030
That's what I did with you.

829
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:13,100
Oh, we're doing a romantic comedy.

830
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,940
But why can't I see Dr. Jang?

831
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,240
Is she very busy?

832
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,310
Dr. Jang left for America a few days ago.

833
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,710
She resigned from her exchange professorship.

834
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,710
What?

835
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,650
Don't you know? I thought you guys had a deal.

836
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,180
I thought you told her to go.

837
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,350
I told her to go, and she really went?

838
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:28,620
What did you do? Why didn't you talk her out of it?

839
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,250
Of course, I did. I told her to wait.

840
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,220
But she said it couldn't go on like this.

841
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,460
She looked really hurt.

842
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,990
What exactly did you say to her?

843
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,090
Forget it. Give me her American address.

844
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,060
Oh, I didn't ask.

845
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,360
Oh, no.

846
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,830
I take it you were rejected.

847
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,900
Romantic comedies need people around.

848
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,800
Even if you are discharged,

849
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,300
you can't push yourself too hard for a while, you know?

Come on, tell me.

859
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:06,290
I have stayed too long.

860
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,760
Now it's time for a shift.

861
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,400
You guys can guard it from now on.

862

Cha Bun.

864
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,150
Oh, I was so worried about you.

865
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,580
You were here.

866
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,990
Are you all right?

867
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,320
You look healthy.

868
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,350
Have you put on weight?

869
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,560
Was that kid in my home?

870
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,930
Well, after my mom kicked him out of the salon,

871
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,060
your grandpa was in charge.

872
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,230
Then he should've been doing well in a rich man's home.

873
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,700
Sure enough, father and son have strong survival abilities.

874
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,330
Father and son? Father?

875
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,240
Who is his father?

876
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,040
He's a master of romantic comedies.

877
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,270
Oh, I'm hungry. Buy me dinner.

878
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,910
Why do you always let me treat you? You have more money.

Dr. O Su Jeong.

880
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,480
I heard you applied to our department.

881

These are my books.

00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,290
You can read them sometime.

Feel free to ask me if you don't understand.

886
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,590
Let me know if you need anything.

887
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,930
Do you have any book on Kirklin's heart surgery?

888
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,560
It's in the medical department.

889
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,000
Should I give it to you now?

890
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,200
Okay.

891
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,940
Follow me.

892
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,310
Wow, someone who never distinguishes seniors and juniors and doesn't care about anyone would give her that book.

893
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,010
Really.

894
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,510
I didn't expect the sunbae to be such a person.

895
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,720
Oh, no.

896

Beautiful doctor.

Are you busy?

898
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,390
I have something for you.

899

I'm available.

00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,500
Here you are.

902
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,270
Why am I getting this?

903
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,810
Chocolate cake.

904
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:09,680
I should have brought it a long time ago.

905
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,720
Is it too late?

906
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,550
I'm so sorry, beautiful doctor.

907
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,490
Thank you, too.

908

Thank you for being a wonderful person to be proud of.

909

910
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,630
Live happily and well.

I'll cheer you on from afar.

912

you will be there for me.

and hugged me?

Well, your furniture looks pretty good.

01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:46,430
So excited. The life of a beloved resident.

997
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,470
From today,

998
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,800
do 100 squats a day, Go Seung Tak.

999
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,040
Take a video and send it to me.

1000
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,610
Start with a simple morning coffee.

1001
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:54,780
Go Seung Tak, you're gonna join all the surgery I do from now on.

1002
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,210
You'll take care of the patients.

1003
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:58,010
I'd like medium rare Korean beef steak for dinner.

1004
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:00,250
Go Seung Tak, you will also be responsible for

1005
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:03,020
the transcribing and sorting of all reported cases of academic meetings in the future.

1006
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,790
You're gonna have to pay me back.

1007
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:06,250
Just follow me,

1008
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,160
full of energy.

1009
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,190
You will be sorry.

1010
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:24,840
Last, you must remember, Cha Yeong Min.

1011
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,080
1, 2, 3.

1012
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,920
Professor Cha Yeong Min.

1013
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:35,930
It's a stab wound patient.

1014
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:36,920
(Stab injury)
It's a stab wound patient.

1015
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,880
The knife penetrated between the second and third ribs
(Stab injury)

1016
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,690
The knife penetrated between the second and third ribs

1017
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,390
on the left side of his chest.

1018
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,130
Start with etamsylate to stop the bleeding.

1019
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,530
Get the patient to the operating room immediately, Go Seung Tak.

1020
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,280
Remember,

1021
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,050
just like your life,

1022
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:09,580
everyone's life is great.

1023
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,150
Scalpel.

1024
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,460
Suction.

1025
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:28,070
To catch the hand of life

1026
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:30,710
in a flash.

1027
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,950
It's the golden hand.

1028
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:39,910
Recognition?

1029
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,480
Hey, did you do that? I did it all.

1030
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,090
Are you too close to me?

1031
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:46,990
I am so hungry.

1032
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,120
Lunch?

1033
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,790
That's what you should do today

1034
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,970
(Operating Room)
That's what you should do today

1035
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:55,430
That's what you should do today

1036
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:58,100
on the line between life and death.

1037
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,070

1038
