2
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,260
Where am I?

3
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,460
Why am I doing this?

4
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,690
A thoracic surgeon must be strong, don't you know?

5
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,200
I have no other choice now.

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,730
This guy is not qualified in many aspects.

7
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,270
Take a breath and let's go. It's an emergency!

8
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,580
Did you really inject 5,000?

9
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,150
I had an emergency back then,

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,880
so I asked Go Seung Tak to do it for me.

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,120
Well, you must be here for the heparin.

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,390
It's this brat. It must be this brat…

13

(Intensive Care Unit)

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,600
Blood pressure and pulse are okay.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,070
No abnormal change in discharge color.

16
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,780
Then why…

17
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,580
This guy is so weak.

18
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,080
Gee, has he ever exercised?

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,650
Then why did you call me here?

20
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,950
Why don't you use honorific…?

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,660
I wish you had come so quickly to save me.

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,130
I called everyone just in case.

23
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,690
It turned out that Dr. Go arrived first.

24
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,330
(Self Respiration)
Has he resumed self-aspiration?

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,860
Yes, look.
(Self Respiration)

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,430
Yes, look.

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,710
What's going on?

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,410
The ventilator was set at 12 before,

29
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,910
but now it's 20.

30
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,350
He seems to have regained self-aspiration.

31
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,850
Does he?

32
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,620
Then switch to synchronous intermittent ventilation mode.

33
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,090
Gim Jae Won, prepare for brain MRI.

34
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,720
Dr. Lee, call Professor Eun from Neurosurgery Department.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,120
Stop staring. Move!

36
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,600
Good, you do it. Why don't you be his attending physician?

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,570
I'm sorry, Dr. An. I didn't mean….

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,410
Dr. An Tae Hyeon is Professor Cha's attending physician.

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,280
He's been with Professor Cha for the longest time.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,750
Please have a good think about it.

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,850
What instructions would Professor Cha give?

42
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,390
Gim Jae Won, contact the exam room.

43
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,330
Dr. Lee, call Professor Eun.

44
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,730
-Yes.
-Yes.

45
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,680
So warm.

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,350
The pulse is still beating.

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,520
Get up. You can do it.

48
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,160
Cha Yeong Min, fighting!

49
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,170
Are you out of you mind?

50
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,410
He's not brain-dead yet.

51
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,210
A patient in a coma can occasionally have self-respiration.

52
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,280
Just reset the ventilator and keep observing.

53
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,010
How could you take it as a miracle or surprise?

54
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,650
These young doctors have no experience.

55
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,950
But Dr. An, don't you know it either?

56
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,750
Why are you also like them?

57
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,150
Is that what Professor Cha has taught you?

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,290
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,730
Cha Yeong Min, why are you being so stupid these days?

60
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,460
If you waked up,

61
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,200
you wouldn't be in this body now.

62
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,040
My time is limited. So listen to me, Dr. An.

63
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,640
Who are you…?

64
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,980
Don't ask, just listen.

65
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Dr. An, you also heard it, right?

66
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,950
Go Seung Tak injected President Jang with heparin.

67
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,450
It wasn't a mistake. He did it on purpose.

68
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,480
And Han Seung Won was behind this.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
The two of them colluded with each other.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,350
So let Go Seung Tak attend tomorrow's seminar,

71
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,890
then you'll understand everything.

72
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,590
Dr. An, I trust you and you know it.

73
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,159
Please make sure that he will be present.

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,470
Go... Go Seung Tak.

Where's my coffee?

79
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,700
Oh my, what a hand!

80
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,500
It felt like a baseball bat.

81
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,070
Have you always been beaten like this?

82
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,040
Ten multiplies one is ten.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,810
-Ten multiplies two is twenty.
-Go... Go Seung Tak.

84
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,410
What's wrong with him?

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,110
Why is he reciting the multiplication table?

86
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,050
Hey, where are you going?

87
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,450

Why is she looking at this?

92
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,480
I was being too exaggerated.

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,810
Sorry for bringing you so much trouble.

94
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,650
Nurse Jeong, you don't need to apologize.

95
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,250
We thought he was to wake up, so we got too excited.

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
You must have called everyone just in case.

97
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,600
But sure enough, it's just a temporary self-respiration.

98
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
Well, he's not brain-dead.

99
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,970
Just reset the ventilator and observe for a while.

100
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,880
Why did you even do an MRI because of it?

101
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,240
Will any one of you pay for the expense?

102
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,110
Hey, weren't you the person who required an MRI?

103
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,880
Me?

104
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,990
Please send me the invoice. I'll pay.

What's the matter with him?

106

He was acting like a maniac just now.

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,430
He's like a maniac the whole day.

108
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,330
Did he act that way for his error?

109
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,780
Well, are you disappointed that I'm still alive?

110
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,610
Or are you reassured

111
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,680
that it turns out I haven't woken up yet?

112

Go Seung Tak.

113
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,650
Stay where you are.

114
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,159
What did you mean just now?

115
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,940
Vice President Han Seung Won is behind what?

116
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,670
You and he colluded for what?

117
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,480
Me? How is that possible?

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,750
President Han has no right to let me do anything.

119
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,250
And I will never collude with him.

Won't you attend the seminar on President Jang?

123
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,660
And you said you would speak it out there.

124
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,060
Did I say that?

125
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,760
Yes, you said it with your mouth.

126
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,100
Though I don't know what you are going to say,

127
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,470
please come anyway. Then we can talk.

128
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,840
Right, well done, Dr. An.

129
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,080
It concerns Professor Cha's reputation.

130
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,450
You must come.

131
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,190

Even if you do, it won't help.

Oh, why are you treating me like this?

Don't you also do this kind of thing?

142
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,320
Of course I do.

It's about to be found out.

155
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,850
But is he aware of anything?

156
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,460
During Professor Cha's hemostatic plug surgery,

157
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,060
I still took it as a misunderstanding or exaggeration.

158

But the just-now Go Seung Tak

159

is really not yesterday's Go Seung Tak, right?

160
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,800
I also think so.

161
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
So different.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,640
He can be totally another person.

But he is really smart.

167
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,080
So when occasionally that person comes,

168
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,920
he changes into someone else

169
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,720
and then…

170
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,190
Who's that person?

171
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,760
Please be specific.

172
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,790
What?

173
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,130
Ahh, it looks like that person came again.

(EunSang University Medical Center)

177
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,870
I thank them for their care.

178
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,010
Gee, here it comes again.

179
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,710
Even if they're exhausted,

180
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,580
I remind them to try harder.

181
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,090
I won't interfere with life and death

182
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,960
or meddle with others' lives.

183
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,690
To do or not to do, it's both okay.

184
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,530
But I'll do others a little favor if I can.

185
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,470
Please.

186
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,800
But I can't only do what makes me happy.

187
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,340
No pain, no gain.

188
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,350
Ahhhhh…

189
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,890
Doctor, I'm not put under anesthesia yet.

190
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,590
I'm not put under anesthesia yet.

191
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,490
You haven't put me under anesthesia.

192
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,730
So sour. So painful.

193
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,140
I did this in return for lending me her body.

194
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,780
Now the anesthesia is working.

195
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,780
Good.

196
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,720
It's important to get to the point directly

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,460
and get out quickly.

198
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,290
If you stay for too long,

199
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,160
you may change a person's life.

200
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,760
Just as there are rules for the living,

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,900
there are also principles for the ghosts.

202
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,740
Therefore, don't interfere with the living's affairs.

203
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,110
They are as smart as you.

204
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,380
This is my business.

205
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,180
Also leave your treatment to the living.

206
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,120
Don't ruin others' lives.

207
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,950
And did that little guy do anything wrong?

208
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,890
He deserved it.

209
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,220
How can you be so sure?

210
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,890
I've checked President Jang's medical records.

211
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,590
My operation was perfect.

212
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,690
It was all those guys' fault.

213
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,000
If it were not for them,

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,130
the president would have lived well now

215
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,130
and I wouldn't have suffered.

216
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,570
So I will never forgive.

217
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,440
Then you keep running around.

218
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,580
Your own life is already in danger.

219
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,350
But who can stop you from looking for trouble?

220
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,150
Good luck.

221
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,750
Bye.

222
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,430
I'm sorry for what happened to Professor Cha.

223
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,130
Thank you for calling me.

224
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,210
Hi, Beren. This is Se Jin.

225
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,550
Sorry but I have a favor to ask you.

226
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,890
Do you have a minute?

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,360
Why hasn't he come yet?

230
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,700
Is this guy running away?

231
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,130
Oh, I'm going crazy.

232
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,340
Oh, I can't believe it!

233
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,010
What on earth is this made of?

234
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,050
Where did it come from?

235
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,410
It's driving me nuts.

236
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,320
You must come.

Come here.

248

Come quickly.

let's make it public.

257

who would refuse to admit his own mistakes.

259
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:34,610
Please trust me this time.

260
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,740
I'll watch you for a period

261
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,840
but not too long,

After the operation, Professor Cha said he would go out

264
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,860
and then left.

00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,330

Call me if anything happens.

268
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,069
Don't you know why he went out and where he went?

269
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,839
He didn't tell me.

270
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,940
It seemed that he got an emergency text.

271
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,480
What was so urgent that he left his patient?

272
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,250
No common sense.

273
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,250
Hippocrates.

274
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,450
When observing the patient's condition,

275
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,890
I found that his heart rate elevated

276
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,359
and then called the professor.

277
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,160
He asked me to send him the patient's data.

278
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,130
The examination results suggested a crack in the surgical site.

279
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,070
So I dialed his number immediately but he didn't answer.

280
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,170
Maybe he was already hit at that time.

281
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,250
That's why I decided to do the emergency surgery.

282
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:48,810
What else could I do?

283
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,350
The patient was dying.

284
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,050
As the chief, of course I should come forward.

285
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,980
What's wrong?

286
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,320
Where's Professor Cha? Isn't he coming?

287
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,350
Right, he said he was far from the hospital.

288
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,320
Excuse! He did it to evade the responsibility.

289
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,660
So he left.

290
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,890
Then, could you do it, chief?

291
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,390
Why should I be the scapegoat?

292
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,130
President Jang

293
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,500
is Professor Cha's patient.

294
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,160
Either wait till Professor Cha is back

295
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,900
or keep calling other doctors.

296
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,170
I see.

297
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,200
Listen up.

298
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
If anything happens to President Jang,
Professor Cha takes full responsibility.

299
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,270
Are you clear?

300
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,110
But Dr. Gim Jae Won wanted to do an LPTT

301
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,750
just in case.

302
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,950
An LPTT.

303
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,180
It's very urgent. Please be quick.

304
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,020
But the sample turned out to be uncheckable,

305
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
(Uncheckable
The value is too high or too low, beyond the detection range)
But the sample turned out to be uncheckable,

306
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,360
which suggested an overdose of heparin.
(Uncheckable
The value is too high or too low, beyond the detection range)

307
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,490
(Uncheckable
The value is too high or too low, beyond the detection range)

308
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,660
Why did you want to do that test?

309
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,900
Because Dr. An Tae Hyeon gave me an instruction before.

310
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,540
What instruction?

311
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,240
I asked him to rise heparin to 1,000.

312
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,620
So why?

313
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,150
I said clearly 500.

314
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,960
I must have told you

315
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,060
to add heparin to 1,000,

316
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,560
didn't I?

317
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,330
Shoot!

318
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,070
Or did I say 5,000?

319
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,100
I happen to be curious, too.

320
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,470
Was that Professor Cha's instruction?

321
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,440
What?

322
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,470
Dr. An Tae Hyeon said it was Professor Cha's instruction.

323
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,680
He let me add to 5,000 but the surgery wasn't done yet.

324
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,980
I also found it strange.

325
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,110
Well, now…

326
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,980
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

327
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,110
So,

328
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,180
Dr. Gim Jae won, did you inject heparin for the patient?

329
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,850
If you did, how much?

330
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,590
Well…

331
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,490
I didn't do it.

332
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,430
If not you, who?

333
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,940
Seriously?

334
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,340
Why are you being so quiet?

335
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,240
What?

336
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,250
Do you still dare not speak the truth?

337
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,750
I knew it. You coward!

338
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,350
It's me.

339
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,260
Dr. Gim Jae won asked me to do it for him.

340
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,110
Dr. Go Seung Tak,

341
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,610
what exactly did Dr. Gim Jae won tell you?

342
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,150
He asked me to add heparin to 1,000.

343
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,150
So did you inject 1,000?

344
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
Dr. Go Seung Tak,

345
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,430
how much heparin did you give the patient?

346
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,990
I didn't do the injection.

347
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,730
Not even a milliliter.

348
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,540
I knew you would say that.

349
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,510
How could I trust a guy like you?

350
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm telling the truth.

351
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,380
I did nothing to patient Jang Gwang Deok.

352
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,750
Never.

353
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,120
How can you prove what you just said?

354
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,290
Is there any evidence?

355
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,050
There can't be evidence for a thing I didn't do.

356
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,160
But there should be a witness.

357
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,740
Dr. Go Seung Tak checked on

358
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,440
patient Jang Gwang Deok after he came in.

359
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,720
Let me take a look at the medical record.

360
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,060
Alright.

361
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,460
It’s here.

362
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,100
Based on the medical record, the patient has been injected with heparin at 500 ml an hour

363
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,100
round the clock according to Professor Cha Yeong Min’s instructions.

364
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,470
The patient suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage

365
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,700
and cardiac tumor.

366
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,470
The tumor had been removed during the surgery.

367
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,010
In case it wasn’t completely removed

368
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,980
and to avoid tumor cells traveling through the lungs and neck

369
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,380
to the brain,

370
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,820
we did a heparin injection after making sure that there wasn’t any

371
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,850
postoperative bleeding.

372
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,960
Gosh.

373
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,660
You don’t deserve to be called a doctor.

374
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,630
I thought you’d at least learned something before you could be qualified to sit there.

375
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,100
So simply put,

376
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,530
heparin injection was performed to prevent the remaining tumor cells

377
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,440
from traveling through this side up here

378
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,710
and clogging blood vessels in the brain.

379
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,540
By the way, you know what heparin is, don’t you?

380
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,140
It’s used to prevent blood clotting.

381
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,010
Oh, yeah.

382
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,150
But the thing is

383
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,050
that if you inject too much heparin, it could cause vascular rupture.

384
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,320
And then what will happen?

385
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,050
The surgical wound could open.

386
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,160
On the medical record, it said that atrial fibrillation occurred once after surgery.

387
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,000
To minimize the risk of the recurrence of cerebral hemorrhage,

388
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,970
Professor Cha prescribed no more than 500 ml of heparin.

389
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,570
When I checked on the patient, he was stable

390
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,240
and had no abnormal symptoms.

391
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,770
If you increase the dose under such circumstances,

392
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,370
it’s no different from killing the patient.

393
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,140
That’s exactly what I thought!

394
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,150
No need to increase the dose of heparin.

395
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,250
If anyone asks, tell him it’s my instruction.

396
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,920
Then I’m leaving.

397
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,660
(Intensive Care Unit)

398
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,260
After saying that he left

399
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,460
and never came back again.

400
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,480
I feel like I was being set up.

401
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,350
Could you tell me what’s going on?

402
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,120
So who the heck increased the dose of heparin?

403
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,450
There’s no way to find out.

404
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,060
We don’t have a camera, so we can’t make a baseless accusation.

405
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,890
It’s said the Legal Department will run an investigation.

406
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,560
They will find out the truth soon.

407
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,860
Don’t worry too much.

408
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,570
As long as you know that I was still on your side in that situation.

409
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,070
Of course, Chief, we know that.

410
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,770
We are thankful to you.

411
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,070
The professors weren’t in the hospital at that time.

412
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,240
You said you were somewhere far away.

413
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,880
You said you got acute enteritis.

414
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,150
You said your wife’s family had a funeral. Did you go for mourning?

415
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,250
After President Jang learned this matter,

416
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,920
only Chief Ban and my team members were involved in the treatment.

417
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,260
But how come Professor Cha wasn’t in the hospital at that time?

418
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,860
He caused such a mess.

419
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,930
I know he didn’t do it on purpose and I shouldn’t have blamed him,

420
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,090
but he does lack a sense of responsibility.

421
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,260
Chief Ban Tae Sik would do whatever

422
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,570
Han Seung Won asks him to do in order to take me down.

423
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,200
No, wait.

424
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,340
But evil as he is, he wouldn’t risk someone’s life.

425
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,970
Darn it!

426
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,020
Gim Jae Won.

427
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,980
He believes everything the professors say

428
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,350
even if they told him he could treat a brain tumor with aspirin.

429
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,420
How did such a dumbhead become a doctor?

430
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,830
But he’s indeed a kind person.

431
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,930
He wouldn’t even walk under a pine tree

432
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,200
because he doesn’t want to kill a pine moth by accident.

433
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,960
How could he do such a thing to a patient?

434
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,730
No. No way.

435
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,900
Sunbae, during the meeting…

436
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,540
Didn’t you sign the Confidentiality Agreement?

437
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,140
It’s none of our concern anymore.

438
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,340
Why don’t you read a medical paper if you have time?

439
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,950
This Lee Seon Ho guy.

440
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,780
He could become an excellent doctor one day.

441
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,350
It’s obvious that he’s selfish and self-absorbed.

442
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,990
Would a person like that stain his career?

443
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,790
No way.

444
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,830
I feel so bored as if I ate 100 yams.

445
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,230
A statement like that would make people think you are even worse than a first-year newbie.

446
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,730
Didn’t you see?

447
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,930
I think even one with four years of experience can’t compare to Go Seung Tak.

448
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,470
What did you say?

449
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,580
Iced Americano.

450
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,450
You asked for hot, right?

451
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,380
I told you that I’d double the coffee.

452
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,950
And by double, this is what I meant.

453
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,720
This is a bribe to make up for being late, isn’t it?

454
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,660
Hey, Crystal, don’t you get it yet?

455
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,560
I’m not the punctual type.

456
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,670
Guys, enjoy.

457
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:11,340
True. He’s just a rude and inconsiderate klutz

458
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,250
who’s only good at theory.

459
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,020
Darn it.

460
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,160
Then who is it?

461
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,730
Could it be An Tae Hyeon?

462
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,100
Female patient, 69 years old.

463
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,400
She had the CABG during Post-MI treatment.

464
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,930
She suffered from a ventricular septal defect.

465
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,300
Four days ago she was implanted with artificial lungs.

466
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,570
Two days ago she was extubated

467
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,100
and started breathing on her own.

468
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,910
The ejection fraction is 30%.

469
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,940
Her condition is stable.

470
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:44,810
Oh, yeah?

471
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,880
Then inject anticoagulant regularly.

472
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,550
Switch to LMWH for tedelparin.

473
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,090
She’s a patient to whom Professor Cha has been paying close attention.

474
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,420
Keep an eye on her.

475
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,060
Okay.

476
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,300
This patient was operated on by Dr. An at last, right?

477
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,170
An ECG shall be done every day.

478
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,740
Start 24-hour ECG recording after she moves to the ward.

479
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,940
Since Professor had an accident,

480
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,640
the operation was two days later than scheduled.

481
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,150
Tell her it wasn’t the professor’s fault.

482
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,580
Take good care of her till the end.

483
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,080
Okay. Got it.

484
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,620
I must have gone crazy.

485
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,930
How could I doubt my men?

486
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,470
Sunbae.

487
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,110
Professor Cha…

488
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,240
Is there anything we can do?

489
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,880
The Neurosurgery Department will take care of him.

490
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,220
Don’t you know his condition?

491
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,720
Since the clinical death has been announced,

492
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,990
he can’t be saved anymore.

493
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,650
The student is a master now.

494
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,420
He learned very well.

495
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,930
But hearing that in person seems to put him in a bad mood.

496
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,000
Hey, careful. He’ll hear you.

497
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,400
So be it.

498
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,100
Did I say anything wrong?

499
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:14,620
How long do I have to stay in the Emergency Room?

500
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,030
Professor Cha asked you to start with the basics, didn’t he?

501
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,060
Even so, with Professor Cha’s condition…

502
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,330
There’s nothing you can do up here anyway.

503
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,210
Try to understand.

504
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,780
He only said that because he’s sad about Professor Cha’s condition.

505
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,510
No matter what, it’s quite depressing.

506
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,380
I think it is.

507
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,550
What do you think…?

508
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,480
Whenever I talk to him, he’d…

509
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,890
Oops, this guy heard us. He did.

510
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,520
We must have scared him.

511
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
Who are you?

512
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,390
You can’t even recognize your patients?

513
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,530
Oh, right. We didn’t count as patients.

514
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,760
We were unsalvageable.

515
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,270
What are you talking about?

516
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,470
How come these patients are still here?

517
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,610
Have we got extra beds or what?

518
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,070
Ask them to transfer within this week.

519
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,310
How can we abandon the savable patients

520
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,610
for those unsalvageable ones?

521
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,080
Are their lives that lovely?

522
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,620
I don’t understand why they won’t just give up.

523
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,520
Just let go when the time is coming.

524
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,090
Looks like he remembers now.

525
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,260
How good is your life? Why don’t you give up?

526
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,860
Do you even know us?

527
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,330
Are you leading a great life?

528
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,870
What are you doing?

529
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,940
You’d scare people.

530
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,570
I’ll beat you…

531
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,440
Scare whom?

532
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,140
Nobody is here.

533
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,280
Well, don’t be afraid.

534
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Say hi to each other.

535
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,250
We’ll meet often anyway.

536
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,050
Since we’ve said hi,

537
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,920
let’s have a deeper conversation.

538
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,790
I’ve been holding it back these days.

539
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,230
Come here.

540
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,600
What?

541
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,110
Gosh, what’s that about? Possessed him again?

542
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,120
He… He just possessed him, right?

543
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,480
Looks like it.

544
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,750
That’s right.

545
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,720
He possessed him.

546
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,920
But he passed through the nurse just now.

547
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,160
How… How… How… did he…?

548
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,960
I don’t know.

549
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,300
Oh, I got a phone call. Hello?

550
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,400
Oh?

What are you doing?

553
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,720
How are you going to pay the price?

554
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,930
Sure. You don’t have to.

555
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,460
He does.

556
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,070
What the heck?

557
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,640
If he can, why can't we?

558
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,310
It's discrimination.

559
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,350
Uh...

560
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,690
Ah!

561
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,260
11 multiplies 1 is 11.

562
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,130
11 multiplies 2 is 22.

563
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,300
11 multiplies 3 is 33.

564
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,740
Wow, that's surprising. The kid's got a temper.

565
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,600
The kid's not supposed to be like this.

566
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,940
But he's gone too far today.

567
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,360
Ouch!

568
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,230
Are you angry?

569
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,429
I guess so.

570
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,300
Okay, I understand.

571
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,300
Hey, hey, hey, come on. You're not crazy. It's okay.

572
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,639
It's just that sometimes... you get out of control.

573
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,340
First of all, I'm sorry I misunderstood you before.

574
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,880
And I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

575
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,350
I swear, I didn't know.

576
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,719
I'm not really sure how it happened right now.

577
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,590
I'm not in a good situation either.

578
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,260
So it's already like this anyway.

579
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:44,530
What's wrong? Who is it?

580
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,770
You're so grumpy.

581
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,870
Hey, wait for me.

582
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,940
This patient fell while walking and looking at his phone.

583
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,540
According to the CT results, rib number 5 and 6 are fractured.

584
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,940
Fluid is detected on the lumbar side.

585
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,880
So?

586
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,910
Apart from the assessment of 300, there's basically nothing.

587
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,020
But the heart rate is getting faster and the blood pressure is dropping.

588
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,590
So...

589
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,260
This patient is in urgent need of surgery, but there's no operating room available.

590
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,020
So we're waiting here.

591
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,030
Something has to be done here before the surgery.

592
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,330
Er, so...

593
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,830
Since this patient is in urgent need, why did you ask me to come?

594
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,100
Well...

595
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,740
No, I was just thinking

596
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,240
maybe that person would come again.

597
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,470
Which one do you mean?

598
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,040
I'll call another doctor.

599
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,750
Wait a minute. Put the phone down.

600
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,920
Let's look at the CT.

601
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,530
I heard that the CT was taken?

602
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,830
Uh, yeah.

603
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,200
Misaligned rib number 5 on the right side.

604
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,540
I can see that there's hemothorax.

605
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,910
It's not a lot of blood, except for the chest tube.

606
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,940
If there's a rapid heartbeat and a drop in blood pressure,

607
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,140
it's not about the lung, it's a ruptured blood vessel.

608
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,750
You can't see it on the CT, so we'll have to open it up and look at it.

609
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,480
Now we start to identify the bleeding point.

610
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,320
Prepare for local anaesthesia.

611
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,750
Get the scalpel, the electrotome, and the retractor.

612
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,790
Bring in the equipment for thoracotomy.

613
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,550
Find the right angle so you can see clearly.

614
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,620
What are you doing?

615
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,760
Are you going to leave the patient unattended?

616
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,360
Uh, okay, okay, okay.

617
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,310
I've returned the favor.

618
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,850
So...

619
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:51,020
The one you talked about was just here, right?

620
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,160
Yes, I think so.

621
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,430
Oh, what am I doing?

622
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,760
Unbelievable.

624
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,310

625
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,610
I've got somewhere to be.

626
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,610
Ah, look at that guy.

627
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,980
I thought we had known each other and I should remind him.

628
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,550
Why is he running away?

629
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,450
It's not like he's going to get eaten.

630
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,320
Look at the way he sticks his neck out all day.

631
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,190
You deserve it.

632
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,630
But why can't we do that when he can?

633
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,530
Is it because they're peers?

634
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,310

and escaped unscathed.

What is it?

824
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,960
What are you doing with my patient?

825
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,670
Dr. Jang Se Jin is Professor Cha's attending physician.

826
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,270
What is going on here?

827
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,500
The Seattle hospital where Dr. Jang works

828
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,910
sent an invitation to exchange professors, and I said yes.

829
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,840
It happened that Dr. Jang had her internship at our hospital.

830
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,050
Why? What's the problem?

831
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,610
But, her being Professor Cha's attending physician is a little...

832
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,050
Professor Cha was transferred to Neurosurgery Department.

833
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,690
But the professors there felt a burden.

834
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,560
Dr. Jang happens to be a capable neurosurgeon.

835
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,890
And I'm grateful that she volunteered.

836
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,060
Was it because of Seung Tak?

837
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,430
When Seung Tak did the surgery...

838
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,730
Vice President of Administration Han Seung Won,

839
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:07,100
I think what you should be concerned about

840
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,770
is not hospital staff transfer,

841
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,270
which is the authority of the Chairman of the Council and the President

842
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:14,210
but the comatose President Jang.

843
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:18,010
What’s going on with him?

844
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,850
When I was in America,

845
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:24,290
someone sent me President Jang’s medical records anonymously

846
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,190
and asked if I could perform a surgery.

847
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,730
I was supposed to meet him when I came back, but he didn't show up.

848
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,130
I haven't heard from him since.

849
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,660
I heard that the President's surgery was a success.

850
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,030
But I don't understand why this is happening now.

851
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:40,040
The accident of Professor Cha, who was the chief surgeon, was also questionable.

852
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,270
It's weird and I have been trying to figure it out.

853
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,910
Dr. Go, can you help me?

854
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,480
So you didn't know?

855
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,810
I'm one of them who dislike Professor Cha.

856
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,680
I don't like you either.

857
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,250
Then why...

858
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,190
Didn't you just stop Professor Cha from being transferred?

859
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,520
Right, why did you...

860
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,090
It's a sense of duty, I guess.

861
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,560
For my first patient.

862
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,130
What? A sense of duty?

863
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,000
Do you think you did the surgery?

864
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,730
That's it. I don't like to think too much.

865
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,600
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

866
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,100
I don't even know what I'm thinking about.

867
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,010
Dr. Go.

868
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,840
I'll leave now. I'm off sick today.

869
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,010
Oops, headache.

870
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,280
That's so rude.

871
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:52,270
I came here like this? It's crazy.

872
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:01,750
So, how could you come like that?

873
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,550
What’s wrong with you?

874
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,760
I finally got a good look at you.

875
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:19,300
Don't you have anything to say to me?

876
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:26,710
You were with me 12 years ago, and a few days ago.

877
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,110
I have a lot to say.

878
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,180
Then you should say it.

879
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:39,990
You should have said it then, and you should say it now.

880
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,360
Look at my eyes.

881
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,130
Oh, teacher, what a blessing!

882
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,200
You've come at the right time.

883
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,000
Thank you so much for contacting me every time.

884
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,800
Thanks to you, Professor Cha was not transferred.

885
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,470
I never thought that after I called Dr. Go,

886
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,570
he came right away. I'm so lucky.

887
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,610
I didn't expect him to be like that.

888
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:04,880
I was so shocked when he pushed the bed so hard.

889
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,820
So from now on, Dr. Jang, you are

890
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,220
Professor Cha's attending doctor and guardian?

891
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,990
Yes, I’ll need your help.

892
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,780
When did autumn come?

893
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,250
I'm so...

894
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,380
I'm so busy that I don't even know the seasons have changed.

895
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,280
Since I borrowed it,

896
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,980
I'll return it twice.

897
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,550
Go Seung Tak.

898
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,130
Wow, the new FW products are out so soon?

899
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,030
That's...

900
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,400
That's a nice suit.

901
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,640
It's cool.

902
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:00,720
But a ghost's hair doesn't get messed up.

903
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,620
Ah, that’s scary.

(EunSang University Medical Center)

905
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,240
Are you sure?
(EunSang University Medical Center)

906
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:23,770
Are you sure?

907
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,370
I've told you a few times.

908
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,780
There's the guy. The new guy's coming from over there.

909
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:32,180
He ran up to him, possessed him, and left.

910
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,520
What does he want?

911
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,220
It's too boring to stay in the hospital.

912
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,920
I think he's just going out for a while to get some air.

913
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,290
He'll be back soon.

914
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,330
He's physically here, even if he's out,

915
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,360
where else would he go?

916
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:51,470
He'll have to be firmly attached to him anyway.

917
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,840
What does that mean?

918
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:11,020
If his ghost leaves his body out there...

919
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,660
What happened?

920
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,860
What happens then?

921
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:27,340
What's wrong with this madam?

922
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,500
I'll call ambulance.

923
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,470
Go Seung Tak.

924
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,510
Calm down.

925
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,150
Help me first...

926
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,890
Go Seung Tak, it's not that way.

927
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,430
Help me first...

928
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,670
Are you a doctor?

929
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,300
What?

930
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:06,780
Ah, yes, I think she’s...

931
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,520
Will he disappear and die?

932
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,830
Hey!

933
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,570
If you're still with me,

934
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,070
please save this person.

935
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,310
You have to save her.

936
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,050

(Ghost Doctor)

937
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,350
Can you see me? Can you hear me?

938
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,450
Hello? Are you with me?

939
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,550
No, I'm not with you.

940
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:57,250
Good job.

941
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,260
You're a disgrace to Thoracic Surgery Department.

942
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,890
Well done.

943
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:02,890
Good job.

944
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,090
Did he do it on purpose?

945
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:05,960
Why is that guy here again?

946
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,600
Professor Cha's not doing very well.

947
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,230
What's he doing?

948
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,030
What else? He's trying to survive.

949
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,100
I can't get inside you now.

950
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,230
I'll do it.

951
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:14,870
I'm leaving the surgery to Go Seung Tak.

952
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,600
How could you do this to me?

953
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,240
And now you're hesitating.

954
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,940
Do I look like Go Seung Tak to you?
