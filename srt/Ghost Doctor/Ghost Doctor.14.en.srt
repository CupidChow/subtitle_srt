1
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,780
My father died

2
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,150
because of me.

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,250
Yeah. I've heard of it.

4
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,390
I don't have the courage to face

5
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,450
another death.

6
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,590
I've been afraid of that for all this time.

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,360
Not because I can see ghosts,

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,590
but because I'm afraid

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,390
that someone dies because of me.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,730
But now I know

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,040
that I cannot keep living like this.

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,110
So, please teach me

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,610
how to be a qualified doctor.

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,150
A doctor who can save patients' lives with his own hands.

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,590
Didn't you say you were tired of the hospital and patients?

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,550
But I have you, don't I?

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,090
You are the one who made an ordinary person change his mind.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,630
Even death grows near,

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,000
you still won't abandon patients.

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,230
I also want to take such responsibilities,

21
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,700
like you

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,700
and that old gentleman.

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,289
Thanks to you,
(Emergency Medical Center)

26
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,990
Thanks to you,

27
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,390
I had a nice ride.

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,890
Nothing is better than home.

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,930
Oh, my home!

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Thank you for sending me back.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
See you.

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,740
You couldn't

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,610
leave because of me, right?

34
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,350
Because of me, you missed your time,

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,750
or suffered some sort of punishment,

36
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,220
so you have to stay here till now, right?

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,190
If I say yes, what will you do?

38
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,760
Will you let me leave right away?

39
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,530
Why did you save me?

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,800
Because I was

41
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,840
wearing scrubs on that day.

42
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,010
One, two, three.

-Seung Tak! Seung Tak! -Prepare for CPR.

44

Wake up!

45
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,079
Seung… Seung…

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,960
You were looking so confused,

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,190
and you kept staring at me.

48
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,160
Looking at your innocent eyes,

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,700
I somehow felt so gloomy.

50
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,710
And seeing the living were at a loss,

51
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,710
I had no other choice

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,380
but to lend a hand as a ghost.

53
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,780
I'd worn scrubs for 40 years,

54
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,050
but I still couldn't get rid of them.

55
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,890
It felt like I was carrying a heavy stone on my shoulders.

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,160
How was I supposed to resist it?

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,030
So you've been keeping an eye

58
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,000
on me ever since then, right?

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,170
You are a coward who always chooses to escape.

60
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,570
Why do I keep an eye on you?

61
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,810
As a child, you escaped for fear of ghosts.

62
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,350
As an adult, you escaped because you didn't want to be a doctor.

63
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,490
You are the one who always escapes.

64
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,390
Until one day you met someone

65
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,600
who always tries his best to save patients' lives.

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Sometimes I think it's quite cute when I see it.

67
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,240
That's right. After a long wait,

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,339
someone upon whom you once looked down may eventually catch your attention.

69
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
Looks like he's the one

70
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,950
who brought us together.

71
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,990
It had nothing to do with religion, blood type, or astrological signs.

72
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,130
It was because he borrowed someone's body to save you,

73
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,860
and then borrowed my body to save someone else.

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,400
At that time…

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,930
the one who entered your body was…

76
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,100
It was Doctor O Su Myeong of the Thoracic Surgery Department.

78
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
What is it?

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,780
You were staring at my portrait just like this on that day.

80
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,550
You feel disturbed again?

81
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,950
You traitor.

82
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,160
You promised that you'd have my back.

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,990
Why did you leave so early?

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,330
Had you stuck around longer,

85
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,000
I might have become a good doctor.

86
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,440
Look at you.

87
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,940
You can only blame yourself for lacking skills.

88
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,440
So stop thinking too much.

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,480
Don't hang up on what kind of doctor you could have become.

90
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,120
Just think that at least you saved a little boy's life.

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,590
As a doctor, it's good enough already.

92
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,260
I miss you so much.

93
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,280
Doctor,

94
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,080
it's a wise decision you made.

95
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,350
No matter what, our hospital is better for him.

96
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,620
Professor Cha works here,

97
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,190
and we are all like his family.

98
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,390
No worries. We'll take good care of him.

99
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,430
You are doing a great job already.

100
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,430
But speaking of that, you wouldn't change your mind

101
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,930
no matter how hard we tried to persuade you.

102
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,600
Yet a word of Dr. Go made you change your mind instantly.

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,070
I feels a little hurt to be honest.

104
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,470
It wasn't because of Dr. Go,

105
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,710
but him.

106
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,140
What?

107
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,150
It was his own wish to stay here.

Do you know what time it is?

You know why I'm late.

113
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,470
Couldn't you head out a little early?

114
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,810
I left around midnight.

115
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,110
Besides, I'm not the one who takes orders.

116
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,580
You talk too much.

117
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,350
Now, follow me. You need to say hi to many people.

118

How dare you order

119
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,690
a specialist around in such a age?

How many times do I have to tell you?

122

I've told you many times that I didn't do it.

123

Why did you make such a mess?

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,510
I'm going crazy.

127

Have you ever seen that I put myself in trouble?

128

Have you?

129
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,110
Then what's with that video?

130
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,950
The camera caught you walking out of that room.

131
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,720
That's why I think it's weird.

132
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,120
I remember that I walked out of the Vice President's office and went to the hallway.

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,260
But when I woke up, I found that I was in the lobby.

134
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,830
I can't remember all what happened in between.

135

Why are you looking at your cousin whom you haven't seen for a while

140
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,120
as if you were looking at a ghost?

141
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,990
I saw you quite happy the other day.

142
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,620
How come you look so terrible today like you've got doody in your mouth?

143

What?

144
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,020
Does it make you mad that you lost your champagne-opening moment?

145

Did you…

146
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,730
You said the champagne was expensive, right?

147
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,700
Then keep it well.

You entered Jang Min Ho's body, didn't you?

150
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,970
I thought you could only enter Seung Tak's body.

151
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,570
It's my secret, and it's none of your business.

152
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,410
So what are you doing here?

153
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,040
Are you going to hide in my cousin's body to harm people?

154
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,680
I will never use other people's body to harm anyone.

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,750
I will take my final revenge when the time comes.

156
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm here today to tell you something.

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
Listen up.

158
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,530
Is it necessary to say that?

159
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,760
How am I supposed to say it out loud?

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,400
It makes me shy.

161
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,860
Go ahead.

162
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,600
I…

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,570
Deliver my message.

164
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,270
It drove me crazy that I couldn't say these words to you before.

165
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,580
I want you to tell him every word I say.

No one can destroy Go Seung Tak.

Let's wait and see. It's just a beginning.

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,180
Deliver his message.

169
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,690
No one can destroy Go Seung Tak.

170
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,890
Can't you look at him harder?

171
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,920
What's that about?

172
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,160
Oh, forget it.

173
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,560
Seung Won, you made trouble again while I was away, didn't you?

174
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,400
As you can see, I'm back now.

175
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,140
Let me warn you. Stop messing with him.

176
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,370
Cha Yeong Min

177
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,440
is my master from now on.

178
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,780
-Master! -Yes!

179
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,820
How annoying you are!

180
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,020
Stand there and don't move.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,860
(ICU)

182
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,460
Nice to meet you, bro…

183
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,230
Um… professor.

184
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,030
What's going on?

185
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,330
From today on, three shifts will take turns to guard the ward around the clock.

186
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,200
You agreed to stay because of me.

187
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,340
So I need to protect you two well.

188
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,520
We are treating him with suction and antibiotic therapy.

189
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,050
Meinta is injected four times a day.

190
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,950
We also test his albumin and blood,

191
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,020
and take chest X-ray every day.

192
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,250
He's under close observation now.

193
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,090
I think he'll get better within two weeks at the soonest.

194
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,330
But if another type of acinetobacters is found during such period,

195
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,900
he might be infected again.

196
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,530
I'm sure he'll get better.

197
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,630
After all, Professor Cha has hung in there for this long.

198
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,830
He's not the type who'd give up easily.

199
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,400
He's the unbeatable Cha Yeong Min.

200
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm going to let Jang Min Ho go for now.

201
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,310
The camera only caught him entering the ward,

202
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,180
but there's no any hard evidence.

203
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,610
It's also my fault. I shouldn't have let him alone in the ward.

204
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,610
You didn't do anything wrong.

205
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,750
I'm sure Professor Cha wouldn't want you to blame yourself for it.

206
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,120
You should be positive especially at times like this

207
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,690
so that Professor Cha can feel your energy and get better.

208
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,960
Did Professor Cha ask you to send me the message?

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,930
Yes.

210
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,660
What?

211
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,160
Can you help me send him a message?

212
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,330
I'm very well. He doesn't have to worry about me.

213
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,660
I've waited for so long.

214
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,270
I don't mind waiting a little longer. I can do it.

215
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,940
No matter how long, I just want him to come back to me.

216
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,710
I often see you talk like this.

217
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,680
So I think maybe you two can really communicate with each other.

218
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,510
Like talking to the soul

219
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,550
through telepathy.

220
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,480
Come on, Dr. Jang,

221
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,020
I'm not a wizard.

222
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,890
It doesn't matter.

223
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,690
Didn't you have something to ask me?

224
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,420
I was going to ask you something.

225
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,790
But the problem is solved now.

226
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,500
I'll put all my worries aside

227
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,630
and keep only him in mind.

228
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,700
I only want him to wake up after his surgery.

229
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,370
Have you told her everything behind my back?

230
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,480
Anything happened while I was away?

231
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,610
I think we should be more careful.

232
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,410
You are always so careless.

233
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,780
Why do you always ask me to be careful?

234
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,550
You are the trouble-maker.

235
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,320
How dare you say that!

236
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm your professor.

237
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,250
Just go.

238
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,090
I still need to meet others.

239
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,290
Have you forgotten it so soon?

240
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,790
You should treat me well.

241
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm your boss.

242
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,020
I'm the teacher and you're the student.

243
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,260
I must have heard that somewhere.

244
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,070
Go Seung Tak.

245
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,130
Is that you?

246
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,430
You're finally back.

247
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,440
I said that these beds should be upgraded.

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,510
Where is our hospital's revenue used?

249
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,570
Change all the beds in this room.

250
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,510
And the bedsteads, too.

251
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,580
Also the bedsteads?

252
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,810
Brother.

253
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,610
You make lots of noise in your sleep.

254
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,450
Especially in the late night…

255
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,460
Go Seung Tak, I miss you so much.

256
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,860
Change all the desks and chairs this side.

257
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Comfy and classy ones.

258
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,530
Just this side?

259
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,810
Some gossip behind your back when you are attacked while some care about you sincerely.

260
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,840
They should be treated differently.

261
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,250
Go Seung Tak is back.

262
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,680
I didn't say anything.

263
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,610
(Intensive Care Unit)

264
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,120
Ah, here comes our novice doctor.

265
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,160
Welcome.

266
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,360
What's this?

267
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,040
He satisfied our requests.

268
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,340
I'm curious how he changed his mind.

269
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,880
Could he hear my "thank you"?

270
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,850
Your return is too ostentatious.

271
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,790
What about me? Where's my gift?

272
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,390
Why are you smiling?

273
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,160
Go Seung Tak. Seung Tak.

274
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,130
It's already installed.

275
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,900
Please enjoy.

276
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,400
I noticed a massage chair in your house.

277
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,800
You can use it here after you wake up

278
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,770
from the surgery.

279
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,140
Oh, Seung Tak.

280
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,210
I really need this.

281
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,140
Oh my.

282
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,310
Come on. You should at least say thank you.

283
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,450
It didn't cost your money.

284
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,880
What a show-off!

285
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,420
There is a headband.

286
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,790
I paid for this. I bought it.

287
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,620
Pay me the experience fee first.

288
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,060
Oh, it's nice.

289
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,630
I feel pain from neck to waist.

290
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,970
It feels so good.

291
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,200
A ghost can really do everything.

292
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,740
Ma'am, what can I do for you?

293
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,930
(Hoguanwon)
Ma'am, what can I do for you?

294
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,440
Ma'am, what can I do for you?

295
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,180
Dear Tae Sik.

296
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,310
Oh, no. Chief Ban.

297
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,520
Please pay more attention to your knees.

298
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,380
Take good care of it.

299
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,490
Your hands are unsteady.

300
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,620
But now so are your legs.

301
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,330
Well, why?

302
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,960
Why do you give me such a meaningful gift?

303
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,040
Your hands are already unsteady, if…

304
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,370
The same can't happen to your legs.

305
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,880
Take it. I…

306
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,680
Because of my betrayal and failure to guide you, you…

307
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,090
Drink it.

308
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,230
You've kept talking since you got in. Could I say something?

309
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,630
How do you know about my knees?

310
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,130
Come on.

311
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,340
Does this lady like me?

312
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,940
Oh, it's not okay.

313
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,480
Go Seung Tak, you're back?

314
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,690
Wow, that's so typical of you.

315
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,760
Did you bring us so many gifts?

316
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,560
They're not from me.

317
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,330
Then who?

318
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,160
Grandpa.

319
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,130
-President.
-Hello, president.

320
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,230
Don't mind me. Go back to work.

321
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,570
And have some snacks.

322
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,210
Why did you suddenly come here to visit me?

323
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,050
I didn't come here for you.

324
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,680
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

325
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,520
Hello, Grandpa. Why are you here?

326
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,550
I'm here to date Dr. O.

327
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,590
I wanted to contact you in advance.

328
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,360
What are these?

329
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,860
Oh, I brought them to bribe you

330
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,200
so that you can cultivate my grandson.

331
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,440
It must be hard to put up with his temper.

332
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,339
It needs some patience but I can handle it.

333
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,810
You do handle my back a lot.

334
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,410
Do you know my grandpa?

335
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,609
We've known each other for more than 20 years.

336
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,020
I've known her longer than you have, boy.

337
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,250
If you must know,

338
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,950
we date once every quarter.

339
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,990
How about a cup of tea?

340
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,950
Sure.

341
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,990
I already knew it.

342
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,730
I knew you would come back.

343
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,730
Very good.

344
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,430
How did you know?

345
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,370
I wanted to tear my resignation but it was missing.

346
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,570
No, I'm not talking about that.

347
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,470
Your grandfather died twenty years ago.

348
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,840
How did you know that he saved me?

349
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,410
How did you know?

350
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,980
Did your grandpa tell you that?

351
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,080
My grandpa also knows it?

352
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,220
Uh, well…

353
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,650
I'm also not sure.

354
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,950
What's going on?

355
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,890
Twenty years ago, you were eight.

356
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,660
What did you see that day?

357
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,660
I was very sick.

358
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,770
She's so hot with a fever.

359
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,830
Please don't get sick anymore.

360
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,960
You should grow up vigorously.

361
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,170
And you will do what you like

362
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,570
and have a happy life.

363
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,710
Grandpa loves you very much.

364
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm so sorry.

365
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,180
Grandpa.

366
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,750
Come this way.

367
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,150
Monitor.

368
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,760
Patch the monitor.

369
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,030
Doctor, oxygen saturation keeps dropping.

370
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,660
What to do?

371
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,030
He needs ECMO.

372
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,270
But Dr. O isn't there, what to do?

373
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,460
Grandpa.

374
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,470
Kid, why are you here by yourself?

375
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,770
Where are your parents?

376
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,440
My grandfather

377
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,280
got into a doctor's body.

378
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,560
What do you mean by that?

379
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,920
(Operating Room)
What do you mean by that?

380
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,800
Who got into what?
(Operating Room)

381
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,190
Who got into what?

382
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,590
My grandfather died.

383
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,560
But he got in there

384
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,370
with a boy.

385
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,720
(Operating Room)
with a boy.

386
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,590
with a boy.

387
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,970
Kid, are you all right?

388
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,470
I woke up to find myself lying in the ward.

389
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,610
Your grandpa was sitting next to me.

390
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,670
He said that boy was his grandson.

391
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,010
The operation went well and he survived.

392
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,080
I didn't know that the boy was you until I went to college.

393
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,450
So that's why you are so mean to me.

394
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,150
My grandfather tried so hard to save you.

395
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,620
However, you grew up skipping classes every day.

396
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,560
Of course I would loathe you.

397
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,060
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

398
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,390
Your grandpa said that

399
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,300
I had such a terrible fever

400
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,800
that I got confused and dreamy.

401
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,830
He asked me not to tell others about it

402
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,570
and keep it a secret between us.

403
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,610
He must have done it to protect me.

404
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,740
Because no one would believe me.

405
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,580
There were many people there at that time.

406
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,010
Was it really a dream?

407
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,820
I don't think so.

408
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,150
But I couldn't see everything as you do.

409
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,020
So I kept it to myself in confusion.

410
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,160
Only after I saw you here was I sure of it.

411
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,660
It wasn't a dream.

412
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,300
What I saw was real.

413
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,940
Back then your grandpa was the director-general and mine was a professor.

414
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,570
Congenial to each other, they became friends.

415
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,340
He comes to every anniversary of my grandpa's death.

416
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,350
So, work hard and behave yourself.

417
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,880
Maybe my grandpa is watching you.

418
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,850
He's watching all the time.

419
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,350
And he's not just watching me.

420
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,490
One more thing.

421
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,890
You must keep

422
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,700
my presence a secret to Su Jeong.

423
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
She's my baby granddaughter.

424
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,030
I want to protect her mental stability.

425
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,540
The joy of my life is to look at her.

426
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,020
What did you mean by saying those things there?

427
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,550
There? Where? What?

428
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,060
Your heart raced. You found me cute.

429
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,760
Is that true?

430
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,500
What are you going to do if it's true?

431
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,200
Nothing. I'm just curious.

432
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,640
So it's true.

433
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,560
Here I am.

434
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,760
Are you here?

435
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,470
Dear bro.

436
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,670
Why do you ask every time?

437
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,240
Could you hear me even if I answer?

438
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,910
Your granddaughter has grown up well.

439
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,310
Sure, but your grandson hasn't.

440
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,980
Maybe

441
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,790
you and I will be in-laws in the future.

442
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,660
Are you having a dream?

443
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,930
It depends on his performance.

444
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,600
She will be a top talent.

445
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I can trust her and hand patients to her.

446
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
She is a good doctor.

447
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,970
You funded my granddaughter in secret.

448
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,280
It was also a way of repaying.

449
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,350
Thank you.

450
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,150
If you repay that debt

451
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,320
to society while you are still alive,

452
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,790
I will be very grateful.

453
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,960
Both of you.

454
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,260
I shouldn't have let you go like that.

455
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,730
If I could get back,

456
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,110
I would hold you tight and never let you go.

457
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,610
You're not God.

458
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,110
How could you catch a person who was dying?

459
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,420
Take good care of yourself and live a good life.

460
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,260
You have many things to do after I leave.

461
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,860
What's your plan?

462
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,960
I heard that Go Seung Tak was back, right?

463
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,300
He came back to show off his money.

464
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,500
What's that to show off? Has he done anything right?

465
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,300
It's said that he was stimulated and ran away.

466
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,370
But he looks pretty normal.

467
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,970
Of course he's very mentally healthy.

468
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,670
We'd better admit it.

469
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,380
Because his grandpa owns the hospital.

470
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,840
Anyway, he's extraordinary.

471
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,280
I wouldn't have come back if it were me.

472
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,780
The patient must be in a good place.

473
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,260
Go Seung Tak, have you greeted him?

474
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,760
Also with my regards.

475
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,330
I've been waiting for so long.

476
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,210
Go Seung Tak, I believe you.

477
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,450
You will appear there.

478
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,560
Boy.

479
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm so glad to see you this way.

480
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,470
As you know, I can't go though I want to. Thank you.

481
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,840
Well done.

482
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,440
Have you greeted everyone?

483
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,710
It's time to start our business.

484
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,150
Have you got everything? Nothing missing?

485
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,980
The hospital has enough equipment.

486
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,490
Why do we have to take the used ones from home?

487
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,490
Don't you know that one should use a second-hand car to practice driving?

488
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,020
It's your honor to use any equipment

489
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,260
with my sweat on it.

490
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,390
By the way, did you lock the door?

491
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,090
Did you clean up?

492
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,000
Clean up?

493
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,930
If I return home to find it a mess,

494
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,840
I'll sue you for break-in.

495
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,240
But only interns practice these…

496
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,540
I heard you went through the motions as an intern.

497
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,310
So your foundation is so weak.

498
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,510
Take it as a pilgrimage.

499
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,080
Let's start with the basics.

500
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,750
Here we go. Now do the suturing.

501
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,390
Are you chatting with a banana?

502
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,000
No. Well, it's not like that.

503
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,970
Oh, darn it. Move.

504
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,110
Leave some space.

505
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,670
Space.

506
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,280
Like this.

507
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,180
Space, okay?

508
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,480
Can't you even do this? Really?

509
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,580
Why thumbs-up?

510
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,290
Do it again.

511
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,090
No, not like that.

512
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,730
I can't believe I'm teaching you this.

513
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,960
You stay here.

514
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,530
Stitch all these. All of them.

515
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,530
No sleep.

516
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,530
Start.

517
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,140
Hey, how could I finish all these in one day?

518
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,590
Are you swiping a card? A lump sum?

(Patient Safety Guide)

521
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,480
Hello.

522
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,650
How can you still smile?

523
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,220
Do you plan to teach that boy and let him save you?

524
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,790
That guy hasn't learned to walk yet.

525
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,620
It can take forever.

526
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,130
Don't be so sure.

527
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,530
Doctor, didn't you also teach me like that?

528
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:16,930
Me? Teach you?

529
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,870
When?

530
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,570
Go Seung Tak once said

531
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,040
that I was a fighter full of morale.

532
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,240
That's right.

533
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,780
I want to win.

534
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,250
Over who?

535
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,150
Those who once despised you and bullied you?

536
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,520
A ghost who possessed me.

537
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,220
I can't argue for I don't know who it was.

538
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,500
I will compete with that existence my whole life.

539
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,930
If I perform well enough, it won't possess me forever.

540
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,570
No wonder you get better day by day.

541
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,440
So does Go Seung Tak.

542
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,910
To stop me from possessing him.

543
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,210
To beat me.

544
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,910
Maybe it's the meaning of this period of time.

545
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,120
I can train this boy for the rest of my time.

546
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,500
At this critical time, you need to cheer up, Dr. Jang.

547
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,100
Only then does Professor Cha have the chance.

548
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,380
Have you eaten?

549
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,820
Dr, Jang, your hair…

550
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,790
I went out for a change of mood.

551
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,720
It's strange?

552
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,850
Looks very nice.

553
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,660
What happened? You got a haircut.

554
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,690
Did you also buy flowers?

555
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,360
I saw them on my way here.

556
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,230
I wanted to change the atmosphere in the ward.

557
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,500
Beautiful, right?

558
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,970
It's so beautiful.

559
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,670
It makes me want to wake up quickly.

560
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,380
If I can't save it,

561
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,480
no one could.

562
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Tweezers.

563
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,890
Sweet, sweet, sweet!

564
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,160
Are you okay?

565
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,400
What?

566
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,300
Yeah.

567
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,500
Be careful of the slippery floor here.

568
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,640
Don't get hurt.

569
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,880
Handsome Hoon Gil, be sure to wake up

570
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,580
and fulfill your dreams.

571
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,410
Chun Hui, it's for you.

572
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,420
A gift.

573
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,990
What's going on? Is anyone there?

574
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,830
What?

575
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,630
There's nothing.

576
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,130
Well, I told the elders to set the date for next spring.

577
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,110
Hey, isn't that you?

578
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,780
Why are you watching it secretly?

579
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,320
Hey, you said you were a courier. Turns out you are an actor.

580
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,850
So this is your movie.

581
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,050
I'm not.

582
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,860
It's just a part-time job.

583
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,660
They said the daily wage was good.

584
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,090
How handsome!

585
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,630
Only if Chun Hui had seen it.

586
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,100
She would be very happy.

587
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,200
It's embarrassing.

588
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,530
I didn't act too much.

589
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,340
Look at you. Wow! You are so handsome.

590
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,740
You really do look like an actor.

591
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,840
If you become famous in the future,

592
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,680
make sure I can get your autograph.

593
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,980
Come on! Be realistic.

594
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,580
Future? What future?

595
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,850
I have no future.

596
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,360
I can't even talk.

597
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,400
Mom, I'm back.

598
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,300
Who is it?

599
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,570
And this lady even calls me mom?

600
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,600
I'm your daughter. Of course, I call you mom.

601
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,440
I can't call you Grandma, can I?

602
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,510
How's my little thing doing?

603
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,710
You are too disobedient to be my daughter.

604
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,610
I'll come home on time from today on.

605
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,780
Whatever.

606
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,120
I'll change my department, too.

607
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,590
Really?

608
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,060
Have you changed your mind?

609
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Will you do as I say?

610
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,830
Because it's time, I'm changing my department next month.

611
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,830
To Thoracic Surgery Department.

612
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,460
What?

613
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,170
You finally end up...

614
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,500
Mom,

615
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,570
I went to medical school because I wanted to be a doctor like Grandpa.

616
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,670
I want to live like my Grandpa.

617
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,810
You silly girl!

618
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,010
What?

619
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,210
A doctor like Grandpa?

620
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,780
You mean you'll leave your family behind for the rest of your life,

621
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,780
only focus on patients

622
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,449
and die of overwork alone?

623
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,290
No. I want to be a doctor who saves lives and changes people's destinies.

624
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,560
Do you really want to see me get pissed off?

625
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,260
If you had the strength, I would say nothing.

626
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,600
You are always sick.

627
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,830
You even had to suspend your schooling a few times.

628
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,800
Why on earth do you have to take such a tiring job?

629
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,040
I want to do as I wish and live a happy life.

630
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:02,680
That's the deal I made with Grandpa.

631
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,260
Unbelievable. Instead of solving the problem, I got kicked out.

632
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,300
No... No.

633
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,800
I'm not saying you're a burden. Don't get me wrong.

634
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,540
I always failed.

635
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,840
I wonder where we should go now.

636
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,660
Come on.

637
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,030
The patient died.

638
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,580
Very good.

639
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,110
Now use your left hand.

640
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,020
Good job!

641
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,020
You have to know how to use your left hand.

-Sorry.
-Are you crazy?

646
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,660
It's fine. It's just that I'm depressed.

647
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,570
Go on, go on.

648
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,040
Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs.

Okay.

CBC results show

651
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,230
the white blood cell number decreases to 11,000.

652
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,500
So does the C-reactive protein number.

653
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,240
It's getting better. So great, Doctor Jang.

654
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,270
Yeah.

655
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,310
Looks like he's getting better and better.

656

Dr. Go hasn't been here much lately.

657
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,050
He used to be here frequently.

658
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,580
Maybe he's been too busy lately.

659
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,220
I heard he's been staying in Professor Cha's office all the time.

660
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,350
Is that the reason?

661
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,190
What has he been doing there?

662
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,200
Yeah, keep some space between them.

663
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,830
From the middle of that.

664
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,140
Take it easy.

665
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,820

00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,690
Newcomer.

670
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,360
I know you stayed up late.

671
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,900
But wake up, please.

672
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,170
Newcomer! Hey, newcomer!

673
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,500
Newcomer!

674
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,080
Dr. Go, I was just about to call you.

675
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,540
Well…

676
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,950
How could Hwang Guk Chan be transferred to another hospital so suddenly?

677
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,280
Dr. Gim, have you already told him?

678
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,720
No, I just knew it. How did you know that?

679
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,220
I told you not to tell him.

680
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,990
Everyone's so busy. It's troublesome.

681
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,290
-Of course, I must.
-Isn't it right?

682
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,190
Is it because of Han Seung Won?

683
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,960
He mentioned that last time.

684
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,100
But the patient's family rejected it, so I put it on hold.

685
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,430
He made difficulties again today.

686
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,800
No, I mean he criticized us again today.

687
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,200
He said he's cutting off the support.

688
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,540
Hwang Guk Chan's hospital bills have always been paid by the hospital.

689
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,770
After we told his family,

690
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,710
they reluctantly agreed.

691
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,080
Ridiculous! He's going too far.

692
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,050
What's going on with the support for Hwang Guk Chan?

693
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,320
There's a reason for that.

694
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,520
Will only Hwang Guk Chan be transferred to another hospital?

695
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,620
What about Choi Hoon Gil?

696
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,160
His family is more determined.

697
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,030
And his hospital expenses are borne by themselves.

698
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,490
We mentioned it a little bit last time.

699
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,800
But they didn't agree anyway.

700
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,430
There is a former officer in his family, after all.

701
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,000
We dare not offend them.

702
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,470
There's nothing to be afraid of.

703
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,010
Just do it.

704
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,370
Leave Uncle Guk Chan here and transfer me.

705
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,810
They feared I would be found out.

706
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,350
So, they left me in a corner.

707
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,350
What difference does it make whether I live or die?

708
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,720
Didn't they say I was a ticking time bomb?

709
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,520
Take this opportunity and kill me.

710
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,500
Go Seung Tak or Cha Yeong Min?

711
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,840
Tell me who you are first.

712
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,470
What did those patients do wrong?

713
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,240
Why are you taking it out on innocent people?

714
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,350
You came straight here. Looks like you are Go Seung Tak.

715
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,520
Those unconscious patients are all in your group.

716
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,550
And they all wander around in the hospital as ghosts, right?

717
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,450
I have negotiated with his guardian.

718
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,460
And he's staying. You are informed.

719
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,290
Now you even get involved in the hospital administration, don't you?

720
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,290
Do you have the right to approve the hospital bills?

721
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,030
There must be some reason why the hospital has not stopped the support so far.

722
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,200
You are always calculating.

723
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,500
You can't be so kind, can you?

724
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,040
If you really want to save those patients,

725
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,280
bring me the medical evidence you believe in.

726
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,080
What is your master doing?

727
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,750
By the way,

728
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,220
that guy gets numbness in his hands

729
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,620
in front of hopeless patients, doesn't he?

730
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,160
Has it been the same lately?

731
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,630
This guy is amazing in every way.

732
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,300
That's right though. If he were just a courier,

733
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,740
how could he afford a hospital stay for months?

734
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,210
Have you known that earlier?

735
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,040
It's me... who operated on him.

736
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,750
It seems that he doesn't get along with his parents.

737
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,480
That's why no one visited him.

738
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,890
When he suffered a traffic accident earlier,

739
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,050
he was alone in the hospital, too.

740
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,590
I thought he didn't have a family.

741
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:26,920
The traffic accident?

742
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,690
Yeah. There is a scar on his arm, so I asked.

743
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,260
He said he had a motorcycle accident three years ago.

744
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,100
He is afraid.

745
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,770
Bo Mi has left.

746
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,570
So will you.

747
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,470
If I'm gone,

748
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,870
he is afraid of being left alone.

749
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:46,380
I was alone before he got here, so I understood

750
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,480
it was very scary... and lonely.

751
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,400
I've been trying to find you.

752
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,830
What are you doing here?

753
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,500
Do you remember

754
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,370
the thing about Hoon Gil's C-line?

755
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,570
Who inserted this C-line?

756
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,270
The patient had a fever from UTI.

757
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,000
(UTI: Urinary Tract Infection)
The patient had a fever from UTI.

758
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,310
So he needed antibiotics.

759
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,710
But the original one had been used for a long time.

760
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,210
So we inserted a new one yesterday.

761
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,180
If antibiotics had been used,

762
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,650
his fever should have been gone.

763
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,950
ESR70, CIP10.

764
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,720
That's the same number.

765
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,630
It means his fever was not caused by UTI.

766
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,930
So...

767
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,500
He suddenly had breathing difficulties while delivering the packages.

768
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,400
So he was sent to the hospital in a coma.

769
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,270
The patient was diagnosed with infective intimitis and the operation was successful.

770
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,800
However, due to bleeding in the brain,

771
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,440
he became unconscious.

772
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,140
He was young and the amount of blood loss was small.

773
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,410
So, we chose to pay attention to it.

774
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,710
But there are other reasons why he hasn't woken up yet.

775
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,750
Any ideas?

776
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,020
Nope.

777
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,150
You need to find that.

778
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,520
The date of the last brain CT...

779
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:06,950
was five months ago.

780
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,790
(CT: July 29, 2021)
was five months ago.

781
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,390
(CT: July 29, 2021)

782
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,550
He had the CT scan first.
(CT: July 29, 2021)

783
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,130
He had the CT scan first.

784
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,830
He was hospitalized for a traffic accident three years ago.

785
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,330
He must have had a CT at that time.

786
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,730
Identify the hospital and get his CT scan.

787
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,830
Let's compare that.

788
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,040
OK.

789
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,310
He asked for it.

790
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,180
You know that.

791
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,750
The doctor told my family many times to prepare themselves.

792
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,990
I could die at any moment.

793
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,290
But…

794
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,960
He has a long way to go.

795
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,330
He says his dream is to be an actor.

796
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,510
These patients.

797
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,650
I want to save them,

798
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,480
if they can be saved.

799
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,090
If... Either you or these people

800
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,320
think it's not over yet…

801
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,470
You have to get to work.

802
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,700
Ready?

803
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,670
-This way. -It hurts. -Traffic accident. Five people.

804
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,900
LOC occurred after one person hit his head.

805
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,140
(LOC: Loss of Consciousness)
LOC occurred after one person hit his head.

806
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,270
Nausea and vomiting. He needs a brain CT.
(LOC: Loss of Consciousness)
LOC occurred after one person hit his head.

807
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,800
(Nausea)
Nausea and vomiting. He needs a brain CT.

808
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,110
Nausea and vomiting. He needs a brain CT.

809
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Go Seung Tak came at a perfect time.

810
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,680
Come and see the patient.

811
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,480
Just focus on the patient. Let's go.

812
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,190
One. Two. Three.

813
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,430
The motorcycle collided with a taxi.

814
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,930
The bus then came to a screeching halt

815
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,270
and many passengers fell and got injured.

816
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,400
The most seriously injured patient was the motorcyclist.

817
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,030
He's a patient with multiple trauma.

818
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:02,940
(Multiple trauma)
He's a patient with multiple trauma.

819
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,840
Get his air tube intubated first.
(Multiple trauma)

820
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,460
Get his chest intubated and check out immediately.
(Multiple trauma)

821
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,980
Get his chest intubated and check out immediately.

822
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,210
Go Seung Tak. Just intubate.

823
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,510
Sunbae Lee Seon Ho will be here soon.

824
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,150
Please prep the tube for me.

825
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,420
Oh, won't you do it all?

826
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,390
Calm down.

827
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,390
Do what you've practiced.

828
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,560
Now let the patient's neck relax completely.

829
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,290
Slow down.

830
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,900
Press the tongue with a laryngoscope.

831
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,630
Find the location of the endotracheal tube.

832
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,800
Pull open.

833
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,270
OK.

834
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,340
Go Seung Tak.

835
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,140
If you're here, why did they call me...

836
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,210
Multiple trauma. I think it's hemopneumothorax.

837
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,940
I need you to intubate in the chest.

838
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,410
Why are you still standing there, Lee Seon Ho?

839
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:46,550
Can't you see the patient's in critical condition?

840
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,950
Why don't you hurry up?

841
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,120
Oh, it works.

842
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,620
All right?

843
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,750
Is that all right?

844
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,290
Well done.

845
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:53,690
Next.

846
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:54,690
OK.

847
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,800
Come here.

848
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,970
Use right angles to get a sense of depth.

849
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,500
(Deep bite)
Use right angles to get a sense of depth.

850
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,010
Right.

851
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,040
Align with the resected surface.

852
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,180
(Resection Margin)
Align with the resected surface.

853
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,670
Don't pull it too tight.
(Resection Margin)

854
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,550
Don't pull it too tight.

855
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,550
Yes.

856
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:20,780
Check ears.

857
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,780
OK.

858
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,810
Don't you think Go Seung Tak is getting weird?

859
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,110
He used to do very difficult emergency surgeries.

860
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,650
What's wrong with him today? He's not an intern.

861
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,950
He doesn't even go to the operating room now.

862
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,250
Is it because of what happened last time that he was devastated?

863
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,950
Professor Jang Se Jin, come here.

864
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:30,720
OK.

865
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,360
Good.

866
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,390
Yes.

867
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,260
Cardiac arrest. Prepare CPR.

868
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,170
Oh, no.

869
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,010
-I don't see emergency patients. -Why?

870
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,610
There are a few more stages to get to where I am.

871
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,480
Get Dr. Han there. No ECMO.

872
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,320
ECMO Priming is 300 at a time. It's a waste of money!

873
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,260
My hands only see patients with a 1% chance of survival.

874
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,210
Go Seung Tak. It's not over yet.

875
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,110
Do something. The patient's gonna die.

876
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,550
Oh, no.

877
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,030
No.

878
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,470
You must have a sincere desire to save a life.

879
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,970
Encounter such a mind and continue,

880
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,240
so that the patient can feel.

881
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,710
Can their eyes, which confuse men and ghosts,

882
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,450
confuse the god?

883
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,160
It's back.

884
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:29,630
You did it yourself, Go Seung Tak.

885
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,430
Right.

886
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,670
I guess there's a point in nurturing him.

887
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:42,370
Dr. Go did it all by himself without Professor Cha.

888
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,510
Professor.

889
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,810
He should be watching.

890
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,870
Well, he wasn't like that from the start.

891
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,640
After Professor Cha's last surgery,

892
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,810
he went completely insane.

893
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,080
Since then, he has performed difficult operations on his own.

894
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,550
Actually, I haven't told anyone about this.

895
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:29,820
I occasionally think I see Professor Cha in him,

896
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,250
when I saw Go Seung Tak in the operating room.

897
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,600
Didn't you hear me tell you to get out?

898
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,370
I guess you haven't noticed yet.

899
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,470
Or…

900
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,340
Are you trying to hide it?

901
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,110
What?

902
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:57,350
Ask Go Seung Tak yourself.

903
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,280
No.

904
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,950
Ask Professor Cha.

905
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,690
Dr. O, which department do you want to go to?

906
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,730
I want to go to the thoracic surgery department.

907
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,230
Dr. Go was seeing someone else...

908
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,230
Is Go Seung Tak seeing anyone?

909
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,370
When he was in school, he was famous for never having a relationship.

910
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,470
I made a deal with a girl.

911
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,240
I'm going to the thoracic surgery department.

912
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,880
She's going to the neurosurgery department.

913
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,850
Do you want to go to another hospital?

914
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,590
Is your judgment of me still valid?

915
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,890
OK, then stay here.

916
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,560
Stay with me.

917
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,970
So, teach me

918
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,970
how to be a doctor.

919
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,740
I want to be a doctor who can save people with his hands.

920
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,550
Aren't you a professor?

921
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,150
You shake people who stay quiet.

922
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:07,580
You are the one who changed me.

923
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,270
It's not me inside Cha Yeong Min.

924
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,440
It's Cha Yeong Min who got inside me.

925
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,400
How…

926
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,440
How could this happen?

927
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,480
Who are you to threaten Se Jin?

928
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,720
How could you threaten her like that?

929
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,370
You haven't done it for a while…

930
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,230
If you know it's going to happen, you should practice it beforehand.

931
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,760
Yeong Min.

932
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,870
I see.

933
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,140
You were always there for me.

934
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,110
With me.

935
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,950
By my side.

936
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,510
What are you doing alone in the middle of the night?

937
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,350
As you can see,

938
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:21,920
I'm working on becoming a good thoracic surgeon.

939
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,090
Did you just see that? Did you see me?

940
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,590
Did your heart go pit-a-pat, too?

941
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,560
Well, my heart almost jumped out of my chest.

942
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,700
Oh, is this the protein drink of that time?

943
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,570
The timing is perfect.

944
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,740
It's better to drink this after exercise.

945
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,380
I've had a really good day and this tastes even better today.

946
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,050
What's the matter with you?

947
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:58,050
Is it because of your mother? Are you still avoiding her?

948
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,220
No, we're in a truce.

949
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,860
We've had a round of fighting.

950
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,460
I failed.

951
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,390
I understand how your mother would feel

952
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,560
if I saw your grandfather.

953
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,130
Of course I understand.

954
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:11,230
But I'm prepared to continue now.

955
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,570
Because there are no parents who can win their children.

956
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,270
How is Professor Jang these days?

957
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,940
Is she alright?

958
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,540
What?

959
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,080
I know you're busy with your internship right now.

960
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,450
Pay more attention to her.

961
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,580
Anyway, how can you compare me to an intern?

962
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,780
I saved a patient today.

963
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,750
With my hand.

964
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,580
Look.

965
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,720
It's an excellent hand.

966
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,860
Sure enough, you know that.

967
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,760
How do you know that?

968
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,900
Is it Go Seung Tak...

969
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,700
If Dr. Go told me, he would have told me in the first place.

970
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,970
He hasn't told me yet.

971
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,970
There must be a reason.

972
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,470
Although I don't know the details,

973
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,940
I think Professor Cha wants it that way.

974
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,610
So,

975
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,840
can you keep it from Dr. Go?

976
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,980
My legs hurt.

977
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,020
Aromatherapy is good for insomnia.

978
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,560
I heard you like lavender very much.

979
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,690
Hey.

980
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:08,560
No.

981
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,060
I heard that many people like lavender.

982
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,760
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

983
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,300
Thank you. I'll make good use of it.

984
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,440
I heard you broke your only mug.

985
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,340
Hey…

986
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:23,810
No.

987
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:28,310
Well, the sound of t breaking was heard outside.

988
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,480
Really?

989
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,520
I think about buying one, but I always forget.

990
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,380
Thank you again. I'll make good use of them.

991
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,890
No cucumber, lots of onions and pickles.

992
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,060
Hey, are you gonna be this sloppy all the time?

993
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,300
That's what I used to like.

994
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,000
What?

995
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,500
I've been eating a lot of cucumbers lately.

996
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,400
I seldom eat pickles.

997
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,970
I want to eat something else instead of bread.

998
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:57,240
Have you eaten yet?

999
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,070
(Ilmiyeo Gourmet Chicken)

1000
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,080
-Enjoy your meal. -Thank you.

1001
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,680
They said it was a gourmet restaurant.

1002
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,650
How do you think?

1003
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,790
Oh, I like chicken very much.

1004
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:20,360
It tastes good.

1005
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,370
What does Dr. Go like to eat?

1006
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,540
He said he didn't like soup.

1007
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,270
What?

1008
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,870
What does he like to eat, seafood, meat, beef or chicken?

1009
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:36,110
He prefers meat to seafood.

1010
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:39,480
He doesn't eat chicken because he had suffered from indigestion.

1011
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,630
Why do you eat out suddenly?

1012
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,800
I just want you to eat something good.

1013
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,670
I think you should be tired of eating hospital food all day.

1014
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,030
Let's eat out tomorrow, too.

1015
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:58,900
What?

1016
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,870
Come out tomorrow?

1017
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,770
I'm tired of eating alone.

1018
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:05,510
I really appreciate the food you cooked for me last time.

1019
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,880
We ate egg rolls and tofu.

1020
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,510
They're delicious. I wish I'd eaten them all.

1021
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:14,350
I should have eaten them all.

1022
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,870
I haven't taken a walk in a while. It's nice here.

1023
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,870
The air is clean and the street is nice at night.

1024
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,770
Right.

1025
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,280
It would be boring just to stay in the hospital.

1026
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,880
Why don't you take a walk like this once in a while?

1027
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,480
What?

1028
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,920
Take a walk?

1029
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,120
It was pretty there that day.

1030
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,350
I want to go with him next time.

1031
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,820
It should be winter by then.

1032
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,230
But it should be beautiful in winter, too.

1033
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:01,160
It's beautiful even in winter.

1034
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,870
I made a deal with him.

1035
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,370
After we got our qualification certification, we'd go to the Alps.

1036
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:10,440
Not after the qualification certification, but after the internship.

1037
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,330
Do you want a hot drink?

1038
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,260
I'll treat you...

1039
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,960
I'll go get it. Just give me a second.

1040
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,640
That's weird.

1041
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,640
What's the matter?

1042
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,280
Pick up the phone.

1043
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,720
Why did you have to let me find you?

1044
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,890
You have something.

1045
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,590
Does your boyfriend in his hospital bed know that

1046
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,160
you've moved on?

1047
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,230
I hate that hospital. I can't get in.

1048
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:11,530
I've got someone waiting for you to get out.

1049
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,170
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.

1050
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,500
We have things to talk about, don't we?

1051
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,440
I don't have anything to say. Go away.

1052
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,740
Stay here. Can I eat you?

1053
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,610
Just a chat between brother and sister.

1054
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:23,910
Let me go.

1055
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,910
Will you not let me go?

1056
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,520
Darn it

1057
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,420
It would really drive me crazy.

1058
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:37,890
Good, because I got beaten last time, I haven't been sleeping well lately.

1059
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:42,230
Hey, let him pay the debt.

1060
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:51,040
Dr. Go. Dr. Go.

1061
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,150
Get out of the way. Dr. Go.

1062
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,920
No.

1063
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,790
Watch out. Cha Yeong Min.

1064
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,500
Seung Tak.

1065
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:24,310
No.

1066
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,380
Go Seung Tak.

1067
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:33,880
Wake up, please.

1068
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:42,890
Wake up!

1069
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:45,190
Wake up.

1070
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,080
Yeong Min.

1071
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:06,510
Cha Yeong Min.

1072
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,720
Yeong Min.

1073
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,910
Didn't you say you'd accumulate it and do it all at once?

1074
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,680
That doesn't mean you can put up with it.

1075
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,940
Let's take this opportunity to do it again.

1076
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,050
Are you in a lot of pain?

1077
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,110
Your darling is here.

1078
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,250
You've always asked Seung Tak for help recently.

1079
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,520
Don't do that. Let's make a rule.

1080
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,850
A life with blood on hands.

1081
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,440
Can there be any change at the second time?

1082
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:19,820
(Preview of the next episode
Ghost Doctor)
Can there be any change at the second time?

1083
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,490
I won't last long if it goes on like this.
(Preview of the next episode
Ghost Doctor)

1084
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:22,820
I'm his guardian.

1085
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:23,730
I'll decide.

1086
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,360
I also have the responsibility and power over him.

1087
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,300
You'll do your surgery, right?

1088
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,200
Where did he go?

1089
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:29,930
What's going on?

1090
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:30,570
Seung Tak.

1091
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,200
Can't you see me?

1092
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Can't you hear me?
