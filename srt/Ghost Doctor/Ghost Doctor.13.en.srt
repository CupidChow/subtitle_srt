1
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,840
It's so hot.

2
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,520
Hey, Seung Tak, put the life vest on.

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,820
Hurry. Put it on.

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,760
Ah, Dad, this one is huge…

5
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,060
Seung Tak!

6
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,830
Doctor, the oxyhemoglobin saturation is dropping!

7
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,830
What?

8
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,259
What should we do?

9
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,170
We need to connect him to the ECMO machine.

10
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,330
We need to connect him to the ECMO machine.

11
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,540
But Professor O is not available.

12
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,800
What do we do?

13
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,390
Hey, Go Seung Tak, where are you going? Hey!

14
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,260
(Episode 13)

15
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,830
What caused the death of the patient exactly?

16
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,200
The fractured ribs caused rupture of the descending aorta,

17
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
resulting in hypovolemic shock.

18
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,700
Any mistake made by the surgical team?

19
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
I don't think it's Dr. Go's mistake.

20
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,440
The patient's blood pressure suddenly dropped

21
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,770
while they were still waiting for Professor Jeon.

22
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,980
It was an emergency.

23
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,740
They had to do something.

24
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,150
But it already ruptured when they opened the patient's chest.

25
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,350
So it's not a medical malpractice, right?

26
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,850
Under such circumstances, a resident physician

27
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,190
would press on it with hands while waiting.

28
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,690
You don't even have to do it yourself.

29
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,890
But I think Dr. Go wanted to try his best to save the patient's life.

30
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,190
Plus, it's said that the patient had such underlining disease as high blood pressure,

31
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,430
which means his descending aorta is larger than normal,

32
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,130
so it's more fragile.

33
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,940
No matter what, Dr. Go did everything

34
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,500
he could in such extreme situation.

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,710
You all can't wait to express your opinions, can you?

36
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,079
If others hear you, they may think you are in this together.

37
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,650
Is that what you are going to say to the patient's family?

38
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,720
Yes. Since the patient passed away, we should take responsibilities.

39
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,250
But it's more of a moral obligation.

40
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,320
I mean it shouldn't be considered a medical malpractice.

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,890
We can look into that in the future then.

42
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,230
Although, why are you here, Chief Ban?

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,590
What?

44
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,700
Aren't you supposed to be in the Operating Room right now?

45
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,870
What do you mean the operation is canceled?

46
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,740
Is it really canceled,

47
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,670
not postponed for a few hours?

48
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,170
Well… Something happened in our department.

49
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,610
The Chief is distracted.

50
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,150
I don't know what happened exactly,

51
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,010
but what are we going to do with his operation?

52
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,920
When will they be ready to do it?

53
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm not sure.

54
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,190
Where's Dr. Go Seung Tak?

55
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,750
Wait. Professor Jang.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,130
Actually Go Seung Tak is involved in the thing.

57
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,770
What am I supposed to do?

58
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,440
Why would this happen?

59
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,440
Go Seung Tak, stop!

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,040
You can't leave like this!

61
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,910
Seung Tak!

62
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,060
Go Seung Tak! Darn it.

63
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,930
Go Seung Tak! Seung Tak!

64
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,600
Seung Tak!

65
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,740
I can't believe him.

66
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,010
I told you to be more careful.

67
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,380
Oh, well.

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,420
I was pushed out during the operation.

69
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,490
I tried to get back, but it didn't work.

70
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,659
Why did it have to happen at that time?

71
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,360
Even if it hadn't happened, it would've still been hard to save his life.

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,400
That's why you should stop when you don't feel well.

73
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,070
Why do you have to borrow his hands to save the patient?

74
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,940
It wasn't me this time.

75
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,300
I saw the look in his eyes.

76
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,710
(EunSang University Medical Center)

77
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,310
The same look as yours back then, right?

78
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,850
If you are that serious,

79
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,350
you should strive for the goal you set for yourself with your own strength.

80
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,550
Or maybe you should talk him into changing his mind when he's back.

81
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm not sure if he'll come back.

82
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,930
Whenever I have such experience, I know

83
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,800
that I can't do it with my own hands.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,130
Even if I'm not able to save people's lives,

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,630
I can't just watch them die.

86
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,140
It's my fault. I shouldn't have got in.

87
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,940
That way, at least the patient wouldn't have died on his operating table.

88
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,380
Gosh. Since you know that,

89
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,710
why are you still sitting here

90
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,950
and saying things like, "Oh, it's my fault."

91
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,120
Is it the time for that?

92
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,180
If you know it's your fault,

93
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,750
you should try to make things right.

94
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,920
No matter it's you or him,

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,220
seeing what you've done,

96
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,730
I really want to punch you guys.

97
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,400
Alright, I'm leaving.

98
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,170
-Oh, is it Go Seung Tak? -The subscriber is not available.

99
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,870
-Where is he? What did he say? -Your call will go to voicemail.

100
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,510
Why is his phone off?

101
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,450
Please answer your phone.

102
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,320
So why did he volunteer to do it?

103
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,680
Did he think he could make a miracle?

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,290
He was so arrogant.

105
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,090
He overestimated himself,

106
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,360
and he caused a big trouble as a result.

107
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,820
It's not the time to say that, okay?

108
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,760
If it'd been you guys,

109
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,690
you wouldn't have even dared touch the patient.

110
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,300
You would've watched, and that's it.

111
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,600
At least Go Seung Tak tired his best to save the patient.

112
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,680
The subscriber is not available. Your call will go to voicemail.

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,740
Intern O, can you get a hold of Go Seung Tak?

114
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,880
You can't reach him either?

115
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,350
His phone is off, and he hasn't checked his messages.

116
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,620
What's going on with Go Seung Tak?

117
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,620
He went out and has been out of reach.

118
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,460
It wasn't a small accident after all.

119
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,790
I knew he'd make trouble sooner or later.

120
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,560
How could he step up when he can't even tell the difference between poop and pee?

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
Do you want a beating?

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,930
You think doctors are screens?

123
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,830
You think we should only stand aside and watch?

124
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,600
Isn't that what doctors should do, stepping up when there's a patient?

125
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,340
And patients are not poop or pee.

126
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,480
How about hotels?

127
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,780
We are checking the hotels in Seoul right now.

128
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,450
But there's no sign of him so far.

129
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,080
He left his car in the parking lot of the hospital.

130
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,620
So we can't locate him through GPS.

131
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,280
He didn't go home either?

132
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,920
He's not home?

133
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,890
I couldn't reach him either,

134
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,530
so I came here to see if you've found him.

135
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,360
Looks like it was a big blow to him.

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,100
But he should at least go home. The elders are all worried about him.

137
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,799
Don't worry too much.

138
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,740
I think he just needs some time.

139
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,010
Seung Tak is much stronger than you think.

140
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,540
He'll get over it and come back bravely.

141
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,080
Thank you.

142
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,280
And don't worry about the operation.

143
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,290
We'll put the needs of the patient's family in the first place,

144
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,890
and take good care of it.

145
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,920
As you know, that's what I'm good at.

146
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
Seung Won,

147
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,700
about your uncle, Seung Tak's father,

148
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,840
you know he died for saving Seung Tak's life, right?

149
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,880
I know. Because of the boat accident 20 years ago.

150
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,080
And you also remember that he started

151
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,350
to have those strange symptoms

152
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,780
because of the trauma, right?

153
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,320
Seung Tak used to be an outgoing, thoughtful kid.

154
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,430
How did such a kid go through

155
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,660
all these years after the accident?

156
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,940
I'm scared, Seung Won.

157
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,620
I'm afraid that he'd go to somewhere far away again.

158
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,820
Since your son is so precious to you,

159
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,830
why did you let him become a doctor?

160
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,360
You know very well what a hospital is like.

161
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,730
It never occurred to you that something like this would happen?

162
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,230
Nothing would've happened if you hadn't let him be a doctor.

163
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,740
I did give you a chance.

164
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,050
I know the situation now, but his operation…

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,480
If Dr. Go can't do it,

166
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,750
we still have other resident physicians.

167
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,960
But Professor Cha's operation must be performed when Go Seung Tak is around.

168
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,730
Who said that? Chief Ban?

169
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,130
I think so as well.

170
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,060
It's not someone else. It's Professor Cha's operation.

171
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,970
I think we need our genius surgeon Go Seung Tak more than ever.

172
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,270
I know Dr. Go is an excellent surgeon.

173
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,870
But after all it's only his first year as a doctor.

174
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,840
But he's not an ordinary doctor.

175
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,370
His skills can definitely be on a par with the best specialist.

176
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,010
To be honest, he wasn't this good in the beginning.

177
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,110
But after Professor Cha's cardiac tamponade operation, he changed dramatically.

178
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,120
He even completed a very complicated operation all by himself after that. So amazing!

179
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,130
I think it's impossible to blame the chief surgeon for the death of the patient.

180
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,100
After all the doctor did what he was supposed to do when the patient's life was in danger

181
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,970
instead of doing nothing. If you only focus on the death of the patient,

182
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm afraid it'll trigger criticism and protest

183
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,370
not only in our hospital, but also in the entire medical field…

184
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,510
People would misunderstand if they heard it.

185
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,080
Don't tackle with it head-on.

186
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,880
Let's explain it from the angle of medical judgment and medical principles.

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
And the hospital will pay

188
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,680
for the medical bills and funeral expenses.

189
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,250
As for the death benefit… maximize the amount.

190
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,960
Okay.

191
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,820
Got it.

192
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,590
Then how should we deal with Dr. Go Seung Tak's punishment you ordered earlier?

193
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,130
He's done for. Why bother?

194
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,860
Any unnecessary move may cause more trouble.

195
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,330
Just let him go.

196
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,440
He left himself. He won't come back again.

197
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh.

198
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,770
Right. He won't come back anymore.

199
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,440
Just wait for him to hand in a resignation letter and that's it.

200
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,680
I was wondering why I felt chills. Turns out you are here.

201
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,850
Oh? You can feel my presence?

202
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,160
Then why don't you open the window and jump out

203
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,020
before I push you down?

204
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,130
Are you going to take this chance to squeeze your cousin out?

205
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,060
I'm afraid it's not the first time you've tried it.

206
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,600
You want to defeat him without lifting a finger, right?

207
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,840
Not me.

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,270
It's you, Cha Yeong Min, who destroyed him.

209
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,840
What?

210
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,670
You know that he made me suffer a lot.

211
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,410
But you are the one who broke his wings.

212
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,110
You didn't know when to stop, did you?

213
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,480
He was not a normal kid to begin with. What have you done to him?

214
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,660
Let's make it clear. I didn't make you become like this on purpose.

215
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,290
You became like this because of your bad luck.

216
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,030
Why can't you stop complaining?

217
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,370
And what did Seung Tak ever do wrong?

218
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,400
I don't understand why you always talk about operations.

219
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,570
As it turned out, you ruined my cousin for your personal interests,

220
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,840
and you even

221
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,150
want to put an end to it.

222
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,390
Are you happy now?

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,690
No.

224
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,260
I feel like it's the end of the world.

225
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,460
I didn't know he experienced such an unfortunate accident.

226
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,670
I'm concerned about him.

227
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,170
After all, that boy is weak mentally.

228
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm afraid he'll get hurt.

229
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,940
I feel so upset.

230
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,510
I want to see him but I can't get out.

231
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,910
Uh, what am I doing here? Darn it!

232
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,750
Anyway,

233
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,220
you get it wrong.

234
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,250
It's not true

235
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,120
that Go Seung Tak has been ruined.

236
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,490
It's impossible to end it this way.

237
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,460
What do you know?

238
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,030
Do you know Go Seung Tak better than I do?

239
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,400
Did you say that Professor Cha's surgery

240
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,830
must be done with Dr. Go around?

241
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,840
Ah, you also know that?

242
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,770
You must have heard about it.

243
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,240
Let me explain.

244
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,710
Though it's his first year,

245
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,840
Dr. Go has become the trump card of our department.

246
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,480
You've never seen it so you'll find it unbelievable.

247
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,180
Have you seen the process

248
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,020
of Dr. Go's surgery yourself?

249
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,750
Of course.

250
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,620
I've seen it

251
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,490
several times.

252
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,560
It's improper to let things like this go public.

253
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,830
Everyone was shocked the day Dr. Go first operated.

254
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,260
Were we bewitched?

255
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,630
Or was Go Seung Tak possessed by a ghost?

256
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,530
It's hard to tell if it only happened once.

257
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,770
But it got more and more…

258
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,440
All sorts of magical medical skills.

259
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,750
It was really an incredible enigma.

260
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,880
It made me doubt if there was really a ghost

261
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,690
or if he was a god from heaven.

262
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,020
Did Dr. Go mention himself that he wanted to do the surgery for Professor Cha?

263
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,060
Of course, he did.

264
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,290
He did more than that.

265
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,660
He cried his eyes out.

266
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,330
He has a strong will to save Professor Cha.

267
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,530
The OR was also prepared by him.

268
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,900
So, anyway,

269
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,000
how about waiting for him a little longer?

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,610
If you insist, we can do it too.

271
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,870
I'm full of confidence.

272
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,680
I can guarantee you.

273
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,410
But I want to leave Professor Cha to a top doctor.

274
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,080
Professor Cha is my student. I really cherish and love him.

275
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,950
If you really care about him, why is he still in bed?

276
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,820
What?

277
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,690
I can't wait that long.

278
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,760
If you must have Dr. Go do it,

279
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,660
please get him back soon.

280
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,260
Otherwise, I would ask others for help.

281
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,700
Dr. Go…

282
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,430
will come back.

283
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,900
Though Dr. Go is so mysterious that I can't understand him,

284
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,370
I'm sure of one thing.

285
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,080
He wants to save people more than anyone.

286
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,480
That's why he often makes us feel ashamed.

287
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,970
Professor Cha.

288
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,540
Are you here now?

289
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,310
Could you hear me?

290
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,520
If you can, could you please give me a signal?

291
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,160
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,630
I didn't break in.

293
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,530
Well, I've knocked.

294
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,330
It's okay.

295
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,070
Are you Dr. O Su Jeong?

296
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,770
Do you know me?

297
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,040
I saw you a few times in the emergency room.

298
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,869
Are you Dr. Go's friend?

299
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,240
I was going to look for you.

300
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,609
Could you get in contact with Dr. Go?

301
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,780
No, I haven't contacted him yet.

302
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,980
I thought you could reach him.

303
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,750
By the way, why are you here?

304
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,290
Oh, right.

305
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,560
Have you had lunch?

306
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,160
I don't know what you like.

307
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,790
So I picked some food convenient for packing.

308
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,030
It seems that my face can stir others' desire to bring me food.

309
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,630
What?

310
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,300
Dr. Go did the same.

311
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,500
He would ask if I had meals when he saw me.

312
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,170
Ah?

313
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,640
Go Seung Tak reminded you to have meals?

314
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,210
I thought he would never do these things.

315
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,350
Nice.

316
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,650
He usually brings me hot soup.

317
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,750
It's strange how he knew it.

318
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,220
Very strange.

319
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,690
He said that soup made him feel full so he didn't like it.

320
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,460
But he knows your preferences so clearly.

321
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,930
What a good man!

322
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,260
He has never bought me any food.

323
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,170
Did you come for him to have lunch with me?

324
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,770
Um, well…

325
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,110
I just feel that I should do something.

326
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,710
It's boring to just stand by and watch.

327
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,980
I can't completely fill his vacancy,

328
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,820
but I can at least do these things.

329
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,490
At this point, it's also a way to comfort him

330
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,260
by expressing his caring for you.

331
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,360
I hope that he won't get angry with me

332
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,660
for I only bought you the simple food.

333
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,600
You are such a good friend.

334
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,530
Oh, it's not a big deal.

335
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,140
As a senior, I make you youngsters so worried.

336
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,440
I feel so ashamed.

337
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,640
Thank you.

338
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,740
I'll enjoy your food.

339
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,650
Dr. Go once said that Professor Cha

340
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,220
would get better only when I took good care of myself.

341
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,750
I believe him.

342
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,420
So I'll take good care of myself.

343
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,520
Please don't worry about me anymore.

344
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,860
Go to help your friend.

345
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,030
He helped me a lot when I had a hard time.

346
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,730
But as you can see, now I…

347
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,200
I have only time and energy for Professor Cha.

348
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,430
Okay, I will.

349
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,270
Let's eat and fight together.

350
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,270
Okay.

351
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,110
Let's enjoy the food.

352
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,140
It looks delicious.

353
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,010
Seung Tak, you have a good friend.

354
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,510
Now I owe more debts to you.

355
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,280
Will a drowning man hang on until someone gets him out?

356
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,780
What?

357
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,220
Patients don't always wait until a doctor comes.

358
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,360
I was afraid when I was a child.

359
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,330
Of course, I would be afraid.

360
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,990
After all, I was only eight then.

361
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,200
Where is the boy? What's he doing?

362
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,170
He must be alone.

363
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,880
I haven't cooked for long. I'm a terrible cook.

364
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,510
Had I known it,

365
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,950
I would have practiced more.

366
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,290
(EunSang University Medical Center)

367
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,600
Why isn't the newcomer here? I'm so sleepy.

368
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,370
Where's Hoon Gil? He said he would stay here with me.

369
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,840
Ahh?

370
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,910
Honey.

371
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,080
You know what?

372
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,320
Hye Jin has submitted applications to various universities.

373
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,060
Ji Won has passed the assessment of a university's professor appointment.

374
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,430
She has just woken up for a few days.

375
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,530
It's okay. You'll catch up with them soon.

376
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,830
You can leave the hospital in two weeks.

377
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,370
If you study harder after that,

378
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,030
you can finish your paper by next spring.

379
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,800
Mom, I'm reading.

380
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,370
Could you stop talking?

381
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,170
What?

382
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,180
I'm saying that your friends are becoming professors.

383
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,150
Aren't you worried that you may get left behind?

384
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,810
When did I ever…

385
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,450
say that I wanted to be a doctor and then a professor?

386
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,390
It's your dream.

387
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,590
You're the one who's worried.

388
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,620
You're afraid that your daughter can't be a doctor.

389
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,790
Great.

390
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,820
Well said!

391
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,130
What's wrong with you recently?

392
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,760
Is it kind of after-effects?

393
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,170
(Henri Bergson)

394
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,100
Did you bring me this book?

395
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,770
How did you know it? Where did you get it?

396
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,440
What?

397
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,610
Isn't it your book?

398
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,580
I just went to your place and took some.

399
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,810
Did Su Mi put it there?

400
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,490
She can't see me.

401
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,990
I'm a ghost. Why am I hiding?

402
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,760
It must be the newcomer who did it.

403
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,130
Mr. Bak would show off again.

404
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,140
Anyway, where is he and what is he doing?

405
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,770
I haven't said my request.

406
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,300
An Tae Hyeon.

407
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,770
Why do you come here?

408
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,200
Aren't you ashamed?

409
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,810
Honey.

410
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,280
How are you these days?

411
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,520
I'm sorry for not coming to see you often.

412
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,090
Jun Yeong went to a basketball match with his friend.

413
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,790
He said his favorite player would come today.

414
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,360
And he let me say sorry to you.

415
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,830
He said he would visit you next time.

416
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,730
Oh, I see.

417
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,300
It's okay.

418
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,170
Of course, he would choose his favorite player.

419
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,030
Who wants to visit a sick father?

420
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,600
He might feel worse to see me like this.

421
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,170
You must be busy.

422
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,540
You don't need to visit me often.

423
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,710
But there's an amazing thing.

424
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,050
I did as it said.

425
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,780
And the taste is the same as what you made.

426
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,750
Jun Yeong likes it very much.

427
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,350
He said it tasted almost the same as yours.

428
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,150
I always sell them out in a short time.

429
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,850
At this rate,

430
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,090
we can be rich very soon.

431
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,790
Is that so? Yeah, great!

432
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,100
Really great.

433
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,560
But…

434
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,030
Did you write this down

435
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,530
for us specially?

436
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,570
It doesn't look like your handwriting.

437
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,440
I don't know where he got this.

438
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,770
You are so…

439
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,310
Since it's for us, why didn't you give it to us earlier

440
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,680
or teach me step by step directly?

441
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,510
If so, we wouldn't have been driven out by others.

442
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,520
That's because I didn't want you to suffer.

443
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,620
I wanted to take everything by myself.

444
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,530
Honey.

445
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:22,470
You worked so hard to buy that shop.

446
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,680
I'm sorry.

447
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,610
I failed to keep it in our hands.

448
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm the one who should say sorry.

449
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,730
It's all my fault. I made you suffer.

450
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,400
I'm really sorry, honey.

451
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,300
But again, that person was quite funny.

452
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,500
He said that you were waiting for us

453
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,240
and asked me to bring our son to visit you.

454
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,440
Who did he think he was?

455
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,240
I wanted to say thank you to him.

456
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,380
It turned out that he had a day off today.

457
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,720
Oh, you are talking about the new doctor.

458
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,820
I will convey it for you.

459
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,270
Here comes our trump card.

460
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,110
Dr. An, it's been long.

461
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,880
What's going on? What do you want?

462
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,720
What can I do for you?

463
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,420
Dr. An, it's time to reinstate you in your post.

464
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,190
What?

465
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,990
Sure.

466
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,760
How could a doctor as highly skilled as Dr. An

467
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,930
take such a long rest?

468
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,890
It's said that if a doctor rests for too long,

469
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,830
his hands will rust.

470
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,800
Right?

471
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,570
There happens to be a doctor now

472
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,400
who has an important operation to perform

473
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,830
but left without permission.

474
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,400
The patient urgently needs you to operate.

475
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,340
A patient in urgent need of surgery?

476
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,680
What kind of patient…

477
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,810
Cha Yeong Min.

478
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,440
What?

479
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,380
Are you asking me to operate on Professor Cha?

480
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,420
It doesn't matter who he is.

481
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,150
What matters is the surgery itself.

482
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,420
What do you mean…

483
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,350
Not long ago, a patient died

484
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,760
during the process of surgery.

485
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,020
But people say that

486
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,000
it's an irreversible situation in order to save the patient's life.

487
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,130
Besides, dangerous things happen

488
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,570
when doctors perform surgery,

489
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,040
some of which cause death.

490
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,840
Anything wrong?

491
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,310
The personnel office will inform you of your reinstatement soon.

492
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,080
Then please resume your post and finish your first operation.

493
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,280
Why are you telling me this here…

494
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,820
What?

495
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,450
Are you afraid that he's looking at you?

496
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,790
Even if he is, so what?

497
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,190
What can he do?

498
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,990
Seung Tak is not here anyway.

499
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,060
Well, what's that?

500
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,030
Oh, this.

501
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,130
This is a reinstatement gift

502
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,400
prepared for Dr. An in advance.

503
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,310
After you finish the surgery,

504
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,810
let's open it and celebrate.

505
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,280
Don't screw it up like last time.

506
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,280
And don't leave any evidence.

507
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,290
This wine is very expensive, you know?

508
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,720
It's really good wine.

509
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,090
I didn't think you knew it.

510
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,270
(Room 4202, Building 102, Iareuk, No. 54-32, Iwon Road, Gangnam Gu, Seoul Password 1206)

511
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,770
It's Professor Cha's residence.

512
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,010
Dr. Go visits there occasionally.

513
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,950
I suppose he might be there now.

514
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,720
Well…

515
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,050
If you see him,

516
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,720
could you tell him I'd like to meet him?

517
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,060
There's something I'd like to ask him in person.

518
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,630
Excuse me.

519
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,690
What are you doing here?

520
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,930
How did you know I was here?

521
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,430
I just came to capture you back.

522
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,500
Come with me while I can negotiate.

523
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,250
Why are you still here?

524
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,120
Just put something on and get out of here.

525
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,220
I'm an intern and I don't have much free time.

526
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,090
Is it Dr. Jang or Nurse Jeong

527
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,120
who wants to see me?

528
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,790
Dr. Jang.

529
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,330
She said if you didn't want to come with me,

530
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,900
I would drag you and take you back.

531
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,030
How did she know I was good at it?

532
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,730
I hear it's all sorted out, right?

533
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,240
Well, all that's left is me.

534
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,870
I have my written resignation in the living room.

535
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,880
Submit it for me.

536
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,210
I'm sick and tired of all the calls.

537
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,350
I wonder if this one is OK.

538
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,720
This style is not good enough.

539
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,160
Do you know I had a crush on you?

540
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,160
What?

541
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,290
You ran up to me in your doctor's uniform,

542
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,500
happily saying that the patient was saved,

543
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,160
and I thought you were very handsome.

544
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,330
I can see you're genuinely happy.

545
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,700
Every time I see you like that,

546
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,970
my heart is pounding, too.

547
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,410
I often think, if my grandpa saw you,

548
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,710
how happy he would be.

549
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,940
Why do you mention your grandpa?

550
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,810
He never even met me.

551
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,610
Didn't you say he was dead?

552
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,620
He died 20 years ago.

553
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,380
When he died,

554
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,950
he saved a little child.

555
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,760
So, I feel even sadder.

556
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,460
Because that little child is here right now and I'm so worried about him.

557
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,700
What are you talking about?

558
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,530
I have to go out.

559
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,500
Now that you're here, you might as well take a break.

560
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,340
I'm gonna go.

561
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,570
You know Professor Cha's surgery was delayed, right?

562
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,140
He must be waiting for you.

563
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,880
I think you know that better than I do.

564
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
There are so many doctors in this hospital,

565
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,310
they'll do the surgery.

566
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,280
Professor Jang is waiting for you, too.

567
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,220
She said she had to ask you something in person.

568
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,520
Really? I don't think we need to see each other anymore.

569
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,560
I just told you how I felt. You...

570
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,970
Oh god.

571
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,900
I should have just hit him with my fist.

572
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,540
Are you crazy?

573
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,970
What do you want me to do for you?

574
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,040
Time is running out.

575
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,240
I guess you are really crazy.

576
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,840
No matter how crazy you are,

577
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,180
what do you think I am?

578
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,780
I'm a discreet and classy ghost.

579
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,010
Didn't you help me when I saved Seung Jo?

580
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,720
Do you think the situation was the same as it is now?

581
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,580
It was the same with Hoon Gil.

582
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,320
I disagree. Why do you still talk so much?

583
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,820
Then, why did you...

584
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,830
What were you doing in the operating room that day?

585
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,630
What?

586
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,300
What are you waiting for?

587
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,170
Just pick up the scalpel.

588
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,240
Really…

589
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
It's all water under the bridge.

590
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,770
Why bring it up?

591
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,070
If you had come in earlier,

592
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,280
would the patient have survived?

593
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,210
What do you mean?

594
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,110
I could be a ghost in a hospital for 20 years,

595
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,720
but I can't do surgery.

596
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,620
What did you do when you got inside me?

597
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,260
That day 12 years ago,

598
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,990
and a few times since,

599
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,830
you saved patients' lives with my hand.

600
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,590
You are a doctor.

601
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,230
A thoracic surgeon.

602
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,800
With superb medical skills.

603
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,230
And you're in debt to me.

604
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,670
Are you sure you've got your calculations right?

605
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,140
Aren't you supposed to owe me? Why do I owe you?

606
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,810
It won't be long before I have surgery.

607
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,980
If I go into surgery,

608
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,250
I'll die.

609
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,920
If you're not careful, you could be dead before you get to the operating room.

610
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,920
This time…

611
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,990
Please don't stand by

612
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,190
and watch me die.

613
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,900
Doctor.

614
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,200
-Son.
-My dear mom.

615
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,470
Are you feeling restless because of me?

616
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,770
Yes.

617
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,440
Do you have any idea how worried I've been?

618
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,950
Well, here I am.

619
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,380
I don't want to worry my mom.

620
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,820
Look at you.

621
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,850
Do you eat regularly?

622
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,520
Mom, have you ever seen me hungry?

623
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,360
You know I only eat expensive and good food.

624
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,960
Why don't you go home?

625
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,200
Where do you live?

626
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,660
I have a secret place to stay anyway.

627
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,900
Keep it a secret from Grandpa.

628
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Your grandpa's worried about you.

629
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,840
You know that, right?

630
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,140
Although he doesn't show much emotion,

631
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,610
he loves and cherishes you very much.

632
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,080
I know

633
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,720
you must be very tired to be on my side

634
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,660
between my undemonstrative grandpa and me.

635
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,330
I don't like it either,

636
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,330
but it's happening again.

637
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,540
Mom, I have something to say.

638
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,800
I'm hungry.

639
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,740
Let's order first.

640
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,929
Don't be too shocked and don't cry too often.

641
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,300
I'll be fine.

642
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,670
It's gonna be okay.

643
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,139
I'm not doing it to die.

644
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,199
I'm doing it to live.

645
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,969
I want to be alive and be with you.

646
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,210
Hello?

647
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,480
The emergency room needs you.

648
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,219
Okay.

649
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,429
What does he want?

650
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,429
I can't believe he's doing this.

651
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,670
(Emergency Center)

652
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,540
I don't care. Whatever!
(Emergency Center)

653
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,370
I don't care. Whatever!

654
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,010
It's delicious.

655
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,850
Let's eat here again sometime, son

656
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,420
Mom.

657
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,090
I remember that day.

658
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,290
When you were about ten,

659
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,870
you came downstairs one morning with a big smile on your face.

660
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,900
Mom, I'm hungry.

661
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,100
Cook for me.

662
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,440
The day you said that.

663
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,240
Wow, it's delicious.

664
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,810
Cook it for me again.

665
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,450
The day you said that.

666
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,680
From that day,

667
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,420
you pretended to forget everything.

668
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,590
You pretended not to care.

669
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,260
You laughed louder

670
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,220
and acted more innocently,

671
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,100
as if you're deliberately showing the appearance of rich children.

672
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,140
I know you're doing this because of me.

673
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,410
You think you took dad away from me.

674
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,580
So, you want to make me happy all the time.

675
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,750
Because of you, I am very happy

676
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,190
and very sad.

677
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,760
Because I know my son is trying.

678
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,530
I know you're not interested in the consortium job.

679
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,030
You think I'm in your position now,

680
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,870
and then I'll transfer the position to you.

681
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,540
So, you want to reluctantly accept it.

682
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,710
But son, you don't have to live like this.

683
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,280
Don't do it for me.

684
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,850
Just live the life you want.

685
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,220
Do what you want to do.

686
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,360
It makes me happier.

687
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,100
(Notice on Delayed Opening of the Emergency Room)

688
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,110
No neurosurgical patient was admitted.

689
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,640
Is there a mistake?

690
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,810
Hello, Nurse Jeong.

691
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,080
What?

692
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,790
What's the matter?

693
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,830
It's like aspiration.
(Aspiration: Inhaling foreign object or substance into the respiratory tract)

694
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,270
Call chest radiography machine now.

695
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,500
OK.

696
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,170
It's intensive care unit 9001.

697
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,010
Bring the chest adem position radiography machine here.

698
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,070
I just got a call from the doctor and I came right away.

699
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,910
But the head of the bed was low and tilted.

700
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,040
I found it strange, so I raised it immediately.

701
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,380
What happened to the hospital bed?

702
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,520
I lifted it up before I left.

703
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,630
(New Message)

704
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,500
Answer the phone! Professor Cha has a big emergency!

705
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,640
(Hey, please pick up! Something happened to Professor Cha!)
Answer the phone! Professor Cha has a big emergency!

706
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,540
Answer the phone! Professor Cha has a big emergency!

707
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,710
What's the matter? What's wrong with Professor Cha?

708
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,480
Why don't you answer the phone?

709
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,910
Drive to EunSang University Medical Center. Please drive a little faster.

710
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,990
Is that one of yours?

711
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,890
Isn't it enough that you hurt the president?

712
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,590
Are you trying to kill Professor Cha?

713
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,630
What do you mean by that?

714
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,600
What's wrong?

715
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,470
Did you freak out when you heard Professor Cha was having surgery?

716
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,640
Are you afraid that when he wakes up, everything will come out?

717
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,570
Even so, how could you do something like this?

718
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,970
You don't think I know it, do you?

719
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,470
Do you know why I keep silent when I know?

720
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,510
Because I was afraid that I'd hurt Professor Cha.

721
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,150
To save that man.

722
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,850
To save Cha Yeong Min.

723
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,020
Listen to me.

724
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,660
If anything happens to Cha Yeong Min,

725
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,160
I will not let you go.

726
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,360
Tell that trash.

727
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,200
If he comes near him again,

728
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,900
even if I have to chase him into the hell,

729
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,570
I'll trounce him and kill him.

730
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,800
Understand?

731
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,420
Oh.

732
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,590
There you are. Go Seung Tak.

733
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:42,390
I had to risk my life to see you.

734
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,160
Well, it looks like you are wearing my clothes.

735
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,100
What's wrong?

736
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,630
Are you afraid I'm a dead ghost?

737
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,540
As you can see, I'm fine.

738
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,510
Are you crazy? Out of your mind?

739
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,870
How could you do that anyway?

740
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,740
You could have died.

741
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,210
I don't know what to do. Go Seung Tak was not there.

742
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,710
I can't do anything without you.

743
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,650
What did you just say?

744
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,120
How dare you say that?

745
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,160
Even if it hadn't happened that day, it would've been impossible to save the patient.

746
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,920
Maybe you didn't know that.

747
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,330
When we opened his chest, it had already ruptured.

748
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,930
It was too late. It wasn't your fault, so...

749
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,500
That could have been you.

750
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,430
I could kill you.

751
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,400
What if that happens when I operate on you?

752
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,270
I was wrong.

753
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,910
I thought if I trained you well,

754
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,910
you could be a useful doctor.

755
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,180
Probably I was wrong.

756
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,050
Was that all what you thought about when you were away?

757
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,720
You just thought you almost killed someone,

758
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,090
not that you could have saved a patient if you were a little stronger. Was that all what you thought about?

759
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,120
Professor.

760
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,960
Not every operation

761
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,530
will succeed.

762
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,690
You think doctors always tell all the guardians that

763
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,460
the operation is successful

764
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,570
and please do not worry?

765
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,900
Do you think doctors always say that?

766
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,740
Are doctors Gods?

767
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,440
It is precisely because doctors are not Gods that

768
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,910
they do their best

769
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:10,210
to make sure that more patients will survive than die.

770
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,420
Only this urgent mood.

771
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,460
Are you gonna do this every time?

772
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,060
Curling up in the room and crying

773
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,530
just like a boy

774
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,730
who lost his whole world?

775
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,830
You might as well give up being a doctor in your state of mind.

776
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,470
A man like you doesn't deserve a white gown.

777
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,600
Give me the hand mask I gave you back.

778
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,240
I didn't say I'd always be a doctor.

779
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,710
Who are you? Why are you judging me?

780
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,880
Why would you destabilize me

781
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,410
and put me in this mess?

782
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,810
You won't remember when you wake up anyway.

783
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,480
Why am I going through this?

784
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,720
Why am I stuck with you going through all this?

785
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,090
Do you regret it?

786
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,820
Or

787
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,660
are you tired of me?

788
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,430
What's the matter? Didn't you say you were gonna hold out until I woke up?

789
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,890
Yeah. Tired of it.

790
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,560
I'm sick of the hospital and the patients.

791
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,100
I'm tired of lending you my body.

792
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,000
What am I going to do? What should I do?

793
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,130
I'm tired of thinking about it.

794
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,740
I'm tired of everything.

795
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,610
I want to stop now.

796
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,080
I want to live as I used to be.

797
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,920
Oh, one is to run over

798
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,220
for fear that someone would die;

799
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,990
the other is to hurt his own body

800
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,760
to let someone come over.

801
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,070
But why did you speak so harshly?

802
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,300
Why didn't you comfort him?

803
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,600
Well, you said to take this opportunity to let him correct his mistakes.

804
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,470
When did you listen to me like this?

805
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,480
Why did you

806
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,950
possess me

807
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,420
on that day 12 years ago?

808
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,120
Didn't I tell you?

809
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,950
Your eyes

810
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,550
were the same as that guy's eyes.

811
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,460
He can't leave.

812
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,060
He's in the hospital.

813
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,490
And we are doctors.

814
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,060
If we abandon a patient like this...

815
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,630
I was also fascinated by him.

816
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,600
Are they nine-tailed foxes or what?

817
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,810
Yes. So I want to make a bet.

818
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,440
It's said he's being swayed and he's thinking about it.

819
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,310
You remembered what he said so clearly.

820
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,350
It seems that you are also fascinated by him.

821
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,820
I think he calculated a good angle and time point,

822
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,420
and got into my heart, right?

823
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:43,530
Is that a surgery? Luckily it was discovered early.

824
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,100
And I don't know what will happen next.

825
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,740
It's my first time too.

Actually, it's my principle to not possess a bad person.

But what should we do now?

It's all my fault.

Well, since you are at the entrance of the hospital,

you can go in directly.

You brat, why are you here so late?

You kept me waiting and I'm gonna die.

Is your judgment on me still valid?

Stay by my side

983
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,440
Stay with me.

984
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,150
(20 years ago)

985
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,770
Cut.

986
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,500
Wow, Professor O,

987
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,140
you are so good.

988
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,580
Professor, the surgery is perfect.

989
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,740
Thank you for your effort.

990
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,210
Ah, well...

991
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,550
Dr. Ban Tae Sik.

992
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:53,380
Yes.

993
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:57,790
Come to my operating room when you have time.

994
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,020
Fill in the missing parts one by one,

995
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,730
and it will become better.

996
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,700
Thank you so much, professor.

997
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,630
I'll work hard and learn.

998
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,200
Are you feeling unwell?

999
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,840
No, no.

1000
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,770
I'll look after the patient, and you can go back and rest.

1001
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,980
You didn't come home yesterday.

1002
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,580
No, no need.

1003
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,910
I have to see the patient wake up and then I can go back.

1004
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,860
Oh.

1005
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,760
Oh, my princess.

1006
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:46,200
Well, grandpa will go back after seeing the patient.

1007
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,100
What?

1008
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,370
Well...

1009
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,140
You are gonna stay up and wait for me, right?

1010
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,710
Of course.

1011
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:05,250
Of course, grandpa bought the chocolate cake that our princess likes.

1012
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,120
AVG check again in an hour.

1013
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,960
If anything happens, call me.

1014
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,060
OK.

1015
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,060
Hello.

1016
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,260
We don't have a professor who can do the surgery.

1017
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,170
Can you transfer the patient to another hospital?

1018
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,570
What kind of patient is it?

1019
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,340
Just a minute.

1020
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:21,870
It's a patient with descending aortic aneurysm,

1021
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,100
(Descending aortic aneurysm
Impending rupture)
It's a patient with descending aortic aneurysm,

1022
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,370
and impending rupture.
(Descending aortic aneurysm
Impending rupture)

1023
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,740
For impending rupture, even if the vital signs are fine,
(Descending aortic aneurysm
Impending rupture)

1024
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,140
For impending rupture, even if the vital signs are fine,

1025
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,280
there will be problems along the way.

1026
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,750
I'll go down and see. You let them admit the patient.

1027
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,320
Then contact the anesthesiologist

1028
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,680
to book the operating room.

1029
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,890
Understood.

1030
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,750
OK, send the patient here.

1031
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,600
Do you believe in God?

1032
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,300
Even if an atheist

1033
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:58,210
will also earnestly seek God at some point,

1034
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:03,040
in order to come in handy at that time, we have doctors.

1035
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,510
What would happen if the doctor ignored the patient?

1036
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,750
For what a ghost can't do,

1037
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:15,920
a living person must do his duty well.

1038
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,480
Oh,

1039
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,750
it's so late.

1040
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,920
She said she would wait for grandpa to come back and kept crying and couldn't sleep.

1041
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,090
Dad, she's asleep now.

1042
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:57,130
Gee, I'm late again.

1043
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,040
Grandpa didn't keep the promise again.

1044
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,240
Professor.

1045
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:18,550
Oh, you're working overtime again.

1046
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,250
Well, are you asleep?

1047
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,200
The patient with descending aortic aneurysm.

1048
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,030
Are the myocardial enzyme results confirmed?

1049
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,270
Not yet.

1050
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,240
Cheer up, you brat.

1051
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,970
What to do if he has a heart attack?

1052
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:16,770
You can't afford that.

1053
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:17,770
Yes.

1054
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,490
Thanks for waiting for me.

1055
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,490
Let's go.

1056
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,230
Here, grab it.

1057
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,900
One, two, three.

1058
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,240
Do the rescue, hurry.

1059
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,680
Keep pressing.

1060
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,740
This way.

1061
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:58,850
Quick, quick.

1062
01:03:58,850 --> 01:03:59,480
Grab it.

1063
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,980
One, two, three.

1064
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:06,050
Tak.

1065
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,920
Tak, buck up.

1066
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,590
Intubation.

1067
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,430
Hong Ju, prepare for intubation.

1068
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,210
Dad.

1069
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,880
Dad.

1070
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,680
Dad.

1071
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,680
Dad.

1072
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,850
Dad.

1073
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,790
Dad.

1074
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,130
The moments of earnest search for God.

1075
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,490
If God is too busy,

1076
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:50,030
they hope even the moment a ghost appears to help.

1077
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,140
Dad.

1078
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,990
If all living people help each other…

1079
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:19,530
If so…

1080
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:03,100
(Preview of the next episode)

1081
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:06,140
What time is it? You are so undisciplined the first day.

1082
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,610
Stop messing with this guy.

1083
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,710
Now he's my master.

1084
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:09,740
Master.

1085
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,780
OK.

1086
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,050
I want to save these patients.

1087
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,020
Cardiac Arrest, prepare for CPR.

1088
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,590
Treat it as a practice and start over from the bottom.

1089
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:19,990
It's not like that.

1090
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:21,490
Execute overnight.

1091
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,220
Do you have supper?

1092
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,060
It's a bit strange.

1093
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,230
It's a bit strange.

1094
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,130
Give that 1a favor.

1095
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,860
Avoid it, Dr. Go!

1096
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,860
No.
