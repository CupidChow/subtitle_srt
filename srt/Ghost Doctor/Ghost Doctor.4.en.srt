00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,300
Hey.

2
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,140
If you are still with me,

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,220
please save this person.

4
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,020
She's got low blood pressure, but it doesn't seem to be caused by clogged arteries.

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,860
Eye ground appears to be pale.

6
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,860
There are neurofibromas on her face and wrists.

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,660
She suffers from neurofibromatosis, right?

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,540
(Neurofibromatosis is an incurable disease which causes neurofibromas, skin and central nervous system to show specific abnormalities at the same time)
She suffers from neurofibromatosis, right?

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,220
Huh? What's that?
(Neurofibromatosis is an incurable disease which causes neurofibromas, skin and central nervous system to show specific abnormalities at the same time)

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,060
Huh? What's that?

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,460
It's a disease

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,020
where vessel rupture can occur spontaneously.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,660
Her lungs are filled with blood. We need to reduce her blood pressure immediately.

14
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,980
Let's save her together.

15
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,500
Good! Good! I survived.

16
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,100
Hey, how can you just leave like this?

17
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,820
Didn't you say she suffers from neuro… whatever?

18
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,660
How can you leave?

19
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,420
Aren't you a doctor?

20
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,220
If you are still with me, please save this person.

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,860
At this point, this guy is still…

22
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,940
Are you going to do the same thing again?

23
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,340
You are only good at theory anyway.

(Emergency Medical Center)

26
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,100
A roughly 50-year-old female found at the intersection of Dayang Road.

27
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,500
She is believed to be a neurofibromatosis patient.

28
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,660
Go… Go Seung Tak?

29
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,740
She was saved after receiving

30
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,340
first aid treatment on her left side here.

31
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,540
It took nine minutes to send her here.

32
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,260
Yeah. I'm Go Seung Tak.

33
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,460
This way, please.

34
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,700
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

35
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
Hurry inside. What are you doing?

36
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm coming.

37
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,300
How have the interns been trained recently?

(Emergency Medical Center)

39
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,140
Please make way.

40
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,820
Where's Go Seung Tak?

41
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,460
He's right behind us.

42
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,820
One, two, three.

43
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,460
Careful.

44
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,940
Ventilator.

45
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,020
Ma'am. Ma'am.

46
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,980
Can you hear me?

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,700
TER effusion 400CC.

48
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,900
Set the RI at 15.

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,660
Can you hear me?

50
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,940
Please do ECG and SATs.

51
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,900
Get ready for an ABG analysis.

52
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,380
She's saved!

53
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,100
These are golden hands!

54
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
Are they coated with gold?

55
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,140
Ma'am, can you hear me?

56
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,260
What happened to her?

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,660
The Rescue Team said she fainted by a roadside.

58
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,620
Luckily, Go Seung Tak happened to be there and gave her first aid treatment.

59
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,260
I think she's out of danger now.

60
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,100
What? Who?

61
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,659
Go Seung Tak, what happened?

62
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,180
Oh, I think she suffers from neurofibromatosis.

63
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,700
What?

64
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,820
Neuro what? What is that?

65
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,780
I heard of it before, but I don't know about it.

66
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,100
What kind of first aid treatment did you give her?

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,060
Oh, the first aid treatment.

68
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,700
About that, I just quickly…

69
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,660
Jeez. Is that how you answer it?

70
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,940
Makes sense though. If you knew, you wouldn't be Go Seung Tak.

71
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,500
I supposed that she got spontaneous hemothorax,

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,900
(Spontaneous hemothorax)
I supposed that she got spontaneous hemothorax,

73
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,300
so I opened her chest to reduce the blood pressure.
(Spontaneous hemothorax)

74
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,260
so I opened her chest to reduce the blood pressure.

75
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,300
(Artery bleeding)
so I opened her chest to reduce the blood pressure.

76
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Arteriorrhagia occurred.
(Artery bleeding)

77
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,820
Make sure to give her relatively higher dose of hemagglutinin.
(Artery bleeding)

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,220
If the CT scan shows that her vital signs are stable,

79
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,900
let the Medical Imaging Department perform an interventional operation on her.

80
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,500
(Intervention
An interventional operation performed by the Medical Imaging Department for therapeutic purpose)
let the Medical Imaging Department perform an interventional operation on her.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,540
If it's hard to arrange, then do it in the operating room.
(Intervention
An interventional operation performed by the Medical Imaging Department for therapeutic purpose)

82
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,140
They are all ready, right?
(Intervention
An interventional operation performed by the Medical Imaging Department for therapeutic purpose)

83
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,820
Oh, sure. But, um…

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,100
I thought it happened on the street.

85
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,500
How did you open her chest?

86
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,740
What?

87
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,220
Why are you…? Stop asking questions!

88
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,460
What's wrong with him?

89
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,100
I borrowed a bottle of wine, a knife, and a pair of scissors from a nearly snack stand,

90
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,340
and I took a straw from a passerby.

91
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,340
After disinfecting the knife and the scissors with the wine,

92
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,580
I stabbed her with the knife, opened her chest with the scissors, and then did blood drainage with the straw.

93
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,940
Is that good enough, Dr. An?

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,700
Do you have other questions?

95
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,780
Please shoot if there are more.

96
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,100
Let's do CT scan first.

97
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,060
Okay. I'll inform the Medical Imaging Department.

98
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,260
Wow, Go Seung Tak. With a straw, huh?

99
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,060
Good for you!

100
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,180
(Emergency Medical Center)

101
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,659
Go Seung Tak said that himself?

102
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,500
He said he injected the heparin.

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,340
That's why I thought he injected again after I did.

104
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,420
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,020
Just keep him close and watch him first.

106
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,940
Hey! If you are still with me,

107
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,180
please save this person.

108
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,100
Don't tell me you know who I am.

109
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,180
Ah! I've been wandering around the whole day?

110
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,980
I must be crazy.

111
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,460
You brat, you scared me!

112
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,820
Stop!

113
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,340
(No Entry & No Exit)

114
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,060
I haven't got a haircut for so long.

115
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,740
I may as well take this chance and curl my hair.

116
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,900
What's going on with you?

117
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,780
How can you be so calm?

118
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,900
Aren't you even concerned about this situation?

119
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,460
The patient was sent to the Medial Imaging Department.

120
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,820
They said she didn't need an operation.

121
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,780
Oh, yeah? Good to know.

122
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,540
I heard you called in sick today.

123
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,340
What brought you to that intersection?

124
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,580
And dressed like this?

125
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,260
What?

126
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,460
Oh, I was jogging.

127
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,420
Whenever I do it I'd jog as far as I can.

128
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,900
And then I got lost

129
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,700
and happened to find the patient lying there.

130
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,620
And you can fool people like this every time?

131
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,460
You also think I've been acting weird lately, don't you?

132
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,980
I'd sometimes talk like a crazy person.

133
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,020
Yeah. You are like that lately.

134
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,820
Do you know why though?

135
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,380
Hmm. I do.

136
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,380
You know

137
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,500
that I've been doing a job that's way too demanding for me.

138
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,660
I'm more suitable for a fun job.

139
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,620
You know cognitive dissonance, right?

140
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,060
Abnormal symptoms would occur when there's inconsistence

141
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,020
or conflict between what you think and what you do.

142
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,140
How come even his excuse makes me nauseous?

143
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,220
So,

144
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,900
when you see me acting weird

145
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
and talking like a crazy person,

146
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,180
just go ahead and smack on my back

147
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,980
like how you did earlier

148
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,500
so that I can sober up.

149
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,140
Okay?

150
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,340
Hey, don't let her do that!

151
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,980
She's such a strong girl.

152
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,420
What if I get smacked out again?

153
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,460
No. Say no.

154
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,100
No problem.

155
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,220
Hey, what are you doing?

156
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,700
I've been having this feeling.

157
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,380
O Su Jeong, it's so nice to have you as my friend.

158
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,980
Then I'll take off.

159
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,020
If you want to drink something,

160
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,060
try this flavor. It's not bad.

161
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,460
You rude brat.

162
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,300
Hey, tell her not to smack you first! Hey!

163
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,900
Why does it taste like this?

164
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,860
That's the flavor you chose.

165
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,820
Try the blue one next to it.

166
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,980
Hey! Hey! Hey!

167
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,940
You can see me, right?

168
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,620
Your shoelace. Your shoelace is loose.

169
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,740
By the way, you left your phone on the ambulance.

170
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,620
I knew it! You can see me, right?

171
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,500
You can hear me!

172
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,660
Hey, wait! The car… The car is not there.

173
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,700
My car. Where's my car?

174
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,780
My car!

175
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,300
(Penalty Charge Notice)

176
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,300
Hey.

177
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,300
You think this place is as comfy as your home?

178
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,900
That's why people say nonsense like being alive

179
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,180
is the best even if you fall into a toilet pit.

180
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,540
Look at your depressed face.

181
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,380
Something happened, right?

182
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
I didn't know you were gonna go out like that.

184
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,220
Even if I had told you in advance,

185
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,260
you wouldn't have listened to me.

186
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,300
What would have happened

187
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,460
if I hadn't repossessed him?

188
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,900
You are gonna die straight away.

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,020
You are there and your body is here.

190
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,900
Don't be afraid.

191
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,540
You're not dead.

192
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,900
He put out his hand

193
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,580
and let me take possession.

194
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,420
He let me take possession of him and save the patient.

195
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,820
Well, he was thinking about the patient at that moment.

196
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,580
Really.

197
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,820
Well, you always go in and out.

198
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,100
Wouldn't it be even weirder

199
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,260
if he didn't know?

200
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,820
Well, that young man is your savior.

201
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,940
Why... why you talk like that?

202
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
Does he know it's you?

203
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,940
I... I don't know.

204
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,100
I don't know how it happened,

205
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,700
but it looks like your gallbladders are connected.

206
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,220
I hope you're not bored now.

207
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,980
For ghosts,

208
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,900
something is particularly awkward.

209
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,500
Time

210
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,660
and endless persistence.

211
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,180
You can also try to

212
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,460
solve your own doubts and persevere endlessly.

213
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,580
I'm gonna go.

214
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,220
Woah, it's nice.

215
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,980
You can eat and do some exercise.

216
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Okay.

217
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,980
That kid was one of Professor Cha's patients, right?

218
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,100
Her operation was postponed because of President Jang's operation.

219
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,180
But her pulmonary valve became narrower during this period.

220
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,540
Her liver tolerance dropped.

221
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,460
She's also starting to have pleural effusion.

222
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,740
Well, she needs surgery as soon as possible.

223
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,820
Why hasn't she had surgery yet?

224
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,940
None of the other professors would do it.

225
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,500
Dr. An, why don't you operate on her?

226
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Your skills are very good.

227
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,940
Well…

228
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,140
Don't you have the ability to perform this kind of surgery?

229
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,260
There's no other way.

230
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,100
Talk to the guardian.

231
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Get them transferred to another hospital.

232
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,020
What you said before really came true.

233
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,300
The 7-year-old patient O Heung Ju

234
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,180
had pulmonary atresia.

235
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,180
She underwent cardiac catheterization 21 days after her birth due to ventricular septal defect and Rastelli surgery when she was one year old.

236
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,900
Two days later, she will have surgery to repair the double outlet of her right ventricle.

237
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,060
Check her vital signs again.

238
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,100
Make sure to check her peroxidase and electrode reactions tomorrow.

239
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,420
Honey, don't be rude to the doctor.

240
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,420
I don't like this doctor.

241
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,420
I didn't realize you were such a good judge of character.

242
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,540
Do you also find that doctor annoying?

243
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,420
He ignores his patient...

244
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,980
Do you really want to

245
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,260
let that pesky doctor operate on you?

246
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,740
It's not too late to regret it.

247
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,700
At your age, you can totally choose your own surgeon.

248
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,580
I didn't have any of these when I was an intern.

249
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,700
Internship conditions have really gotten better.

250
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,140
I don't have anywhere else to go right now.

251
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,740
I'm just gonna hang out here. I think I owe you one.

252
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Go Seung Tak.

253
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,860
Help him.

254
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,980
A 40-year-old male patient.

255
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,660
He fell from a 3-meter-high platform at the construction site.

256
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,339
The left side of his chest was penetrated.

257
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,780
BP 90, pulse 120.

258
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,460
Go Seung Tak.

259
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
Prepare to do intubation.

260
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,340
Come on…

261
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,940
A doctor can't even intubate…

262
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,260
You're a disgrace to Thoracic Surgery Department.

263
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,300
Hey! Brat!

264
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,820
Open the patient's throat first.

265
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,580
Press his tongue with a laryngoscope.

266
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,100
After the laryngoscope passes the base of the tongue, pull it upward.

267
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,100
It's the only way to insert an endotracheal tube.

268
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,380
The patient will die if you don't help him.

269
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,060
You are useless.

270
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
Let me do it.

271
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,660
This kid can't even do that right.

272
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,620
You can't even do basic things.

273
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,420
Did you see that?

274
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,380
Did you?

275
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,980
That's what intubation is.

276
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,300
Well done.

277
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Good job.

278
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,860
Yeah, I did a good job.

279
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,100
Could... Could he have done it on purpose?

280
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,220
Was he just complimenting himself?

281
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,740
It's just intubation...

282
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,300
Let me go.

283
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,020
Please be quiet.

284
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,340
Please be quiet.

285
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,980
What are you doing?

286
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,740
Do you know me?

287
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,380
Why should I know you?

288
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,060
What are you doing, Sir?

289
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,060
Are... Are you there?

290
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,620
I… I am not here.

291
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,460
Do you take me for a fool, boy?

292
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,100
How could I be fooled by you again?

293
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,140
A little harder.

294
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,460
Nice.

295
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,060
Sir, Sir.

296
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,700
Are you all right?

297
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,980
What's wrong with him? Why is this happening all of a sudden?

298
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,700
Doctor, take a look over here.

299
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,420
Unbelievable.

300
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,900
Nurse, take a look at this man.

301
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,340
Myocardial infarction.

302
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,980
Prepare to do intubation.

303
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,580
And artificial lung.

304
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Hurry up.

305
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,500
I can't believe that

306
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,260
he gets played every time.

307
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,700
As a result, he rushed into his body every time.

308
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,460
He's a doctor.

309
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
What?

310
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,380
It is a place where patients are treated.

311
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,660
And he's a doctor.

312
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,660
(EunSang University Medical Center)

313
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,340
Why isn't Go Seung Tak back?

314
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,660
Where did he go?

315
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,820
In my first year as an intern,

316
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,580
I didn't even have time to go to the bathroom.

317
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,100
200 joules. Charging.

318
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,980
Defibrillating.

319
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,340
200 joules. Charging.

320
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,060
Ready.

321
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,980
Ready. Shock.

322
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,860
When the body dies,

323
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,020
the soul goes up to the heaven.

324
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,380
It's both the order of divinities

325
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,100
and the law of nature.

326
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,340
Why stop it from happening?

327
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:19,580
People who wander between the world and the underworld.

328
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,540
What?

329
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,980
Why is he looking at us like that?

330
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,100
Does he think we are pathetic?

331
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,900
What?

332
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,700
That's what I want to say.

333
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,340
I wish he'd looked at us like that when we were still alive.

334
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,300
But… Why did he come here again?

335
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,900
They transferred me to another hospital while I was gone?

336
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,580
Where have you been?

337
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,500
You don't even know your body's been removed.

338
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,580
(Attending Professor Jang Se Jin Cha Yeong Min)

339
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,420
The room is still a little cheerless.

340
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,260
Just give me some time.

341
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,780
I'll see

342
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,220
where to start.

343
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,580
Han Seung Won.

344
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,300
What are you doing here?

345
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Is this ward to your satisfaction?

346
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,140
It is nice and sunny.

347
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,900
This empty ward must be expensive. Thank you for this.

348
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
I should thank you.

349
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,060
Thank you for making such a big decision for us.

350
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,580
I thank you on behalf of the hospital.

351
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,620
It should have happened a long time ago.

352
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,700
I just have been too busy lately.

353
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,140
You're a smooth talker.

354
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,700
I know.

355
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,300
You've been very busy lately because of the President.

356
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,340
As you requested,

357
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,580
I transferred Nurse Jeong Eun Mi here from ICU.

358
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,140
If you need anything else, just let me know.

359
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,300
Years have passed,

360
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,140
and you are still the same.

361
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,660
As kind as ever.

362
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,060
How do you two know each other?

363
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,580
How do you and Se Jin know each other?

364
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,180
If you

365
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,860
mess up with Se Jin,

366
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,700
I'll kill you.

367
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,780
You asked a busy man like me to come

368
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,100
and kept me waiting.

369
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
I don't think that's right.

370
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,060
We are in hospital.

371
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,460
You need to observe some basic decency.

372
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,260
What?

373
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,500
What's bothering you?

374
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,700
You get super sensitive when something's wrong with you.

375
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,780
Nothing.

376
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,740
I thought you must be tired working in the emergency room.

377
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,300
So, I wanted to get you up here and relax.

378
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,660
Tea?

379
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,940
No.

380
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,180
Is there anything to eat?

381
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
I'm hungry.

382
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,740
Seung Tak, do you know

383
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,300
you've been doing surprising things lately?

384
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Me?

385
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,260
What?

386
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,220
What have I done to surprise you lately?

387
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,180
Well... Like Professor Cha's surgery.

388
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,660
And what happened to President Jang.

389
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,540
Why didn't you tell me about it?

390
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,220
President Jang?

391
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,820
Well, I didn't expect that

392
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,220
at the meeting either.

393
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,900
I would have told you if you had asked.

394
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,420
But did I do something wrong?

395
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,220
Can you explain what you did

396
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,420
when Professor Cha was being transferred to another hospital?

397
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,020
Well, I heard it was your instruction.

398
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,180
I thought it was Chief Ban.

399
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,620
Anyway, it's been handled properly, right?

400
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,500
He's even got a guardian.

401
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,140
They're calling.

402
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,540
I'll assume I already snacked.

403
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,140
Seung Tak.

404
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,700
Professor Cha, whom you respect so much, has been transferred to the VIP ward.

405
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,260
What respect?

406
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,060
I guess we don't have to see each other again.

407
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,820
Have a good rest.

408
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,340
Seung Tak. Why don't you tell me

409
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,540
what you are up to?

410
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,300
Got a place to go.

411
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,220
Now you can leave me alone.

412
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,380
- Put the books over there, please.
- Okay.

413
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,300
Put the case by the table, thank you.

414
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,620
Put the table in front.

415
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,500
The curtains need to be changed.

416
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,500
What's going on here?

417
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,660
You're here.

418
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,980
I'm gonna have to take care of him

419
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,700
until we can find a caregiver.

420
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,620
You're practically planning on living here with him.

421
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,140
What?

422
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,780
No. I'm not.

423
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,340
The laboratory is far away, and it's too troublesome to go back and forth...

424
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,900
Actually,

425
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,420
I'm staying in his room for convenience.

426
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,140
Who's that?

427
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,860
Hi.

428
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,700
Why are you here?

429
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
Actually,

430
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,980
I'm gonna live here from today.

431
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,820
What are you talking about?

432
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,860
Why do you want to live here?

433
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,220
It's too troublesome to go back and forth.

434
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,220
In this way, I can save time for study.

435
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,380
Technically,

436
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm staying here for convenience.

437
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,220
I'll pay half of all kinds of bills.

438
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,420
What are you talking about?

439
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,460
No way, you have to go.

440
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,380
I'll take you home.

441
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,900
No.

442
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,820
When we get married, we're gonna live together anyway.

443
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,580
Can't we just do it a little earlier?

444
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,420
No.

445
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,460
That's impossible.

446
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,900
I'll take you home.

447
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,940
It's so late.

448
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,740
We can't catch the last bus.

449
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,420
Take a taxi.

450
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,860
I haven't eaten yet.

451
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,540
What? Haven't eaten?

452
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,020
It's not good.

453
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,900
Why haven't you eaten so late?

454
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,220
I have told you many times.

455
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,300
Be sure to eat regularly.

456
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,700
And no matter how forgetful you are, you can't forget to eat.

457
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
How long do I have to take care of you?

458
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,820
I can't do it anymore.

459
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,140
You never listen to me.

460
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,420
It's so nice.

461
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,700
Well, you can just eat.

462
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,860
We can't do anything else.

463
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,540
I have made it clear. We can't.

464
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,700
Something else?

465
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,220
What does that mean?

466
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,340
Sleep before you go... No.

467
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,140
I mean, we can't sleep together.

468
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,540
Absolutely not.

469
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,020
Yeong Min,

470
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,980
we must live like this in the future.

471
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,020
And both of us will work in the same hospital.

472
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,740
You're a thoracic surgeon and I'm a neurosurgeon.

473
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,100
What do you think? It'll be great.

474
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,140
There will be a thorough examination tomorrow.

475
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,300
Start injecting drugs in this order from tomorrow on.

476
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,100
Please also record his blood pressure.

477
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,740
Why is this happening now?

478
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,300
What are you...

479
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,420
Work harder.

480
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,140
Go Seung Tak, what are you doing here at this hour?

481
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,460
You can see it. Morning exercises.

482
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,860
Didn't you say you were too sweaty to come?

483
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,100
Thoracic surgery depends on physical strength. Don't you know that?

484
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,140
Ah, you don't know.

485
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,940
It is true for doctors.

486
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,260
Hello?

487
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,620
Stocks of Tianming Group?

488
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,660
Have you sold them all?

489
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,460
Buy them quickly.

490
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,220
So fast? The news travels so fast.

491
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,780
Buy as many as you can get.

492
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,140
The price will go up again. Buy them now!

493
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,820
(EunSang University Medical Center)
The price will go up again. Buy them now!

494
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,380
(EunSang University Medical Center)

495
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:46,980
Mike, have you checked the records I sent?
(EunSang University Medical Center)

496
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,540
Mike, have you checked the records I sent?

497
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,780
Yeah. I think it helps the injury.

498
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,500
He is breathing but still in a coma.

499
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,020
The patient?

500
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,100
Someone important to me.

501
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,220
Could you figure it out?

502
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,220
Mike, I'll call you back.

503
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,140
(President Jang Gwang Deok of Tianming Group Regained Consciousness)

504
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,980
(President Jang Gwang Deok of Tianming Group Regained Consciousness)

505
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,740
Here he comes.

506
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,260
Please say a few words.

507
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,820
Is it true that President Jang regained consciousness?

508
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,300
Thanks to all of you,

509
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,380
he finally woke up.

510
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,420
Will he recover after that?

511
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,580
He has to be observed for a while.

512
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,620
But I believe he will.

513
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,220
As for the matter of the heir, does it remain unchanged?

514
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,420
It is said within a month the Group will change...

515
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,540
My dad's recovery comes first.

516
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,820
Director Jang! Director Jang!

517
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,420
Open the door! Open the door!

518
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,180
Thanks for your calling, President Song.

519
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,220
Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,460
It is still a little difficult to visit him for the time being.

521
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,140
I'll be sure to tell my dad.

522
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,220
Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,540
Why are you here again?

524
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,380
I heard President Jang is awake.

525
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,740
Let me meet him.

526
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,620
Didn't you hear me?

527
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,220
A visit is not allowed for the time being.

528
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,740
My dad said it himself.

529
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,860
No one is allowed in here.

530
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,100
By the way,

531
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,580
I heard you became a doctor in this hospital.

532
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,900
You are pretty impressive.

533
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,940
You don't have to worry about going hungry,

534
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,100
even though you don't depend on me.

535
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,500
You can't go in there.

536
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,700
President Jang, what's going on?

537
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,380
The news...

538
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,700
I heard you suffered in a wheelchair yesterday.

539
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,700
Ah, those guys out there had a rough time.

540
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,220
You're heavy, after all.

541
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,500
You finally woke up.

542
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,220
You don't know how happy it makes me.

543
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,420
You just need to get better slowly.

544
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,340
Very slowly.

545
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,500
You jerk!

546
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,219
Yeah, I get it.

547
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,179
Dr. An, have you seen the news?

548
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,980
So, you will go there to check it?

549
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,139
Yeah, that's what you will do.

550
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,179
But do you know where the patient is?

551
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,620
Dr. An?

552
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,340
Here...?

553
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,260
Han Seung Won ordered him. They two colluded with each other..

554
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,699
You...

555
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,780
That's the way you are.

556
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,260
I said I trusted you.

557
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,940
You are quite right.

558
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,420
Here it is.

559
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,820
Go in.

560
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,500
Wow, this is crazy.

561
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,900
These guys just happen to be together.

562
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,620
I'd like to beat both of you up.

563
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,140
Hey! Be confident! Don't be afraid. Ask them directly.

564
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,020
If you can't persuade them,

565
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,140
just say you want to see the patient.

566
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
"I'm a doctor and President Jang is my patient."

567
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,060
Why don't you say something? Be quick!

568
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,340
Welcome.

569
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,140
This is the thoracic surgeon I mentioned last time.

570
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,500
My name is An Tae Hyeon.

571
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,260
Ah, the starting pitcher of this game, right?

572
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,820
I heard it. Thanks for your hard work.

573
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,500
You flatter me.

574
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,940
Things went wrong.

575
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,300
But I'm sure Vice President Han will take care of that.

576
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,220
Dr. An will be President Jang's attending doctor from now on.

577
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,220
Will you?

578
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,140
You just have to keep my dad's pulse beating.

579
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,660
It won't be too long. One year is better.

580
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,180
In the meantime,

581
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,940
I have a lot of work to do.

582
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,460
Yeah.

583
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,420
I'll do my best.

584
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,100
An Tae Hyeon?!

585
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,140
You did that?

586
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,260
That was you!

587
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,980
An Tae Hyeon, you…

588
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
You jerk!

589
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,700
Why? Why did you do something like this?

590
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,700
I trust you the most.

591
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,140
How could you do this to me?

592
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,260
How could you…

593
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,700
… do…

594
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,500
… this to me?

595
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,180
Why are you in here?

596
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,300
Why are you in my office?

597
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,500
Yeah.

598
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,820
The other day when I stopped you,

599
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,060
if only you had listened to me.

600
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,020
Please listen to me. Do we have to do this surgery?

601
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,980
No worries. Autotransplantation may be successful.

602
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,780
Surgery is risky and there is a risk of recurrence.

603
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,940
That's not the way you are, Professor Cha.

604
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:59,780
Don't blame me for your greed.

605
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:07,260
Of course. Since that time…

606
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,860
But I have protected your reputation.

607
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:18,900
The patient woke up after the operation.

608
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,860
Why did you have to save someone from dying?

609
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,580
It gets worse now.

610
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:47,700
When did you know my man did it?

611
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,540
I'm really sorry.

612
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:55,940
I am unable to educate my son well. What else can I say?

613
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,540
I will help you set the record straight.

614
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,420
I'll be sure to help you.

615
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,660
You don't know how to play go, right?

616
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,820
What?

617
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:14,340
I want to enjoy playing go for my last year.

618
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,780
I find it boring to play go by myself.

619
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,740
Please teach me!

620
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,820
(Instant Food Cookie)

621
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,220
We can penetrate through living things but not inanimate ones.

622
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,540
We can eat, drink and fetch things.

623
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,980
It won't affect the real world.

624
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,700
You can think there are two worlds.

625
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,780
You even can't do this trifle.

626
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,620
You take so much effort every day.

627
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,700
Have a try.

628
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,740
No. No.

629
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,660
You always remind yourself that you're a ghost.

630
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,580
That's why you can't open the door.

631
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,140
Do it naturally and unconsciously. Like this.

632
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,900
We didn't always remind ourselves that we were living people

633
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,540
when we were alive.

634
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,180
Do it again.

635
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,060
I made it! I made it.

636
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,220
Do it naturally.

637
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,820
Ask him to get changed first.

638
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,940
You've been wearing the same clothes for days.

639
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,700
Do I smell bad?

640
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,460
Ah, ghosts are odorless.

641
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,540
I guess you have a bad temper.

642
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,900
You usually looked elegant.

643
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,540
Now it's been a little...

644
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,620
You were handsome before death and always caught people's eyes.

645
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,780
What are you talking about? I'm not dead yet.

646
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:39,020
The best way is to choose someone with a similar dressing style.

647
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,340
So, you don't have to think about what to wear every day.

648
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,900
It's really convenient.

649
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,340
Jeo has a keen eye.

650
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,620
He's quick to spot someone with good taste.

651
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,820
He actually likes new styles.

652
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,260
These are my clothes.

653
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:10,500
How are they? Aren't they nice?

654
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,940
Leave it aside. Let's talk about something else.

655
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,700
Can I hit someone or do something like that?

656
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,500
What? Are you afraid I'm gonna hit you?

657
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,700
Hit… Hit me…? Of course not.

658
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,140
I thought you had a way out. Why bother asking?

659
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,740
An Tae Hyeon, get up.

660
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,980
Go Seung Tak?

661
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,180
Do you think I am Go Seung Tak?

662
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,540
I'm Cha Yeong Min.

663
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,900
The day you failed the expert interview,

664
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,540
I chose you because of your toughness.

665
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,060
When you got into trouble in your second year of employment,

666
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,740
the patient would have died if I hadn't found it out timely.

667
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,740
I helped you with a lot more than that.

668
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,260
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

669
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,580
You're a doctor because of me.

670
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,860
But how did you repay me? How could you be so heartless?

671
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,780
What? Are you out of your mind?

672
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,420
You said you protected my reputation. But I am stainless!

673
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,660
As you said, I saved people from dying.

674
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,940
You're the one who killed the patient. Why don't you go to hell?!

675
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,620
Come clean about what you've done.

676
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,820
Or you'll have nightmares every day. Remember it!

677
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,260
I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

678
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,220
What the heck are you? Who are you on earth?

679
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,940
What did you just say to me?

680
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,340
How do you know all that stuff?

681
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:48,140
Did you have a nightmare? Or did you dream about me?

682
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:48,900
What?

683
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,340
What did I say in your dream? Looks like it didn't sound good.

684
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,660
Have you been fully awake?

685
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,500
Since you're here, why not be on duty for me?

686
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,980
I thought you were off duty. What are you doing here?

687
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,820
This is my white gown. I brought it here to be washed.

688
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,180
Are you scared? I haven't done anything serious yet.

689
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,220
It just gets started. You'd better remember it well.

690
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,620
You don't understand.

691
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
How did I get the surgery?

692
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,620
With what kind of mentality? You bad guy!

693
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,340
You know who I am?

694
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,860
Please show me all videos before and after that.

695
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,420
Only those ones.

696
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,060
It's getting crazy.

697
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,700
You think you're really a ghost?

698
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,860
You think you are making a movie?

699
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,580
I wish I could bring my car.

700
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,660
All right. Let's go get your car.

701
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,940
(124 Jeo 1224)

702
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,700
I made it.

703
00:47:52,700 --> 00:48:01,460
Bun! Cha Bun! What is this? Cha Bun?

704
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,340
Where is my little darling?

705
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:28,020
Dr. Go? Dr. Go.

706
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:34,700
Gim… Why are you here, Dr. Jang Se Jin?

707
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,500
His apartment hadn't been visited for too long.

708
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,620
I got the address from Nurse Jeong.

709
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Have you been here before?

710
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,860
No, this is my first visit.

711
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,380
Dr. Go, how did you get here...?

712
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,980
I have the same reason.

713
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,700
Looks like you two are pretty close.

714
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,460
- No, we hate each other... very much...
- No, we hate each other… very much...

715
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,700
No, I don't mean that. Well…

716
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,780
Have you still not changed your mind about the favor I asked?

717
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:10,060
Professor Cha is not in good condition.

718
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,500
I compared today's diffusion MRI

719
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,660
with that done the other day.

720
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,820
Here is the newly added intensity signal boost section.

721
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,500
The amplitude of the neurofeedback widens, so the basal ganglia also…

722
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,140
So what I mean is that his health is getting worse.

723
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,700
The vital signs and examination results and indicators are alright,

724
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,780
but it seems that something

725
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,700
is doing repeated damage to the brain.

726
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,580
There shouldn't be that kind of factor.

727
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,580
Quit possessing somebody and coming out constantly,

728
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,620
or else you might never wake up.

729
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,500
If you insist on doing that, I can't stop you.

730
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,380
It's already dangerous.

731
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,460
How can I stop you from putting your own life at risk?

732
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,020
Dr. Go?

733
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:34,460
Good. This room is spacious and warm.

734
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,820
Then have a nice time.

735
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,260
I'm leaving.

736
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:54,660
But what is that?

737
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,140
This is when I was alive... oh, no.

738
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,580
I don't like wearing used clothes,

739
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,140
and there is no one having better taste in clothes than me, so...

740
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,660
You won't give up fashion even as a ghost.

741
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,940
And there are new clothes.

742
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,340
No, do you know who I am?

743
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,620
No, you can't see that.

744
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,220
Don't let her see this, or I'm doomed.

(Deposit Book Bank KD)
Don't let her see this, or I'm doomed.

746
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,380
No, no.
(Deposit Book Bank KD)

747
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,620
Oh, she saw it.

748
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,060
You don't think I stole it, right?

749
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,140
You know me, my family is rich. This...

750
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,820
this is the top 1% black card.

751
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,740
I am rich. How can I do that?

752
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,540
I wasn't mean to give you the card like this.

753
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,460
Medical fees in this hospital are expensive, aren't they?

754
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,380
It seems that it can sponsor you, so I brought it here.

755
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,100
So,

756
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,580
you know who I am.

757
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,500
Our Professor Cha

758
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,660
has been sleeping for too long.

759
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,260
So he caught me who wanted to go home

760
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,580
and went to his own home.

761
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,020
Well, he should have gone by public transport.

762
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:31,860
Is that his car?

763
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,820
Or he should drive it back.

764
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,220
Gee, what a person.

765
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,820
Why does he still do this when he knows...

766
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,260
What's the matter between us?

(EunSang University Medical Center)

768
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,420
Cha Yeong Min, do you wear this kind of clothes recently?

769
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,300
You have improved a lot.

770
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,820
At that time, even if I begged you, you refused to wear it.

771
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,140
Why is it so expensive?

772
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,500
Yeong Min, let me see.

773
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,220
No need, just choose your own clothes.

774
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,740
No, we must buy your clothes today.

775
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,780
Aren't you tired of wearing the same clothes?

776
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,260
You have been wearing it for years.

777
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,660
No, I bought it last year.

778
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,540
I know even if you buy new clothes, you just buy the same style of different colors.

779
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,420
You just wear the same hooded sweatshirt and jeans all day.

780
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,860
Gee...

781
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:38,460
Hey, it's our professor's wedding, how can you dress like this?

782
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,300
Do you know how people say about you behind your back?

783
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,180
They say that you are a fashion terrorist.

784
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,300
What is the importance of clothing?

785
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,340
Only clean and tidy matter.

786
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,500
Forget it, I feel comfortable in this.

787

789
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,500
With the appearance like this, if you dress casually,

790
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
it's a waste.

Stop.

Am I here to kill you,

801

or am I here to save you?

802

may not come to this situation.

don't let me do your death declaration.

00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,380
Please don't let me do that.

811
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,060
I know something complex is happening,

812
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,540
but even in that case, please wake up first.

813

You should wake up to solve them,

815

and our matter.

So don't think about anything else,

817

just wake up.

00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,780
Thank you.

830
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,420
How good.

831
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,540
The iced Americano in this shop is really tasty.

832
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,140
What is he doing?

833
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,260
A cup of iced Americano.

834
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,060
Oh.

835
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,620
Is he doing well?

836
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,900
How else?

837
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,500
He does that because he wants to live.

838
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,180
What?

839
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,580
Look, who is he?

840
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,900
I've never seen him before.

841
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,620
Is he a newcomer?

842
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,500
But what is he watching right there?

843
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,740
I thought he finally settled down.

844
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,020
Something is happening again.

847
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,900
It was raining, and he hit a tree.

00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,860
Looks like he got hit in the chest.

849
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,100
How about the vital signs?

850

Didn't you see the patient is badly hurt?

Call somebody else.

Ah, yes.

857
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,780
Doctor, where is my husband? Doctor.

858
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,860
Please save him, doctor.

863

But doctor, why is your hand...

870
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,500
I fell at the stair, and it might be sprained.

871

It's cardiac tamponade.

It might be right ventricle.

873
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,140
Do we need to send him to the operation room right away?

874
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,140
That does not work.

875
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,420
Then what should we do? Call other doctors?

There is a medical society today. Other doctors are out.

877

Go Seung Tak,

879
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,900
how about you trying it?

880
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,540
Are you crazy?

881
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,260
He is just in his first year. How can he do a cardiac tamponade surgery?

882
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,180
It's the same case as Professor Cha.

883
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,860
Didn't you do the surgery at that time?

884
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,660
I'll watch by the side.

885
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,620
This time you can finish it from the beginning.

887
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,060
You can't do it?

888
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,940
Of course he can't.

889
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,700
Even a fourth-year doctor can't do a cardiac tamponade surgery. How can he do it?

Don't you know Go Seung Tak?

891
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,820
Then there's no way.

892
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,780
Let's call other hospitals

893
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,740
to see if any of them can do a cardiac tamponade surgery.

894
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,140
What?

895
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,340
Ah, yes.

896
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,740
But can the patient survive till then?

We have no other option.

Let's hurry and ask.

899
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,540
OK.

900
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,700
What are you looking at?

901
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,700
I know what you are thinking about, but this is open-heart surgery.

902
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,500
It's quite different from doing emergency treatment in the street.

903
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,780
I'll do it.

904

905
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,860

If you do that because you trust me,

910
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,940
cancel it right away.

911
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,860

912

I can't possess you,

914
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,060
so go cancel it right now.

Hey.

916
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,140
Of course it will hurt your pride, but I don't care.

917
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,620
Of course the patient will be in danger.

918
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,900
But it's not the time for me to care about other people's life.

919
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,300
Gee, what is the use of me talking to myself?

920
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,620
Anyway, take care of what you've caused.

921
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,380
I'll go to my ward.

922
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,180
Why did you try to take care of all the things by yourself?

You don't have anything to do, why are you so down?

933

How does he have nothing to do?

My dear grandpa,

942
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,700
saying half is an exaggeration.

943
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,140
