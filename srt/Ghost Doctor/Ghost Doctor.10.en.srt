00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,110
I'm still here.
(Episode 10)
(Operating Room)

4
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,180
(Operating Room)
I'm still here.

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,710
I'm still here.

6
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,520
Inside your dear cousin's body.

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,160
Yes, you are right.

8
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,460
I am Cha Yeong Min.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,470
What? My quick confession gave you a panic attack?

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,740
You got mad

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,440
so you treated the patient's life

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,840
as a joke in my operating room?

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,540
You think the patients' lives

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,739
are a worthless joke, don't you?

15
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,950
But… How did you…

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,320
That's not important.

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,950
So,

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,990
you know my secret now. What are you gonna do?

19
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,820
You can go ahead and tell people.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,090
Make me a ghost and make yourself a psycho.

21
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm a ghost anyway. I don't care.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,670
But what would happen to a psycho?

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,370
You are already in trouble, aren't you?

24
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,000
Just think about it.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,340
You do like it, don't you?

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,210
I see that you talk about it with Jang Min Ho all the time.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,780
I'm not a psycho, you know?

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,910
Professor Cha is very precious to our hospital.

29
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,650
He's the expert who can make money for me.

30
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,880
Why would I do that?

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,520
Then think about it again

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,789
and come to me when you make a decision.

33
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,630
You said that you weren't a psycho,

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,030
and that I was precious to this hospital, didn't you?

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,240
Since you know that,

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,440
you'd better leave me alone.

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,910
You still need me to make money for you when I wake up, right?

38
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,980
Also, let me warn you,

39
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,490
if you dare touch my patients again,

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,590
I'll…

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,329
You've committed enough sins.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,260
It's time for you to stop. Just keep your mouth shut and wait

43
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,240
till I meet you in person.

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,280
(Operating Room)

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,230
Are you out of your mind? How could you tell him?

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,360
Well…

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,860
I wasn't going to, but my anger got the best of me

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,430
and I couldn't help…

49
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,700
Although, it seemed he asked because he already knew something.

50
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,840
I guess I was exposed after all.

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,310
Even so, you should've denied it!

52
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,540
How could you be so naive?

53
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,710
Don't you have any control over your anger?

54
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,810
What the heck were you thinking?

55
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,180
It was their fault…

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,210
They used Dr. Jang to lure me out.

57
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,880
So what should we do now?

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,780
Shall I take my words back and tell them I was lying?

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,190
What kind of nonsense is that?

60
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,120
Hey! I'm sorry.

61
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,760
But I did try my best to be cool.

62
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,290
So…

63
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,530
what do you think he'll do next?

64
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,730
Well…

65
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,360
Even though he's Han Seung Won, he must've been startled.

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,500
Assuming he's still human.

67
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,500
He even knows about the conversation I had with Jang Min Ho!

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,540
There were only the two of us at that time.

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,210
But Cha Yeong Min was there too and he heard everything.

70
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,210
He was watching us.

71
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,410
He really said that?

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,010
He admitted that he's Cha Yeong Min?

73
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,650
Are you kidding?

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,180
How many times do I have to tell you?

75
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,390
If it's true, then there's nothing that Cha Yeong Min doesn't know.

76
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,260
Who does he hate the most?

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,020
Me?

78
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,430
No.

79
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,030
It should be you.

80
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,000
You betrayed him and stabbed him in the back.

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,530
How could this happen?

82
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,540
How could an unconscious person…

83
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,700
And it's that guy whose body is possessed.

84
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,270
I thought they didn't get along with each other.

85
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,310
What are you going to do?

86
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,910
You are asking me?

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,220
Is he standing behind you right now?

88
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,420
Darn it!

89
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,230
Darn it!

90
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,430
He must've been scared to death.

91
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,600
Anyway, they should lay low for a while.

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,270
I did scare the hell out of him.

93
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,340
You did an incredible thing.

94
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,270
It was, wasn't it?

95
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,710
Not that big a deal.

96
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,409
Was the operation successful?

97
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,480
Of course.

98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,110
Even in such a situation, my skills still didn't fail me.

99
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,880
Good to know.

100
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,650
Anyway, what's done can't be undone.

101
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,110
Don't be stressed over that anymore.

102
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,150
It's not worth it, since you just performed a difficult operation.

103
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,320
Let's focus on the patient

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,760
and hope he can wake up soon.

105
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,790
I think Han Seung Won knows

106
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,260
that you can see ghosts.

107
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,230
He said you used to see spooky things

108
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,630
in the hospital when you were little.

109
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,830
So, he knows.

110
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,570
That's why he found out.

111
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,670
And he believes what you told him.

112
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,710
What happened exactly

113
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,580
when you were little?

114
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,620
Is that also privacy?

115
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
I was quite timid when I was little.

116
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,590
I was timid

117
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,390
because I was only eight years old.

118
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,100
I had an accident and I almost died.

119
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,440
And ever since I woke up, I've been able to see things that others can't.

120
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,510
It took me a long time to realize that they were ghosts.

121
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,810
It really scared me, so I came to the hospital more often

122
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,620
to see if I could keep seeing them.

123
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,870
I wished I couldn't.

124
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,080
And I'd run away when I saw them.

125
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,650
But how am I supposed to live if it goes on like that?

126
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,420
Or I may as well just kill myself.

127
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,920
Young as I was, I had all kinds of thoughts.

128
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,830
And later, I came here to overcome my fear

129
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,820
because I wanted to live.

130
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,090
I also wanted to practice how to pretend not to see them.

131
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,770
So boring.

132
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,270
(Fire extinguisher)

133
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,540
I lived like that for 10 years and I thought I finally overcame my fear
(Fire extinguisher)

134
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,580
until it came back to haunt me again.

135
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,550
Everybody, watch carefully.

136
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,310
Go Seung Tak, you go first.

137
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,880
Would it hurt

138
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,450
to be cut by that?

139
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,660
Hey, Go Seung Tak!

140
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,130
I can't do it.

141
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,830
Where are you going?

142
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,530
-Where are you going?
-Don't go.

143
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,830
Well, I'm afraid I can never do it.

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
Though I can't do it on my own,

145
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,210
I can lend my body to you. It still feels good

146
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,240
even though it's not my own strength.

147
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,310
At least I'm part of it.

148
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,590
You'll have to hang in there for four years after I wake up.

149
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,050
What are you gonna do?

150
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,260
Especially that Han Seung Won knows our secret now.

151
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,730
I won't be a doctor forever anyway.

152
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,330
So, make sure to get well so that we can put it to an end.

153
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,130
Wake up soon and you can operate yourself.

154
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,470
Before that, I'll do everything I can to hang in there.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,030
Though I heard the rumor,

156
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,030
it's still hard to believe he could be that good since he's only an intern.

157
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,740
Do you know how highly-skilled Dr. Go is?

158
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,950
Is… Is that possible?

159
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,550
(Dr. An Tae Hyeon)

160
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,150
When we did sarcoma surgery last time,
(Dr. An Tae Hyeon)

161
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,020
When we did sarcoma surgery last time,

162
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,490
Professor Cha moved the intubation by accident,

163
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,520
and air got in as a result.

164
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,460
The blood pressure dropped and the patient almost died because of it.

165
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,260
What? When did I?

166
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,330
Professor Cha Yeong Min.

Is Professor Cha getting better?

168
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,010
You should say hi first even if you are in a hurry.

169
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,380
Be polite, will you?

170
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,280
You ask the same question over and over every day.

I wish I could have good news,

172

but nothing has changed.

173
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,380
But the patient is awake now.

174
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,590
Is it because of stress?

175
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,020
I'm sorry if I made you feel stressed.

176

What?

178
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,060
You mean you went to the observation room?

179
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,200
Apologize to her.

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,930
I yelled at her earlier.

181
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,170
Why should I…

182
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,170
It's not my style.

183
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,610
Sorry that I yelled at you earlier.

184
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,940
It's okay. Never mind.

185

Just now…

187
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
Tell her you were kidding. You were just kidding.

188
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,420
And then leave. Don't forget to say goodbye.

190

Then, I'm leaving. Bye.

191
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,260
How did you know?

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,190
What?

193
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,130
Know what?

194
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,460
About Im Chun Hui's nosebleed.

195
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,160
Even the attending physician and his parents didn't know.

Oh, about that…

197
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,170
She told me herself.

198
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,440
I told you not to say…

199
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,640
Speaking of that…

200

You aren't her friend, are you?

203
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,180
Well… I'm a friend of a friend of hers.

Why did you go into the operating room?

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,430
I was asked to deliver the contract renewal in person.

208
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,500
I intended to work here for only some time,

209

but as you can see, I extended my contract period.

Will you leave this hospital when your contract expires this time?

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,380
Who were you talking to?

332
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,420
Uh, me?

333
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,650
With whom?

334
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,230
There's nobody else here.

335
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,630
Who were you talking to?

336
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,400
No… it wasn't me.

337
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,730
Why are you here?

338
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,340
You can't wander outside your ward now.

339
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,070
Come on, come with me.

340
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,860
It is so quiet here.

341
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,530
It's as quiet as on the eve of a storm.

342
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,270
Let's go.

343
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,070
Brother, how did you watch the patient?

344
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,010
Hmm?

345
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,380
O Seung Jo,

346
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,950
did you sneak out?

347
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,550
I told you many times not to go outside.

348
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,680
Hurry to get in. Your mum must be looking for you.

349
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,050
Yes, Doctor.

350
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,290
Hey! I told you not to jump or skip.

351
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,420
This boy never listens.

352
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,130
Any news?

353
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,000
Strange rumors, for example.

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,930
Rumors? Like what?

355
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,370
You have been talking about me whenever you gathered these days, right?

356
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,640
Go Seung Tak.

357
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,510
I won't care whether you are a ghost or an alien anymore.

358
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,910
And I will accompany you to the end.

359
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,010
What?

360
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,650
How should I put this? Whatever way I think about it,

361
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,620
I feel you have protected me

362
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,750
from the black magic hands.

363
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,660
Thus, I am willing to accompany you to the end.

364
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,820
What nonsense!

365
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,430
Go without me and don't come back.

366
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,630
(Thoracic Surgery Department Exam Room)

367
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,670
Maybe I should have said "from the K-Zombie's hands".

368
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,200
(Operating Room)

369
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,450
Did she go back into her body?

370
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,550
Yes, she did.

371
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,820
Great.

372
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,920
This is great news. This is great.

373
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,060
What? Why are you so startled?

374
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,590
You look as if you saw a ghost.

375
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,830
Didn't you go back into your body?

376
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,500
Uh, today they only put the cannula into my head.

377
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,300
Through the cannula,

378
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,140
they injected antibiotics into my head. Now they need observe me for a while.

379
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,140
If this works, I will get better.

380
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,640
Based on what I saw on the surgeon's face,

381
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,980
I think the surgery went very well.

382
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,980
It is just the beginning, so you need not be too disappointed.

383
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,880
The man over there told me this.

384
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,160
She didn't seem to understand it very well, so…

385
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,870
That's what a doctor should do.

386
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,440
Aren't you a doctor yourself?

387
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,370
Why are you saying this in a strange way?

388
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,380
Don't say that. He helped find a way to cure Chun Hui

389
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,280
and got her the surgery, right?

390
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,780
Right. I almost forgot to thank you.

391
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,950
Thank you for finding a way to cure me.

392
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,930
Oh, Dr. Jang,

393
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,960
why need you be in such a rush?

394
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,300
You ran over upon finishing the surgery.

395
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,000
If you keep doing so, you might get sick, right?

396
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,300
Ms. Min and I will take turns to attend to him.

397
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,670
You should go get some rest.

398
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,740
Go out to get some fresh air and sunshine.

399
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,510
Don't you feel suffocated?

400
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,380
I can get the fresh air and sunshine this way.

401
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,850
This is good enough.

402
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,020
He has been like this for several months.

403
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,180
It has been a while since I sat in the sun.

404
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,850
Did we ask you? You are cottoning up to us.

405
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,010
Gosh, why did you say that?

406
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,280
We didn't buy this place.

407
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,520
Right. It's good to bask in the sun together.

408
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,890
Today, the sunshine is great and I am in a great mood.

409
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,430
People need to get more sunshine.

410
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,130
That's why we launched the Sunshine Policy.

411
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,000
Sunshine Policy?

412
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,070
Have you woken up?

413
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,540
You talked nonsense.

414
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,980
You think I said those words because I didn't know that?

415
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,150
I just wanted to make you laugh.

416
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,690
You are all experts.

417
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,560
But you hired interns to improve performance due to your incompetence.

418
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,100
Strictly speaking, this is surgical fraud.

419
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,500
Did you realize that?

420
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Well, you are overstating the matter.

421
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,830
Our main surgeons performed the operations in person.

422
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,600
They only used the help of the assistant during the operation.

423
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,810
This doesn't go against the medical law.

424
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,410
I checked the operation schedules of our main surgeons

425
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,580
and found one operation was performed by the resident alone.

426
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,480
Ah, the abdominal aortic aneurysm.

427
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,320
What happened back then was…

428
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,850
Let me explain, please.

429
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,060
I ran there with a speed faster than Bolt.

430
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,530
But the patient's condition was very critical at that time.

431
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,330
During this time, you should be covering up.

432
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,400
Now that I know it, I won't sit by and do nothing.

433
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,970
If this is discovered by the outside world, it will be a very big case.

434
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,070
Professors, would you like to have a separate disciplinary committee?

435
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,700
Doctor, here I come again.

436
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,160
What's your request this time?

437
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,430
I request that you stay here till the night

438
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,170
and company Professor Cha Yeong Min.

439
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,510
What? What do you want me to do?

440
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,150
Hello, doctor.

441
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,110
Just now Go Seung Tak asked me to

442
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,220
check on Professor Cha every hour.

443
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,260
Professor, Professor, I'm Jae Won, Jae Won.

444
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,060
My apology for not coming to see you more often.

445
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,560
I heard that you have a car. You will wake up.

446
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,730
You have to wake up. What should I do?

447
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,840
Doctor, I've heard that you took half a day off. Good job.

448
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,210
Please hurry and go. Hurry.

449
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,580
Me? Half a day off?

450
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,180
Just half a day off, you should spend it outside.

451
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,350
Isn't it a sunny autumn day?

452
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,550
I know you did that for my sake, thank you.

453
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,190
But I'm OK. I have nowhere to go anyway.

454
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,290
You have a place to go.

455
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,620
This is a very popular star in Korea.

456
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,930
I've heard that Professor Cha is her big fan.

457
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,760
Professor Cha? A fan?

458
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,270
Yes. Isn't it absurd?

459
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,900
You should see for yourself.

460
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,670
The star was Professor Cha's patient when she was a child.

461
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,670
When she came here for another operation,

462
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,310
she asked me to tell Professor Cha something if he wakes up.

463
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,680
Anyway,

464
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,250
won't Professor Cha be happy

465
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,950
if you go for him?

466
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
You said it gave you happy hormones to watch the concert video.

467
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,990
Will a live concert double it?

468
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,220
We don't have enough time, hurry and go down.

469
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,060
I can do that, but...

470
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,200
How should I... You mean…

471
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,800
That's why I'm so well-dressed.

472
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,040
It's a limited edition. Be careful with it.

473
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,310
Don't ruin this coat and don't always put your hands in the pockets.

474
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,940
In addition, you can't do this.

475
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,280
You'll regret it

476
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,510
if you let my hand hold that kind of thing.

477
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,520
What a surprise.

478
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,460
I am surprised for sure,

479
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,060
but why are you surprised, Dr. Go?

480
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,500
Why am I surprised?

481
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,840
Well, I didn't expect you to come here.

482
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,740
Didn't you ask me to come?

483
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,270
What is going on here?

484
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,540
I was asked by someone too.

485
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,550
That Jessica, Jessica. No, not Jessica.

486
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,750
Her original name was Lee Ji Woo.

487
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,350
I am Patient Lee Ji Woo's attending physician.

488
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,880
I came in case of an emergency.

489
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,650
I'm here as a doctor. As a doctor...

490
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,830
Well, now that everyone is here,

491
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,360
I want to confess something to you.

492
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,970
I had a heart operation recently.

493
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,770
My attending physician said that

494
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,380
I couldn't do too strenuous activities yet.

495
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,350
So I'll sit here and present the song.

496
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,720
I hope you can understand.

497
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,250
OK.

498
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,370
♫ I wake up in the morning ♫

499
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,240
♫ Can hardly open my eyes ♫

500
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,510
♫ With so many eye crusts ♫

501
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,140
♫ Because I cried so hard ♫

502
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,080
♫ My face looks swollen ♫

503
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,480
♫ How to put on make-up ♫

504
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,160
♫ The make-up base is hard to apply ♫

505
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,360
♫ Just like you are hard to convince ♫

506
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,630
♫ The eyelines on my swollen eyes ♫

507
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,000
♫ Are hard to paint So is our future ♫

508
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,600
♫ Hello Hello Hello ♫

509
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,100
♫ It's another new day ♫

510
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,870
♫ Leave the annoying ♫

511
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,770
♫ Trouble behind ♫

512
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,210
♫ I am who I am from today on ♫

513
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,580
♫ You are who you are from now on ♫

514
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,210
♫ Hello Hello Hello ♫

515
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,680
♫ Yeah A brand-new day ♫

516
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,180
♫ I don't want to get hurt any more ♫

517
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,180
♫ Not any more ♫

518
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,550
♫ Don't call ♫

519
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,090
♫ Try not to call ♫

520
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:18,320
♫ Not used to the life without you yet ♫

521
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:25,160
♫ Memories come round occasionally ♫

522
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:32,740
♫ Remind me of the past ♫

523
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,840
♫ But do have a good day ♫

524
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,910
It's been a long time since I came out for a walk at night.

525
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,680
It feels so good. The scenery on the road is beautiful, too.

526
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,680
Working in Thoracic Surgery Department must be tiring, right?

527
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,580
I've seen it when I was an intern.

528
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,820
It feels like you live in the hospital every day.

529
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,450
That's how we came through.

530
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,530
That's how we came through.

531
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,200
But today's young people are all going to less tiring departments.

532
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,270
May I ask why did you choose to work in the Thoracic Surgery Department?

533
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,870
I had a deal with a girl

534
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,810
I work in the Thoracic Surgery Department, and she works in the Neurosurgery Department.

535
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,020
Yeong Min, we must do this in the future.

536
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,990
We do this and make a hospital home.

537
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,820
You work in the Thoracic Surgery Department, and I work in the Neurosurgery Department.

538
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,460
How about it? Does it feel good?

539
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,600
To make a hospital home must feel good...

540
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,040
Well... How about having supper?

541
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,440
No, let's get back to the hospital.

542
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,180
Now that we're out, we should have a meal.

543
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,580
It doesn't matter, I'm not hungry.

544
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,920
Then how about we have something other than supper?

545
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,450
Why didn't this guy pick up?

546
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,320
He wasn't seen all day. I'm really worried about him.

547
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,520
(Emergency Department Park)

548
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,240
Why did they get off the car together?

549
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,480
And what's that look on him?

550
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,170
Thank you for today.

551
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,700
I could go out for a ride for your sake.

552
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,370
Yes, me too.

553
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,040
Then I...

554
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,290
It seems to be a good end.

555
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,760
Well, how about your happy hormones?

556
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,330
Thanks to you, I've got a lot of it.

557
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,639
I've been doing a lot of things that I would never do in my life lately,

558
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,699
which is meaningful...

559
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,400
What is this?

560
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,610
You said it yourself, walnut biscuits are the next.

561
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,110
When are you going to fulfill my request?

562
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,340
Your request.

563
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,310
Then how about the next one. I want walnut biscuits.

564
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,850
OK, well, walnut biscuits are the next...

565
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,050
At that time, it was only in a confusing state that I agreed...

566
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,250
Even if you were confusing, a promise is a promise.

567
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,219
I took care of it for you.

568
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,960
What? You want me to thank you? You used my body anyway.

569
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,699
Yes, brother.

570
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,270
Hey, Seung Tak, something big happened.

571
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,699
Something big? What big thing?

572
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,469
Is it Professor Cha...

573
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,670
Seung Jo disappeared.

574
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,010
Where could he be?

575
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,380
Hey, I thought it was really something big, you scared me.

576
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,610
Maybe he is playing hide-and-seek somewhere else.

577
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,150
Is it Seung Jo?

578
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,780
Did you check the lounge?

579
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,450
I'll look down stairs.

580
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,260
Sorry. I went by myself.

581
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,330
Next time let's go together.

582
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,560
You and me.

583
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,330
Oh, this.

584
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,300
Dr. Go said you would like it.

585
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,510
He knows you very well.

586
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,950
Just like he is you.

587
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,490
(ICU)

588
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,800
Please let him become a doctor

589
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,830
and meet patients just like himself.

590
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,170
Yes, and work hard in the Thoracic Surgery Department.

591
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,800
My little friend O Seung Jo,

592
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,210
what time is it now?

593
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,310
Don't you know that children got to bed at 9 o'clock?

594
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,310
Let's go, I will send you back.

595
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,480
Attending doctor.

596
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,860
Attending doctor, are you here to see Seung Jo?

597
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,330
Seung Jo, you…

598
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,340
Seung Jo, Seung Jo, open your eyes.

599
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,190
Ah.

600
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,230
What's going on? What happened here?

601
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,300
I came to find him and found him passed out on the ground.

602
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,430
Did you come all by yourself? Where is Professor Cha Yeong Min?

603
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,470
Hey, you.

604
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,670
Find a way to save the child first.

605
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,370
Is he around you, Professor Cha?

606
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,870
Yes. What?

607
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,110
He is.

608
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,950
Replace me, hurry.

609
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,160
Check heartbeat.

610
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
He is back.

611
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,470
Endotracheal intubation first, then confirm whether consciousness is restored.

612
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,440
What? Oh.

613
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,650
When did you... When in the world did you know it?

614
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,280
I think it's

615
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,020
when you knew about it.

616
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,780
That's from the beginning?

617
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,790
Then why did you pretend you didn't know a thing?

618
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,960
What would you think if Professor Cha possessed me?

619
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,430
You never asked.

620
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,090
Why does this sound so familiar?

621
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,600
Wow, how could you…

622
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,600
Because you were being so obvious.

623
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,300
Is he here?

624
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,340
Professor Cha.

625
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,540
Professor Cha.

626
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,510
Hey, she can't see me, can she?

627
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,110
Please restrain yourself, don't call me Intern O.

628
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,980
Only you called me that.

629
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,080
But this dude here calls me O Crystal.

630
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,950
Well, you two couldn't even do that right.

631
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,990
Who would call an intern that?

632
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,320
Wow. What's wrong with her?

633
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,690
In addition,

634
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,920
don't do this before every operation.

635
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,790
This seemed to be Professor Cha's signature move.

636
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,960
Do you want to tell the world out loud that you are Cha Yeong Min?

637
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,630
What?

638
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,600
You've been doing this?

639
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,000
But, that's what I do.

640
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,700
That's hard to change. Do you understand?

641
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,600
It's like that.

642
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,100
It would be a miracle if nobody found out.

643
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,870
The two of you should do that kind of things right first.

644
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,480
We'll do what we do and I'll help you two.

645
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,810
But why did you get all dressed up?

646
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,450
Oh, I had a place to go.

647
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,350
Where?

648
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,550
Jessica's concert.

649
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,920
What? A concert?

650
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,250
Whom did you go with?

651
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,760
Dr. Jang.

652
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,060
Why did you go with her?

653
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,690
I have my reason.

654
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,230
But it's not the point.

655
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,560
It looks like you've been having a good time these days.

656
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,160
You are even dating a woman.

657
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,400
Good for you.

658
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Wow, hey.

659
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,410
Is she always so imaginative?

660
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,040
Even if that's so obvious, should she believe it?

661
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,110
Yeah, she is imaginative for sure.

662
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,920
But is that really so obvious?

663
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,690
Hey.

664
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,230
Is it delicious?

665
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,170
It's not?

666
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,630
How is it not delicious? Be specific.

667
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,740
It's all right.

668
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,810
It's all right?

669
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,140
Just all right?

670
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,540
Tell me the truth, is it too sweet?

671
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,310
The flour is too hard, too.

672
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,080
Right.

673
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,550
Who bought this?

674
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,720
How was it? Is your throat okay?

675
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,950
Were there a lot of people?

676
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,250
Was there any customer?

677
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,020
I don't know about the throat.

678
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,820
There were many people on the street, but not so many customers.

679
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,930
Right, newcomer. Do you want to try it, too?

680
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,530
I don't eat street food.

681
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,540
Let me be straight.

682
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,670
Two doctors ran over

683
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,580
and they didn't seem to have cured a single child.

684
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,180
Now they stare people in the face.

685
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,450
The two of them.

686
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,690
Has it finally been found out?

687
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,660
Oh, I was thinking you lasted a long time.

688
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,990
Why couldn't you be more careful?

689
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,700
You stayed in our hospital for a long time.

690
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,270
Don't you think you should pay the rent?

691
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,040
Wow, such a little child

692
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,370
has grown so big.

693
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,780
Time flies.

694
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,210
Right. A little child has grown so big.

695
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,150
Do you still have nowhere to go? Do you need me to help ask around?

696
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,750
What are you talking about?

697
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,560
You were so kind when you were a child,

698
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,920
but now you are getting meaner and meaner.

699
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,430
You look the same as I saw you when I was a kid.

700
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,060
But right now you must be an old man.

701
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,170
But why are you still here?

702
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,340
Generally, when people die, they vanish quickly.

703
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,340
Gee, why didn't you ask earlier?

704
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,210
You must be curious for around 20 years.

705
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,750
Everyone has their own story that cannot be told.

706
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,250
No matter who it is, they have a story.

707
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,720
When I was little, our eyes met once.

708
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,390
You obviously saw me.

709
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,260
But why did you pretend you didn't know?

710
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,760
For 20 years.

711
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,760
Well,

712
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,130
because you pretended to not know me,

713
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,940
then why should I show that I know you?

714
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,340
Wow, so cool.

715
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,110
What a nice thought.

716
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,310
Well, I have something urgent to deal with, so let me say goodbye.

717
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,310
Let's keep in touch.

718
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,020
Gee, this kid has grown well.

719
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,000
Where is Seung Jo?

720
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,770
Well, he was taken away by the ghosts.

721
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,440
He can't meet his mom.

722
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,840
Did the chat go well?

723
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,410
You can say that.

724
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,780
Hey, I should have thought of that earlier.

725
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,380
You came to the hospital a lot, and that guy Jeo has been here for 20 years.

726
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,050
It'd be strange if he didn't know.

727
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,350
Will he wake up one day?

728
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,090
Of course.

729
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,460
I will put him into the original position.

730
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,430
Early in the morning, Gim Jae Won will do brain CT and cardiac MRI for him.

731
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,000
You go back and rest.

732
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,460
I'll take care of Seung Jo.

733
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,870
Forget about Go Seung Tak,

734
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,180
why did Dr. Jang go to the concert too?

735
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,410
Are people in Neurosurgery Department so laid back?

736
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,110
Even I don't have time to go.

737
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,920
Is it

738
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,150
because of Professor Cha, those two started to know each other, and then...

739
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,960
Gee, what am I talking about?

740
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,800
Mom, I'm back.

741
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,940
Why do you come back late every day?

742
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,470
You should get off work on time.

743
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,140
Well, I went out with my friends.

744
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,270
Gee, playing is tiring.

745
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,440
Brat, I'm back.

746
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,120
What was that guy who named it thinking? Brat?

747
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,980
It's ridiculous.

748
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,020
Maybe he wanted to have three good meals a day.
(Note: the pronunciation of "three meals" and "brat" in Korean is the same)

749
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,690
So it's not Brat, but Three Meals?

750
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,290
That makes sense.

751
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,030
But why isn't he taking it back?

752
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,800
He asked you to take care of it for a while, but it's been a long time.

753
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,200
He'll take it back soon.

754
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,570
He's busy lately.

755
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,480
Su Jeong, mom's eyes are dry, check them for me.

756
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,150
What?

757
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:29,980
Me?

758
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,880
You've worked as an intern in ophthalmology department for a month.

759
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,050
Can't you do this?

760
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,650
Oh, sure.

761
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,530
Have you acted well in front of the professors?

762
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,300
I heard the competition is fierce.

763
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,500
You must be an excellent intern

764
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,970
so as to be selected as a specialist.

765
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,870
Don't worry. I'm trying my best.

766
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,180
Maybe the air is too dry so that your eyes get a little dry.

767
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,080
I know that, too.

768
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,710
Are you an eye doctor?

769
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,620
Of course. I'm an ophthalmology intern.

770
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,290
Something is wrong with you.

771
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,590
Have you rotated in the Emergency Room, Thoracic Surgery Department or Neurosurgery Department?

772
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,930
Ow, why would I go to those torturing departments?

773
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,730
You've promised

774
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,800
to only be a doctor

775
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,300
in the ophthalmology, E.N.T., or dermatology department.

776
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,300
You are not going to live your grandpa's life.

777
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,170
I get it.

778
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,040
Mom, let me check for you again.

779
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,820
Hi, did you sleep well?

780
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,990
I slept for a while.

781
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,720
How about Seung Jo?

782
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,760
Still asleep.

783
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,060
Who's his current attending doctor?

784
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,760
Professor Gang.

785
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,460
The reason?

786
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:53,930
I found it.

787
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,930
It's said that he often ran around recently.

788
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,970
After the right ventricular catheter replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery,

789
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,570
the patient's running caused his right ventricular catheter

790
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,810
to press the internal and external arteries.

791
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,310
The decreased blood flow in the left coronary artery led to cardiac arrest.

792
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,820
Luckily, we found the patient in time and performed CPR

793
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,220
to recover his heart rate.

794
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,120
He's in a coma for now.

795
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,490
But the MRI shows no sign of cerebral injury.

796
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,130
Observation is needed for the time being.

797
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,800
The problem is his right ventricular catheter.

798
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,470
Look.

799
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,800
This is his cardiac CT taken this morning.

800
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,240
The right ventricular catheter and internal and external arteries

801
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,910
should have some spare space.

802
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,310
But the running causes blood flow increases and the resulting blockage.

803
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,340
Were you watching this while I was sleeping?

804
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,080
Or what, having fun? You brat!

805
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,550
Focus.

806
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,020
Here comes the key point.

807
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,350
We should create a bigger space

808
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,820
and move the right catheter to this position.

809
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,500
Thus, another surgery is needed to change the right ventricular catheter.

810
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,930
Let's conduct it today, Professor Han.

811
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:08,340
Uh, I'm afraid not. My schedule is full today.

812
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,580
Oh, which professor is available today?

813
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,710
I'll be your assistant.

814
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,180
Do you understand what I mean?

815
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,520
What's wrong with everybody?

816
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,920
Chief Ban.

817
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,650
Um, me?

818
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,090
I…

819
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,530
I mean, the patient is a kid.

820
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,090
His coronary artery is in a bad situation.

821
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,830
Multiple additional surgeries

822
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,330
may put him in danger during the operations.

823
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,000
Besides, the kid hasn't woken up yet.

824
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,770
It's better to wait until he's getting better mentally.

825
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,140
Let's observe him for a few days.

826
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,670
Actually, according to the rules,

827
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,810
the attending doctor should be the same.

828
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,310
I mean, Dr. An Tae Hyeon is not here.

829
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,380
As you know, I assisted Dr. An Tae Hyeon in the preceding surgery.

830
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,420
Now that you mentioned it,

831
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,390
Dr. Go, you don't need to assist me in Tuesday's operation.

832
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,660
Oh, me either.

833
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,100
Hwang Yeong Sik will assist me in the coronary artery bypass graft operation next week.

834
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,260
Yeah, and me.

835
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,470
As for my inferior aortic aneurysm and MVR surgery,

836
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,870
Lee Seon Ho will help me.

837
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,450
(EunSang University Medical Center)

838
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,590
Brother, is it you?

839
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:31,850
Did you come alone

840
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,090
or together?

841
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,530
Well, Go Seung Tak?

842
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,730
Cha Yeong Min?

843
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,060
You'd better wear a name tag.

844
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,500
Brother, are you stopping me from performing surgeries?

845
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,100
Others may really think it's you who did it.

846
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,000
What? Why?

847
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,740
I'm fulfilling the duty of a vice president of administration.

848
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,110
It's abnormal to let a resident

849
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,110
perform surgeries.

850
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,110
It will cause trouble if it's known by people from the outside.

851
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,020
That's not the reason, is it?

852
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,720
Of course not.

853
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,890
I'm just curious.

854
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,120
Why would Professor Cha in that state

855
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,890
enter your body to do surgeries?

856
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:13,430
I can't hear a sincere answer from him even if I ask.

857
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,730
So I decided to stop him first

858
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,330
and see what would happen.

859
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,200
Though I can't kill or save Professor Cha,

860
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,470
I can still do things of this kind.

861
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,810
The patient is a kid.

862
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,840
He's unconscious now.

863
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,940
Let him have this operation.

864
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,910
I've warned those professors.

865
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,750
How could I do things like this?

866
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,580
One exception will make power and order collapse.

867
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,280
Don't you know that?

868
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,050
Is your power more important than a kid's life?

869
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,400
The kid's life matters a lot to you, right?

870
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,840
Now that we've said it, let's be frank.

871
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,300
To cooperate with Professor Cha

872
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,540
is not just good for him, is it?

873
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,010
To be honest,

874
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,880
you're doing it to achieve your own ambition,

875
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,310
aren't you?

876
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,780
I can't watch this.

877
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,550
If you really feel sorry for that kid's life,

878
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,990
confess your secret about Professor Cha first.

879
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:17,460
Otherwise, do it yourself instead of with the help of Professor Cha.

880
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,660
(Vice President of Administration's Office)

881
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,040
I've warned that bastard before.

882
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,470
But a leopard cannot change its spots.

883
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,940
Bad people are always bad.

884
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,640
Darn it, that jerk!

885
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,580
Lend me your hand.

886
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,280
I'll throw him out of the window.

887
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,420
What's wrong? Why are you so lost?

888
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,350
Where's Seung Jo?

889
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,590
The crying calf

890
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:51,690
sits on the pot.

891
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:56,330
Mommy.

892
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:57,830
My ass is so hot.

893
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,440
Look, the kid is having a good time.

894
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,300
Very happy.

895
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,140
He's such a bright boy.

896
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,110
So bright.

897
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,810
At times like this, I always think luckily he's still a kid.

898
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,680
Wow, he's so cute.

899
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,010
Whether at home or in the hospital, it's always nice to have a kid around.

900
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,120
So I plan to have more kids.

901
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,120
A mom of many kids.

902
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,490
But how long will he still be lucky for?

903
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,390
I have no idea.

904
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,760
Maybe until he realizes that the ghosts are so good.

905
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,360
Let's play hide and seek.

906
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
Okay, come on.

907
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,160
You catch us.

908
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,030
Hide yourself well.

909
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,530
Okay.

910
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,970
Hide well. Be careful of your hair.

911
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,440
Can't you come to pick him up quickly?

912
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,540
What?

913
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,850
Didn't you say that you needed a kid?

914
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,280
And I said one more sentence.

915
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,150
Three hours at most with a kid.

916
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,890
You try to play hide and seek 27 times.

917
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,720
Where is the kid?

918
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,590
Isn't he asleep on the bench?

919
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,130
Has the 28th started?

920
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,370
No!

921
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,010
Hide well.

922
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,910
Be careful of your hair.

923
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,880
(To be played in 60 seconds)

924
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,950
You're screwed if you get caught.
(To be played in 60 seconds)

925
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,050
I want no kid now.

926
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,490
Seung Jo, where are you?

927
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,900
To cooperate with Professor Cha

928
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,300
is not just good for him, is it?

929
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,470
To be honest, you're doing it to achieve your own ambition,

930
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,900
aren't you?

931
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,680
Vice President, please.

932
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,820
It's just a kid's surgery. Let's work together.

933
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,550
Dr. Go can also help.

934
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,160
Isn't the patient still unconscious?

935
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,160
The kid hasn't woken up. How can you perform surgery?

936
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,730
If he still can't wake up after the surgery, then we will be in trouble.

937
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:06,600
Yes, I'm aware.

938
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,430
It's your policy to try to avoid surgeries with high risk index…

939
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,600
No one else can do it? Then why do I pay you such a high salary?

940
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,240
If you really have no confidence,

941
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,270
transfer him to another hospital.

942
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,710
Bastard!

943
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,710
That will be a little…

944
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,980
The full surgery cost

945
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,880
is covered by Professor Cha's donation.

946
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,110
And the hospitalization cost.

947
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,720
You said the hospitalization cost…

948
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,620
Are you feeling not well?

949
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:36,330
I see, donation.

950
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,690
It is for Professor Cha's operations.

951
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,100
This additional surgery is not included.

952
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,600
It's not involved in donation.

953
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,100
Is there Professor Cha's signature?

954
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,770
What signature?

955
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,170
In the future, any use of Professor Cha's donation

956
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:51,210
should be signed by me.

957
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,370
Considering his current state,

958
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,080
just put the donation under the hospital.

959
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,480
I'm wondering how to upgrade the VIP wards.

960
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,420
Problem solved.

961
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,390
Such a jerk!

962
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,660
Seung Jo.

963
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,700
Come on, wake up.

964
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,640
Mommy is waiting for you.

965
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,480
Mommy.

966
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,190
Mommy.

967
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,560
Mommy.

968
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,620
Mommy.

969
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,190
I'm here.

970
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,070
Doctor,

971
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:00,440
what's wrong with my mommy?

972
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,750
Seung Jo.

973
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,390
You must be painful now, right?

974
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,890
Come on, wake up.

975
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:38,650
Bro,

976
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,520
is what you said still valid?

977
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,180
What?

978
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,250
What did I say?

979
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,720
Whether I'm a ghost or an alien,

980
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,290
you will be with me.

981
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:48,090
What do you want?

982
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,560
Okay, let's go.

983
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,100
But to send the kid to another hospital is a little…

984
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,600
Yeah.

985
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,740
They have no money for surgeries.

986
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,510
He needs more surgeries.

987
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,980
Talk, talk. Don't just talk.

988
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,510
Make a decision. We need a decision.

989
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,450
You guys.

990
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,520
What is a doctor?

991
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,950
Hippocrates.

992
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,950
Sense of mission.

993
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,760
Can we let patients wait for doctors?

994
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,260
How could we just read faces?

995
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,330
Is it okay to focus more on money than life?

996
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,630
Our professors are real doctors.

997
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:32,270
Unlike those who can ignore patients and still eat.

998
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,070
Especially Chief Ban.

999
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,870
20 years ago, you must have saved the 8-year-old patient

1000
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,270
with the same love for patients.

1001
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,780
What?

1002
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,710
Me?

1003
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,710
You were very brave back then, Chief Ban.

1004
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,780
That courage supported you to this position.

1005
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,850
Right.

1006
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,350
At this position, you must stand out

1007
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,290
when a patient is in danger.

1008
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:57,490
Please take the right path for the patient.

1009
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,070
Dr. Go?

1010
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,840
He asked you to have meals on time.

1011
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,510
He is worried about you.

1012
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,950
Ah, I am so surprised.

1013
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,700
I had a deal with a girl.

1014
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,400
I came to Thoracic Surgery Department.

1015
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,330
And she went to Neurosurgery Department.

1016
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,640
We said we would live together

1017
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,040
and take over the whole hospital.

1018

(EunSang University Medical Center)

1019
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,820
How much time is left?

1020
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,560
15 minutes.

1021
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,690
You didn't sleep, right?

1022
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,760
I had coffee all night.

1023
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,860
My heart is trembling.

1024
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,960
And look at my shaking hands.

1025
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,570
It's because of caffeine.

1026
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:13,370
I can do it, right?

1027
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,300
Bro.

1028
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,910
Bro, you're the best.

1029
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,140
Be confident.

1030
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,540
Okay. Confidence.

1031
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,020
How much time is left?

1032
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,480
About 10 minutes.

1033
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,790
Not Gim Jae Won. I mean you.

1034
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,390
About 20 hours.

1035
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,920
Well done, resident.

1036
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,630
I'm doing it only because I'm a resident.

1037
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,790
I'm the one who enjoys others' service.

1038
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,960
I am Party A.

1039
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,770
Party B, are you ignoring me?

1040
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,230
Where are you going? How dare you?

(Operating Room)

1042
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,430
Seung Jo, do you know who I am?

1043
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,330
Yeah, I'm Cha Yeong Min.

1044
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,700
The best doctor in this hospital.

1045
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,170
Whose attending doctor I am?

1046
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,710
Seung Jo.

1047
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,410
Right.

1048
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:31,550
You'll meet your mom. I promise.

1049
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,320
Now please be strong and wait here.

1050
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,190
Can you do that, Seung Jo?

1051
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:38,590
Yes.

1052
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:55,370
(Operating Room)

1053
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,270
Does he pay it back just like that?

1054
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,510
Is it something passed on between generations?

1055
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,790
Hello, Vice President.

1056
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,190
Why did you come here on weekend?

1057
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,720
Professor Han and Dr. Gim Jae Won

1058
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,420
have made up their minds to operate on the kid

1059
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,860
by using their days of rest.

1060
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,830
Of course I should come to encourage them.

1061
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,060
Oh, you don't need to do that.

1062
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,300
I don't like that since childhood.

1063
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,100
Which operating room?

1064
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,900
Which? Right, which one?

1065
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,700
Is it changed or not decided yet?

1066
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,680
As you can see, the operation is well prepared.

1067
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,890
But this operation is a pretty sensitive one.

1068
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,820
Right, it's sensitive.

1069
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,820
We can't make them uncomfortable.

1070
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,590
Sure, let's leave here.

1071
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,130
Five.

1072
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,090

Two.

1075

Why did you get in?

1085
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,800
I came to do the surgery.

1086
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,400
Brother, what are you doing here?

1087
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,140
I see, to visit.

1088
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,570
Chief Ban.

1089
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,740
Well, that means actually

1090
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,740
Dr. Gim Jae Won stayed up all night to take care of patients.

1091
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,980
180 resident hours plus 8 overtime hours.

1092
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,920
188 hours at most.

1093

Professor Han.

1094
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,790
I've contacted all other residents.

1095
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:55,260
Everyone is in the same situation.

1096
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,360
Except for Dr. Go Seung Tak, he has some hours left.

1097
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,570
Thanks to someone, I can't work.

1098
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,300
So I have so much time left.

1099
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,070
About 20 hours.

1100
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:10,110
Ten minutes has gone now.

1101
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:13,270
Isn't there a fine of 5 million won for violating the resident law?

1102
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,540
Some residents were caught before, right?

1103
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,850
What era is it now?

1104
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,010
Can you still use residents at will?

1105
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:22,080
If they get caught again this time, the fine will not be a big deal,

1106
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,050
but they can get removed from the resident TO.

1107
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:28,220
Our resident TO is already not enough.

1108
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,730
Shall we start, Professor Han?

1109

I'll die, right?

won't happen to you?

There's only one result.

To wake up

1141
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:04,770
or to die.
