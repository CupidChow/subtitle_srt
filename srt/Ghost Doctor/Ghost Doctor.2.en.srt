Professor Cha, you are incredible.

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,930
Such a complicated and difficult operation,

4
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,330
you can finish flawlessly.

5
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,000
Should this level be reported to the society?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Because of the patient's advanced age,

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,100
He may need some time to wake up.

8
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,130
During the time, it has the risk to produce tumor emboli.

Well, I'll keep an eye here,

Well, where is he going in such a hurry?

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,290
Does he do that on purpose so he can hit me?

29
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,000

Is it bro Jae Won?

33

Yes, Go Seung Tak, are you busy?

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,579

I'll go back right now, you keep watching,

Professor Cha, patient's blood pressure goes down again.

46
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,240
Could it be that the surgical site is cracked?

47

What are you talking about? How could it be?

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,780
before the patient wake up?

168
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,220
I don't know either.

169
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,190
He wouldn't report to me before leaving.

170
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,190
How do you do your job?

171
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,720
Don't you know his identity?

172
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,030
I know, sorry.

173
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,930
But right now... I helped to overcome the emergency.

174
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,900
Who is doing Professor Cha's operation?

175
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,570
Professor An Tae Hyeon went in.

176
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,440
It should be over now.

177
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,900
Doctor An?

178
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,190
Why can a person go in, but not me?

179
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,660
Right...

180
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,700
Fortunately Doctor An Tae Hyeon arrived in time. Thanks a lot.

181
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,670
Did the operation succeed?

182
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,670
I... suppose the operation was a success.

183
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,210
Is Professor Cha alright?

184
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,710
Of course.

185
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,840
Don't just see An Tae Hyeon is like this.

186
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,240
He's got some strength.

187
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,710
We cannot tell for sure.

188
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,250
Why? Is something happen during the operation?

189
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,490
The operation went well.

190
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,220
But whether he can wake up or not depends on the situation.

191
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,560
Is it...

192
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,800
He is in low blood pressure for too long.

193
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,000
It couldn't be.

194
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,710
It can't be.

195
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,310
No, I have to go back.

196
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,180
Damn it.

197
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,720
I want to go back.

198
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,050
Please. Damn it.

199
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,990
Please, please.

200
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,720
I need to go back...

201
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,860
No, no...

202
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,730
I want to go back. I want to live. I want to live.

203
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,170
No, I want to go back.

204
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,910
Go Seung Tak.

205
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,880
Are you sure it is Go Seung Tak who did the surgery in front of him?

206
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,250
Intern, are you sure you have seen it with your own eyes?

207
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,550
Yes.

208
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,590
It's nonsense.

209
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,220
How can it be?

210
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,690
How could Go Seung Tak...

211
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,060
Is it important to discuss this?

212
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,800
You...

213
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,700
Why didn't you arrive in time?

214
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,370
Didn't the first bleeding stop in time?

215
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,300
Why stopped in the middle of it?

216
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,140
I saw him completely frozen.

217
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,440
Two eights are sixteen, three eights are twenty-four.

218

Four eights are thirty-two...

(Medical Center Entry)
Four eights are thirty-two...

220

Don't tell anybody about President Jang.

221
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,120
Keep it a secret for now. Don't tell anyone.

222
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,600
Hey, Go Seung Tak, I've been looking for you for half a day.

223
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,060
Wow, things are really gummed up today.

224
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,470
But this is the best one I have to say.

225
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,040
What's wrong with you? Did you really operate on Professor Cha?

226
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,300
You? Yourself?

227
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,940
It was a cardiac tamponade operation.

228
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,070
Hey, are you dead?

229
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,310
Did you really operate on Professor Cha?

230
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,610
Yes, they said that I did it.

231
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,680
Did you say I did it?

232
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,250
Shouldn't you say... I did it?

233
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,860
But... I don't remember.

234
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,890
Yes, you did it.

235
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,860
I'm so bloody jealous of you.

236
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,360
Wow, first solo surgery.

237
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,970
What am I saying?

238
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,400
It was Professor Cha's surgery.

239
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,510
Ah, what's wrong with Professor Cha anyway?

240
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,350
What a bolt from the blue!

241
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,250
Hey, that's what happens when you have your first solo surgery.

242
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,390
It's like being possessed by a ghost.

243
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,220
You don't remember anything, you're in a trance or something.

244
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,530
Really?

245
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,530
How would I know? I've never had an operation before.

246
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,200
That's what they say.

247
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,840
If you don't believe yourself, go to a psychiatrist.

248
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,940
You should have done that a long time ago.

Let's do it.

252

Intern O, you'll be the first assistant.

So you come back in form.

256
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,760
Can you explain what's going on?

257
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,960
What... what?

258
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,470
Ah... you seem to have had a bad scare.

259
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,510
I didn't mean to go that far.

260
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,080
Maybe I gave away the reversal too soon.

261
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,380
A reversal?

262
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,450
What you saw during that time wasn't the real me.

263
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,790
I'm a bit of a... genius.

264
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,250
Did I fool you?

265
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,690
So... you're a genius in the first place?

266
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,090
During that time I was just pretending

267
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,120
because I didn't want to work.

268

270
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,500
get a license and disappear. That's my goal.

271
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,970
Why should I make things harder for myself?

272
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,600
Oh, you were pretending?

273
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,140
So, can you cooperate?

Hey, is this the time to talk about clothes?

316
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,790
I heard that you possessed someone in the operating room today.

317
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,790
You're going to die soon because of this.

318

A coma ghost.

319

Once you've entered someone's body.

320
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,100
You can't return to your own body.

321
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,500
Don't you know that?

322
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,630
What's a ghost?

323
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,140
In your terms, it's called a coma.

324
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,710
That is, a ghost who don't know if he is alive or dead.

325
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,840
A ghost?

326
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,780
So what you're saying is... I'm a ghost.

327
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,080
Why are you surprised? You know it already.

328
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,850
Ah... it's not very nice to say it's a ghost, is it?

329
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,020
So I'm glorifying it?

330
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,090
A ghost... a coma ghost.

331
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,890
How's that? Doesn't that make you feel good?

332
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,660
So you are a ghost too?

333
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,060
Socrates.

334
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,540
That's my name.

335
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,810
You can call me Soc, if you like.

336
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,710
So you are...

337
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,010
I'll lock your throat.

338
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,910
Call me Soc.

339
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,450
So, Soc, how did you manage to possess other people?

340
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,450
Didn't you just come out of that lady?

341
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,590
Ah, I'm just a normal ghost.

342
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,050
A dead ghost.

343
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,590
I just possessed somebody in the operating room.

344
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,030
What's that?

345
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,360
So...

346
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,970
Normally a coma ghost can't possess people.

347
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,640
But... you made it.

348
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,770
Ah, so you're dead.

349
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,840
I'm not dead yet.

350
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,710
And I'm a doctor.

351
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,180
Death is the medical term for...

352
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,120
Okay, I get it. All right.

353
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,490
I guess you're going to die soon.

354
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,390
This is the first time this has happened to me.

355
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,960
I don't know what's going to happen.

356
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,030
What are you talking about?

357
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm going to wake up.

358
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm not going to die like this.

359
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,530
Don't look at me like this.

360
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,700
Then... wait and see.

361
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,610
I'll... see you next time

362
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,710
I'm leaving.

363
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,080
Goodbye, my ass. Never again.

364
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,820
And get rid of those fake clothes.

(EunSang University Medical Center)

367
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm not going to die like this.

368
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,530
Why should I die? I'm not going to die.

369
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm going to wake up right now and become a section chief and then a hospital president.

370
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,420
What's that?

371
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,760
Ah, it's a blood pressure reducer.

372
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,360
Yeah, my blood pressure is a bit high.

373
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,700
Two milliliters should be enough.

KCL is given at regular intervals of 20ml per hour.

376
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,510
Be careful, Nurse Jeong.

377
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,150
One quick injection can cause trouble.

378
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,520
And... last time I yelled at you...

379
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,520
I'm sorry.

380
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,020
You still look angry.

381
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,890
I'm a bit impulsive, you know.

382
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,960
Calm down.

383
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,830
What? Premature ventricular contractions?

384
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,030
What? I'm the only one who saw it?

385
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,400
How the hell did you do it, Nurse Jeong?

386
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,000
Oops!

387
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,070
Sorry, did I yell at you again?

388
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,870
I deserve to die.

389
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,780
But you know, I trust you the most.

390
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,870
Are you happy? Are you happy now?

391
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,570
It is hard to tell whether the patient is alive or not.

392
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,940
Are you happy to be applauded for a small surgery?

393
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,140
Besides, I did the surgery, not you.

394
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,610
Yes, I understand.

395
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,350
You must be very confused.

396
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,820
It's understandable.

397
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,220
I didn't know about it before.

398
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,890
I don't know how it happened.

399
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,620
What am I doing?

400
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,990
Explaining things to a guy like that.

401
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,800
The question is

402
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,870
why you sent me to the emergency room?

403
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,300
You brat! I had no choice but to...

404
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,540
Wait a minute.

405
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,040
Can you hear me?

406
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,910
I should have eaten some noodles at the convenience store and then come.

407
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,310
It makes no sense coming so early.

408
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,280
I didn't even get to eat because of the surgery.

409
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,080
It's not too late to eat now.

410
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,250
Instant noodles or rice in soup is both fine.

411
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,620
Just order a double portion like a rice bucket.

412
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,820
I've never even done an all-nighter in my internship.

413
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,560
Now my genius has been discovered.

414
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,630
I won't be able to desert from tomorrow.

415
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,060
What am I going to do?

416
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,560
What?

417
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,170
What do you mean?

418
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,670
Whose genius?

419
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,940
I can't believe I did such a wonderful thing as saving my tormenting boss with my own hands.

420
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,340
It doesn't fit my persona.

421
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,810
Wow, there's someone so brazen in the world.

422
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,880
Doesn't this guy know what's happening to him?

423
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,220
Come here, let me dissect your brain.

424
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,220
So...

425
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,390
Wake up, you've slept long enough.

426
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,690
You shouldn't have left like that.

427
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,960
You're Cha Yeong Min.

428
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,060
You've come this far.

429
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,630
At least I need to hear you say thank you to me.

430
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,370
And I also expect a ninety-degree bow.

431
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,240
And that's not all.

432
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,040
Take me out to dinner every day and take care of all my duties.

433
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,210
How good you'll be to me.

434
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,370
I want to be a resident physician that everyone loves.

435
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,380
Please do wake up.

436
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,180
So... I'll see you when you wake up.

437
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,580
Have a good dream.

438
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,550
Go Seung Tak.

439
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,820
The day I wake up is the day you die.

440
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,460
You are dead meat.

441
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,090
I'm gonna get you to take off that white gown.

442
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,600
You jerk!

(EunSang University Medical Center)

444
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,470
Have you heard about Professor Cha?

445
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,740
What's going on?

446
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,810
How can it be?

447
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,340
Do you know

448
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,680
the true colors of Go Seung Tak?

449
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,980
What? What true colors?

450
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,050
He is even unable to pull out tubes.

451
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,310
He's a loser in the emergency room.

452
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,050
However, last night, he suddenly changed…

453
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,650
You're the only one who saw it from beginning to end.

454
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,150
Please tell me the truth!

455
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,190
There must be secrets about Go Seung Tak, right?

456
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,560
Seriously?

457
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,090
I think you're missing the point.

458
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,900
Professor Cha is at the jaws of death...

459
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,970
How is he?

460
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,700
Is Professor Cha awake?

461
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,070
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

462
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,810
The pupil is still 3 millimeters wide.

463
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,380
There is almost no pain response.

464
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,680
Oh, it is terrible.

465
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,250
Well, what brings you here, Professor Hong?

466
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,620
We get the brain wave detection result.

467
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,190
Brain wave detection?

468
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,720
Who gave the instruction?

469
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,730
Han Seung Won, Vice President of Administration.

470
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,760
Didn't you get the notice?

471
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,800
What is the result?

472
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,130
Well…

473
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,200
Not so good.

474
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,370
His anoxic brain injury is serious.

475
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,210
What?

476
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,410
He has been losing consciousness for long.

477
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,610
And there is no special response.

478
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,680
That is to say...

479
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,880
In a coma.

480
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:34,060
What will happen next... We'll have to wait and see.

481
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,150
Isn't he the patient? Why doesn't he get into the room?

482
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,780
I think he has already known his condition.

483
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,020
After all, he's a doctor himself.

484
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,190
After a thoracic surgery,

485
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,150
a patient usually wakes up in three to four hours.

486
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,360
But he still hasn't woken up yet, so it's over.

487
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,530
You!

488
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,130
Bite your tongue!

489
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,030
Well…

490
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,760
Isn't that what he used to say?

491
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,770
Look at their sad faces.

492
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,810
I guess he has good characters.

493
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,510
But what kind of face is that?

494
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,880
Is he in Stage IV?

495
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,350
Denial, anger, compromise, depression and acceptance.

496
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,889
The five stages of death.

497
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,389
After all, I've been here for years. I know it well.

498
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,360
People usually start with denial.

499
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,190
But he's already depressed.

500
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,230
Is it because he's a doctor?

501
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,000
Sure enough, he's different from the rest.

502
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,370
He's quick and cold.

503
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,540
That's why I told you not to mention God very often.

504
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,340
Who knows what God will do with you?

505
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,610
(Intensive Care Unit)
Who knows what God will do with you?

506
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,370
(Intensive Care Unit)

507
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,910
What's the matter with me?

508
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,480
What did I say?

509
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,220
Is this a prophecy?

510
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,990
I'm not wrong.

511
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,190
It's understandable for people to say that in a rage.

512
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,890
What do you think?

513
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,890
What did I do?

514
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,930
What kind of curse did you put on me?

515
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,170
I envy you.

516
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,980
You're still alive.

517
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,350
And you can drink.

518
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,590
Cool?

519
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,730
It must be very cool.

520
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,700
I can barely get water in my bed.

521
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,040
Dumplings and soup must go together.

522
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,280
Are you all right?

523
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,940
Why bother asking him?

524
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,810
He's alive.

525
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,110
You should ask me.

526
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,550
How does it taste?

527
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,750
I need to ask my mom to replace this vending machine.

528
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,650
That's its taste.

529
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,890
Drink the blue one beside it.

530
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,720
If you feel sad, just tell me.

531
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,460
Don't blame the vending machine.

532
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,530
These guys start speaking ill of me right after I turned into a ghost.

533
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,930
Wait.

534
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,200
These guys have been saying that behind my back before.

535
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,770
Me?

536
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,100
Why should I be sad?

537
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,370
It's not my fault that he ended up being like that.

538
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,540
He was the one who had the accident.

539
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,240
Hey, how can you say that...

540
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm just a one-year resident doctor.

541
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,680
I've done what I could.

542
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,050
Everyone is born with a destiny.

543
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,950
His current situation

544
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,020
is destined.

545
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,570
Whoops, I thought he would feel better after walking around.

546
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,440
I can't believe he's doing it again because of that young man.

547
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,370
The name of this young man

548
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,040
comes across as a professor.

549
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,480
Never thought he also speaks like one.

550
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,540
What do you mean?

551
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,780
I mean, he sounds right,

552
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,280
but his words make others upset.

553
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,920
Understand?

554
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,550
It's my turn.

555
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,790
It all started that day.

556
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,200
The day this guy first showed up.

557
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,400
Somehow I've had a bad feeling since that morning.

558
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,870
Why did I send you to the emergency room?

559
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,100
Who should take the blame?

560
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,640
But now

561
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,110
you put the blame for the accident

562
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,810
on my own destiny.

563
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,510
Oh, good. You come with me.

564
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,710
I will take you to the grave together.

565
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,050
Get over here, Go Seung Tak.

566
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,850
Come over.

567
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
What the hell!

568
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,850
What is this?

569
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,790
Darn it!

570
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,520
Come here. Come here.

571
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,830
You get over here.

572
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,330
You get over here.

573
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,830
Hi, we meet again.

574
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,030
Look how scared you are.

575
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,370
It's not our first meeting.

576
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,540
Well, I find you have a lot of questions...

577
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,840
I'd better go.

578
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,940
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

579
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,180
Wait, wait.

580
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,910
What is this?

581
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,810
What's wrong with me?

582
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,610
What's wrong with you?

583
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,750
For the comatose ghosts,

584
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,190
there is a goal of action.

585
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,950
In English, it is boundary.

586
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,920
Do you know boundary?

587
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,160
What is that?

588
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,260
Duh!

589
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Look where you are right now.

590
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,700
This is a point.

591
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,930
With this point as the center,

592
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,900
a radius of 100 meters…

593
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,870
That is to say,

594
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,940
the area is...

595
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,140
... so big.

596
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:59,580
And you can only walk around in this area.

597
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,890
There's no way you can get out.

598
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,920
What if I get out?

599
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,690
Darn it!

600
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,090
I told you there's no way out of here.

601
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,030
Maybe you can have a try.

602
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,060
What about me? My boundary?

603
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,800
Where is your body now?

604
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,170
Isn't it in the ICU?

605
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,300
Now you draw the structure of this hospital

606
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,540
in your head.

607
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,270
You should know it well.

608
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,950
Nonsense!

609
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,850
Who made it?

610
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,280
Bullshit!

611
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,850
I didn't make it.

612
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,020
It's God.

613
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,590
What's more,

614
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,160
never keep away from your body.

615
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,970
If you wake up, then go back at once.

616
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,100
That's right!

617
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,270
I'm leaving.

618
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,100
What?

619
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,810
Look at me.

620
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,380
This.

621
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,690
My soul is free.

622
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,730
If you envy me, then die.

623
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,630
What?

624
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,900
Seminar?

625
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,000
You mean the case of President Jang?

626
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,910
To make clear the right and wrong, we should figure out the ins and outs.

627
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,770
If it's called a medical negligence,

628
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,640
the hospital will be in a dilemma.

629
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,680
After all, the patient was not hospitalized.

630
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,950
Ah, yeah.

631
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,220
What's the matter?

632
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,650
Do you have any worries?

633
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,590
After all, Professor Cha in charge of
the patient is still lying in a hospital bed.

634
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,890
But we can't just wait around.

635
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,260
Who knows when he will wake up?

636
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,530
Anyway, the seminar can't wait.

637
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,200
Hold it as fast as possible.

638
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,700
What will happen to Professor Cha?

639
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,900
It's hard to say.

640
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,970
If he stays like this,

641
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,770
we shall open the trachea later

642
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,210
and put on a gastrostomy tube for him.

643
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,440
He may be sent to a nursing home in about a month.

644
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,410
By the way, when that happens, I don't know whom to discuss the transfer issue with.

645
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,010
What's the matter?

646
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,880
He doesn't have a family.

647
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,020
It seems that he doesn't have relatives and friends as his guardian, either.

648
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,090
What to do then? It's so pathetic.

649
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,830
I was supposed to have two surgeries today.

650
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,070
There are three more tomorrow.

651
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,940
All right.

652
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,710
Even if I'm still alive,
the only thing I can do is surgery.

653
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,140
What a boring life!

654
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,280
Since it's time to go, I should leave gracefully.

655
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,120
Where are you going?

656
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,760
Before you leave, please get me back into the normal state.

657
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,530
President Jang.

658
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,500
Yes?

659
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,000
Does it hurt a little?

660
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,700
Maybe.

661
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,440
I was also a martial artist when young.

662
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,710
Since I happened to meet you here,

663
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,140
-let me show you some moves.
-No, don't.

664
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,180
What's wrong with you?

665
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,080
Ah, should we do something?

666
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,950
Let him be. This is better.

667
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,090
I didn't notice that

668
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,720
he can be such a trouble-maker.

669
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,490
You are a better one.

670
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,830
Darn it!

671
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,130
Oh, my God.

672
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,100
You scared me. When did you come?

673
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,840
Oh, that guy?

674
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
He's a ghost.

675
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,240
Is he a ghost?

676
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,640
He is dead?

677
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,840
No, he is a coma ghost.

678
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,910
Coma?

679
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,780
Are you saying that President Jang is in a coma?

680
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,710
How is that possible?

681
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,210
My surgery is perfect.

682
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,480
Then maybe it has nothing to do with your surgery.

683
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,690
(Lee Seon Ho)

684
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:06,960
Hello.

685
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,920
Professor Cha,

686
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,330
the patient is in a strange state.

687
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,590
(Lee Seon Ho)
the patient is in a strange state.

688
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,400
Professor Cha, the patient's pressure is dropping rapidly.

689
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,660
Could it be that his surgical site has cracked?

690
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,830
Where is he now?

691
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:16,870
Oh, well…

692
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,230
Do you know the VIP ward building?

693
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,400
He's in the innermost room.

694
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,410
VIP ward.

695
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,240
It's this way.

696
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,560
Why are you still here?

697
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Why did you come here…

698
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,700
(I hope to see you.
Could you come to meet me?
I'll fly back to America tomorrow morning.
I want to talk with you before leaving.
I'll wait for you in our old place.)

699
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,260
I hope to see you.
(I hope to see you.
Could you come to meet me?
I'll fly back to America tomorrow morning.
I want to talk with you before leaving.
I'll wait for you in our old place.)

700
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,000
I hope to see you.

701
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,430
Could you come to meet me?

702
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,600
I'll fly back to America tomorrow morning.

703
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,670
I want to talk with you before leaving.

704
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,710
I'll wait for you in our old place.

705
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,380
You asked me to meet with you.

706
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,750
But you didn't show up.

707
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,080
And then

708
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,790
you came to the operation room.

709
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,150
You…

710
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,590
Why did you act like this?

711
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,060
Hell! Again?

712
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,840
Sorry, miss.

713
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,770
The Vice President has ordered that no one can come in without his permission.

714
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,850
I've heard the same excuse nine times.

715
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,010
I want to see him. Have you told him that?

716
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,320
What do you want?

717
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,490
Are you living in the hospital?

718
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,560
Or why are you in and out like a rat?

719
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,590
I just want to check President Jang's situation.

720
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,060
Will he get better by that?

721
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,900
If you don't like it…

722
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,530
At least show me the medical records.

723
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,200
Well, so what do you want after you…

724
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,400
What will you do after that?

725
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,740
This is the same question that I've asked you three times.

726
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,240
I heard that President Jang's operation went well.

727
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,810
There must be a reason for his sudden deterioration.

728
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:08,980
It could be medicine, infusion,

729
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,250
or during the surgery…

730
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,250
You don't deserve to be a doctor.

731
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,690
Hey,

732
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,690
stop showing off and get lost.

733
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,920
No matter it's America or wherever, just get out of my sight.

734
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,130
You seem to be still unclear about it.

735
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,400
Hey,

736
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,230
only when President Jang is alive are you a daughter in this family.

737
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,940
But you are never my sister.

738
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,910
I've also said that three times.

739
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,280
You don't understand my words no matter in the past or now.

740
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,480
It's the same for me.

741
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,350
What?

742
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,320
I've made it clear that you are never my brother.

743
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,320
Three times, I guess.

744
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,590
You are so offensive and rude.

745
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,260
No matter in the past or now, you just…

746
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,130
… never change. I guess you never really grow up.

747
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,060
How dare you…

748
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,260
I'll come again.

749
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,700
And you'd better either open the door

750
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,240
or show me the records.

751
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,840
President Jang is still alive.

752
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,550
I'm even not sure what crazy things I will do.

753
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,800
I feel so terrible every time I see her. Go to hell!

754
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,420
Are you hurt

755
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,750
just for this little problem?

756
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,540
Just for…

757
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,110
How could you treat me like that for being despised by others?

758
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,400
This is President Jang's Operation Record.

759
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
(Operation Record)
This is President Jang's Operation Record.

760
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:47,900
This is President Jang's Operation Record.

761
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,940
Dr. Gim.

762
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,770
-Yeah.
-No.

763
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,810
-… the records of Patient No. 363 have been changed as you required.
-Yes.

764
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,380
-His pulse and body temperature have returned to normal…
-Good.

765
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,510
He is now in a stable state.

766
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,250
We have news from the Neurosurgery Department you mentioned yesterday.

767
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,450
See?

768
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,990
I've told you so.

769
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,060
But this is evidence that you are still alive.

770
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,730
You should feel lucky.

771
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,430
Yesterday, intramuscular injection of 1.6…

772
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,640
Dr. Gim Jae Won,

773
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,740
could we have a few words?

774
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,040
About patient Jang Gwang Deok,

775
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,110
what the hell is going on?

776
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,410
Right, what's going on?

777
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,810
What happened after the surgery?

778
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:31,910
Well…

779
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,950
The surgical site suddenly cracked.

780
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,520
What?

781
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,120
Why?

782
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,650
Why is that?

783
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,620
He was fine before. How could the surgical site crack so suddenly?

784
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,990
I also felt confusing. So, I took a chance to check his activated partial thromboplastin time.

785
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,730
The results showed that his heparin was too high.

786
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,460
-What?
-What?

787
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,330
Then I injected him with some protamine as the chief ordered.

788
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,830
Luckily, his heartbeat was back to normal.

789
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,130
But his blood pressure keeps dropping now,

790
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:50,730
which seems to lead to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain.

791
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,430
Too high heparin? How is that possible?

792
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,440
How much heparin was injected?

793
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,540
I injected 5,000 as directed.

794
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,440
Are you nuts?

795
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,110
5,000?

796
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,040
Hey, An Tae Hyeon,

797
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,140
was that your idea?

798
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,510
Why?

799
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,980
What are you talking about?

800
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,110
I told you to add to 1,000 gradually just in case.

801
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,350
Hey, even 1,000 is too much.

802
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,950
Why? Was anything wrong?

803
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,580
What?

804
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,180
No, you said 5,000.

805
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,450
And you also said it's bolus.

806
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,190
(Bolus: as a large single dose)
And you also said it's bolus.

807
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:10,690
Are you an idiot?
(Bolus: as a large single dose)

808
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:11,290
Are you an idiot?

809
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,890
It was not for operation.

810
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,820
How could you give 5,000?

811
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,190
So?

812
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,060
Did you really inject 5,000?

813
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,600
Well,

814
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,430
I didn't do it myself.

815
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,310
It was an emergency,

816
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,040
so, I asked Go Seung Tak for help.

817
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,240
Go Seung Tak?

818
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,410
Did you ask Go Seung Tak to inject 5,000?

819
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,880
Oh my, is it 5,000 or 1,000?

820
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,290
Anyway, he must have injected a large amount considering the patient's condition.

821
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,460
I haven't verified it yet. The chief told me to keep it a secret for the time being.

822
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,130
Go Seung Tak!

823
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,290
Go Seung Tak!

824
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,430
Come here, boy!

825
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,330
You brat!

826
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:57,800
What the hell did you do to my patient?

827
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,040
Why did you mess with my patient?

828
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,550
Oh, Dr. An Tae Hyeon, you came just in time…

829
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,020
What the hell is this?

830
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,820
Well, you must be here for the heparin. It's this brat.

831
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,820
It must be this brat…

832
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,390
Where is that brat boy, Dr. An?

833
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,460
Wake up!

834
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,530
How could you talk to a specialist that way?

835
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,430
Who is that brat boy

836
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:32,600
you just called?

837
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,040
See?

838
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,780
I have told you so.

839
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,350
But this is evidence that you are still alive.

840
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,020
The patient was stabbed in the abdomen

841
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,820
by reinforced concrete

842
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,520
when passing the construction site.

843
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,160
Hey.

844
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,060
Where are you going? We have a patient here.

845
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,790
I am in big trouble. I have no time for him.

846
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,060
Gloves. I need gloves.

847
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,780
No damage to organs and blood vessels.

848
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,210
Just a 10-centimeter-deep wound in the abdomen.

849
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,520
Disinfecting and sewing it up will work.

850
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,750
I'll leave the rest to you.

851
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,390
Jeo.

852
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,430
Jeo.

853
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,400
Why could I possess Go Seung Tak?

854
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,370
Can you... Can you see me?

855
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,310
It's me.

856
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,010
Cha Yeong Min.

857
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,710
How to get out of his body?

858
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,780
I just came in inadvertently.

859
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,910
Ah, about that…

860
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,650
How to put it? I see.

861
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,180
You know Iron Man, right?

862
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,350
How did he take off his suit?

863
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,390
He would think, “I want to take off my suit.” Then the suit came off.

864
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:05,160
So, you need to think about it first.

865
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,830
I've thought about it. But it didn't work.

866
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,830
Then you can try to come out directly.

867
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,400
How to do it directly?

868
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,170
A strong push will do.

869
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,140
P-U-S-H.

870
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,580
What's happening?

871
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,380
What's this place?

872
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,520
Why am I here?

873
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,120
Did you see that?

874
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,420
I can possess no one else,

875
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,590
but only him.

876
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,690
Why can I do that to him?

877
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,660
Yeah, how did you do that?

878
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,790
What's wrong with me?

879
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,890
I don't know if I'm being possessed.

880
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,900
Dispel all evil spirits.

881
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,100
It's not going to dispel.

882
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,730
What? Your destiny?

883
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,600
It's your destiny, brat.

884
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,740
Look at him having a nervous breakdown.

885
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,900
So cool.

886
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,940
So happy.

887
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,140
Look how happy you are.

888
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,940
Yes.

889
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,310
I am so happy.

890
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,810
You don't even know you're going to die.

891
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:56,410
What?

892
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,710
Don't be in and out frequently just because you can possess.

893
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,380
You may never wake up if you go on like this.

894
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,330
One times nine is nine.

895
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,560
Two times nine is eighteen.

896
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,800
Three times nine is twenty-seven.

897
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,710
Mom.

898
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,310
I have a quick question for you.

899
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,910
If…

900
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,920
Well, aren't my voice and looks pretty good?

901
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:35,650
Yeah.

902
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,920
I think I'm handsome.

903
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,520
So maybe I should stop being a doctor.

904
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,160
If I become a singer or an actor,

905
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,300
I'm gonna get kicked out of my family?

906
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,530
Son.

907
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,800
I'll see you at home later.

908
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,800
OK?

909
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:00,080
Dr. Yun, please come and have a look.

910
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,480
Doctor, please come here.

911
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,300
What are you doing here?

912
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,630
I was just going to... go in.

913
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,540
What's wrong?

914
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,970
Do you want to see if the stabbing victim is still here?

915
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,210
Is the stabbing victim still here?

916
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,810
After his wound was stitched up, he left.

917
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,010
I did what you told me to do, Dr. Go.

918
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,920
Well.

919
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,820
Looks like I had a gift and made another diagnosis.

920
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,690
Right?

921
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,920
Is there anything strange?

922
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,860
What?

923
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,590
Me?

924
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,290
Strange?

925
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,330
Like a headache.

926
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,300
Or your limbs are out of control.

927
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,230
I'm fine.

928
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,030
Everything is fine from my head to toe.

929
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,070
That's OK.

930
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,310
Since you're fine,
why don't you go get a cup of coffee?

931
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,840
Okay, I'll get you some super expensive coffee.

932
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,180
Are you trying to hide it?

933
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,250
Then I

934
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,320
will help you.

935
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,330
It's your coffee.

936
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,330
Ah, I got you.

937
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,230
Hey.

938
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,430
Why aren't you answering my calls?

939
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,900
Do you know what coffee it is?

940
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,170
I have to ask you something.

941
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,840
How long do I have to stay in the emergency room?

942
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,870
Hey, that's not important right now.

943
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:42,080
Do you think there's anything more important to me right now?

944
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,780
Brother?

945
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,010
He's coming.

946
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,350
He's coming here.

947
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,520
What?

948
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,220
Who?

949
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,120
You know that.

950
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,690
President Jang's son.

951
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:58,130
President Jang's son?

952
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,380
What's Plan B?

953
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,150
Wasn't the operation a success?

954
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,750
I knew this would happen.

955
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,860
Because Professor Cha was in an accident and I didn't tell you.

956
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,960
President Jang failed to wake up.

957
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,530
What?

958
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,000
Unconscious just like Professor Cha.

959
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,600
Why did Professor Cha have an accident so suddenly?

960
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,570
What the hell is going on here?

961
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,010
The patient and the surgeon fell into a coma the same day.

962
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,250
There you are.

963
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:58,250
Did you find a way to save me?

964
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,160
I was really wronged.

965
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,360
I wouldn't have made you like this.

966
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,430
Who would it be if it wasn't you?

967
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:15,840
You don't seem to be the kind of person to pass the buck to a subordinate.

968
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,040
That's a good thing about being a leader.

969
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,280
You will be responsible to me

970
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,310
with this attitude.

971
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,150
What... What can I do?

972
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,780
Can't you see me like this?

973
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,380
I am a ghost like you.

974
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:29,990
Ghost.

975
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:33,260
Ghost.

976
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:38,730
Really... I can't say you deserve it.

977
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,400
As a doctor, you leave the patient alone.

978
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,070
What's the emergency?

979
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,070
You can undo your wrongs yourself.

980
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,440
You're gonna save me anyway.

981
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,840
If you don't want to be killed by my son.

982
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,480
President.

983
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,550
Control the reporters first. Don't let the news get out.

984
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,950
An official announcement is expected soon. Let them wait.

985
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:07,520
Do I even have to tell you everything?

986
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:13,160
Damn it.

987
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,870
My father's gonna be on the grapevine these days.

988
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,000
So why do you listen to me?

989
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,880
I wish you'd listened to your wonderful smart little girl.

990
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,110
You should live another year without surgery.

991
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,620
I wish you had listened to me earlier.

992
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,950
Then I don't have to do this.

993
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,920
Why did you get blood on my hands?

994
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,560
Well, no time to rest.

995
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,330
This is Jang Min Ho.

996
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,530
Yes.

997
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:49,630
Now?

998
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:21,160
I'm surprised Professor Cha got caught up in this.

999
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,700
That's a lot of damage to the hospital.

1000
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,940
I thought you had made it.

1001
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,140
I'm not some kind of psychopath.

1002
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,610
Professor Cha is the property of this hospital.

1003
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,780
Why would I do this to a man who could make me money?

1004
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,580
You can have a second thought.

1005
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,680
Let me know when it's over.

1006
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,620
It's my area of expertise.

1007
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,160
What do you mean there's a meeting?

1008
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,090
Is there any guarantee?

1009
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:53,860
You think I started before I did it in thoracic surgery?

1010
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,030
You don't have to worry about that.

1011
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,370
The problem is Professor Cha.

1012
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,370
What?

1013
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,980
But it's going to work out.

1014
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,150
Let's think about it.

1015
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,160
Well, brother Jae Won.

1016
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,760
I'm in a hurry now and I'd like to ask you a favor.

1017
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,730
Please give President Jang an injection.

1018
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:34,940
Back then, I told you it's heparin 1000.

1019
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,670
Professor Cha said it's heparin 5000.

1020
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,410
You're gonna help me.

1021
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:45,850
What?

1022
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:47,720
It's getting cold.

1023
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,820
Do you worship with coffee?

1024
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,620
Yes, coffee.

1025
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,490
Got another big slap on the back.

1026
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,260
What?

1027
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,130
The bed in the duty room.

1028
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:01,830
I can't sleep on it.

1029
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:02,930
Ah. My waist.

1030
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:05,930
You were on duty once. Why are you so delicate?

1031
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,800
So, I'm gonna show off like a man.

1032
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,970
Help me change all the beds in the duty room.

1033
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,410
Why do hospitals make so much money?

1034
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:16,510
Oh, by the way, Professor Cha's lead surgeon

1035
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:20,220
will be Dr. An Tae Hyeon.

1036
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,950
To keep your doctor experience from being flawed,

1037
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:25,290
as a brother, I took care of it for you.

1038
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:27,560
Anyway, thank you for your efforts.

1039
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,460
I was worried about you.

1040
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,730
I didn't know you were so good.

1041
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,960
Keep it up in the future.

1042
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,200
Don't forget, I'm always behind you.

1043
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:38,490
There's another benefit

1044
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:41,300
to being a ghost.

1045
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:41,600
(EunSang University Medical Center)
to being a ghost.

1046
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,460
(EunSang University Medical Center)

1047
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,570
I can hear a lot of things.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

1048
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:47,870
(EunSang University Medical Center)

1049
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:51,340
I can know a lot of things.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

1050
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,410
(EunSang University Medical Center)

1051
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:02,850
But there's one thing I don't know.

1052
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:09,260
It was in the operating room the day you picked up the scalpel.

1053
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,830
Were you trying to kill me instead of saving me?

1054
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,800
You came to ICU

1055
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,070
and said you wanted me to wake up.

1056
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,610
Was that a lie?

1057
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:35,150
Did you feel guilty afterwards?

1058
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,690
I didn't even know that...

1059
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,030
So,

1060
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:53,100
colleagues arrived late at the operating room.

1061
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,740
Was it late because they were dealing with President Jang's problem?

1062
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,670
Heparin wasn't a mistake. It was intentional?

1063
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,780
Since when.

1064
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:06,680
When did it start?

1065
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,150
How could you do that to human life?

1066
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,920
You're an asshole.

1067
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,660
Why? Why?

1068
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,230
Because you want to get certified as a specialist?

1069
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,130
You do what he says,

1070
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:27,800
and your brother will let you have it?

1071
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,940
You're a jerk.

1072
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,240
Do you have any idea what you've done?

1073
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,190
Hello?

1074
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:48,290
ICU?

1075
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:49,790
What's wrong with Professor Cha?

1076
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:51,560
What's wrong with me?

1077
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,860
I'll be right there.

1078
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,220
-=Preview of the next episode=-

1079
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,420
You can wake up.

1080
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,490
Cha Yeong Min, come on.

1081
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:30,590
Did I say something like that?

1082
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,930
Yeah, you said it yourself.

1083
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:34,430
I have repaid you.

1084
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,200
Why would you do that?

1085
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,260
How to be responsible?

1086
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,000
I'll blow the whistle.

1087
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,270
What are you talking about when you can't protect yourself?

1088
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,970
What happened to her hands?

1089
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,170
Now let's organize our route.

1090
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,740
Why is she watching this?

1091
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:47,140
What are you up to?

1092
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,010
You need to be strong outside.

1093
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:53,280
I'm sending you somewhere else today.
