1
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,060
Darn it.

2
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,300
(Episode 15)
Darn it.

3
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,880
(Episode 15)

4
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,380
It must've been Professor Cha.

5
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,940
I bet it was him.

6
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,620
Judging by the situation, it shouldn't have been Go Seung Tak.

7
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,220
No! No! You are wrong.

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,740
No. It was someone important. That I'm sure about.

9
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,460
Yeah. It couldn't be him.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,220
No way. If it'd been him,

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,260
I would've killed him by now.

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,539
Come on. You shouldn't say that no matter how angry you are.

13
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:11,300
You are a doctor for God's sake.

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,900
Do you want me to get them and beat them up?

15
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,820
He asked me to keep it a secret.

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,340
Can't believe he's that kind of person.

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,260
Did he think he could act without scruple now that everybody knew?

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,590
(Professor Jang Se Jin)

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,660
Yes, Professor Jang.

20
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,020
What? What happened to Go Seung Tak?

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,140
What's going on? How did he become like this?

22
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,900
Is it because…

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,260
It's Professor Cha. Let's get him inside first.

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,580
Okay.

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,220
Wow, I haven't taken an ambulance ride for a long time.

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,940
Looks like someone already beat these two for me.

27
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,140
Gosh.

28
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,300
Hey, what are you doing?

29
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,860
Hey.

30
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,820
Are you crazy?

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,780
Are you awake? Do you recognize us?

32
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,300
It's the first time for 20 years I've met someone who needs so much care.

33
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,900
Unbelievable.

34
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,300
But what am I supposed to take to get back?

35
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,860
Delete my number and hide!

36
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,260
I could've got a closure today.

37
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,940
But why did that girl keep shouting "Cha Yeong Min" over there?

38
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,140
She literally went crazy for him.

39
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,340
Yeong Min. Cha Yeong Min! Yeong Min!

40
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,740
Se Jin. No, Dr. Jang.

41
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,540
Let's get you some treatment first.

42
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,460
I think of you every day,

43
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,980
wondering if you'd hate me more,

44
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,980
if you'd blame me more.

45
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,740
I wish you could forget about me. No.

46
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,420
I'd rather you not to forget about me.

47
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,340
I won't let you go anymore.

48
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,500
So I've been gathering my courage.

49
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,540
I've never hated you, Dr. Jang.

50
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,620
Every day, I think about the happy times we had

51
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,300
and the happy moments we shared.

52
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,940
So I can't and I'll never hate you.

53
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,380
He's trying very hard to hang in there

54
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,100
so that he won't come back too late

55
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,580
or let you wait for too long.

56
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,420
Turns out you are Jessica's fan.

57
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,740
Yes. Let's go to her concert together next time.

58
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,900
I thought you ordered takeout every day

59
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,780
instead of cooking at home.

60
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,500
I did. But I'm going to cook more in the future.

61
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,659
Because I have someone to eat with me now.

62
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,740
It must be very tough and scary for you.

63
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,660
No. Because I have you. You are there for me.

64
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,620
Is there anything I can do for you?

65
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,700
Can I hug you?

66
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,180
Good morning!

67
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,740
Good morning!

68
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,980
Why did you do that?

69
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,580
What's the matter with you?

70
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,300
Mom, lower your voice. This is hospital.

71
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,780
May I ask what happened?

72
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,780
She threw all the books away

73
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,700
behind my back last night.

74
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,820
Do I need your permission

75
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,860
to throw away my books?

76
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,500
Don't you think it's a waste to throw away the books you studied before?

77
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,260
You were so close to get the professor title.

78
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,900
Mom, don't you feel pity for me?

79
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,980
I never went outside, and all I did was study.

80
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,540
Gosh, I'm speechless.

81
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,620
Doctor, she's been acting like this all the time recently.

82
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,700
So willful and stubborn.

83
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,020
She wasn't like this before.

84
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,900
Do you think it's necessary to give her a checkup?

85
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,380
It's very normal.

86
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,140
When patients wake up from a long-term coma,

87
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,060
some of them may experience mind alteration.

88
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,860
Maybe when they were asleep,

89
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,540
they had some extraordinary adventure that we are not aware of.

90
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,220
What? Extraordinary adventure? What do you mean?

91
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,220
It varies from person to person.

92
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,020
You'll be discharged next week.

93
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,060
I wish you all the best!

94
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,980
Oh my goodness. Even the doctor is acting like this.

95
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,340
What's wrong with her?

96
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,180
What's this about?

97
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,740
You only got a minor wound thanks to my outstanding athletic ability.

98
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,180
Otherwise your head would've been badly hurt.

99
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,740
Is that how you talk to the person who saved your life?

100
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,380
What if it leaves a scar?

101
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,860
But our Se Jin has treated your wound.

102
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,380
It won't leave a scar. Stop worrying.

103
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,780
Our Se Jin?

104
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,340
Right. You did something yesterday, didn't you?

105
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,780
I thought you'd save it to the end.

106
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,100
You just couldn't wait, could you?

107
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,140
An ignorant person like you wouldn't understand.

108
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,100
It wasn't something you could wait.

109
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,460
In that case, let's do it again.

110
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,380
Shall I change the curtain?

111
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,700
With or without patterns?

112
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,820
What about the color? Elegant beige or refreshing pink?

113
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,420
What do you think?

114
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,980
What? Are you asking me?

115
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,820
Well, I'm okay with everything.

116
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,900
It's been so many times.

117
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,940
If he borrows your body, at least he should protect it well.

118
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,460
It's not his own body anyway.

119
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,100
Exactly. He does it to me all the time.

120
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,500
He really gets on my nerves.

121
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,780
Tell me about it.

122
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,260
What are you doing, Go Seung Tak?

123
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,180
The curtain needs to be plain and patternless.

124
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,980
How about a linen curtain?

125
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,660
That's exactly what I thought.

126
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,820
We indeed share the same taste.

127
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,980
We are such a perfect match.

128
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm so hungry. Would you buy me a meal?

129
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,820
Why would I buy you a meal?

130
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,460
It's said people could die of starvation.

131
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,300
Will you take responsibility if I'm dead?

132
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,180
I can't let you die. What do you want to eat?

133
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,860
Um… Meat.

134
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,020
Go Seung Tak.

135
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,460
Seung Tak. Seung Tak.

136
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,780
About the background music,

137
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,820
he prefers the top 100 most popular songs

138
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,420
to Pop and classic music.

139
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,660
Oh, yeah. Cha Yeong Min likes that kind of music.

140
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,540
Then I'll play Jessica's songs.

141
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,420
Great. Her new songs got good reviews.

142
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,580
He doesn't need goose-down comforter.

143
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,900
He wants a light and thin blanket.

144
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,700
And he wants the color to be reddish.

145
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,660
When did I say that?

146
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,420
Oh, right. Yeong Min doesn't get cold easily.

147
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,140
Then I'll get a thin blanket for him.

148
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,540
Okay. That's good enough.

149
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,500
I want the color to be refreshingly blue.

150
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
The one who made a scene in the clothes store is dead, right?

151
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,500
Hey, I've become more sensitive recently.

152
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,380
I didn't come back for this

153
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,740
after what I've been through.

154
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,420
Go Seung Tak, wait.

155
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,900
It's lunch time.

156
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,860
Sister, you look so good lately.

157
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,900
Not long ago,

158
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,020
you looked like you carried the burden of the whole world on your shoulders.

159
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,060
It's all thanks to our Vice President Han.

160
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,940
He even has more faith in Seung Tak than I do,

161
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,100
and he's been waiting for Seung Tak to come back.

162
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,740
I really am grateful

163
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,740
for Seung Tak having such a reliable cousin.

164
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,180
By the way, Father.

165
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,460
Have you seen the last year's Best Hospital ranking list?

166
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,420
Our hospital moved up the ranking a lot.

167
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,340
At this rate, our hospital will soon enter the top five.

168
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,220
It's all thanks to the hard work of the medical team.

169
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,140
The skilled and trustworthy doctors are like a hospital's

170
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,220
heart and lungs.

171
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,700
But heart and lungs

172
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,540
can't be functional without blood vessels.

173
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,620
It's the consistent administrative support

174
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,260
that makes the blood circulate smoothly.

175
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,460
You made a witty comment today.

176
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,380
Have you been learning?

177
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,700
Come on, Sister,

178
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,940
have I ever been bad at anything?

179
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,380
I know what to say all the time.

180
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,700
Just be quiet and eat.

181
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,780
Stop talking.

182
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,860
I told you that I wouldn't mind eating alone.

183
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,220
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Go.

184
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,940
He said he was hungry, too.

185
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,020
Have some meat.

186
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,220
Yeong Min, you should eat more. I'm fine.

187
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,620
He's on a diet. You can have it all.

188
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,980
Would you like some egg?

189
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,460
I'm confused. I've been wondering

190
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,740
what's going on with those two.

191
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,220
You know something, don't you?

192
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,780
How would I know?

193
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,740
Why are you so curious about everything?

194
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,780
Hey, isn't that…

195
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,260
It's such a nice day. Why don't we go out to eat?

196
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,100
We can't. It's too dangerous.

197
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Who knows if Jang Min Ho is watching us?

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,500
This jerk Jang Min Ho, I swear I'll give him a good beating.

199
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,820
Stop that already.

200
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,580
Your hands are too precious

201
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,060
to be used on such insignificant thing.

202
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,100
You need to use your precious hands to save your own life.

203
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,100
You will operate

204
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,700
on yourself, right?

205
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
What? Operation?

206
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,820
I don't trust the others.

207
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,780
You should do it.

208
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,580
That's why I chose to stay here.

209
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,900
You know that, right?

210
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,340
Yes, I know.

(EunSang University Medical Center)

213
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,500
Professor Cha Yeong Min's operation was postponed.

214
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,460
Have you set a new date for his operation?

215
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,540
As far as I know, he's still under treatment for pneumonia.

216
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,380
Yeah?

217
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,100
I didn't expect it'd take this long.

218
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,020
The operation will be performed

219
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,620
by Chief Ban as planned, right?

220
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,300
Yes. I think so.

221
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,100
Make sure it goes well

222
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,860
so that all your efforts of saving the position for him will be worth it.

(Director of the Legal Dept)

224

I have a question for you.

225
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,180
Dr. O.

226
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,620
Did you just hit Yeong Min?

227
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,100
Oops. I didn't know it was Professor Cha.

228
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,500
I thought he was Go Seung Tak.

229
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,420
You know he's Yeong Min.

230
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,420
So you beat him hard.

231
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,260
No, I didn't.

232
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,980
It's just my hands.

233
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,780
O Su Jeong.

234
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,300
Anyway, the body is Go Seung Tak's.

235
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,660
He's the one who feels the pain.

236
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,780
But, Cha Yeong Min is inside him.

237
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,500
Honey, does it hurt?

238
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,980
No, no.

239
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,100
Your honey is here.

240
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,380
You've used my baby too much recently.

241
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,820
Baby?

242
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
Is that me?

243
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,980
The surgery is to be done soon.

244
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,660
Can't you be generous for a few days?

245
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,020
Dr. O, if you are so unhappy about it, just forget it.

246
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,860
That sounds familiar.

247
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,820
She's a difficult person.

248
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820

Have some food here with Dr. Go.

253
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,420
Go Seung Tak doesn't eat chicken.

254
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,380
He choked on it once.

255
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,220
Oh, I forgot that.

256
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,580
Last time, Yeong Min enjoyed the chicken.

257
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,380
You let Go Seung Tak eat chicken?

258
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,100
Did you eat chicken into my body?

259
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,980
Oh, yeah.

260
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,660
But I was fine that night.

261
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,340
Well, why did my body take it well?

262
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,380
How about some rules?

263
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Good idea.

264
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,020
One hour per day.

265
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,260
Hey, it's too little. Two hours.

266
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,100
Then the frequency should be limited. Once a day.

267
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,900
No. Three times.

268
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Isn't that too much?

269
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,980
What's your opinion?

270
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,100
This is really good!

271
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,420
Yeah, right.

272
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
-Delicious, right?
-Yes.

273
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,660
He really enjoys it.

274
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,820
Eat as much as you like.

275
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,540
He's eating beside me.

276
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,980
Dr. Go Seung Tak is a little different recently.

277
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,860
Different how?

278
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,940
I've checked his surgical records.

279
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,300
He hasn't entered operating rooms recently.

280
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,060
And no record of emergency surgery.

281
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,060
No operating rooms and no surgery?

282
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,240
Then what's he doing lately?

283
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,100
(Emergency Room)
Then what's he doing lately?

Why didn't you wake me up?
(Emergency Room)

286
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,460
I should check the patient in the early morning.

287
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,020
Dr. Go Seung Tak has done it.

288
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,220
What? Go Seung Tak?

289
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,860
It's him again.

290
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,540
He confirms the vital signs every night.

291
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,780
He also changes the dressing.

292
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,860
And he even does the injection.

293
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,740
Is he crazy?

294
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,099
What's wrong? Who's crazy?

295
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,660
Go Seung Tak.

296
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,220
Don't you think he's crazy lately in a weird way?

297
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,420
He would only work in the OR before.

298
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,900
But now he's doing things he didn't even do during his internship.

299
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,180
Is it just me, or that he's strange?

300
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,780
Um, his recent behavior is abnormal.

301
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,140
It's abnormal, right?

302
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,859
He was not like this before.

303
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,060
This is not any Go Seung Tak that I know.

304
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,260
Wait, what about Professor Cha's surgery?

305
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,380
Well, is there anything wrong?

306
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,540
The leucocyte count is increasing again.

307
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,700
So are procalcitonin and C-reactive protein.

308
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,660
Is it a recurrence of pneumonia?

309
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,100
No, we can't let it happen.

310
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,180
Absolutely not.

311
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,430
Do a new sputum culture.

312
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,820
(Sputum culture)
Do a new sputum culture.

313
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,420
Yes.
(Sputum culture)

314
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,220
I thought he was getting better. Why again?

315
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,220
It's all right. He will be fine.

316
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,660
Since it's on yourself,

317
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,980
you will perform the surgery, right?

318
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,100
I don't trust anyone else.

319
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
You do it.

320
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,900
The boy must've done ward rounds the whole night.

321
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,220
If I've woken you up, just continue your sleep.

322
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,260
You must be tired.

323
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,340
Oh, I can't believe that I fell asleep.

324
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,540
What time is it?

325
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,180
Now that you're awake, let's have a talk.

326
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,980
My operation…

327
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,060
I'm so hungry.

328
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,780
I hope that the canteen has fried pork chop today.

329
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,580
Go Seung Tak.

330
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,780
Can't you hear me?

331
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,020
No.

332
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,940
It's such a fine day. Why don't I go out to eat?

333
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,220
Seung Tak, can't you see me?

334
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,700
Can't you hear me?

335
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,860
I should be quick, or there will be none left.

336
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,540
Go Seung Tak.

337
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Go Seung Tak, what's the matter?

338
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,060
Can't you hear me? Can't you see me?

339
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,380
It's not okay.

340
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,460
What's going on?

341
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,300
Where's Su Jeong?

342
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,660
Go Seung Tak!

343
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Seung Tak!

344
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,940
How dare you fool me?

345
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,980
You call me anytime you like. What else can I do?

346
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,220
You scared the hell out of me.

347
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,420
Go Seung Tak.

348
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,100
You've come just in time.

349
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,780
Help me with this patient.

350
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,700
He was unconscious when he got here.

351
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,460
But I just can't find the reason.

352
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:06,510
The electrolyte test has been done.

353
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,940
(Electro)
The electrolyte test has been done.

354
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,810
Everything is fine.
(Electro)

355
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,260
Everything is fine.

356
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,060
Nothing abnormal in the brain CT scan and the chest radiography.

357
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,140
If even that doesn't work, what can I do?

358
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,220
Oh, you are not who you used to be.

359
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,540
Now you're back to unreliable hands, right?

360
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,220
Didn't you see me save someone last time?

361
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,700
Do you see my hands?

362
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,060
They are about to become gold hands.

363
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
Go Seung Tak.

364
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,980
Catch him.

365
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,980
Catch him.

366
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,740
Come on, come here.

367
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

368
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,420
Hey, ghost, come here.

369
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,660
Come on, come here.

370
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,700
It's okay. Come here.

371
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,420
What's the matter? Why bother to catch him?

372
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,540
Ah, it's really noisy.

373
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,420
Why are they running again?

374
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,740
Why? Are you an idiot?

375
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,820
Apparently to save that man.

376
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,540
Now he can't use his hands.

377
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,860
So he can only run.

378
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,380
Professor Cha has worked hard to the end.

379
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,860
But days like that are coming to an end.

380
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,860
He's going to have the operation.

381
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,700
Who knows?

382
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,940
Some people are always unpredictable.

383
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,060
I'm also not sure what will happen.

384
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,580
Come here.

385
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,020
Ouch.

386
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,460
So here's your boundary.

387
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,460
I never thought that I would run after a ghost.

388
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,500
Why did we run after him?

389
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,020
To save that patient.

390
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,220
Are we going to let him die?

391
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,140
Hi, ghost.

392
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,220
Who are you?

393
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,980
Why did you chase me?

394
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,860
Who is this doctor?

395
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Is he also a ghost?

396
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,380
No, he's a human being.

397
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,980
The only doctor in the world who can save you.

398
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,960
Injection of 2 mg naloxone.

399
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,820
(Naloxone: A medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose)
Injection of 2 mg naloxone.

400
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,590
Naloxone? Why?
(Naloxone: A medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose)

401
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,860
Naloxone? Why?

402
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,380
He's on drugs.

403
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,020
Drugs? What drugs?

404
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,100
Fentanyl.

405
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,060
(Fentanyl: An addictive opioid medication that kills pain)
Fentanyl.

406
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,170
Illegal prescription and habitual intake.
(Fentanyl: An addictive opioid medication that kills pain)

407
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:13,940
Illegal prescription and habitual intake.

408
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,980
Really? Who told you that?

409
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,700
Himself.

410
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,020
Do you know this patient?

411
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,140
I wish I didn't if I had a choice.

412
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,100
Wait.

413
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,220
Wait, stop.

414
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,020
What?

415
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,700
I… Will I be taken away by the police

416
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,220
after I get the injection and wake up?

417
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,500
Will you call the police?

418
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,300
Do it.

419
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,140
Wait.

420
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,260
Stop.

421
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,780
What now?

422
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,020
Promise that you'll never touch it again after you wake up.

423
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,100
What's the use of his promise?

424
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
He won't remember after he wakes up.

425
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,340
Inject now. And call the police after he wakes up.

426
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,620
The patient has woken up. The police are on the way.

427
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,900
I just saved a person though I didn't do surgery.

428
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,780
Go Seung Tak.

429
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,580
Will a good doctor only do operations?

430
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,900
It's not me but you

431
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,460
who saved that patient.

432
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,260
It's another good thing about being able to see ghosts.

433
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,900
You can save patients other doctors can't save.

434
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,340
Don't take it as a barrier.

435
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,420
Give it a good play.

436
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Make it your superpower.

437
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,060
They're not random ghosts or bad ones.

438
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,380
They are patients who need to be saved.

439
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,420
This is President Jang's last wish.

440
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,420
They also have their own stories.

441
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,380
They have a lot of death wishes to be realized.

442
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,020
Though it can be hard, could you help them?

443
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,780
Please. I'm asking you a favor.

444
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,340
What are you doing?

445
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,900
Is that your last wish?

446
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,340
Boy, how dare you say that?

447
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,340
I'm telling you now in case I may forget it.

448
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,540
Maybe I can't remember it later.

449
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,620
By the way, your surgery.

450
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,380
Did you come to talk about that?

451
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,340
We can't do it. And you know it.

452
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,620
As I said,

453
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,820
this will be one of the most difficult operations.

454
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,100
And don't forget the doctors here are also good ones.

455
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,500
Oh, right.

456
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,420
The result of Choi Hoon Gil's brain CT should come out, right?

457
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,420
Come on, let's go have a look.

458
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,180
Didn't he once say that he had a lot of time?

459
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,100
I just want to have lunch with O Su Jeong. Oh, no!

460
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,620
Why hasn't she come?

461
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,660
(President Jo
Mom, let's have lunch together.
I made a reservation at your favorite restaurant.
Please make sure to be there before noon.)

462
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,220
Mom, let's have lunch together.
(President Jo
Mom, let's have lunch together.
I made a reservation at your favorite restaurant.
Please make sure to be there before noon.)

463
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,300
I've booked the restaurant you like.

464
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Do come before twelve.

465
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,580
She already read the message. But why didn't she reply?

466
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,540
As a daughter, I can't accompany my mom on her birthday. Alas!

467
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,830
It looks like hydrocephalus.

468
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,900
(Hydrocephalus:
The buildup of fluid in the cavities deep within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain.)
It looks like hydrocephalus.

469
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,060
(Hydrocephalus:
The buildup of fluid in the cavities deep within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain.)

470
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,670
Comparing the image three years ago with the new one,
(Hydrocephalus:
The buildup of fluid in the cavities deep within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain.)

471
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,900
Comparing the image three years ago with the new one,

472
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,980
you can find that his cerebral ventricle is a little bigger.

473
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,300
This is hydrops.

474
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
To be specific, it's cerebrospinal fluid.

475
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,100
The treatment is…

476
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,700
Bypass.

477
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,940
Insert a straw into the brain all the way to the abdominal cavity.

478
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,220
It can be somewhat complicated.

479
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
But as long as the hydrocephalus can be removed,

480
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,940
this method is feasible.

481
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,500
Yes.

482
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,220
Was it there from the beginning? I must have missed it…

483
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,180
Well…

484
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,820
Maybe it was there from the beginning…

485
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,700
Based on the image taken at that time,

486
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,100
it was hard to tell.

487
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
What's more, the patient had cerebral hemorrhage then.

488
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,100
His bleeding is now decreasing.

489
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,700
I think as doctors,

490
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,140
our current best choice is to wait and observe.

491
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,620
However, if the adhesion gets worse,

492
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,100
it may affect his consciousness.

493
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Yes.

494
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,020
Even if we try our best as humans,

495
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,620
there'll be unexpected results beyond our capability.

496
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,900
That's what our job is like.

497
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,460
We found the image from three years ago which even his family didn't know.

498
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,620
It's very lucky.

499
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,420
What if we didn't find it? We would miss this chance.

500
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,380
Let's go.

501
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,180
I want to share the good news.

502
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,780
Hey.

503
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,780
You should at least say thank you.

504
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
This bad boy.

505
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,460
Oh, my God.

506
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
Why is this?

507
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,900
Let them run a check

508
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,300
and send us the results as soon as possible.

509
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
After that, do a CT scan.

510
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Yes, Dr. Jang.

511
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,620
Professor Cha.

512
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,260
I heard that the way to save Hoon Gil has been found.

513
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,500
Great. It's really great.

514
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,940
What happened? Is he transferred so soon?

515
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,340
Neurosurgery Department?

516
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Not now.

517
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,780
They're transferring him to a general ward first.

518
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,620
Why?

519
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Well, his parents came to visit.

520
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
It just feels so strange.

521
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,580
I'll go have a look.

522
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
You take charge of the transfer.

523
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,420
My son, this must be suffering.

524
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,980
Come on. Hold on.

525
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,140
Mom will never give up.

526
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,860
Take more pictures of the lady. This side.

527
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,100
Mr. Gim, please write a good report for us.

528
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,260
I understand.

529
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500
Mr. Choi.

530
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,700
Don't get too worried.

531
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,500
Thank you.

532
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
We'll go back first.

533
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,180
Darn it.

534
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,140
Why did they shoot so long for just a few pictures?

535
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,300
What a waste of my tears!

536
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,220
It's not a video. Why were you being so exaggerated?

537
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,260
If anyone hears you, they will know I was acting.

538
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,100
You said that this news mattered for you to get a recommendation

539
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,780
from the party in the next election.

540
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,780
Don't you know what the world is like? There's no privacy for a candidate.

541
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,420
Even photos of your family can be made public.

542
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,380
Let's go.

543
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,420
Even if it's freezing cold, I'd like a cup of iced Americano.

544
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,420
Lots of ice, please.

545
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,020
I'd like a glass of grapefruit orange juice.

546
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,100
And... a glass of grapefruit orange juice.

547
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,220
Mango banana latte.

548
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,260
And mango banana latte.

549
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,900
This, and this one.

550
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,220
This one with chocolate.

551
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,820
I want them all.

552
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,820
Can ghosts have hypoglycemia?

553
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,380
No. Some guy didn't have dinner with my lovely granddaughter.

554
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:21,860
Excuse me.

555
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,500
This one, this one.

556
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,900
And this one. I'll take them all, too.

557
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,020
Hey.

558
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
And the card.

559
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,580
What?

560
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Didn't I save you, boy?

561
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
Why are you staring at me?

562
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,540
And the card…

563
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,500
I need you to slip this card

564
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,140
under the vending machine in the lounge.

565
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,900
And be nice to my granddaughter, boy.

566
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,620
Or I'll just...

567
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,300
What are you hiding from?

568
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
What's your limit on this card?

569
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,260
Choi Hoon Gil!

570
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,500
What are you doing?

571
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,700
Get down here now.

572
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
Come down slowly.

573
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,420
I know you're upset.

574
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,340
But you can't play with your precious body.

575
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,020
Get down here now.

576
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Come down slowly.

577
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Oh, right.

578
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,660
You are a... ghost.

579
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,300
Get down here.

580
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,500
What are you doing?

581
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,260
I don't want to have surgery.

582
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,300
What?

583
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,620
Just let me die.

584
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,780
Even if I did wake up, I wouldn't be welcomed.

585
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,260
It's not a precious life.

586
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,420
Didn't you sneer and ask how wonderful my life was worth struggling with?

587
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,020
My life is not wonderful at all.

588
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,020
I want to die. It's cool.

589
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,340
"How wonderful your life is worth struggling with?"

590
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,820
What do you know about us?

591
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,100
How great is your life?

592
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,820
Right. I don't know your life.

593
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,820
How could I possibly know

594
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,820
your life?

595
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,580
And

596
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,580
why should I know?

597
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,580
But

598
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,740
I did learn a few things by accident.

599
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,300
He had his whole life ahead of him.

600
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,300
It is said that his dream

601
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,820
is to be an actor.

602
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,500
There are patients who are more worried about your future

603
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,820
than their own imminent death.

604
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,220
I want to save

605
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,860
these patients.

606
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,220
If I can…

607
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,660
There are doctors who have survived painful personal trauma

608
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,500
and tried to save you.

609
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,740
Am I going to die?

610
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,220
His O2 sats are up.

611
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
His heart rate dropped.

612
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,500
You don't want to die, do you?

613
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,180
You want to live.

614
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,860
Does that happen to people who want to die?

615
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,860
At that time…

616
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,940
How did you become such a patient-oriented doctor?

617
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,500
Didn't you say it was over? Did you just let it go?

618
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,820
What makes you play the good doctor now?

619
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,060
That's not like you at all. I need you to stop.

620
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,100
Right.

621
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,580
I did say that.

622
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
It's over.

623
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,580
I let go of your hand.

624
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,780
It was the other doctors who saved you

625
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,100
from being given up.

626
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,420
So, I am a doctor who operates based on who the patient was.

627
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,700
Is the patient going to live or not?

628
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,660
Will the family be happy when he wakes up?

629
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
If a patient asks me to save him, I'll save him.

630
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
If the patient begs me to let him die, I'll let him die.

631
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,300
That's the kind of doctor I am.

632
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,620
It's what you think I am.

633
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,660
But what can you do?

634
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,420
You're not gonna be operated on

635
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,100
by a doctor like me.

636
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,740
He really cares about his patients.

637
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,220
He is a very good doctor.

638
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,940
If that's what you want to do, tell me.

639
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,260
I'll tell him.

640
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,740
What are you going to choose?

641
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,220
Should he save you,

642
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,980
or should he let you die?

643
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,980
Patient Choi Hoon Gil.

644
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,860
What do you want me to do?

645
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,900
Let him die or let him live?

646
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,020
Your father.

647
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,340
You've become this kind of doctor.

648
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,500
I don't treat just anyone. Why?

649
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,100
Because I'm not a doctor who treats every patient.

650
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,940
He was pronounced dead in the morning. Are you in a bad mood?

651
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,900
You have to learn how to declare death, don't you?

652
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,620
I'll take my leave.

653
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,900
After all, I have patients to save.

654
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
There are two kinds of patients in the world.

655
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,500
There are patients I saved

656
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,180
and patients who died after treatment.

657
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,420
But if I treat the patient and the patient dies,

658
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,420
it means no one can cure him.

659
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,100
That's what happened with those patients.

660
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,940
You are crazy.

661
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Who do you think you are?

662
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,300
A man asked me to give it to you.

663
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,620
Asked you? A man?

664
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,699
Who?

665
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:23,940
Just a man.

666
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,300
Lately, this man has made looking at you the joy of his life.

667
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,820
He said you had low blood sugar. That's why he asked me to buy it for you.

668
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
He even took my card away.

669
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820
What are you talking about?

670
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,699
Are you making fun of me again?

671
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,500
If I make fun of you, he'll come back and kill me.

672
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,020
Eat them all by yourself.

673
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,100
You're buying me dinner tomorrow.

674
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,659
I have lives to save, so I'm gonna go.

675
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,780
Hey, how can I eat all this?

676
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,220
But even so,

677
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,540
I still want to live.

678
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,940
It's not that I've had a great life.

679
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,620
It's that I've made so many promises.

680
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,900
And I have to keep those promises.

681
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,380
Because I'm afraid that day won't come,

682
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
I'm so over-cautious right now.

683
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,620
So,

684
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
answer my question well.

685
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,620
I don't have much time now.

686
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,820
Hey, I told you I couldn't make it for a while.

687
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,380
-Darn it.
-Of course, I miss you.

688
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,900
But these days, Bo Mi keeps me on a tight leash, so I have to cooperate with her first.

689
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,100
Hey, you think I'm marrying her because I like her?

690
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,900
How many times do I have to say it? Her family is well off.

691
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,220
She has many houses.

692
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,500
Hey, I gotta go.

693
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Oh.

694
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,420
Do you want me to slap you in the face?

695
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,420
But I can't.

696
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,660
What are you doing out here? I'm going in anyway.

697
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,340
It's cold. You should wear more clothes.

698
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,500
Hey, put it on.

699
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,220
No need.

700
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
I don't feel cold.

701
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,300
By the way, you're leaving the hospital next week, right?

702
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,820
Let's go on a trip together.

703
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,820
I have several places in mind.

704
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,580
What?

705
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
A trip?

706
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,420
Never mind if we don't meet.

707
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,380
Why did she send me a package?

708
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,980
How much can she make as an intern? I can't believe she bought such an expensive thing.

709
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,700
Hello.

710
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Hello. Welcome.

711
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,020
I hear your barbershop is good?

712
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,220
Oh, Ma'am.

713
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,940
What brings you here?

714
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,500
I'm here…

715
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Not…

716
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,420
Why would I come to a barbershop?

717
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,500
Charge me double the price.

718
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,100
What would you like to do?

719
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,500
A perm?

720
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,420
Perm…

721
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,580
Fine.

722
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
A perm, of course.

723
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,500
Well, my hair might be a little...

724
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,980
Oh.

725
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,180
This hairstyle is good.

726
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,300
Give me a perm like this.

727
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,420
That's a young girl's haircut.

728
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,420
What's wrong with my age?

729
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,220
Well, have a seat.

730
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,540
Here.

731
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,180
Oh.

732
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,420
Your daughter's still in the Emergency Room.

733
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,780
That's why your eyes are puffy, right?

734
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,260
Do you know Su Jeong?

735
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
Yes, I do.

736
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,100
She works the hardest in our emergency room.

737
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,740
She's also the best-looking doctor.

738
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,460
Why does she have to work so hard?

739
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,820
She is not so strong to begin with.

740
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,100
I'm so worried.

741
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,820
That's right.

742
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,820
It's worrying.

743
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,380
Facing these doctors all day,

744
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,740
I'm always worried, too.

745
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,020
When I see them walking around

746
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,420
with their pale faces like ghosts,

747
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,700
I would think, why do they have to be so stupid?

748
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,380
Why would you say that again?

749
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,260
If you talk about making more money comfortably again,

750
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,540
I'll have to ask you to stop it.

751
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,540
What doctor in the world would...

752
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,260
You're gonna have a nice perm and go.

753
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,700
But it's amazing.

754
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,300
Although they look like they are gonna fall down any minute,

755
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,100
when they see the patients, their eyes will become bright.

756
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,420
When they see those dying patients walking out again,

757
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,420
they will be happy

758
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,500
and giggle to themselves.

759
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,500
That's how they became good doctors.

760
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,300
I wanted to be like that, too.

761
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,620
I've been in this hospital for decades.

762
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,860
So,

763
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,860
I've seen a lot.

764
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,940
Come on.

765
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,220
You sound like a granny.

766
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,980
I'll give you a nice cut

767
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,300
and make you look younger.

768
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,220
Su Jeong's mom.

769
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,900
Please take care of Su Jeong.

770
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,380
And I'm so sorry

771
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,340
and grateful, too.

772
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
What's wrong?

773
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,860
What's wrong with Professor Cha?

774
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,820
Here.

775
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,020
What is it? What's going on?

776
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,820
Since a few days ago,

777
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:13,930
his sputum has become sticky and purulent,

778
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,940
(Sputum Purulent)
his sputum has become sticky and purulent,

779
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,380
and his white blood cell count has risen.
(Sputum Purulent)

780
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,060
There are other numbers that have gone up.
(Sputum Purulent)

781
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,580
There are other numbers that have gone up.

782
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,700
An examination of the bacterial culture revealed

783
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:18,980
(Carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas)
An examination of the bacterial culture revealed

784
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,460
the emergence of carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas.
(Carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas)

785
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,060
the emergence of carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas.

786
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,260
That is to say...

787
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,380
The pneumonia is getting worse again.

788
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,740
Tell her to take a look at the blood vessels

789
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,940
when she does the chest CT.

790
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:29,950
And take a look at the neck vessel extension.

791
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,740
(Neck vessel extension)
And take a look at the neck vessel extension.

792
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,130
(Neck vessel extension)

793
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,980
What's the matter?

794
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,140
The innominate artery narrowed again.

795
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,180
So…

796
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,420
At this rate, it's a matter of days.

797
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,260
How come nothing ever goes right?

798
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,780
Why is there still new problem?

799
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,900
Seung Tak, don't scare Dr. Jang.

800
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,420
I brought this on myself.

801
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,940
Is this because of what happened last time?

802
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,060
Dr. Go, what about his surgery?

803
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,660
Professor Cha's surgery?

804
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,620
Now?

805
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,170
Now, the reversible innominate artery obstruction that we see on CT

806
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,340
(Reversible
Innominate artery obstruction)
Now, the reversible innominate artery obstruction that we see on CT

807
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,490
is getting worse.
(Reversible
Innominate artery obstruction)

808
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,300
is getting worse.

809
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,980
We need to operate right away.

810
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,540
But if we force it in current state…

811
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,100
It's the same innominate artery replacement surgery,

812
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,300
but it's harder than it was at first.

813
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,860
That's right.

814
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,460
After we operate on a patient who hasn't recovered from pneumonia,

815
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,040
if the artificial blood vessels get infected,

816
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,060
(Graft: artificial blood vessel)
if the artificial blood vessels get infected,

817
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,910
it can be very dangerous.
(Graft: artificial blood vessel)

818
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,420
it can be very dangerous.

819
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,220
But the patient doesn't have the time to wait for

820
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,460
the pneumonia to get better.

821
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,860
That's…

822
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,140
We can't leave Professor Cha in such a precarious state, can we?

823
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,100
Of course we can't.

824
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,780
So, the professors talked it over

825
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,370
and decided to go straight to bypass surgery. What do you say?

826
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,040
(Bypass)
and decided to go straight to bypass surgery. What do you say?

827
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,020
Can't we just fix the blood flow first?

828
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,980
Forget about the innominate artery for now.

829
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,940
Just connect the left and right carotid arteries with catheter at the neck.

830
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,220
All we need to do is open the neck.

831
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,860
The surgery would be much easier.

832
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,300
Professor Cha is not even in his 40s yet.

833
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,340
Didn't we agree last time that

834
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,620
we should solve the problem in a more fundamental way?

835
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,460
I know that.

836
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,140
Professor Cha is still young and has a bright future ahead of him.

837
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,100
He isn't married.

838
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
He hasn't worn enough of the new brands he likes.

839
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,980
I know that.

840
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,340
We want to help him, too.

841
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,900
But to fix the innominate artery,

842
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,060
we have to do a thoracotomy.

843
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,140
His inflammation levels are going up.

844
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,820
It's such a reckless act to perform thoracotomy

845
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,060
on a patient who's still suffering from pneumonia.

846
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
This isn't Professor Cha's first surgery.

847
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
And in an aorta surgery, he could lose so much blood,

848
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,540
which is dangerous. You know that.

849
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,460
Anesthetizing an unconscious patient is already dangerous.

850
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,340
Plus it's such a difficult and dangerous surgery,

851
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,300
do we have to try it?

852
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,780
You know, even if we do the surgery, there's no guarantee he'll wake up.

853
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,900
Maybe he'll have another accident in surgery...

854
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,300
So in this case, it is better to open the neck first,

855
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,940
and solve the problem of blood flow.

856
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,140
We have to save him first.

857
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,940
The professors have changed their minds now.

858
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,660
They really know how to stay out of it.

859
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,540
This is a well possible insight,

860
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,380
and it makes sense.

861
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,700
Which side do you agree with?

862
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,660
Besides, this is your surgery.

863
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,580
I'm not saying that as a patient,

864
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,340
but as a doctor.

865
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,580
So, did you decide to have bypass surgery?

866
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,540
Do you want to live with a tube in your neck for the rest of your life?

867
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,660
It will always be stuck when you eat or speak.

868
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,420
How do you live?

869
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,260
In addition, what if it can be seen from outside?

870
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,860
Don't you want to fall in love and get married?

871
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,660
You will always worry about when it will get blocked.

872
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,100
And I heard that you have to take medicine for the rest of your life.

873
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,060
Do you want to have surgery?

874
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
The surgery.

875
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,220
Didn't you ask me last time?

876
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,780
If I have surgery, will it be done by you?

877
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,900
Do you want to do the surgery?

878
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,580
What are you talking about?

879
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,100
Then do the bypass surgery.

880
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,860
I received a call from the chief,

881
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:56,620
and I heard what you said just now,

882
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,100
and I also learned his opinion as a doctor.

883
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,660
Dr. Jang.

884
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,980
Yeong Min, answer my question.

885
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,140
If you have bypass surgery,

886
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,740
is there a good chance you will wake up safely?

887
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,380
You will live with a tube in your neck for the rest of your life.

888
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,100
You will always worry about when it will get blocked.

889
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,620
And you have to take medicine for the rest of your life.

890
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,820
But even so...

891
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,220
You will definitely wake up, right?

892
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,380
Yes, I will.

893
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,260
Professor.

894
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,860
Go Seung Tak, stop.

895
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,620
I'm his guardian and it's up to me to make the decision.

896
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,780
I also have

897
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,020
the responsibility and power over him.

898
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,540
He struggled to survive this far.

899
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,820
It can't end like this.

900
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,380
I'll search all hospitals in Korea... No,

901
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,940
even if I have to search all over the world, I will find

902
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,020
the doctor who can operate on him.

903
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,980
I absolutely can't let professor become like that.

904
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,740
Yes, Dr. Ye Jin U.

905
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,060
Oh, did he go overseas to attend the academy?

906
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,060
I understand.

907
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,660
Well, wait, maybe...

908
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,420
Hey, bro,

909
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,980
your hospital...

910
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,100
He seems to be looking for

911
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,660
the most powerful doctor in that field from hospital to hospital.

912
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,460
No one wants to do it.

913
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,860
Professor Cha is in a coma,

914
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,100
and the whole medical community knows it.

915
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,060
It's not an easy operation.

916
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,740
We don't know what's going to happen.

917
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,420
In other words, the last card is still valid, right?

918
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,260
I mean it gets easier.

919
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,140
I also have a private meeting with Dr. An.

920
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,020
I've been curious since before.

921
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,780
Why do you want to get rid of Professor Cha?

922
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,940
I've had some problems with him since a lot of years ago.

923
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,500
And even if he wakes up, he won't know anything.

924
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Even if he knew,

925
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,980
no one would believe a man who wakes up from a coma.

926
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,700
The things that worry me are increasing.

927
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,300
The only way to get rid of the other one

928
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,380
is to get rid of him first.

929
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,260
He changes a lot.

930
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:10,900
Anyway,

931
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,780
what are you going to do when you finish using Doctor An?

932
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,260
His testimony would be the biggest problem.

933
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,260
Now there are no other witnesses and no evidence.

934
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,180
If something goes wrong, we have to deal with him.

935
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,660
Let's take advantage of him and wait for the timing.

936
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,530
(Consent For Operation)

937
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,940
Yes, you're right.

938
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,140
We should save him first.

939
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,780
Of course.

940
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,740
You are the chief surgeon.

941
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,860
Don't dare to say anything else. As for bypass surgery,

942
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,540
others say that in this circle,

943
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,100
I can rank among the top three.

944
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,940
I am a little shy about it, though.

945
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,980
Anyhow, as my junior,

946
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,540
I love and cherish Professor Cha very much.

947
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,460
But I have only one regret.

948
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,860
If he has bypass surgery,

949
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,180
his hand strength may shrink.

950
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,060
This is a side effect.

951
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,380
Sometimes he had to do more than 10 hours of surgery before.

952
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,780
But that kind of complicated surgery

953
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,380
will be difficult for him to do in the future.

954
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,700
Gee, come over here, quick.

955
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,260
Professor Cha.

956
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,300
He has something to tell you.

957
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,780
Spit it out.

958
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,980
If you don't say it, it'll be unspoken forever.

959
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,780
Your surgery date has been set,

960
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,620
and it's the same day as mine.

961
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,500
-What?
-Didn't I say?

962
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,820
The doctor who will operate on you this time

963
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,380
is different from me.

964
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,140
It was my fault last time.

965
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,100
Just ignore it, and don't take it to heart.

966
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,500
This line sounds familiar.

967
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,300
Professor Cha, it's so nice.

968
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,060
Good, thank you. I'll leave.

969
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,940
If he has bypass surgery,

970
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,700
his hand strength may shrink.

971
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,300
That kind of complicated surgery

972
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,180
will be difficult for him to do in the future.

973
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,700
Doctor,

974
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,300
I want to ask you something.

975
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,420
Well...

976
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,260
I had frequent nosebleeds before I passed out.

977
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,740
How did you know about it?

978
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,060
I heard you knew about it,

979
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,220
and helped find a surgical method.

980
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,940
A doctor

981
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,660
said there was a possibility, and he asked me to check.

982
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,540
Oh.

983
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,660
Thank him so much.

984
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,420
He is a good doctor.

985
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,620
Even though he is ill,

986
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,620
he still thinks about other patients and performs operations.

987
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,180
He is a doctor with a strong sense of responsibility to his patients.

988
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,420
He is a comatose patient.

989
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,140
Fortunately, we found a way and he's going to undergo surgery,

990
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,060
like you.

991
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,820
It's the same doctor who told me last time.

992
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,460
It's so good.

993
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,420
I really hope that he'll have a successful surgery and wake up soon,

994
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,900
just like me.

995
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,940
What about telling this to the patient directly?

996
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,020
What?

997
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,340
Me?

998
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,900
People always talk to patients in a coma.

999
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,460
It's generally thought that it is just talking,

1000
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,660
but in fact, the patients are listening.

1001
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,780
Hello, Patient Choi Hoon Gil.

1002
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,660
You are so handsome.

1003
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:44,900
Ah, my name is Im Chun Hui.

1004
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,460
I heard that you're going to have surgery soon.

1005
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,300
I've been sick for a long time like you.

1006
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,420
I'm going to be discharged soon after my surgery.

1007
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:04,700
You will, too.

1008
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:11,540
Handsome Hoon Gil, please definitely wake up.

1009
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,620
And fulfill your dreams.

1010
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,620
I'm so sorry.

1011
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:06,460
At that time, if I had gone in earlier...

1012
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,740
I'm probably the only one in the world

1013
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,300
who's ever heard his surgeon say

1014
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,020
he was sorry for not being able to save his patient.

1015
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:20,020
Professor Cha, do you know what the first thing I saw

1016
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,820
when I became a ghost?

1017
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,820
What happened?

1018
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,500
Double-armed polypropylene sutures.

1019
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,980
It was the scene when Chief Ban went out after the operation

1020
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,660
and the resident doctor was finishing up, putting me in danger,

1021
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,180
and then Professor Cha next door came to save me.

1022
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,500
He's trying to save me no matter what.

1023
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,900
Acute aortic dissection

1024
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,540
has a high mortality rate.

1025
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,700
At least my life was saved because of Professor Cha.

1026
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,900
I knew I almost died there,

1027
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,500
and I knew the blood pressure had dropped so low during the operation that my brain was damaged.

1028
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,540
After living in the hospital for so long,

1029
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,660
I almost became a doctor.

1030
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,140
I'm not your patient,

1031
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,820
but since then you have been talking about finding a way to save me.

1032
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,820
I saw that you tried so hard.

1033
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,820
So be it.

1034
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,140
Yes.

1035
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,820
I also saw that every time you came to the ICU, you'd be very sad when seeing me,

1036
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,660
and you even started to lose your temper afterward.

1037
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,900
It's your specialty to lose your temper

1038
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
when you see a patient you can't save, isn't it?

1039
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,100
I know how desperate you are to save me.

1040
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,580
But sometimes I'm a little sad.

1041
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,620
I'm sorry. I was in a bit of a bad state.

1042
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,220
If you are so sorry,

1043
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:19,180
Professor Cha, can I ask you one last thing?

1044
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,780
Can you send me somewhere else

1045
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,980
before Hoon Gil wakes up from the surgery?

1046
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,500
I saw the case in the ICU this morning

1047
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,860
and I know you care about me.

1048
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:36,220
But no matter how you try, you can't find the answer.

1049
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,220
Isn't that really the end of it?

1050
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,260
I heard you are going to have surgery soon.

1051
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,900
I don't want to be alone again.

1052
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,700
If I go to a hospital near my home,

1053
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,340
I can often see my family,

1054
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:56,700
and there should be some friends there, too.

1055
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,060
If it's Professor Cha, maybe there's a way.

1056
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,060
It's hard, so hard.

1057
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:06,100
You can't let him do surgery on himself.

1058
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,300
This is really...

1059
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,900
Go Seung Tak isn't here and he doesn't know it.

1060
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,100
I feel sorry for Professor Cha lately.

1061
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,940
If the surgeries are getting less and less frequent.

1062
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,860
Although Professor Cha sometimes makes people tremble,

1063
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,220
his skills are the best.

1064
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,780
If the bypass surgery is done,

1065
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,500
his skills should not be as good as before.

1066
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,140
Thanks to Professor Cha, my store was saved.

1067
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,140
I'm relieved.

1068
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,620
Thank you.

1069
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,820
Professor Cha.

1070
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,780
If you encounter patients like me in the future,

1071
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,780
you must save them.

1072
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,020
Save more.

1073
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,630
No, how can you let your hands become clumsy? Who said it?

1074

No, how can you let your hands become clumsy? Who said it?

1075
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,220
Don't we also have your hands?
(To be played in 60 seconds)

1076
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,500
Aren't they about to become golden hands?
(To be played in 60 seconds)

1077
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Hey, my hands need more training and practice...

1078
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,060
Didn't you say you will help me by my side?

1079
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,060
Really? Then I have no choice.

1080
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,300
I must protect my hands.

How can I believe you?

How did a coward like you do those things?

1086
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,300
Can you live a normal life in the future?

1087

Your life is so long.

00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,700
Ah, you want to play dumb till the last.

Well, that's not the matter we'll discuss today.

Matter?

Did Professor Cha know that?

1103

Is this what Professor Cha meant?

Yes, that's it.

Do you want Professor Cha's position?

I am betting my whole life.

1111

Should I be qualified to ask for these?

Will my life change if I kill another one?

I'll end it myself.

01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,500
back to the way it was at the beginning.

1150
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,620
Seung Tak.

1151
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,580
Thank you.

1152
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:07,940
From the first day

1153
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,260
to the last moment.
