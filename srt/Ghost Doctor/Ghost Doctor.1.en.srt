1
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,650
Dad, Dad, are you okay?

2
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,990
Other hospitals also refused us.

3
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,990
Then where can we go?

4
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm begging you, please help him.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,590
We have nowhere else to call.

6
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,160
No, no.

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,530
Dad, Dad!

8
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,510
A man will come to a certain moment.

9
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,510
Dad.

10
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,180
Dad.

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,250
Dad. Dad.

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,490
A moment where they wish to receive the help of divinities.

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,660
Oh, no.

14
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,200
It's the abdominal artery rupture patient we just told you over the phone.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,630
We don't have a doctor who can do the operation.

16
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,000
Didn't I just tell you that?

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,270
What are we gonna do about him?

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,530
He's in the state of hypovolemic shock.

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,300
Now we can hardly maintain his vital signs.

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,900
He'll die if you don't do the operation now.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,370
We can't. Please leave.

22
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,880
Go.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,740
Dr. Ha?

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,580
Yes.

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,610
Let's go.

26
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,180
Doctor.

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,720
Please save my father.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,590
I'm begging you, please.

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,160
Send them away.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,229
If the divinities have too much to tend to,

31
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,330
the man wouldn't mind if a ghost could help.

32
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,400
Get out.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,930
No!

34
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,440
Don't do that!

35
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,509
Please reconsider.

36
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,940
If we send the patient away like this,

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,950
he might die on the way.

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,650
Are you crazy?

39
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,280
You are just an intern, how dare you speak up like this?

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,750
Hurry up and send him away, what are you waiting for?

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,350
No!

42
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,620
Stop!

43
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,160
Isn't this a hospital?

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Aren't we doctors?

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,600
If doctors abandon patients,

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,260
then who will...

47
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,500
You fool, think you are a doctor now.

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,070
Hey, why don't you do the surgery on him then?

49
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,120
Dad, no!

50
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,070
(Ghost Doctor)

51
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,270
What happened next?
(Ghost Doctor)

52
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,810
What happened next?

53
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,310
Did the ghost save the patient?

54
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,540
(Episode 1)
Did the ghost save the patient?

55
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,350
You want to know?
(Episode 1)

56
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,910
Well...
(Episode 1)

57
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,579
Well...

58
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,079
It's a secret.

59
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,480
If people in this world know it,

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,890
something disastrous is going to happen.

61
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,520
Do that kind of ghosts really exist?

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,960
Of course, they should be here, in this hospital, too.

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,260
The guardians of the sick.

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,760
You know guardians, right?

65
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,060
So, my little patients,

66
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,670
remember that there are always ghost doctors by your side,

67
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,170
and you should thank them.

68
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,170
Say thank you to them.

69
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,970
Liar!

70
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,380
How can there be such kind ghosts?

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,610
- Liar!
- Liar!

73
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,550
How can a doctor turn into a ghost?

74
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,410
You think ghost is superhero?

75
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,020
She is telling a lie, a big lie.

76
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,880
Let's go.

77
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,190
The children now are really stubborn.

78
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,560
They don't listen to the grown-ups.

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,960
If all problems can be solved by the power of the living,

80

If all problems can be solved by the power of the living,

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,300
(12 years later)

82
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,339
then that's what is called a lie, a big terrible lie.

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,120
Gorgeous.

86
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,930
He doesn't let us down today either.

87
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,030
That's Professor Cha Yeong Min of Thoracic Surgery.

88
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,570
What? He's a professor?

89
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,670
Right, you are surprised, too.

90
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,370
With that appearance and that figure,

91
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,440
why did he become a doctor?

92
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,880
More than that, he's mysterious, too.

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,610
What is it?

94
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,920
So, the time of CPR?

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,790
It took us about 30 minutes to get here.

96
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,330
Without any witness,

97
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,560
we don't know for sure when his heart stopped beating.

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,760
Please go this way.

99
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,140
Let Dr. An do it.

100
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,810
No need for ECMO.

101
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,690
Make way please!

102
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,690
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

103
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,130

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,320
They'll come in a minute.

Check the blood pressure.

Switch to manual.

116
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,900

Sure enough,
interns often make troubles everywhere though they don't know anything.

131
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,860
It's understandable, I used to be just like you.

132
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,670
It's the privilege of an intern.

133

Professor, watch out!

I'm sorry, Professor, but we're running out of time.

Intern O, let me keep it short.

138
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,450
First,

139
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,190
I don't offer treatment to whoever you toss at me

140
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,990
because I'm not that kind of doctor.

141
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,930
Second,

142
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,930
I don't treat emergency patients because

143
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,800
there will be a few steps till the patients get transferred to me.

144

Third,

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,230
I won't treat that kind of patients.

146
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,070
Patients like the one that just got in there.

147

This pair of hands is ready for patients with 1% hope of survival.

148
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,810
Professor, watch out.

149
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,880
Crap.

150
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,380
Professor, if you got the time here to...

151
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,620
To do what?

152
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,890
Intern O, please hurry back to the emergency room,

153
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,790
and learn to declare death.

154
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,960
I need to save the ones that really have the chance of survival.

155
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,540
Lunatic.

156
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,690
Name of the patient?

157
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,200
Well...

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Name of the patient!

159

Who? Don't tell me you went to that man.

164
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,270
Hey, do you know who that is?

165
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,480
Who else can it be? The glamorous gangster doctor.

166
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,050
Gangster? Are you out of your mind?

which saved an emergency patient.

171
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,270
The whole hospital was shocked, and people thought it's outrageous.

172
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,440
But there have been similar things before.

173
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,910
And now, any patient he touches lives.

174
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,880
Rumor says that he's being possessed by a ghost.

175
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,180
What did you just say?

176
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,950
What? He performed an operation during his internship?

177
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,920
You cannot believe that, either, right?

178
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,420
Back then, he was about your age,

179
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,090
even a genius...

180
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,500
No, the possessed-by-a-ghost thing.

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,530
It's just a metaphor, describing his great medical skills.

182
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,240
How can it be a real ghost?

183
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,940
Female, 33 years old. Patient of Behcet syndrome.

184
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,040
(EunSang University Medical Center)
Female, 33 years old. Patient of Behcet syndrome.

185
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,240
According to AR, her colon ulcer
showed inflammation, after three surgeries,
(EunSang University Medical Center)

186
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,780
According to AR, her colon ulcer
showed inflammation, after three surgeries,

187
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,050
it developed into an aneurysm. Professor Cha will perform quadrido this afternoon.

188
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:41,920
(Quadrido: the fourth surgery)

189
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,950
Quadrido?
(Quadrido: the fourth surgery)

190
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,720
The fourth, not the fifth?
(Quadrido: the fourth surgery)

191
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
The fourth, not the fifth?

192
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,560
Well, it's the fifth surgery.

193
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,400
Technically, it's a reoperation of the fourth surgery.

194
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,030
Professor Cha knows that very well.

195
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,770
It's a disease that comes back often.

196
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,040
When it happens, you have a surgery.

197
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,770
Over time, the connection becomes severe and there are adhesions everywhere.

198
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,510
The blood vessels in the chest burst.

199
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,880
It's a tricky and difficult surgery.

200
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,280
Why did you do it since it's tricky and difficult, Chief?

201
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,780
That's because all the other doctors said they couldn't do it.

202
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,890
Then you should do the reoperation too, Chief.

203
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,760
Well... Professor...

204
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,560
What?

205
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,030
The patient said he didn't trust the chief.

206
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,830
He wants to change the surgeon.

207
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,870
Then we have no choice. Prepare for the operation.

208
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,500
Next.

209
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,010
The 70-year-old male patient

210
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,410
with chronic diabetes and hypertension

211
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,750
suffered from a stroke two years ago.

212
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,120
Cardiac sarcoma was found one month ago

213
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,550
during an examination due to breathing difficulties.

214
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,020
(Cardiac Sarcoma, a type of rarely occurring primary malignant cardiac tumor)
during an examination due to breathing difficulties.

215
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,820
That's the one I diagnosed and treated.
(Cardiac Sarcoma, a type of rarely occurring primary malignant cardiac tumor)

216
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,050
That's the one I diagnosed and treated.

217
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,520
The son asked if his father could have a surgery.

218
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,790
So, what, are you going to do it?

219
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,100
I can't do it.

220
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,930
How can I do that?

221
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,770
Can Professor Cha do it?

222
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,430
It cannot be done.

223
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,900
Well, Professor Cha...

224
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,470
Don't jump to conclusions. Please think about it.

225
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,510
Take the son's filial piety into consideration.

226
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,520
A hematoma or tumor tissue that falls out of the heart

227
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,620
may go to the brain, and cause a worse stroke.

228
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,220
There is also the possibility of reoccurrence due to unstable removal.

229
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,660
He has one year left without a surgery.

230
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,260
If he doesn't want to make that even shorter,

231
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,630
a filial son

232
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,900
would let him spend the rest of his life in peace.

233
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,300
Tell the son that.

234
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,400
Professor Cha, don't do this.

235
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,440
Next!

236
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,850
He knew it and he did it to make me look bad.

237
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,480
He treated me, a department chief, like garbage.

238
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,820
When young people think they are capable,

239
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,950
they become aggressive and arrogant.

240
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,590
Go on and see what that will lead you to.

241
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,060
Heaven, please don't just observe out there.

242
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,030
That's right, today's the day.

243
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,130
All right, you brat, meet your opponent.

244
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,270
Relax and be gentle.

245
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,350
He dared not say a word back in there, but he...

246
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,750
But what did he mean?

247
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,780
What opponent?

248
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,590
OK, it's over. Unplugging.

249
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,720
How many are there?

250
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,160
What is wrong with him?

251
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,460
Like one of his screws is loose.

252
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,560
Today is the day to meet the newcomer.

253
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,330
He's been working so hard on his own, of course he's happy

254
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,470
to see a newcomer.

255
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,240
Ah, is it today?

256
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,840
With the Specialist Physicians' Law, how hard could it be?

257
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,610
Why hasn't he shown himself yet?

258
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,880
Being absent on his first day.

259
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,980
Bring him to me when he's here.

260
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,010
I will.

261
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,410
But what's with the look on your face?

262
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,080
What, because you had to declare a patient's death in the morning?

263
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,320
It's not that.

264
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,860
But how do you know?

265
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,060
I saw it on the way in.

266
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,720
The patient suffered from an unwitnessed cardiac arrest.

267
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,160
(Unwitnessed arrest: Unwitnessed cardiac arrest)
The patient suffered from an unwitnessed cardiac arrest.

268
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,030
He lost 30 minutes on the way and had no response.
(Unwitnessed arrest: Unwitnessed cardiac arrest)

269
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,300
That meant he had no chance, right?

270
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,240
What about ECMO?

271
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,140
We did not use that.

272
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,450
Well done.

273
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:27,780
ECMO Priming costs 3 million won at a time.

274
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,910
(ECMO Priming: Filling the entire ECMO circuit with fluid)
ECMO Priming costs 3 million won at a time.

275
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,510
And it is disposable.
(ECMO Priming: Filling the entire ECMO circuit with fluid)

276
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,420
Why waste money when it's useless anyway?

277
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,090
Well done.

278
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,000
You are Professor Cha Yeong Min, right?

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
I've heard a lot about you.

280
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,940
They say you are the best doctor in our hospital.

281
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,540
Yes, I am, you are?

282
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,750
This is a hand possessed by divinities.

283
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,150
It's unexpectedly beautiful.

284
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,380
I take good care of them.

285
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,950
But... who are you?

286
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,990
A president once said

287
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,960
one genius can feed 100,000 people.

288
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,260
Wait a minute.
Our hospital has 2,000 permanent medical staff

289
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,830
and 5,800 general employees, that is about 8,000 in total.

290
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,800
Wow, Professor Cha could feed 10 hospitals!

291
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Well...

292
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,210
ECMO costs 3 million won a time. That's a general employee's monthly salary.

293
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,540
So if you save ten times, that's the annual salary of an employee.

294
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,750
What's up?

295
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,780
Who are you?

296
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,250
So eminent, but I hear you are a little mean.

297
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,390
You're...

298
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,060
That's the personality, privilege and charm of a genius.

299
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,560
Aristotle said

300
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,160
there is no such thing as a genius without a little bit of arrogance.

301
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,930
It takes a whole hospital to cultivate a genius.

302
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,270
After all, you have the medical skills of divinities.

303
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,540
If you have a problem, you can always come to me.

304
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,080
Hello, bro.

305
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,320
You guys go ahead.

306
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,130
Bro, where's the locker?

307
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,290
It's over there.

308
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,600
By the way,

309
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,970
I will start working with you from today.

310
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,880
I'm Dr. Go Seung Tak.

311
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,440
Thank you.

312
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,390
Oh, please...

313
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,930
Is that the new guy we were talking about?

314
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,530
Who is he?

315
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,630
Hey, who's that guy?

316
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,900
You know him, don't you?

317
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,930
When and where did you know him?

318
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,000
How much do you know about him?

319
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,570
I knew him from school.

320
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,010
I don't know much, only a little.

321
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,080
Did you teach him to be like that?

322
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,110
I wouldn't dare!

323
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,750
I just gave him some information.

324
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,150
Information? What information?

325
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,350
Information about arrogance?

326
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,720
It's not fair!

327
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm the biggest victim.

328
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,890
Go Seung Tak.

329
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,330
You don't mean that "they told me" Go Seung Tak, do you?

330
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,390
You know him too, Dr. Lee?

331
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,130
I've only heard of him.

332
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,800
He had an interview when he came as an intern.

333
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,270
It's a legend.

334
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,940
We ask superficial questions at the internship interview.

335
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,070
(EunSang University Medical Center)
We ask superficial questions at the internship interview.

336
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,010
Why do you choose to be a doctor?
(EunSang University Medical Center)

337
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,940
I want to help suffering patients.

338
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,710
I want to save people's lives.

339
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,550
People would talk about superficial things.

340
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,580
Here's what he said:

341
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,720
Grandpa and Mom told me to be a doctor.

342
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,260
So, his grandpa is the President of our group.

343
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,230
And his mom is the Chairman of the Council.

344
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,090
(Qualified)
And his mom is the Chairman of the Council.

345
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,330
Why is there still back-door-dealing in the 21st century?

346
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,370
What dealing?

347
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,810
What if specialists demonstrate?

348
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,110
How dare you do it in modern society?

349
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,880
Withdraw it.

350
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,910
His score ranked first in school.

351
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,050
And he got the best result in the internship evaluation.

352
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,910
If this is a back-door-dealing,

353
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,150
Professor Cha is also a back-door-dealing.

354
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,320
You helped with the internship evaluation.

355
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,150
Since when are specialists selected on the basis of their departmental scores?

356
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,890
What about humanity, sense of mission, sense of life?

357
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,030
When did Professor Cha start to know so well about the qualifications of a doctor?

358
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,990
If that's the case, then send him to another professor.

359
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,030
I don't like him.

360
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,530
He doesn't know enough, does he?

361
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,830
You're here, Vice President of Administration.

362
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,340
Since you're related, you should know very well

363
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,810
that it's not the only thing he lacks.

364
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,310
He is disagreeable and has got no propriety, manners, and humility.

365
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,750
He has so many flaws.

366
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,710
So please take care of him in the future, Professor Cha.

367
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,520
The future of our group is in your hands. Think it that way.

368
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,160
Didn't I tell you?

369
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
Dr. Go is the heir to our hospital.

370
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,990
But President didn't want to hand it over to him directly. So, he put forward a condition.

371
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,560
It's kind of a precondition of succession.

372
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,040
It means

373
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,270
that he's here for the certificate for inheriting the Group.

374
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,380
How did it go?

375
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,250
You are asking me?

376
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,450
Why the question?

377
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,820
I can't stand that kind of guy

378
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,360
walking around in front of me.

379
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,170
It smells good.

380
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,910
This is per…

381
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,950
What kind of doctor would wear perfume in the hospital?

382
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,260
Of course it's not for work time.

383
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,420
I want them to get rid of
the smell of disinfectant when dating after work.

384
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,030
Work-life balance.

385
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,790
Don't you understand?

386
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,130
Have you finished showing off your money?

387
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,400
Time to work.

388
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,130
Intern, Go Seung Tak.

389
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,500
What are you doing?

390
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,510
What about the ward inspection?

391
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,720
This is a 65-year-old patient.

392
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,120
She suffered from bicuspid aortic valve

393
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,350
and ascending aorta dilation.

394
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,160
She had the operation of ascending aortic replacement.

395
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,320
Since the extubation at 10 p.m. yesterday,

396
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,860
the day after the operation,

397
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,060
there has been no special problem.

398
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,600
Go Seung Tak.

399
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,930
Tell us about the bicuspid aortic valve.

400
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,440
Bicuspid aortic valve

401
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,370
is a kind of congenital heart disease

402
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,770
with an incidence rate of 1%.

403
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,840
Symptoms vary with ways of aortic dilation.

404
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,450
Young people may also suffer from AR.

405
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,450
According to Aging, it may develop into AS or large artery dilation.

406
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,920
He was famous at school.

407
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,050
Famous for what?

408
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,760
His theoretical knowledge is as rich as a professor.

409
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,660
So what?

410
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,060
He came first in any subject, in any test.

411
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,260
No one knows how he read so many theses.

412
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,170
At school, his tricky questions always got professors stumped.

413
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,440
It was said professors started to learn more because of him.

414
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,740
I heard that you took one-year off.

415
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Looks like that you worked hard.

416
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,610
Go Seung Tak, you take charge of this patient from now on.

417
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,610
What?

418
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,950
Go Seung Tak.

419
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,620
Tell us about Maze OP.

420
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,090
Maze OP

421
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,830
means an operation where arrhythmia transmission pathway which causes an abnormal heartbeat

422
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,930
is changed into normal cardiac conduction

423
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,040
with various of energy sources.

424
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,340
Good.

425
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,870
This patient is also yours.

426
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,980
Excuse me.

427
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,850
This patient's condition is unstable.

428
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,480
I have to continue…

429
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,710
Dr. An,

430
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,320
does a doctor treat patients by sitting at his table?

431
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Leave it to him.

432
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,300
Go Seung Tak.

433
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,870
What medicine can be used during an infectious endocarditis attack?

434
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,310
I don't know very well.

435
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,310
Really?

436
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,880
Vancomycin, gentamycin,

437
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,150
ampicillin, aminoglycosides or ciprofloxacin.

438
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,150
Just choose a suitable antibiotic accordingly.

439
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,350
Do it this way after the discussion with Infection Department.

440
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,060
Me?

441
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,090
Yeah.

442
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,660
Didn't Go Seung Tak say he didn't know?

443
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,140
Why always me?

444
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,640
Because you are my bro.

445
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,170
Hell!

446
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,780
Don't we check these patients over there?

447
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,150
Hey! Those patients…

448
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,860
Gim Jae Won.

449
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,130
Why are these patients still here?

450
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,230
Well…

451
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,330
Their guardians refuse to transfer them.

452
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,470
You think we have sufficient beds?

453
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,440
Ask them to transfer within this week.

454
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,570
Get it.

455
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,070
It turns out that giving up these patients

456
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,680
is right and wise for a doctor.

457
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,010
I learned a great lesson on my first day.

458
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,010
It's meaningful.

459
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,990
Go Seung Tak.

460
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,990
There are two categories of patients in the world.

461
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,860
Patients who can survive after my treatment

462
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,000
and patients who can't.

463
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,730
If my treatment doesn't work,

464
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,230
anyone else can't help them.

465
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,100
These patients fall into the second category.

466
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,140
Didn't you say I need to feed the hospital?

467
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,070
The more patients, the more earnings.

468
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,370
Isn't it the common sense?

469
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,840
How could we put effort into those patients

470
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,140
who have no hope for survival,

471
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,980
but give up those who can survive?

472
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,080
They don't live a good life.

473
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,320
I don't understand why they don't give up.

474
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,890
When time is up, they should let it go.

475
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,890
Shouldn't they?

476
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,300
How ominous!

477
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,140
Right? So ominous.

478
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,380
A doctor is already ominous.

479
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,280
And that genius...

480
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,480
People always say geniuses are crazy.

481
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,920
So, ignore what he said just now.

482
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,560
Don't take it seriously.

483
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,900
Have you eaten yet?

484
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
A little.

485
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,130
What's going on?

486
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,430
First, you graduated from the medical university.

487
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,900
And now, you became an intern.

488
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,830
Has your grandpa changed his mind?

489
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,270
Well, the President should be

490
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,170
more cautious.

491
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,040
How does an intern know

492
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,870
such important information?

493
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,940
He upgraded it. He asked me to take the certificate.

494
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,550
Yeah, it must be a big blow for you, isn't it?

495
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,880
Or, it's the destiny of an heir.

496
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,350
A kind of tough test.

497
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,820
I just take it as field inspection.

498
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,120
You actually chose the busiest Thoracic Surgery Department.

499
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,790
Isn't it cool? Heart.

500
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,360
I can't let the doctors who work for me look down upon me.

501
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,270
Since you are here, why not try hard?

502
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,970
Change that attitude first.

503
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,340
Su Jeong.

504
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,510
I have been enjoying special treatment and privilege for 28 years.

505
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,870
How should I change my attitude now?

506
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,580
People should indulge me.

507
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,780
What's more, I don't think it's necessary.

508
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,550
I won't be a doctor forever.

509
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,220
Do I have a proper reason to work hard?

510
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,190
Hello? Who's speaking?

511
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,720
Oh, specialist training doctor.

512
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,790
Operation?

513
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,190
Why must I be there?

514
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,130
I would very much like to go,

515
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,530
but I don't feel…

516
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,200
I haven't finished.

517
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,870
It's Professor Cha's operation.

518
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,110
Why do I have to be there?

519
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,840
Why are there so many people?

520
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,210
Professor Cha, your operation

521
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,110
is the best on-the-spot teaching, isn't it?

522
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,480
It's a rare opportunity to watch.

523
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,880
Moreover, they wouldn't want to miss such a rare case.

524
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,080
Doctors have operations every day. What's there to watch?

525
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,560
You fool around on your first day at work.

526
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,990
Put on your surgical gown and get back quickly.

527
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,840
Stand behind me. Be close.

528
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,840
Let's get started.

529
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,140
I guess that you have heard

530
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,280
this is the fifth operation of this patient.

531
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,310
Adhesion must be very serious.

532
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,480
We must be careful when opening the chest.

533
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,720
Here we go.

534
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Scalpel.

535
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,260
Aspirator.

536
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,670
Aspirator.

537
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,270
Electrotome.

538
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,350
Cutter.

539
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,260
Electrotome.

540
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,930
All right. Let's swap positions.

541
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,910
Pressure clamp.

542
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,750
Press down.

543
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,520
Hold it.

544
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,920
Insert the tube.

545
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,430
Cut.

546
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,860
Wire guider.

547
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,180
Cut.

548
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,150
OK, good.

549
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,960
Hello. This is Han Seung Won.

550
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,930
Receive our guests tonight, then.

551
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,260
Don't worry about it.

552
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,430
Now the major operation is over.

553
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,770
Start the esophageal ultrasound.

554
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,670
No bleeding from the aortic valve.

555
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,240
I mean, no after-suture bleeding.

556
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,710
The average pressure difference is less than 1.5.

557
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,040
No narrow blood vessels.

558
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,050
The operation is very successful.

559
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,090
Go Seung Tak.

560
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:20,020
Explain bio prosthetic aortic valve.

561
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,330
Bio prosthetic aortic valve

562
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,660
is a kind of valve

563
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,730
made of the cardiac membrane

564
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,230
or implanted valve.

565
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,600
But in the end it will get calcified.

566
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,870
Then its side effects may cause problems.

567
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,240
Okay, good.

568
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Very good.

569
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,410
Now we should pull out the tube.

570
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,380
You tie the knot.

571
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,380
Can you do that?

572
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,820
Come on.

573
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,730
Anyway,

574
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,040
on the first day of anatomy practice,

575
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,240
he was responsible for the abdominal incision.

576
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,490
What are you doing?

577
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:26,160
Don't you know how to do it?

578
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,520
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

579
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,630
I'm not doing it.

580
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,730
After that, he was often absent

581
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,930
with various reasons.

582
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,900
Go Seung Tak, are you…?

583
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Move.

584
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,590
I admire you so much, Professor.

585
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,860
Do you know who are the slowest

586
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,230
in improving speaking of English?

587
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,770
Those who get good grades at school.

588
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,110
They think good performance in tests

589
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,810
stands for good English.

590
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,640
But what's the use of 10 years' good grades?

591
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,810
You are a failure if you cannot speak English.

592
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,450
It's also true in medical skills.

593
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,820
If you only focus on books and theories,

594
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,420
you will become like this senior,

595
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,390
who knows a lot but can't use the scalpel.

596
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,760
You may be born rich. So what?

597
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,900
Your hands are unreliable.

598
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,070
Why not just say his name?

599
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,240
For a patient in a life-or-death situation,

600
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,340
between a bad-tempered but highly skilled doctor

601
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,440
and a cordial, kind but incompetent one,

602
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,410
who do you think he will choose?

603
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,350
The key to saving patients

604
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,620
lies not in here,

605
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,460
but here

606
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,630
and here.

607
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,429
Keep that in mind.

608
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,929
Doctors are not emotion suppliers.

609
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,130
Doctors are professionals with visible skills.

610
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:23,170
So, if you have no skills

611
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,480
and only want good grades and tags,

612
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,020
don't waste your time here.

613
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Over.

614
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,870
Your hands are unreliable, unreliable, unreliable.

615
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,610
My hands are golden, golden, golden.

616
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,750
I love golden hands.

617
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,350
You know what?

618
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,490
In others' eyes,

619
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,060
I'm a symbol of authority and admiration.

620
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,460
But a strange intern came today.

621
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,090
How dare he show off in front of me?

622
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,530
He thinks he's a prince?

623
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,170
Come on...

624
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,930
Terrible hands.

625
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,700
Cha Bun,

626
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,970
tell me.

627
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,210
Am I a right person he should mess up with?

628
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,270
Of course not.

629
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:35,010
So, I took him to the operating room,

630
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,180
and then mortified him hard.

631
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,420
Boy, how dare you work against me?

632
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,020
Your hands are so unreliable.

633
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,360
It's all right. I won, anyway.

634
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,630
I don't think that boy will come to work tomorrow.

635
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,300
If he comes,

636
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,340
I'll think of another strategy.

637
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,940
So, I'm thinking that

638
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,940
I can wear my new suit to work tomorrow.

639
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,950
Or I can buy a new car

640
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,320
after I pay the installments.

641
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,500
Good morning, Professor.

642
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,710
You came?

643
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,810
Of course, this is my workplace.

644
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,080
You are tougher than I thought.

645
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,610
That is the basic quality of an heir.

646
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,250
Are we standing too close

647
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,160
considering our social status?

648
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,730
Only the old stubborn cares about it very much.

649
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,760
Equality, justice and fairness are the zeitgeist.

650
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,660
Before learning the qualities of an heir,

651
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,200
why don't you pick up some doctor's qualities first?

652
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,300
For example, knot-tying.

653
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,000
Even a genius needs to be cultivated well.

654
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,070
I happen to be very talented in business.

655
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,470
Then talk to your grandpa.

656
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,340
Who knows?

657
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,040
Maybe he'll change his mind.

658
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,810
He is a fickle man.

659
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,210
I don't need to talk to him.

660
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,380
You go up first.

661
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,750
Why?

662
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,220
Are you asking me a question?

663
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,650
Do you think I'll answer you?

664
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,120
Are we very close?

665
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,390
But he has asked me so many.

666
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,890
Are you very close?

667
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,460
You scared me.

668
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,430
I get it. No discord, no concord.

669
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,300
Enemies become friends.

670
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,900
In the end, I'm the only victim.

671
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,840
What are you talking about?

672
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,240
Shall I buy you coffee?

673
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,510
I must be a bad guy in my previous life.

674
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,440
Hello.

675
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,810
A cup of coffee, please.

676
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,650
He's going to that place again.

677
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,320
Where? What place?

678
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,080
There is a place for him

679
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,990
to drink coffee alone and admire himself.

680
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,990
Thank you.

681
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,990
In my hospital,

682
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,490
there's some place I don't know?

683
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,330
Hey, you are asking for trouble.

684
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,570
Don't go there. He won't like it.

685
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,510
How are you doing?

686
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,010
It's been long.

687
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,320
Great, you look good.

688
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,790
It seems that you've also been drinking coffee here recently.

689
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,810
Hello, this is Cha Yeong Min.

690
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:33,880
I came to have coffee but came across an unexpected guest.

691
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,810
No, I'm coming now.

692
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,980
Because my mood for coffee is completely ruined.

693
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,820
We've seen it at yesterday's conference.

694
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,920
Well, the patient with cardiac sarcoma.

695
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,330
I didn't tell you that

696
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,860
it was President Jang Gwang Deok of Tianming Group

697
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,400
who was hospitalized here in secret yesterday.

698
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
As you know, President Jang is a public figure,

699
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,600
so, he was sent here in secret.

700
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,440
I hope you can understand, Professor Cha.

701
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,510
I've told you my suggestion yesterday.

702
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,140
Yeah, you did.

703
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,310
But his son wants a surgery to be done.

704
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,380
This is his son,

705
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,650
Vice President of Tianming Group.

706
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,410
(EunSang University Medical Center)
Vice President of Tianming Group.

707
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,380
(EunSang University Medical Center)

708
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,520
I'm Jang Min Ho.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

709
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,050
Yesterday you may not know who I am.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

710
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,920
Now that you know it today,
please reconsider your treatment plan.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

711
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,260
Now that you know it today,
please reconsider your treatment plan.

712
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,890
And be careful.

713
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,630
I'm my father's only son.

714
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,040
I can't let him go without even trying.

715
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:15,510
Professor Cha, you are the best thoracic surgeon.
I'm seriously asking you a favor.

716
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:20,020
Your father is an elderly patient with diabetes, hypertension and a history of stroke.

717
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,180
It's unlikely for him to make it through the surgery.

718
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,990
Even if he does make it,

719
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,720
it's hard to totally excise the tumors

720
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,520
deep in his left atrium and pulmonary vein.

721
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,760
As a result, he will have a relapse in three months.

722
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,300
It's difficult for him to live long.

723
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,830
But he won't live long either

724
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,200
without surgery, right?

725
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,440
Please, let me fulfill my filial piety as a son.

726
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,980
But I can't bring shame on myself

727
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,850
just to fulfill your filial piety.

728
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,030
Give me today's surgical schedule.

729
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,230
(Emergency Medical Center)
Give me today's surgical schedule.

730
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,530
Here.
(Emergency Medical Center)

731
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,770
(Emergency Medical Center)

732
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,540
Go Seung Tak.

733
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,700
Get out of my sight forever.

734
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,010
What?

735
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,410
People say that his foundation is weak

736
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,210
because of a short period of internship.

737
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,680
Then he should start from the emergency room.

738
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,020
What?

739
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,620
Not happy about that?

740
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,890
If so, go tell your grandpa.

741
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,220
Or you can go cry in front of your mother.

742
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,730
You heard him.

743
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,000
(Emergency Medical Center)
You heard him.

744
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,630
(Emergency Medical Center)

745
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,700
Why do I feel so much tension?

746
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,540
You made him mad again?

747
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,910
It was not me this time.

748
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,480
But what can I do in the Emergency Room?

749
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,980
What else can you do?

750
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,980
Pick up calls!

751
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,750
OK.

752
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,450
A call.

753
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,920
Hello, Secretary Gim.

754
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,550
Do you know who I am?

755
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,260
Has it been spread?

756
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:10,430
Who else can you be?

757
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,190
You are the doctor who can only talk.

758
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,000
It's nice to always be inquisitive to me.

759
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But there's a problem of time and place.

760
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,300
Who can compare with you?

761
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,800
You had better clear these up while I am speaking gently.

762
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,970
Why clear up?

763
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,610
Not at all, take them.

764
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,410
You know it's a famous brand, yeah?

765
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,110
This young man still has not waked up yet.

766
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,280
Sir.

767
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,880
Can I take charge of Dr. Go Seung Tak?

768
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,390
What? Yes, of course.

769
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,820
I guess it is OK.

770
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,520
Although… we are classmates in the student numbers,

771
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,960
but you're an intern now due to
frequent suspension of schooling.

772
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,060
Maybe you have not known that

773
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,560
there is a strict hierarchy in the hospital.

774
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,430
Follow me before I get angry.

775
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,700
You will be sorry.

776
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,170
What?

777
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,870
That hierarchy.

778
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,040
Ah, it hurts! It hurts!

779
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,010
It hurts!

780
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,850
Get out the way!

781
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,690
Sorry.

782
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,160
How dare you keep me waiting?

783
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,230
Do you know who I am?

784
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,770
Mr. Patient, do you know who I am?

785
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,770
You think you are funny? OK.

786
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,500
Get the Chief out, the Chief.

787
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,640
Get the Dean out, now!

788
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,610
My position is higher than all of them.

789
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,080
You can talk to me.

790
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,540
Are you kidding me?

791
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,150
Are you messing up with me, brat?

792
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,810
Are you messing up with me?

793
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,620
Brat, wet behind the ears.

794
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,690
Dad,
this is Professor Cha from Thoracic Surgery Department.

795
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,760
Hello.

796
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,460
I am Cha Yeong Min.

797
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,530
OK, Professor Cha.

798
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,470
I have heard that,

799
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,670
you are the best thoracic surgeon in Korea.

800
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,510
You flatter me.

801
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,900
This is my little daughter.

802
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,430
I am Jang Se Jin.

803
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:39,510
Actually, my daughter is a doctor, too.

804
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:46,220
She works in a famous hospital in Seattle, USA.

805
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:54,590
She came back from so far because I am ill.

806
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:01,000
Leaving such reliable son and daughter behind,

807
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,300
I feel complicated in heart.

808
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:14,140
My son said I can still receive a surgery.

809
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,220
I'd like to hear your honest opinion as an expert.

810
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,420
So I invited you to come here during busy work.

811
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,540
I heard your story.

812
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,310
You found your powerful biological father and changed your life.

813
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,010
You are more decisive than I imagined, Jang Se Jin.

814
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,350
Yeong Min,
you have become a doctor beyond my imagination.

815
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,420
It's not the time to clear the air
by asking how things are going.

816
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,120
What?

817
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,630
You also want me to operate on the President?

818
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,900
No.

819
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,500
It is the opposite.

820
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,000
I got the President's medical records before coming back.

821
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,700
I discussed with colleagues in the US.

822
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,480
I think your opinion should be
the same with me as a doctor.

823
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,880
I think it's better to let him enjoy the rest of his life

824
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,420
than to do a risky operation on him.

825
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,980
That's what's best for him.

826
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,620
Who said it was a risky operation?

827
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,920
If you're doing this because you hate me...

828
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,630
Jang Se Jin,

829
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,860
in your eyes,

830
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,130
am I still that intern 12 years ago?

831
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,540
What? Didn't he write a will?

832
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,210
Or do you feel unsatisfied with that will?

833
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,250
What do you want me to do?

834
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,280
Kill him?

835
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,790
Or save him?

836
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,630
I didn't expect you to become a doctor like this.

837
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,400
I need to talk to you.

838
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,200
I think today is our last chance.

839
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,730
Se Jin.

840
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,700
I will wait for you there.

841
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,680
Se Jin.

842
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,820
Gim Se Jin.

843
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,760
She went to America for further study.

844
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,530
She should be on the plane by now.

845
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,500
It is said that her biological father is a millionaire.

846
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,900
Her life has changed greatly.

847
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,640
Of course… a completely different life.

848
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,240
That must be the man she was dating.

849
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,670
You can tell immediately.

850
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,040
He has been dumped obviously.

851
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,980
Just a poor intern.

852
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,010
She may not even give a straight look at him now.

853
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,160
I didn't expect you to become a doctor like this.

854
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,170
No…

855
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,870
You will never understand

856
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,400
what kind of doctor I am now.

857
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,380
I am Cha Yeong Min.

858
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,060
Have you adjusted the operation schedule?

859
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,620
I have.

860
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,790
But… do you have to do this operation?

861
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,430
Don't worry.

862
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:26,660
It is hopeful with Auto Transplantation.

863
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,760
(Auto Transplantation)
It is hopeful with Auto Transplantation.

864
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,770
But we were supposed to have another surgery at that time.
(Auto Transplantation)

865
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,070
But we were supposed to have another surgery at that time.

866
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,200
That surgery wasn't an emergency.

867
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,740
It's okay to postpone it for a day or two.

868
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,810
This is a high-risk operation.

869
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,580
The likelihood of recurrence is high.

870
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,040
Professor, you would never do this kind of surgery before.

871
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,480
An Tae Hyeon,

872
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,780
how long have you been a specialist training doctor?

873
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,950
4 years.

874
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,350
I remember the appointments for professors
are reviewed in each March.

875
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:53,460
The review will begin soon.

876
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,260
The patient's son told me that

877
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,960
as long as I do this surgery,

878
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,030
a bright future is guaranteed for me.

879
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,300
Wouldn't it be nice if you could share in the glory?

880
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,370
That's why you worked for me

881
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,110
for so many years, isn't it?

882
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:19,780
Well, I'll go get ready.

883
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,420
Very good.

884
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:45,970
(EunSang University Medical Center)

885
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,510
Start the operation.

890

Pull gently!

894
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:39,790
If there's any bleeding because of you,

895
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,390
can you undertake the responsibility?

896
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,290
Focus!

897
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:45,490
OK, sorry…

898
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,290
I'll take care of it, you can take a rest.

899
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:16,120
How can I leave before the patient wakes up?

900
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,340
Who is it?

901
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:28,470
(I want to see you now, could you come out?
I will go back to America by air tomorrow morning.
There's something I really need to talk to you before I leave.
I will be waiting for you at the place we used to go a lot.)

902
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,910
I'll be back soon.

903
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,080

Call me if anything happens.

- Is there anyone in the car?
- Really?

- What should we do?
- Why hasn't the ambulance come yet?

There's so much blood.

908
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:09,980
It was that car that hit it from the side.

909

01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:29,160
Do you see the hematocele here?

997
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,100
It's a cardiac tamponade in the right ventricle.

998
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,300
A surgery is needed to plug it up.

999
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,170
Right here.

1000
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:34,740
You see that? Here.

1001
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,970
There's hematocele in the heart.

1002
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,470
It looks like a cardiac tamponade.

1003
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,280
We're gonna do surgery to find the rupture and plug it up.

1004
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,550
What are you waiting for? Send me to the operating room!

1005
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:44,980
O Su Jeong, come on, to the operating room.

1006
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,410
Yeah, to the operating room.

1007
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,150
Find someone who can do the surgery.

1008
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,850
Hurry up.

1009
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,860
What are they doing? Why aren't they here yet?

1010
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,030
90/110

1011
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,960
Yeah, it's fine.

1012
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,230
Hold on, Cha Yeong Min.

1013
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,540
You'll make it.

1014
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,740
Answer the phone.

1015
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,050
I'm going crazy.

1016
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,850
His blood pressure is falling.

1017
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:25,620
He will die if it goes on like this.

1018
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,360
Why is nobody coming?

1019
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,170
Please, just this once.

1020
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,100
Please.

1021
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,670
Please.

1022
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,410
Till now,

1023
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:51,650
I have saved so many lives with operations.

1024
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:57,120
Is it fair that no one in this operating room can save me?

1025
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,690
Him out of so many doctors! Why him!

1026
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,130
There's no time! Call the Emergency Room now!

1027
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,130
Hand me the scalpel.

1028
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,930
What are you doing?

1029
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,070
Don't tell me you...

1030
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:13,230
Just give me the scalpel.

1031
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:14,600
It is just your first year.

1032
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,940
What do you want to do?

1033
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,440
Didn't you just say he was going to die?

1034
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,440
Are we just gonna let him die?

1035
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,110
Go Seung Tak.

1036
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,750
There's no time. Give it to me.

1037
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,730
I can't take responsibility for that.

1038
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,600
What are you talking about?

1039
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,930
Dr. O, you have to stop him.

1040
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,600
He knows the theory, but he's awful with the scalpel.

1041
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,600
You're putting my life in the hands of a brat like him?

1042
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,170
His blood pressure went down again.

1043
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,310
If we wait any longer...

1044
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,310
Wait.

1045
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,720
Okay. I know you're trying to do something to save me.

1046
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,950
That's nice.

1047
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,620
But have you ever used a scalpel?

1048
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,960
Fine. I know there's no other way right now.

1049
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,030
Calm down.

1050
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:16,260
Just calm down and take a deep breath.

1051
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:20,340
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

1052
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,270
Good. I've been through this before.

1053
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:23,040
I know you're scared.

1054
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,740
You've never done it before. Of course you're scared.

1055
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,440
But you know…

1056
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,080
When I was an intern…

1057
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,010
I know you can do it too.

1058
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,510
Not everyone can do it, though.

1059
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,580
Anyway, I mean…

1060
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,150
You have to believe you can do it.

1061
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,450
Go through the procedure in your head first.

1062
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,990
Your theoretical knowledge is as rich as a professor!

1063
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,820
Not there, brat.

1064
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,890
Do you have a problem with me?

1065
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,790
Probably.

1066
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:49,260
But not now.

1067
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,500
Save me first.

1068
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,270
You can't take your revenge here.

1069
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:55,340
I told you not there!

1070
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:16,160
Dr. Go, what are you doing?

1071
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,860
Will you do it or not?

1072
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,410
What's going on?

1073
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:32,840
How is that possible...

1074
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,980
Ah-ah.

1075
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,950
Hey! Go Seung Tak!

1076
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,810
Let's start.

1077
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:11,010
O Su Jeong, come and be my assistant.

1078
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,680
Wake up!

1079
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,220
Come on!

1080
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,660
Drill!

1081
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:31,800
Saw!

1082
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,300
Retractor!

1083
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,170
My…

1084
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:06,030
My heart.

1085
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,640
-=Preview of the next episode=-

1086
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,370
Now, my hidden talent has been revealed.

1087
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,070
I can't even loaf on the job anymore.

1088
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:49,080
Doesn't he know what's happening to him?

1089
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Come with me.

1090
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,910
Come on. Go Seung Tak.

1091
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:53,310
Nurse Jeong, be careful!

1092
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:55,050
Nurse Jeong, can you be serious?

1093
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:57,490
Comatose ghosts can't possess.

1094
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,490
But you actually can...

1095
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:00,760
Dr. An, where's that guy?

1096
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,590
Who is this guy?

1097
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,060
My surgery was perfect.

1098
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,630
I bet you took the oath before you joined Thoracic Surgery Department.

1099
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:07,400
When you took up the scalpel in the operating room that day,

1100
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,070
you weren't trying to save me, but to kill me!
