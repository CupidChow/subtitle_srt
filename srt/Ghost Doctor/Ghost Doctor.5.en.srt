00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,080
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,320
(Emergency Medical Center)

3
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,220
Yes, dad.

4
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,760
No, not yet.

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,490
It'll still take some time.

6
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,340
No! No! Don't!

7
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,700
Can… Can you see me?

8
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,210
Yes. I can see you.

9
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,980
The patient's blood pressure keeps dropping.

10
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,380
Dr. Go, what should we do?

11
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,660
Then let's get it started.

12
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,780
Why did they let him do it?

13
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,680
Is Dr. An out of his mind?

14
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,690
Hurry! The blood pressure is dropping!

15
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,860
Dr. Go, what's your instruction?

16
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,090
Gosh, the patient's heart will stop beating at this rate!

17
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,830
Oh, no. We can't make that happen.

18
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,270
Go Seung Tak, please leave.

19
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,970
You can leave.

20
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,079
Lee Seon Ho, you'll be the first assistant.

21
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,850
What are you going to do?

22
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,480
You are lucky that we are in the operating room.

23
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,990
Get out of my sight right now!

24
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,590
There's no way I'd leave the patient to you.

25
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,290
Lee Seon Ho, didn't you hear me?

26
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,630
Hey, you…

27
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,800
Dr. An Tae Hyeon.

28
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,040
Do you think you are qualified enough to operate on the patient?

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,079
Don't you see that a life is in danger?

30
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,840
Get out!

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,740
What are you two doing?

32
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,780
Are you trying to make the patient die?

33
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,000
We have no time! Let's begin.

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,010
Scalpel.

35
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,980
Electrotome.

36
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,720
What are you waiting for? Why don't you open the chest?

37
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,630
Give me the scissors.

38
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,000
The drill, please.

39
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,320
Suction.

40
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,020
Lee Seon Ho, suction.

41
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
Suction.

42
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,680
You should've been the one who operates.

43
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,180
Why are you lying here?

44
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,350
How much longer are you going to stay like this?

45
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,740
I heard they let Go Seung Tak operate on a patient for cardiac tamponade.

46
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,000
He's doing it right now.

47
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Dr. Go?

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,610
If it's cardiac tamponade…

49
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,080
Yes. Same as the operation Professor Cha received.

50
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,950
It was right in the middle of the operation when he…

51
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,450
Anyway, it's not like we don't have other surgeons.

52
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,450
How could they let a new doctor

53
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,320
conduct such a difficult operation?

54
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,760
What are they thinking?

55
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,030
What shall we do, Dr. Go?

56
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,040
Cut.

57
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,480
Cut.

58
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,980
Dr. Lee will stitch the patient back up.

59
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,659
As you asked, I saved the patient.

60
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,690
I've left the rest to the others. Follow me out.

61
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,000
Hey, stop.

62
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,270
Go Seung Tak, come here!

63
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,510
Go Seung Tak.

64
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,510
You brat.

65
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
It's only his first year. Is that possible?

66
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,860
No. It's not. Absolutely not.

67
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,260
New doctors may be able to perform cannulation.

68
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,960
(Cannulation is a technique in which a cannula is placed inside a vein)
New doctors may be able to perform cannulation.

69
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,970
And they may even make mistakes doing that.
(Cannulation is a technique in which a cannula is placed inside a vein)

70
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,530
And they may even make mistakes doing that.

71
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,640
Has this ever happened before?

72
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,540
Oh, yes, once.

73
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,110
When Professor Cha was still an intern.

74
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,570
Yeah, that's right.

75
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,440
It's true. It was big news back then.

76
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,310
Even so, how did it…?

77
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,050
Go Seung Tak, I know you can see me!

78
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,260
Why are you pretending you can't again?

79
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,120
You can see me, can't you?

80
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,490
You can see me. You can see my hand, can't you?

81
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,830
Tell me! Tell me! Hey, you can see me, right?

82
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,559
On the ceiling two meters away from here.

83
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,799
Are you crazy?

84
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,570
Why are you worried about the camera?

85
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,070
You can see me, can't you?

86
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,780
Do you remember here?

87
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,850
The place where someone's body usually gets possessed

88
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,720
in those horror-themed shows?

89
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,060
Since when did you…

90
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,960
Since when did you see me?

91
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,630
About that…

92
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,600
It started from that place and that moment on that day.

93
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,430
So for all this time…

94
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,830
Then why didn't you tell me?

95
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,140
Why did you pretend that you couldn't see me?

96
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,340
"I'm a ghost now. Can you see me?"

97
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
You never asked that before.

98
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,240
Why would I tell for no reason?

99
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,070
You can only see me,

100
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,440
or you can see the others, too?

101
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,920
Can they see us today?

102
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,860
Gee, they ignored us again.

103
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,360
That's what they always do, isn't it?

104
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,970
What else do you expect?

105
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,770
Are their lives that lovely?

106
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,040
I don't understand why they won't just give up.

107
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,400
Just let go when the time is coming.

108
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,710
Am I right?

109
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,080
Hey! Hey!

110
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Unbelievable! He's so rude!

111
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,980
Come on. Be cool.

112
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,510
Let me go. I'll kill him.

113
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,510
Don't be like that.

114
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,320
I was almost possessed by several devils because of you.

115
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
When I think back on that moment, it was so…

116
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
You are isolated lately, aren't you?

117
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,360
You should've done a better job.

118
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,430
So even before that you could…

119
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,870
You've always been able to…

120
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,640
When did it start?

121
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,740
Let's put it this way. You are the 250th devil I've seen.

122
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,770
Hey, don't call me devil.

123
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,040
Ghost. Call me ghost. Ghost.

124
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,050
No. I have the right to choose what to call you.

125
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,810
Why should I call you ghost instead of devil?

126
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,580
Whatever. Then since when did you start seeing devils?

127
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,390
D-Devils, no, I mean ghosts.

128
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,750
I don't have to tell you my secrets.

129
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,160
Wait a sec.

130
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,720
You've been giving me short responses.

131
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,260
How dare you talk to a professor like that?

132
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,730
Is that even important at this point?

133
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,500
It's not. What matters is why you confess now.

134
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Why don't you keep pretending?

135
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,470
I told you, I wanted to save the patient.

136
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,570
After all, I'm not the type who'd give up on others' lives.

137
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,770
Oh, because you are not that type.

138
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,070
Is that why you've been using me?

139
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,140
Why did you do it since you knew?

140
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,140
You were free and you had nothing to do anyway.

141
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,080
I did it for your good.

142
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,150
Really? Really?

143
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,510
You did it because you were worried that I'd be bored?

144
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,780
You are such a special young man, aren't you?

145
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,520
You think I'd feel touched by that?

146
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,950
I know what you are up to!

147
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,420
So what? You think you know me well?

148
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,820
Hold on.

149
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,190
Then you went to my home… because…

150
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,700
Oh, about that.

151
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,060
You kept saying, "My kid, my kid."

152
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,400
So I wondered if you really had a kid.

153
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,300
Feel good?

154
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,470
My kid is still alone at home without anything to eat.

155
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,080
Bun, we'd better die together.

156
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,210
I'm not taking my kid. I'll take you with me.

157
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,350
Come here, Go Seung Tak.

158
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,820
Come here.

159
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,120
I didn't want to see you depressed, so I provoked you that day on purpose.

160
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,990
And then you jumped at me and wanted to die together.

161
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,290
Sir,

162
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,030
do you know Professor Cha Yeong Min's home address?

163
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,700
Oh, that's why I haven't seen him for so long.

164
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,730
You are his student, right?

165
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,770
Then please help him pack if you need anything.

166
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,470
And please lock the door when you leave.

167
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,960
I thought a famous doctor like him would be filthy rich and spend money like water.

168
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,090
His apartment is quite simple actually.

169
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,040
As it turns out,

170
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,480
the "kid" he talked about… is this thing.

171
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
My kid…

172
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,450
Is he dead?

173
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,280
The "kid" is a tough creature.

174
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,450
I didn't know that I'd become a lifesaver for you and your kid.

175
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,290
That's great.

176
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,290
So where's my kid?

177
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,050
Where did you put him?

178
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,020
Wow, this is how it feels when you rescue someone from drowning, the first thing he asks for is his bag.

179
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,530
How about you? Where did you put my "kid"?

180
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,760
Are you asking me?

181
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,800
You think I'd answer you?

182
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,300
Are we that close?

183
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,770
You jerk, haven't you asked me over 100 questions?

184
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,300
You jerk?

185
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,740
Hey, brat, don't take my patience for granted.

186
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,240
Then let's talk about it. I've put up with you for a long time.

187
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,570
Am I your son?

188
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,870
Why do you keep calling me brat?

189
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,740
What about you?

190
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,840
Who asked him to get into an accident?

191
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,940
It's his fate to end up like that.

192
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,210
I have got to punch you to make you shut up.

193
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,850
Wow, you are shifting the blame onto me now.

194
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,050
Who should be angry now?

195
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,480
You came into my body without my consent.

196
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,020
Hey, you think I wanted to do that?

197
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,450
I was so reluctant to…

198
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,920
I had no choice but to pick an ill-mannered person like you

199
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,020
to lodge my noble soul…

200
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,090
Do you think I'm happy about that?

201
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,090
I almost beat myself!

202
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,860
Your bloody body is not so good.

203
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,600
You can't even move your fingers flexibly.

204
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,070
All you can do is talking glibly.

205
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,430
I can at least talk as I like.

206
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,340
You can't even open your eyes.

207
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,270
How could you… say that to me?

208
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,340
Hey!

209
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,680
I won't get into your body again even if I have to die.

210
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,440
I don't need your body, you brat!

211
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,550
Any ghost can get into my body except you.

212
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,480
Don't you dare get into my body again.

213
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,550
If you get into my body again, I'll eat your soul.

214
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,380
You brat.

215
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,750
You talk to me rudely all along.

216
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,520
You jerk.

217
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,260
How could you be so rude to your professor flagrantly?

218
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,360
Gosh, he just doesn't change,

219
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,100
even as a ghost.

220
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,070
He is out of danger for now.

221
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,330
His surgery went smoothly.

222
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,000
Doctor, is my husband alright?

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,300
Thank you.

224
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,240
Doctor, thank you so much.

225
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,880
-Your dad is fine, Chae Hee.
-Really?

226
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,110
Yes.

227
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,480
Thank you, doctor.

228
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Thank you.

229
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,480
That brat.

230
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,350
He fooled me like that.

231
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,290
And he talked back to me sputteringly.

232
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,690
Wait.

233
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,960
He asked me, a professor, to intubate for him.

234
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Well, should I worry about other people's lives now?

235
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,890
(EunSang University Medical Center)
Well, should I worry about other people's lives now?

236
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,000
(EunSang University Medical Center)

237
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,210
Hello.

238
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,970
He seems to be the patient whom Dr. Go Seung Tak operated on.

239
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,740
It's said that the operation went perfectly.

240
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,010
How did he manage to do that?

241
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,680
Yes.

242
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,250
He is only a first-year doctor here. It's incredible.

243
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,720
He performed the operation, didn't he?

244
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,420
Yes, he did.

245
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,490
-Did he?
-Well, he did.

246
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,730
To be honest, I knew Go Seung Tak was talented when he was a student.

247
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,670
It seems that he is not just book-smart like a professor.

248
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,840
Where did he work as an intern?

249
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,770
The blood pressure is normal and so is the heart rate.

250
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,570
How about the urine output?

251
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,980
How much urine?

252
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,010
It's 200cc.

253
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,110
Good.

254
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,280
Did you get the ABGA results?

255
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,010
(ABGA Arterial Blood Gas Analysis)
Did you get the ABGA results?

256
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,420
Did he receive private tutoring at some other hospital?
(ABGA Arterial Blood Gas Analysis)

257
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,180
Did he receive private tutoring at some other hospital?

258
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,320
Right! He ever studied in America.

259
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,450
That must be the reason.

260
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,550
The ABGA results, you brats.

261
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,390
Go check whether the ABGA results are out.

262
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,560
You know, in the movie "The Bourne Identity",

263
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,930
Matt Damon accepts special training secretly

264
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,000
to become an excellent secret agent.

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,930
Great.

266
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,570
The patient will be fine.

267
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,630
Good.

268
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,340
Check his conscious state every hour.

269
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,170
So obviously,

270
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,840
Go Seung Tak must have been taught by the world's top surgeon in private

271
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,710
while he was studying abroad.

272
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,910
Then he became a highly skilled doctor.

273
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,210
Wait.

274
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,220
Then why did he fail during Professor Cha's surgery?

275
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,820
Hey, Surgeon Go.

276
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,760
Why are you pulling a long face?

277
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,230
You think I'm here to see you? I am here to check on the patient.

278
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,230
His blood pressure, heart rate and urine output are all good.

279
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,960
His ABGA results are also good.

280
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,070
What are you waiting for?

281
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,740
You have to give instructions. You are the surgeon.

282
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,670
Why are you looking at me?

283
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,080
Wh-wh-what? Do you think I'll tell you when you look at me?

284
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,050
Are we on good terms?

285
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,780
I have talked with his family.

286
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:43,980
(Operation Record)
I have talked with his family.

287
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,820
You should write the Operation Record.
(Operation Record)

288
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,520
Oh, the Operation Record.

289
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,790
You don't know how to write it?

290
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,920
Hey, how can you expect him to know that?

291
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,790
He is Go Seung Tak.

292
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,490
I am afraid he has never seen it.

293
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,069
The chief ordered that before the patient comes round, the surgeon must stay with him.

294
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,569
I guess you know why.

295
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,020
You should feel lucky that we're in the operating room. Now get out of my face.

296
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,849
I can't trust you with the patient.

297
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,950
Dr. An Tae Hyeon,

298
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,560
do you think you are qualified to treat the patient?

299
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,060
Dr. An,

300
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,930
are you insane?

301
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,960
What exactly were you thinking? How could you let Go Seung Tak perform the operation?

302
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,700
Sorry.

303
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,900
Since the thing has happened, it's useless saying more.

304
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,600
You'd better ensure this surgery will succeed.

305
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,740
What?

306
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,310
You are lucky that the patient is still alive.

307
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,440
There were other doctors available at our hospital at that time.

308
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,380
Do you know it'll be a big problem if people find out the operation was performed by a resident?

309
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,450
We had already attracted criticism before for performing operation by residents.

310
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,820
You think you will the only one who will be ruined?

311
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,850
No. All of us will be ruined.

312
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,290
I got it,

313
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,420
sir.

314
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,660
Anyway,

315
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,960
about Go Seung Tak,

316
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,160
did you find anything strange?

317
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,590
What?

318
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,030
What do you mean?

319
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,100
Er,

320
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,730
nothing,

321
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,230
nothing.

322
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,100
Well, he performed the operation successfully, which is suspicious.

323
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,000
Wait.

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,640
Does this suggest that

325
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,440
he is a genius?

326
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,080
It's only… because he is a genius?

327
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
How could he become a genius overnight?

328
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,580
He was obviously not a genius when he was an intern.

329
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,180
He changed suddenly.

330
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,450
He changed into a genius suddenly?

331
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900
This is Vice President of Administration.

332
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,240
Has the operation in Operating Room 7 just now been recorded?

333
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,340
Send me the full video immediately.

334
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,090
Hey, if you are still here, save him, please.

335
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,390
Since when?

336
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,660
When did you start to see me?

337
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,360
Well,

338
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,660
it just started at that moment on that day

339
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
in that place.

340
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,570
I feel uncomfortable when you are here. Could you leave?

341
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,270
My patient is lying here. How can I leave?

342
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,300
If you don't want to be here, you can leave.

343
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,110
Didn't you hear they called me the surgeon?

344
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,970
I performed the operation.

345
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,740
You did it with my hands.

346
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,080
You even didn't dare to hold the scalpel. How can you boast about it?

347
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,280
What is the use of your nimble fingers? You can't even touch the patient.

348
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,410
You brat, why must you touch my sore spot?

349
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,850
I have to destroy your tongue with my punches. Damn!

350
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,150
Sir,

351
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,150
are you awake?

352
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,190
Start with obeying command. The patient's name.

353
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,020
(Obey command: To determine the patient's ability to obey a command of a doctor.)
Start with obeying command. The patient's name.

354
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,860
Mr. Moon Suk Joo.
(Obey command: To determine the patient's ability to obey a command of a doctor.)

355
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,960
Blink for yes.

356
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,730
Blink if you want to say yes.

357
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,390
He is conscious.

358
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,530
Next, motor check.

359
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,090
(Motor check: To check if motor function is intact.)
Next, motor check.

360
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,130
Start with the left hand.
(Motor check: To check if motor function is intact.)

361
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,230
Try moving your left hand.
(Motor check: To check if motor function is intact.)

362
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,130
Try moving your left hand.

363
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,570
Move your right hand.

364
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,300
-Very good. Next…
-Your daughter.

365
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,870
Do you remember the name of your daughter?

366
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,980
If you remember, nod your head please.

367
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,550
Your family is fine.

368
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,150
Don't worry about them.

369
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,890
Chae Hee really looks like you.

370
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,500
Are you alright?

371
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,370
Are you awake?

372
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,870
Dad.

373
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,110
Dad, are you alright?

374
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,340
Your dad said he was fine.

375
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,600
When did he ever care so much about the patient?

376
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,840
Did he perform the operation?

377
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
No. I did it.

378
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,600
Sorry.

379
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,470
I had to do that under the circumstance today.

380
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,300
I'll be careful from now on.

381
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,670
Yeong Min,

382
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:38,410
I heard Dr. Go performed the operation smoothly today.

383
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,610
He made it all the way through this time. He did a good job.

384
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,180
As a young doctor, he is very impressive, right?

385
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,160
Why didn't he do so well when he operated on you?

386
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,590
Exactly.

387
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,830
However,

388
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,000
what is your relationship with Dr. Go?

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,840
Dr. Go said that you two disliked each other,

390
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
but his behavior didn't seem to prove that.

391
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,680
Really?

392
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,050
He is really an odd person.

393
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,620
He is a total oddball.

394
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,350
From today onward, I will work with you.

395
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,190
I am a resident

396
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,930
and my name is Go Seung Tak.

397
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,500
Let's… save the patient first.

398
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,330
Cha Yeong Min.

399
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,700
Since when did you start seeing devils?

400
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,330
D-Devils, no, I mean ghosts.

401
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,970
I don't have to tell you my secrets.

402
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,270
What did that guy go through?

403
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,820
You came back, my son.

404
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,390
Did you take the taxi?

405
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,250
What about your car?

406
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,220
Eh,

407
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,390
I thought driving was too tiring,

408
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,620
so I left it at the medical center parking lot.

409
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,820
What's the matter?

410
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,460
Did something happen?

411
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,400
Nothing, I just feel my mom is so beautiful today.

412
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,700
Seung Tak.

413
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,770
Dad.

414
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:57,650
Dad.

415
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,060
I've heard that the patient has a daughter.

416
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,860
Yes, President.

417
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
He has a seven-year-old daughter.

418
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,930
Fortunately, the child was not injured and is safe and sound.

419
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,030
Her dad regained consciousness, thank goodness.

420
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,100
Seung Tak did a great job on the operation.

421
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,940
Right now the patient's state is good, too.

422
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,550
The room is not cleaned.

423
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,920
Well, no,

424
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,420
it's not like I wanted to do it yesterday,

425
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,690
but I had to.

426
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,960
The patient was in danger,

427
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,700
and I could not leave him to An Tae Hyeon and that guy.

428
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,500
Jeo.

429
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,070
What's the matter?

430
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,670
Where does the mosquito come from?

431
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,710
Die.

432
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,120
What do those guys want? Really.

433
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,500
Nice scenery here.

434
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
What are you?

435
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,930
Why do you come here?

436
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,670
Doctor Go, what's the matter?

437
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,610
I received this yesterday.

438
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,110
Illegal parking.

439
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,250
In the area dedicated to firefighting facilities.

440
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,480
Thanks to you, my fine is like...

441
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,710
Oh, sorry.

442
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,980
It's too dark, I couldn't see clearly.

443
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,880
The white car and blue car were parked neatly together.

444
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,090
Thanks to you, my fine is like...

445
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,450
Wait a second, what's this?

446
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,550
What does that mean?

447
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,660
Cha Yeong Min is an arrogant and selfish man.

448
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,630
He lacks empathy,

449
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,400
like this, and he also lacks moral concept.

450
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,800
It's good nothing happened.

451
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,070
If there's a fire, it'll be a big problem.

452
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,770
Fire.

453
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,200
Hey.

454
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,840
I know. You talk to me about it.

455
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,670
Let's talk alone.

456
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,570
It's still not late, you should think carefully.

457
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,210
Does he deserve your

458
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,510
excellent strength, good character,

459
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,980
and precious time?

460
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,680
Then farewell.

461
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,080
Come here.

462
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,110
You uneducated...

463
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,950
You come here.

464
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,020
Go Seung Tak.

465
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,150
What is he talking about?

466
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,820
Go Seung Tak.

467
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,790
What just happened?

468
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,590
This guy is so weird.

469
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,130
You,

470
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,100
how dare you scold me behind my back

471
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,360
in front of my face?

472
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,700
How can somebody scold you both in front of your face

473
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,870
and behind your back?

474
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,570
And, what about moral concept?

475
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,600
Because I became like this,

476
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,570
you think me, a professor, is hilarious, right?

477
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,670
Professor, before you became like this,

478
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,070
I didn't treat you seriously, either.

479
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,440
It's not news.

480
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,410
Of course people make mistakes.

481
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,550
I really didn't know that, and there's no fire.

482
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,220
It's fortunately to have no fire, and you found the cars because of it.

483
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,120
That's great, think about it that way.

484
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,820
One way or another, I found your baby back.

485
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,550
Take my baby to me.

486
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,560
Two cars parked at dedicated area for firefighting facilities.

487
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,320
The total fine is 1 million won.

488
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,190
Noted. Take my baby to me.

489
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,430
If you want your baby, pay first.

490
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,060
Wow, how can you

491
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,200
use my baby as hostage?

492
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,270
Hey, how can I pay?

493
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,700
Are you Doctor Go Seung Tak?

494
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,840
I'll call you later.

495
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,210
What's the matter?

496
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,150
I'm a journalist from the medical column of Civilian News.

497
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,350
I want to know the details of the surgery you did yesterday.

498
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,020
I heard that you performed the operation alone under an impossible circumstance,

499
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,860
and saved the patient miraculously.

500
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
Is that true?

501
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,560
The new resident physician in Thoracic Surgery Department, EunSang University Medical Center,

502
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,930
performed heart surgery alone on a patient who had a traffic accident

503
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,660
and attracted attention.

504
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,770
A single operation that even the senior resident physician has never done before.

505
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,030
Go Seung Tak actually...

506
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,840
When the physician in charge

507
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,080
suffered pain from a wrist injury, the operation could not be carried out,

508
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,440
in such a crisis,

509
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,250
like he was possessed by a divinity, Doctor Go Seung Tak exerted his hidden power,

510
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,020
and saved the life of the dying patient.

511
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,250
Who is it?

512
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,790
Why did he perform the surgery with a hurt wrist?

513
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,190
We found out that at that moment, Doctor Go Seung Tak couldn't abandon the patient

514
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,830
for a special secret.

515
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,730
Do you know anything?

516
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,860
What?

517
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,370
No, I don't know.

518
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,970
The strength and ability of the young doctor is worthy of praise.

519
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,070
He's the hero of this era,

520
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,440
and the hero in the operating room.

521
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,310
Fighting.

522
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,480
It wasn't easy for me to silence the operating room staff.

523
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,680
What happened?

524
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,750
For this situation, I don't know who it is,

525
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,750
but the finishing touches are very well done.

526
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,920
Well, could it be the Chief?

527
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,520
Is this your work?

528
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,520
Good things need to be widely publicized.

529
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,130
I'm here to do all this stuff.

530
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,130
God.

531
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,430
You colluded with others against him before,

532
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,960
why are you making him look good now?

533
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,970
It is not a good thing to widely publicize this matter, right?

534
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,430
Recently, many problems pop up like

535
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,840
unqualified doctors perform surgery on other's behalf, don't you know it?

536
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,970
Those are unqualified people, but you are qualified.

537
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,440
My little brother's skill on making people surprised

538
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,040
is getting better and better.

539
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,780
Portrait rights and infringement of personal privacy,

540
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,880
where should these be reported?

541
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,250
Personal privacy,

542
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,720
you mean personal secret. This,

543
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,520
we didn't explain carefully.

544
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,730
It's not like you can cover a thing like this.

545
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,260
Sooner or later it will be made public,

546
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,030
I just made the first move

547
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,260
so that I could make you look really good.

548
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,270
Professor Cha is in a state like that,

549
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,000
and we need a new cover star.

550
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,140
Unbelievable.

551
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,710
Calm down. Three times one is three, three times two is six.

552
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,840
Right? Three...

553
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,340
I am a resident physician

554
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,940
in my first year.

555
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,650
But why did you want to do that?

556
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,680
I've heard that it was you who stepped forward to do the surgery.

557
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,550
This guy is really...

558
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,490
Hey, what sin does he have?

559
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,950
If they had transferred away the patient,

560
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,160
then he might have lost his life on the way.

561
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,890
The situation was so urgent. He just wanted to save the patient.

562
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,060
Since these are mentioned, let me ask you,

563
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,300
did you learn the skill somewhere else?

564
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,600
MBA doesn't offer medical internship.

565
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,370
MBA, really?

566
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,600
Your grandpa found out that you were skipping school and playing around,

567
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,440
and then forced you to go back. I know about all these.

568
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,880
Say, you really learned something nice.

569
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,120
These masters are so...

570
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,960
Hello, Mom.

571
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,030
Hello, Chairman Go.

572
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,230
I'm startled.

573
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,300
About that?

574
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,670
No, I'm just letting him be the hero for now.

575
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,000
I just paved the way for him.

576
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,440
My son,

577
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,170
is that report true?

578
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,180
Is that you who saved the patient in crisis?

579
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,540
It seems to be him.

580
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,450
How handsome!

581
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,550
It seems to be right.

582
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,650
Gee, my son is so cool.

583
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,090
I've heard that you did it from the beginning till the end.

584
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,390
And the patient woke up safely.

585
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,460
My son is a genius.

586
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,930
I don't think that's right.

587
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,960
Well, Mom.

588
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
I'm a bit busy,

589
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,070
can we talk later?

590
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,970
Why not?

591
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,570
My genius son,

592
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,140
when will you get home?

593
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,470
So?

594
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,640
Why are you holding him so high?

595
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,510
The higher he is now, the more miserable he'll be when he falls, right?

596
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,320
A lot of people are paying attention. That can be deadly.

597
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,220
Don't worry.

598
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,030
That guy can never get the specialist qualification certificate.

599
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,400
You came.

600
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,010
Thank you.

601
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,320
Tak is indeed a character.

602
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,950
He gets the attention wherever he goes.

603
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,020
Vice President Han is so powerful.

604
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,060
He just moved his fingers,

605
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,160
and he packed him like this.

606
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,460
At least he's going to do that, right?

607
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,400
Not to mention the younger brother who will lead the consortium in the future.

608
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,100
You don't know how grateful I am

609
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,040
to have such a reliable big brother for my Seung Tak.

610
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,240
My old lady must feel at ease.

611
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,410
She has two reliable grandsons

612
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,510
staying in the hospital.

613
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,220
I'm in this state,

614
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,360
but your life is hard, too.

615
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,260
Being besieged on all sides. Being besieged on all sides. Ah...

616
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,100
Well...

617
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,330
Let's find a quiet place to talk.

618
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,400
We don't want to rob you,

619
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,870
right, my children?

620
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,040
Go there and don't play tricks.

621
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,179
Go where?

622
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,360
Hey, my little patient.

623
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,130
What's the matter? What are you doing?

624
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,139
I'm playing hide-and-seek.

625
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,440
With whom?

626
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,610
With my mom.

627
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,810
You go that way.

628
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,610
Do you think it's OK to hide like this?

629
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,980
And you cannot wander around.

630
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,910
Hurry and go to your ward.

631
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,180
Go away.

632
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,460
I want to hide, too.

633
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
To bury my head.

634
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,730
Go Seung Tak, here you come.

635
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,300
I want to ask you something.

636
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,230
About yesterday...

637
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,670
It was not me.

638
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,400
What? Who would it be if it's not you?

639
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,270
Don't you watch the news? I was possessed.

640
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,110
Really?

641
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,410
It wouldn't happen again.

642
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,350
Everything will be back to normal.

643
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,880
How can you know if things like that would not happen again?

644
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,580
I made a deal with that ghost.

645
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,290
Really?

646
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,620
Doctor, please do the operation for my Seung Jo.

647
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,330
If he doesn't receive the treatment, he will die.

648
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,800
Seung Jo's guardian is asking if they have to leave the hospital tomorrow.

649
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,160
Do they have to leave?

650
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
What else? We don't have any doctor who can do the surgery.

651
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,570
Isn't it true that the right ventricular catheter just needs to be replaced?

652
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,840
Is it that hard?

653
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,500
Yes, it is.

654
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:01,940
Because he also needs the CABG.

655
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,010
(CABG: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery)
Because he also needs the CABG.

656
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,510
The operation is difficult, and this is not his patient.

657
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,550
What if he touches a wrong place, and something happens to the child?

658
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,550
Then he will have to take full responsibility.

659
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,850
Doctor, please.

660
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,980
We have nowhere else to go.

661
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,590
Are doctors always like this?

662
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,820
Sometimes.

663
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,230
I am worried that if any other hospital can find a qualified doctor.

664
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,760
Why?

665
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,560
The operation fee.

666
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,300
Originally, our hospital wanted to reimburse her in full for the treatment and hospitalization expenses.

667
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,300
The donations from Professor Cha's surgery on the wealthy

668
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,710
are in the hospital.

669
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,880
There really is something I don't know about this hospital.

670
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,650
It exists. It's the money only Professor Cha Yeong Min can spend.

671
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,750
Professor Cha seems harsh,

672
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,020
but sometimes he surprises people.

673
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,790
Especially when he ignored those things requested by superiors

674
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,860
and powerful people.

675
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,330
Wow, he's handsome when he does that.

676
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,730
Requests?

677
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,870
Well, what are your requests for me?

678
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,840
Nothing special.

679
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,040
Go to the Yeong Deung Po underground commercial street,

680
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,980
and find the walnut biscuit stall.

681
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,580
Please, I want to taste it.

682
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,510
Find me a movie DVD.

683
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,880
I want to read a book,

684
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,090
but only one library has that copy.

685
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,460
Gee, how can I get any of those?

686
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,320
Don't you know?

687
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,490
We are in the same state.

688
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,360
Wow, it's the same.

689
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,530
Come on, Professor Cha, you have the method.

690
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,270
Like, with a beep.

691
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,830
So what you mean is that

692
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,440
let me turn to that guy?

693
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,940
Who has the same state with whom? See?

694
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,570
I knew he would be like this.

695
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,740
Why should we expect such an uneducated person?

696
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,910
Hey, who are you pointing at?

697
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,580
Come back! How old are you? How old is he?

698
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,750
Come on, Professor Cha.

699
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,880
You even have saved a life in that way.

700
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,990
Stop pretending. Think about it.

701
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,990
Otherwise, you'll have a hard time here.

702
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,790
Tell us whatever you want to eat.

703
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,200
Not just Seung Jo's, maybe all the appointments of Professor Cha

704
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,470
will have to be canceled one by one.

705
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,040
Alas, what a big loss it is to lose a professor!

706
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,910
The patient with cardiac tamponade is better

707
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,480
and has been transferred to the general ward.

708
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,750
The wound needs to be treated.

709
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,780
What to do? Will I take care of it, too?

710
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,220
Ugh, how could he order Lee Seon Ho about at that time?

711
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,630
Really so muddleheaded?

712
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,460
Found you!

713
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,400
How did you find me?

714
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
Because my eyes are so big.

715
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,940
Wow.

716
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,770
What do we do now?

717
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,340
Well, what do you want to do?

718
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,280
Seung Jo is not her own son.

719
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,550
It's said that she adopted him as a baby.

720
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,110
But the kid has been ill for long.

721
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,020
The family couldn't afford surgery and hospitalization.

722
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,520
So the father wanted to send the child back.

723
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,020
But the mother insisted on keeping him.

724
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,190
Finally, they got divorced and she's been raising the kid alone ever since.

725
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,230
Do you want to play finger games?

726
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,800
Sure.

727
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,200
Thank you, doctor.

728
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,570
Uh?

729
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,540
Oh.

730
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,540
Thank you, doctor.

731
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,380
We just knew that you were the one who did the operation yesterday.

732
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,720
Really thank you for saving my husband.

733
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,150
Thank you, doctor.

734
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,920
You are welcome.

735
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,890
I'll never forget your kindness. Thank you, doctor.

736
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,940
Hmmm, wound treatment.

737
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,680
Doctor, you should clean the chest and then do the squeezing.

738
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,450
Sure, the squeezing.

739
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,780
Well…

740
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,650
Clean the sticky hematoma in the chest, right?

741
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,580
What? Walnut biscuits?

742
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,550
Go get a DVD? What a bunch of savages!

743
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,250
How dare you ask for these things?

744
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,850
What is he doing?

745
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,130
Oh, my!

746
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,430
Ugh, those unreliable hands.

747
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,630
Is there anything you can do well?

748
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,400
-Oh dear!
-What to do?

749
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,000
-Poor man!
-Come on, doctor.

750
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,210
Do you expect a senior doctor like me to do the squeezing?

751
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,920
Oho, he can't even do the squeezing well.

752
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,450
How on earth did he become a doctor?

753
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,390
Didn't you tell me never to possess you again?

754
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,430
I did what you said.

755
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,430
Hey, where are you going?

756
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,400
Seung Tak, I have something to say to you.

757
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,530
Let's have a talk.

758
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,400
What did you come to my room?

759
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,940
What are you doing?

760
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,110
Are you…

761
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,280
Hey, not that one.

762
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,020
I wore it only once. It's the latest design.

763
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,180
Hey, well, about that…

764
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,290
Well, you can't do that.

765
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,190
The clothes are innocent.

766
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,590
Put it down before I get angry.

767
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,690
Be a good boy. No, don't!

768
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,130
You brat! It's your stinky hands to blame! How dare you mess up with me!

769
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,590
Don't, I get this!

770
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,530
I get it.

771
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,800
Calm down.

772
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,030
Seung Tak, I can meet all your demands.

773
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,400
What do you need me to do?

774
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,770
Just say it. How about doing the squeezing one more time?

775
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,010
No!

776
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,720
Didn't you just let me put it down?

777
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,520
I did what you said.

778
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,590
Are you nuts?

779
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,590
How childish are you to avenge this way?

780
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,060
So what? Of course, revenge is puerile.

781
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,500
But I'm not noble anyway.

782
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,000
Darn it!

783
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,700
Dr. Go.

784
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,780
Ah?

785
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,110
What's this?

786
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,410
Well, why?

787
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,780
Did someone throw it down on purpose?

788
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,420
My size.

789
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,830
Oh, my new clothes.

790
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,610
I bought them from a couture shop.

791
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,240
Darn it!

792
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,180
Installment by credit card for six months.

793
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,080
Darn, that brat!

794
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,650
I even grew dark circles for them.

795
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,270
(Cha Yeong Min)

796
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,210
Why would you come here?

797
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,930
Se Jin,

798
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,260
what are you looking for?

799
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,790
Darn!

800
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,830
Finally.

801
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,110
Did I hear it wrong?

802
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,320
What are you doing?

803
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,320
You want to see the president's records?

804
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,960
But you don't know the password.

805
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,930
Even if you do, it must have been blocked.

806
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,340
Well, please don't keep coming.

807
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,750
The patient should have meals on time.

808
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,720
You jerk, hands off!

809
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,720
I got it. Let me go.

810
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,520
Please send this inside.

811
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:04,470
It's really hard to offer meals to the president in person.

812
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,600
We'll deliver it for you. Please leave.

813
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,710
Did he eat the sauced crab I sent last time?

814
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,170
It's the president's favorite food.

815
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,610
Sure, the president was very happy.

816
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,980
He ate it in satisfaction.

817
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,110
Did he finish all of it by himself?

818
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:24,420
I will deliver this for you. Please leave now.

819
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,090
Please don't make things difficult for us.

820
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,720
Thank you.

821
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,860
If he wants to see me, please tell me instantly.

822
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,930
Okay.

823
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:10,970
President, it's not that I don't want to conceal your situation…

824
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:14,140
Boy, do you have savings?

825
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,000
Not many.

826
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,140
Have you bought an apartment?

827
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:17,910
Full tax...

828
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,010
Family members?

829
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:22,240
Are you from a single family with sisters or what?

830
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,580
Only myself.

831
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,320
Forgive my rudeness.

832
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,320
Do you love my daughter?

833
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,160
Why don't you answer me?

834
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,760
Then how dare you spy on my daughter!

835
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,560
President, it must be a misunderstanding.

836
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,330
If you want my daughter's money,

837
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,500
you can give up that idea now.

838
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,470
She said she wouldn't take a penny from me.

839
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,010
Oh, is that so?

840
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,080
If it's okay with you, please be responsible for her.

841
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,150
What?

842
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,150
Se Jin knows that

843
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,720
I'm allergic to crustaceans. No way I would eat sauced crab.

844
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,620
It's okay that my situation is kept a secret.

845
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:14,730
But don't let her come here again.

846
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,530
She's tired enough for taking care of you.

847
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,570
I don't want to burden her any more.

848
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,710
I'm not a qualified father.

849
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:28,010
I didn't fulfill my duties and gave her so much pain.

850
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,480
She's been beside you all the time

851
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,990
after you had the accident.

852
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,190
Hello.

853
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,960
She makes time to do ward rounds occasionally.

854
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,630
Any symptoms of dizziness or nausea?

855
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,600
At this point,

856
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,340
she won't leave me alone.

857
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,410
But if they find out...

858
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,610
You know what I mean, right?

859
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:23,930
This guy never breaks regulations. He's so honest.

860
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:39,920
That thing must be what keeps me alive.

861
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:46,220
Should I be grateful or angry?

862
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,470
She's tired enough for taking care of you.

863
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:00,170
I don't want to burden her any more.

864
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,300
I'm not a qualified father.

865
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,220
I'm sorry.

866
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,420
Are you all right? Hello?

867
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:43,080
Neither I nor the president can be saved by you alone.

868
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,110
So, don't push yourself too hard.

869
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,620
This is Jang Se Jin, Vice President of Administration.

870
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:57,030
I want to talk with you about the president. Are you free now?

871
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,600
But if they find out...

872
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,670
You know what I mean, right?

873
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,100
Se Jin, no.

874
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,770
Here's your iced Americano.

875
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:15,240
Five minutes. Let me use your body for five minutes.

876
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,550
Go Seung Tak, is that your attitude?

877
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,780
What can you do if I must get in?

878
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,890
Seung Tak, come here. Go Seung Tak.

879
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,260
Go Seung Tak!

880
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,530
This darn shield.

881
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,660
Seung Tak, come here for a second

882
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,400
Let's talk, okay? Just a while.

883
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,000
Didn't I just agree to lend you five minutes?

884
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,100
But you ignored it.

885
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,440
Ah, did you really mean that?

886
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,080
I thought you didn't want to let me pass.

887
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,350
Then don't come forever. Over.

888
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,650
I'm sorry, Seung Tak. It's all my fault.

889
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,380
Seung Tak, just this once. I'm begging you.

890
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,490
Just five minutes! Go Seung Tak, just this once!

891
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,120
You will be sorry for it. Come back.

892
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,420
Seung Tak!

893
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,140
I'm busy. What's the matter?

894
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,480
Why are you so down? This is not like you.

895
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,050
Is it because of the news?

896
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,620
Am I a person who cares about that?

897
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,320
But why don't you ask me?

898
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,520
What?

899
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,430
Yesterday's cardiac tamponade operation.

900
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,590
You saw it, didn't you?

901
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,000
If it's something I should know,

902
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
you will tell me yourself.

903
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,600
I'm your friend.

904
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,710
People in the ICU are confused.

905
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,570
They thought you were a terrible doctor,

906
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,540
but now you're a genius to them.

907
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,310
What about you? Which one do you want me to be?

908
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,820
No one likes a fool,

909
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,220
not to mention a clumsy doctor.

910
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,430
But I don't want you to be too tired.

911
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,800
Just follow your heart.

912
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,400
Let's hope for the best.

913
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,440
Thank you for your advice.

914
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,710
Hello, brother. What's wrong?

915
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,020
Why didn't he drink the coffee at all?

916
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,290
If you don't mind, please drink it.

917
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,760
Ah, thank you.

918
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,960
I happen to be thirsty.

919
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,630
Great.

920
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,960
Why are things so harmonious between you two today?

921
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,130
You always hit him before.

922
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:52,400
What?

923
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,240
Well, it's a habit from school days.

924
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:58,740
Why is that?

925
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,810
Did Dr. Go do anything wrong to our Dr. Pretty?

926
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,250
(Emergency Medical Center)

927
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,080
He owes me.
(Emergency Medical Center)

928
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,890
A great debt.

929
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,960
I get angry at the sight of him.

930
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,300
Enjoy your coffee.

931
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:28,700
Dr. Go indeed often says things that piss others off.

932
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,610
But he's not a bad person.

933
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:35,310
As an elderly person, I'm good at telling a person's quality.

934
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:37,410
Thank you.

935
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,520
But you are not very old.

936
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,100
What… What's this?

937
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:09,080
Bed 37, neurosurgery, blue alarm.

938
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:14,450
Oh, that ungrateful kid! Can't he be a little helpful?

939
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,350
The doctor will arrive soon.

940
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,360
Cardiac arrest. Do CPR and raise the blue alarm.

941
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,390
Yes.

942
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,330
Well, am I able to treat a patient that seriously ill?

943
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,540
Do what you did before.

944
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,610
Didn't you see it just now?

945
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,510
The ghost has left.

946
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,680
Don't call me any more.

947
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,880
Are you clear?

948
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,420
One's constitution decides his work.

949
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,820
To play corresponds with mine.

950
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,520
Was the bed changed?

951
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,500
Yesterday he was a surgeon and today he's Go Seung Tak again.

952
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,540
Seung Jo... Seung Jo is missing.

953
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,600
What?

954
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,940
You scared me.

955
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,780
Hey, little patient.

956
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,820
Are you playing hide and seek again?

957
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,720
I've told you that it's not enough to just hide your head.

958
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,860
Besides, your mom can't find you if you hide in places like this.

959
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,590
Get up. Your mom will get worried.

960
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,500
Doctor.

961
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,740
Doctor.

962
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,790
What happened?

963
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,620
The patient is having a cardiac arrest.

964
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,690
One milliliter of adrenaline. Be quick.

965
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,500
The defibrillator is ready.

966
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,140
Am I dying?

967
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,520
Doctor.

968
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,420
Will I die?

969
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,630
What?

970
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,130
Doctor, you made me become like this.

971
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,930
Now I'm going to die?

972
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,180
Hello, can you hear me?

973
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,280
Hello.

974
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:12,330
Doctor, could you please help me?

975
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,240
Prepare V-fib and de-fib.

976
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,440
(V-fib: Ventricular fibrillation de-fib: Defibrillation)
Prepare V-fib and de-fib.

977
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,080
Ready.

978
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,550
200 joules.

979
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:33,680
Stay clear.

980
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,820
Electric shock!

981
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,330
Hasn't your grandpa changed his mind yet?

982
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,330
It's a pity to waste my ability.

983
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,740
It will be hard. The family's struggle for power can be very cruel.

984
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,010
Your things must be urgent so that you have to possess me.

985
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,110
Well, I'm a doctor.

986
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,110
I will die anyway, no matter I possess you or not.

987
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:02,610
Compared with an idiot with no hands-on ability,

988
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:04,210
a genius is better.

989
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:07,920
But I can't die like this,

990
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,220
for I feel angry about many things.

991
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,590
In my heart, I also don't want to see others die.

992
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,460
Let's cooperate.

993
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,020
