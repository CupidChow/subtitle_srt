1
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,810
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,650
Do you already know the truth?

3
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,680
Not all of it.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,020
How much do you know?

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,450
Vice President Han planed it.

6
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,820
Mr. Jang ordered it against ethics.

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,160
Dr. An carried it out.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,220
The initial plan

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,160
was to use pure Dr. An and sacrifice him.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,660
What do you not know?

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:50,760
Was the car crash really an accident?

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,300
(TA: Traffic accident)
Was the car crash really an accident?

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,700
Was the car crash really an accident?

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,940
Will I die?

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,610
Is that my punishment for hurting you?

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,080
Will I die?

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,120
Prepare V-fib and De-fid.

18
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,150
Ready.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,820
200 joules, right?

20
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,090
Stay clear.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,090
Charge.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,370
He's back.

23
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:44,850
He's the patient who had decompressive craniectomy

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,820
(Decompressive craniectomy & subdural hemorrhage removal)
He's the patient who had decompressive craniectomy

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,750
and SDH removal, right?
(Decompressive craniectomy & subdural hemorrhage removal)

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,960
Yes.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,390
He's the patient who had an car accident, which caused acute SDH,

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,360
(ACUTE SDH: acute subdural hemorrhage)
He's the patient who had an car accident, which caused acute SDH,

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,690
(Diffuse axonal injury)
(ACUTE SDH: acute subdural hemorrhage)

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,390
diffuse axonal injury and hypoxia damage
(Diffuse axonal injury)
(ACUTE SDH: acute subdural hemorrhage)

31
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:53,460
(Diffuse axonal injury)
diffuse axonal injury and hypoxia damage

32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,530
(Hypoxic damage)
diffuse axonal injury and hypoxia damage

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,030
and then accepted an emergency surgery.
(Hypoxic damage)

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,330
and then accepted an emergency surgery.

35
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,660
He survived one critical moment.

36
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,930
But this is just the beginning.

37
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,930
Adjust his norepinephrine well.

38
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,940
Watch out for any blood pressure rise.

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,370
Record his urine output per hour.

40
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,910
And observe whether he needs any diuretic.

41
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,509
Yes, I will.

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,020
Dr. Cha, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,890
Dr. Cha, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,420
Dr. Cha, I'm really sorry.

45
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,460
That day I waited for you at the intersection near the hospital

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
and intended to make a little collision.

47
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,570
They let me hold you up a while.

48
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,000
That was all I needed to do.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,540
The head of this hospital's legal department

50
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,440
was a customer of the private detective agency I worked in.

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
He promised to give me lots of money

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,550
as long as I cooperated.

53
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,079
Because of money, I… I'm sorry.

54
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,890
Dr. Cha, I'm sorry.

55
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,590
Dr. Cha, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm really sorry.

57
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,890
Was that you, too?

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,120
Professor Cha,

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,020
you've lived much longer than I expected.

60
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,860
You look great.

61
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,630
Dr. Jang Se Jin must have taken good care of you.

62
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,329
You jerk!

63
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,130
Things never go smoothly.

64
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,570
Changes are always faster than plan.

65
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,870
I'm actually not that bad.

66
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,880
But you make me a bad guy.

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,650
I hope you can hold on like this forever.

68
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,690
It's said that no love can tolerate a long-lying patient.

69
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,690
Please consume as much emotion and energy of Dr. Jang as you can.

70
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,400
Se Jin.

71
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

72
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,170
It's all right. I heard about an emergency.

73
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,000
How's the patient?

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,670
Yes, but he has pulled through.

75
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,140
Thank you so much.

76
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,140
You don't need to thank me.

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,110
I'm staying here as a doctor.

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,480
You said you wanted to ask me about the President.

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,150
Funny, right?

80
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,520
Though it's just temporary,

81
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,850
I'm a doctor of this hospital anyway.

82
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,260
But I still need to ask others about my father's situation.

83
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,930
I knew about his waking up from the news.

84
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,300
And I can't see him even after that.

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
What do you think?

86
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,470
Se Jin, no.

87
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,070
He's not in a good sate after he waked up.

88
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,940
Jang Se Jin.

89
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,470
I only received a report on the President's waking up.

90
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,580
And I've heard nothing ever since.

91
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,410
I also can't see him.

92
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,610
But I'll check it right away.

93
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,750
One more thing.

94
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,520
Do you know why Professor Cha

95
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,360
went out the day he operated on the President?

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,730
Well… what? What do you mean?

97
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,130
Wasn't it because of your message…

98
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,930
About the specific situation, I…

99
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,710
It must be something so important

100
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,140
that he left the patient.

101
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,950
Is that so?

102
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,380
I'll leave first.

103
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,520
So he got you out of the hospital first

104
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,290
and then hindered the treatment.

105
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,890
The car crash was an accident,

106
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,960
but they did have a plan beforehand.

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,970
Who on earth contacted you that day?

108
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,740
Don't pry into my personal affairs.

109
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,310
What do you want from me?

110
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,880
Doctor, will I die?

111
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:16,350
Could you please save me?

112
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,720
Well, O Seung Jo.

113
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm sorry but I still can't…

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,260
That annoying doctor.

115
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,540
Please help me find him.

116
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,470
Was it because I said I hated that uncle,

117
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,110
no, the attending doctor,

118
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,409
that he left to avoid me?

119
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,820
I don't hate that doctor.

120
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,820
So could you help me find him and tell him

121
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,190
that I'm sorry?

122
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,430
And I'll never say things like that.

123
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,600
Please ask him to save me.

124
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,910
I can't die.

125
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,680
My mom will be so sad.

126
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,220
Hello, bro, what's wrong?

127
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,930
Mommy.

128
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,490
Seung Jo.

129
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,130
Baby, where did you go?

130
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,140
Mommy, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

131
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,770
All right, it's okay.

132
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,140
It will be okay.

133
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,080
Somehow the boy found it out.

134
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
It's said that he asked the nurse about Professor Cha.

135
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,880
The nurse said Professor Cha went to a far place.

136
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,890
Then the boy blamed himself so much.

137
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,190
He's also good at taking hints.

138
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,190
He thought he would die if leaving here without a surgery.

139
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,560
It's just so sad.

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,470
This is what a hospital is like.

141
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,570
And it should be.

142
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,140
I'm a doctor.

143
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,640
I will die no matter if I possess you or not.

144
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,720
But I can't die like this,

145
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,390
for I feel angry about many things.

146
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,059
I'll do it.

147
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,700
Compared with an idiot with no hands-on ability,

148
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,870
I think to be a genius is better.

149
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,540
I'm a person who hates to see people die.

150
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,010
Let me borrow your stinky hands.

151
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,080
Let me use your golden hands.

152
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,980
Cooperate?

153
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,280
Okay, no problem.

154
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,880
Wait a minute.

155
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,790
Why? What's wrong again?

156
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,520
The hospital is kind of an undisciplined place.

157
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,260
(EunSang University Medical Center)

158
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,980
Is that also the latest design?

159
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,210
Right, the very latest.

160
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,280
I buy two suits for a quarter.

161
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,950
Now I know where your salary goes.

162
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,020
Didn't you say that I can't talk to you?

163
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,020
Why are you speaking to me?

164
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,660
First, when there are people around me,

165
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,520
don't talk to me.

166
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,230
Don't say anything to make me act strangely.

167
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,830
For example, "Your shoelace is untied."

168
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,160
Especially at places with surveillance around.

169
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,530
Please pay special attention to it.

170
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,670
I've been in the spotlight lately. Okay?

171
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,300
Why? Are you afraid that others know that you can see ghosts?

172
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,640
Afraid of being isolated?

173
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,870
I'm afraid that I can't get the certificate.

174
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,880
Have you seen any doctor who can see ghosts before?

175
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,210
Are we walking side by side?

176
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,050
But I have such a slender figure.

177
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,580
Let's say you are slender.

178
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,020
You can't be more slender than me.

179
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,890
It's not early.

180
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,960
This brat!

181
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,230
Second, be careful not to touch each other too often.

182
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,730
Let's keep a proper distance.

183
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,640
Our routes can't coincide. We must conduct ourselves in the society well.

184
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,740
Conduct ourselves in the society?

185
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,540
Are you serious?

186
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,890
Can't you be a little careful?

187
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,220
I can't act strangely!

188
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,720
I see, boy.

189
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,130
He's so funny.

190
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,380
Is it a little too much?

191
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,740
The white coat is the final touch of fashion.

192
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,280
Did you steal it?

193
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,450
I don't wear others' white coats.

194
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,520
What the… Don't they ever wash it?

195
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,130
(Cha Yeong Min)

196
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,300
Third,

197
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,700
don't tell other ghosts that I can see them.

198
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,840
Why?

199
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Are you asking me? Don't you really understand it?

200
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,150
Oh, I feel not very refreshed today.

201
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,620
Physical strength is never enough in Thoracic Surgery Department.

202
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,770
You two are always together recently.

203
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,130
It looks like you are pretty close.

204
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,270
Why did you refuse our requests?

205
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,670
Come on.

206
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,010
This is not right.

207
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,280
We just need a few minutes.

208
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,480
If we mention it to him,

209
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,380
he will definitely agree and allow us to talk freely.

210
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,520
You are not as kind as him.

211
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,420
I'm so curious.

212
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,660
Did you receive any special training?

213
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,630
You don't need to know.

214
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,740
Put all your luggage back.

215
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,980
You don't have to leave.

216
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,180
Seung Jo will have the surgery.

217
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,780
Doctor Cha.

218
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,820
Yes, little Seung Jo.

219
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,060
I'm here for you.

220
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,040
He's not wearing a mask.

221
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,080
He's the real Go Seung Tak.

222
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,810
I heard you prepared to operate on Seung Jo.

223
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,050
Even those professors find that operation challenging.

224
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,120
Who do you think you are?

225
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,650
What?

226
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,820
Will you perform such a high-skilled operation?

227
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,150
I never said I would do it.

228
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,660
If not you, then who?

229
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,690
Dr. An.

230
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,690
Are you out of you mind?

231
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,360
Why did you put An Tae Hyeon in charge?

232
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,300
Or what? Should I take charge? It's so difficult.

233
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,570
He can't do that operation.

234
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,470
Then he has to.

235
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,840
Go Seung Tak.

236
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,240
Do you know what kind of surgery it is?

237
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,940
The patient is O Seung Jo, 7 years old.

238
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,910
For pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect,

239
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,680
he had a BT shunt 20 days after birth

240
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,080
(BT shunt: an operation to anastomosis subclavian artery with pulmonary artery and improve pulmonary blood flow)
he had a BT shunt 20 days after birth

241
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,510
and first generation Rastelli.
(BT shunt: an operation to anastomosis subclavian artery with pulmonary artery and improve pulmonary blood flow)
he had a BT shunt 20 days after birth

242
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,980
(Rastelli: an operation to anastomosis artificial blood vessel and reconstruction pulmonary artery trunk)
(BT shunt: an operation to anastomosis subclavian artery with pulmonary artery and improve pulmonary blood flow)
and first generation Rastelli.

243
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,780
We were gonna replace his adhered right ventricular catheter.
(Rastelli: an operation to anastomosis artificial blood vessel and reconstruction pulmonary artery trunk)
(BT shunt: an operation to anastomosis subclavian artery with pulmonary artery and improve pulmonary blood flow)

244
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,350
We were gonna replace his adhered right ventricular catheter.

245
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,280
But it was delayed.

246
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,620
His liver function declined during this time.

247
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,620
(Liver function)
His liver function declined during this time.

248
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,350
He began to develop pleural effusion.
(Liver function)

249
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,990
He began to develop pleural effusion.

250
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,390
You've got a good memory.

251
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,590
It's not an easy operation.

252
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,660
I know.

253
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,360
Which one of my surgeries is easy?

254
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,870
That's why Professor Cha's gonna do it.

255
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,000
After all, it's a difficult surgery.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,700
You brat.

257
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,270
But I'm sure you can handle it.

258
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,370
You've done a good job with your surgeries.

259
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:23,940
The patient had Kawasaki disease.

260
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,610
(Kawasaki disease: an acute vasculitis appearing in infant period)
The patient had Kawasaki disease.

261
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,210
What?
(Kawasaki disease: an acute vasculitis appearing in infant period)
The patient had Kawasaki disease.

262
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,550
Right.

263
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,110
He had Kawasaki disease

264
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,350
when he was four.

265
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,380
You didn't know that?

266
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,280
You didn't know that?

267
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,780
It seems you don't know that.

268
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,390
It...

269
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,860
It... It is a disease that causes high fever and inflammation.

270
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,660
It's mostly for three- and four-year-old children.

271
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,860
It can also lead to fatal complications.

272
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,960
Right, coronary artery aneurysm.

273
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,030
(Coronary artery aneurysm)
Right, coronary artery aneurysm.

274
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,000
Coronary artery aneurysm.
(Coronary artery aneurysm)

275
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,040
Once the coronary artery expands,

276
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,970
the blood will stay in place and form a clot,

277
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,640
which can cause an acute myocardial infarction.

278
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,070
So, we have to deal with that.

279
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,170
We need a CABG.

280
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,580
(CABG coronary artery bypass graft)
We need a CABG.

281
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,310
So, we need a CABG.
(CABG coronary artery bypass graft)

282
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,110
So, we need a CABG.

283
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,520
Why just pick one or two words?

284
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,720
Well, you do know that.

285
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,450
Replacement of the right ventricular catheter is a common surgery.

286
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,020
The hard part is having to do a CABG at the same time.

287
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,860
Not to mention the patient is a child.

288
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,230
Yeah, there's got to be an internal mammary artery underneath the bone.

289
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,560
If adhesions occur,

290
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,760
it's very difficult to just peel them off.

291
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,570
It's gonna be very hard just to peel off the internal mammary artery underneath the bone.

292
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,870
The catheter is also stuck to the chest, making it difficult to peel off.

293
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,040
The adhesions are severe, and the internal mammary artery is difficult to peel off.

294
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,540
The left anterior descending coronary artery is difficult to locate due to adhesions.

295
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,280
It's a far cry from the normal CABG.

296
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,050
Not to mention, my surgery is already more difficult due to adhesions.

297
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,280
He is a little boy,

298
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,650
and opening his chest is a huge problem.

299
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:41,790
It's extremely sensitive from the incision stage

300
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,220
(Incision)
It's extremely sensitive from the incision stage

301
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,350
and needs to be done carefully.
(Incision)
It's extremely sensitive from the incision stage

302
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,090
and needs to be done carefully.

303
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,020
We can't open his chest like we usually do.

304
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,290
If we're not careful,

305
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,860
the patient's life could be at risk before the thoracotomy.

306
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,070
Well, the chest tube is stuck to the wall of tube.

307
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,140
Hey, what are you saying?

308
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,070
It's the wall of tube sticking to the chest tube.

309
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,070
If something goes wrong with the peeling, before the chest is opened...

310
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,710
How can you peel off and open the chest at the same time?

311
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,610
Open the chest first and peel off.

312
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,950
So, to open the chest, we have to go straight...

313
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,550
Hey, what are you talking about? Are you crazy?

314
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,280
I said we need to do it slowly and carefully.

315
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,020
After peeling off, the left anterior artery…

316
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,620
Oh my god.

317
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,560
Seung Tak.

318
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,690
It's left anterior descending coronary artery, Seung Tak.

319
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,630
Left anterior descending coronary artery.

320
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
-So I mean… -I mean…

321
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,470
Where did he go?

322
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Ah.

323
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,850
Who?

324
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,020
Why did you say so much at once?

325
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,150
You need to keep it short.

326
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,860
You brat.

327
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,490
Why are you mad at me when you can't keep up?

328
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,730
You…

329
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,930
Why didn't you tell me about Kawasaki disease in advance?

330
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,530
That's something you need to figure out in advance.

331
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,930
If you look at the patient history, you'd know that.

332
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,770
I told you that you're not allowed to possess me randomly.

333
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,140
Well, technically, it's both our fault.

334
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,280
What?

335
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,480
What are you doing here?

336
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,109
Well.

337
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,380
How could you just walk in here?

338
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,349
Don't you have to knock on the door?

339
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,650
You are so rude.

340
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,359
I can't believe it's such a bad cooperation.

341
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,590
What's wrong?

342
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,330
I don't know what you are thinking.

343
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,000
But I can't do the surgery.

344
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,100
Don't give them meaningless hope.

345
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,730
Help them get discharged.

346
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,170
I heard that Professor Cha Yeong Min

347
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,440
performed this surgery two years ago.

348
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,340
You were his first assistant.

349
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,750
It's the kind of surgery that a surgeon might not be able to perform once in a lifetime.

350
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,190
It's a rare case.

351
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,050
It's the kind of surgery that a surgeon might not be able to perform once in a lifetime.

352
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,260
It's a rare case.

353
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,230
I succeeded in doing such a difficult operation, the first in Korea.

354
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,260
You were part of that historic moment.

355
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,800
You saw and learned.

356
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,900
You work harder than anyone else.

357
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,160
And you are closer than anyone else.

358
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,770
I know you've been in my shadow for a long time.

359
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,170
After all, you've been working for me,

360
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,240
and you've had fewer opportunities than other doctors in your class.

361
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,540
You're going to be a professor soon.

362
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,410
It's the perfect way to

363
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,440
make up for a cardiac tamponade that went wrong.

364
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,450
Will it work?

365
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,750
I am well aware of his situation.

366
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,250
Don't talk.

367
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,350
It will work.

368
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,660
You said I wasn't qualified to treat patients.

369
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,340
You did everything you could.

370
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,550
It's a bit of a stretch from the start.

371
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,650
Don't be too disappointed if you don't succeed in the end.

372
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,680
Is Seung Jo

373
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,320
my patient?

374
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,220
What?

375
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,990
There's nothing good about attending physician

376
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,160
who wears a white coat all the time.

377
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,130
Hey, I heard you don't have a dad.

378
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,230
I heard you and your mom live together.

379
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,770
My mom said

380
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,940
you were the reason your dad ran away from your mom.

381
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,110
Right.

382
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,210
You have no money for treatment.

383
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,650
Your mom can't stop crying.

384
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,050
Kids.

385
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,020
You are still not good even in hospital.

386
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,260
Do you know who I am?

387
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm Cha Yeong Min.

388
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,330
I'm the best doctor in this hospital.

389
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,770
Do you have an attending physician like me?

390
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,670
You don't, right?

391
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,070
But he does.

392
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,740
Seung Jo is my patient.

393
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,140
If you want to ridicule him, you have to think about it.

394
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,440
Do you understand?

395
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,210
Do you understand?

396
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,610
Mom.

397
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,050
Mom.

398
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Why are you smiling?

399
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,480
Hello?

400
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,420
(Emergency Medical Center)

401
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,160
Fall down injury from 3 meters high.

402
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,060
(Fall down injury)
Fall down injury from 3 meters high.

403
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,360
The patient has chest pain.
(Fall down injury)

404
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:52,930
The patient has chest pain.

405
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm afraid the patient hit his chest because the place where he fell was sharp.

406
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,830
This way.

407
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,370
What is the patient's state of consciousness?

408
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,640
That's the most important part.

409
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,980
If possession is necessary,

410
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,950
it must be done by mutual consent.

411
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,250
You can't just grab my wrist

412
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,050
and possess me.

413
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,890
Okay.

414
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,820
How to do?

415
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,990
Well,

416
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,090
let's just use hand signals.

417
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,960
Like this.

418
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,060
You brat, do you take me for a dog?

419
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,430
Like this?

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,460
How about this?

421
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,330
Do you take me for a megalomaniac? Thumbs up all the time.

422
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,370
How about this?

423
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,870
Are you a gangster to beat someone up?

424
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,970
Oh, I know.

425
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,640
What's up, man. Hey!

426
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,310
What?

427
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,040
Are you crazy?

428
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,640
You jerk.

429
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,250
You went up to the mountain to meet another woman?

430
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,580
Who is she?

431
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,750
Tell me who she is.

432
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,050
You can't do that. Keep calm.

433
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,890
You used to go to Gangbuk Dong.

434
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,920
Does this woman like climbing mountains?

435
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,660
So you climbed mountains with her and fell like this?

436
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,230
Oh my.

437
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,430
-Wake up. -You brat.

438
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,570
What are you doing? Come here.

439
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,100
Why do you do that to me?

440
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,010
You can't do that here.

441
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,240
Leave me alone, you jerk.

442
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,450
Stop. You can't do that.

443
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,380
What are you doing here? Just let me go.

444
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,050
I'm not the one who cheated on you.

445
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,690
What's the matter with you?

446
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,990
Intern Dr. O. Intern Dr. O. Intern Dr. O.

447
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,830
The patient's blood pressure dropped.

448
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,630
Let go of me first.

449
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,330
Patient.

450
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,330
-Patient? –Let me go.

451
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,400
Darn it.

452
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,100
Patient.

453
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,730
Patient.

454
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,700
He is unconscious.

455
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,670
What are you doing here?

456
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,370
I will bring the patient back to life and then you can kill him yourself.

457
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,340
Just relax and wait outside.

458
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,110
Intern Dr. O.

459
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,080
Get her out of here.

460
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,880
Okay.

461
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,710
Dear.

462
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,810
-Dear. -Please.

463
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,650
Come with me.

464
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,850
What about his chest X-ray and CT?

465
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,350
It's already done.

466
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,290
Here.

467
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,990
The rib dislocation caused the aortic dissection.

468
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,290
The blood flowed out and blocked the vessel, causing it to rupture again.

469
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,960
He was almost killed by his wife.

470
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,930
What do we do now?

471
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,470
Should we prepare an operating room?

472
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,100
Time is running out.

473
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,930
We're gonna operate here.

474
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,270
Here again?

475
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,800
Gloves.

476
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:21,350
Last time you promised me about the appointment of professor…

477
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,250
Dr. An.

478
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,950
Am I wrong about you?

479
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,580
Are you still confused about the situation?

480
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,020
Well, you made things like this.

481
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,860
I can't believe you're telling me that.

482
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,060
You should have taken your chance

483
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,690
when you had it.

484
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,630
That's the chance you had

485
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,200
by betraying your mentor who you followed for four years.

486
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,500
Am I right?

487
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm willing to your first assistant if you do the operation.

488
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,340
What?

489
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
I mean

490
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,840
I'm willing to back you up behind you.

491
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,510
You know how good I am, right?

492
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,310
You've seen me operate so many times, so you know me.

493
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,690
Go Seung Tak.

494
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,060
I heard you did another big thing.

495
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,590
Tell me the truth,

496
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,290
who did you get special training from?

497
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,230
Just tell me alone.

498
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,330
The patient underwent surgery on the aorta.

499
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,830
You need to keep an eye on his blood pressure to avoid another blood vessel rupture.

500
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,200
Keep his blood pressure between 100 and 120.

501
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,070
What?

502
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,670
What's the matter?

503
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,970
You should be thankful that you're in the operating room now.

504
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,770
If you behave like this again,

505
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,280
-I wonder if it would be inappropriate.
-Can't you hear me?

506
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,780
Hey, brother.

507
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,950
Pay attention to his blood pressure.

508
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,090
Could you?

509
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,290
What?

510
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,520
Even so, you can't tell him the location.

511
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,890
What's going on?

512
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,460
The patient who was sent here just now.

513
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,730
I don't know if she's his mistress.

514
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,460
She said her husband is on his way here.

515
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
Why does her husband come here?

516
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
She said he was coming to kill the patient.

517
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,600
What?

518
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,930
She also said he was going to kill you together.

519
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,640
What?!

520
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,900
That man is a member of the underworld.

521
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,540
He just made a scene in the Emergency Room.

522
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,310
Contact Security Room now.

523
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,980
I have.

524
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,480
Doctor Go…

525
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,980
You can't walk away like this.

526
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,060
Seung Tak.

527
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,630
So, you're the doctor who saved that guy's life.

528
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,730
Do you know me?

529
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,000
You jerk!

530
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,240
Let go of me!

531
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,340
That jerk…

532
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,180
Let go! Let go of me!

533
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,580
I'm gonna kill that guy.

534
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,550
Do you know how much my watch is worth?

535
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,550
Let go of me!

536
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,150
Our cooperation ends here.

537
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,990
That's what I want to say.

538
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,990
It's expensive. Please stop.

539
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,740
Sort all of Dr. Go's surveillance videos every day

540
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,810
and hand it to me.

541
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,510
What?

542
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,710
Every day?

543
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,620
Who broke his promise first?

544
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,220
You said we should negotiate.

545
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,560
He pulled my hair, too.

546
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,890
Just here.

547
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:24,600
Well,

548
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
it's your hair.

549
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,260
Anyway,

550
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,160
I did you a favor once.

551
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,500
You're gonna do me a favor.

552
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,770
You have made countless requests.

553
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,170
I only made one.

554
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,740
Help me uncover the truth.

555
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,640
How can you be so stingy? You just got beaten up.

556
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,510
Are you serious?

557
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,010
Hello, brother.

558
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,650
What's the matter?

559
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,750
Really?

560
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,620
They told me I will have an operation tomorrow.

561
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,260
Will you?

562
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,430
The operation is tentatively scheduled at 8:30 tomorrow morning.

563
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,030
Do some preoperative examinations today.

564
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,870
He should fast after midnight.

565
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,640
Okay, I see.

566
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,540
Check to see if the indicators of the liver continue to drop.

567
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,210
Keep an eye on the heart condition.

568
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,780
Okay, Doctor An.

569
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,790
You persuaded An Tae Hyeon to have the operation,

570
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,690
and you'll also be in the operating room.

571
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,630
And then?

572
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,730
And then you will volunteer

573
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,730
to walk into the operating room.

574
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,570
Go Seung Tak was acting wildly.

575
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,910
Does he think of himself as a hero?

576
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,280
It's all because someone always screws things up,

577
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,050
so that he can have the chance to show off.

578
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,080
I'm sorry.

579
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,820
Dr. An, are you having a sudden ambition?

580
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,950
I didn't ask you to operate,

581
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,520
but you volunteered to do it.

582
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,630
Or are you suddenly craving for being appointed as a professor?

583
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,530
I'm gonna have to find a way for myself.

584
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm already in the position of betraying my teacher.

585
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,200
What else can I lose?

586
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,180
Since you want to contribute to the hospital,

587
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,610
I appreciate that.

588
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,180
This way I can speak for you.

589
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,480
By the way,

590
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,150
is there anything wrong with President Jang?

591
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,660
Is something bothering you?

592
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,460
Nothing.

593
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,400
Just do as you always do.

594
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,870
Pay extra attention to security.

595
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,300
Don't leak any information out.

596
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,500
Especially to the media.

597
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,540
Good luck with your operation tomorrow.

598
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,410
Fine, thank you.

599
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,250
It would be better if the operation fails.

600
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,060
Professor Cha, what are we doing here?

601
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,330
To your room?

602
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:08,860
No.

603
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,490
I have to go somewhere.

604
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,000
I beg you.

605
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,730
Please help my brother.

606
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,000
I'll find a way to pay for the medical bills.

607
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,840
You should discuss this with the General Affairs Department.

608
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,170
You're putting us in a very difficult position here.

609
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,510
No one in the General Affairs Department wants to talk to me.

610
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,280
Please! I'm begging you.

611
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,180
Please.

612
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,420
That's my sister.

613
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,860
Please stop crying.

614
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,870
Both our parents passed away.

615
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,670
My sister and I relied on each other.

616
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,240
My sister is a senior in high school with good grades.

617
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,410
I was determined to pay for her college education.

618
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,480
But I still haven't saved enough money for her tuition.

619
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,460
So, I started delivering late-night takeout a few months ago.

620
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,130
Maybe because of overwork,

621
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,630
my health suddenly began to deteriorate.

622
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,900
I got some pills at the pharmacy,

623
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,810
instead of going to the hospital.

624
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,040
That day I took strong medicine without eating anything first.

625
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,080
It made me muddleheaded.

626
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,820
As a result…

627
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,680
At the beginning,

628
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,550
I was glad I was sent to this hospital.

629
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,480
But no one came.

630
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,420
No one took the responsibility for me.

631
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,990
The hospital expenses must be very high…

632
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,130
Doctor Cha, I beg you to help me.

633
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,030
If you save me,

634
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,530
I will tell the whole truth.

635
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,640
I will take all the blame I should take.

636
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,270
I can't leave my sister alone...

637
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,710
I can't just leave like this.

638
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,810
I'm begging you, Doctor Cha.

639
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,750
Dr. Go Seung Tak.

640
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,450
Please.

641
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,060
What are you doing here?

642
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,560
What brings you here?

643
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,330
What can I do for you?

644
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,570
I'm here to check on the patients.

645
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,940
And seize the chance to sneak off…

646
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,540
Play mobile games.

647
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,310
Then I'm going.

648
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,950
This guy is the culprit

649
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,720
who made all of this happen.

650
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,390
He also has a doctor working for him.

651
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,130
At that time,

652
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,430
someone knocked on my door...

653
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,550
President Jang is now in extreme trouble physically.

654
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,980
Maybe he didn't want you to see his current conditions.

655
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,720
He rejected all visitors, except his son.

656
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,290
And President Jang is in a very low mood.

657
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,930
I specifically asked a neurologist to take extra care of him.

658
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,160
Don't worry too much about it.

659
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,230
I think President Jang will see you soon.

660
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,160
I see.

661
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,040
You are so sweet.

662
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,770
Seems like you have been staying in the hospital lately.

663
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,280
If you don't mind,

664
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,450
let's go out and have a bite to eat.

665
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,380
I have to work late tonight, too.

666
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,920
You jerk! What tricks are you playing?

667
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,080
Thank you for your kindness. Maybe next time.

668
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,450
I'm a little tired today.

669
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,330
Fine. Then,

670
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,690
give me a chance next time.

671
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,820
If you want to support the medical workers here,

672
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:06,090
you need to know what's going on in every corner of the hospital.

673
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,230
Start from the bottom.

674
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,639
Really?

675
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,270
I'm kidding.

676
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,940
Isn't it?

677
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,080
Yeah, yeah.

678
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,389
Come on. Patients are not animals.

679
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,420
How could they be forced to leave because of failure to pay hospital expenses on time?

680
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,690
Does this make sense?

681
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,190
It's not a big deal.

682
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,590
Take it out of my salary.

683
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,889
How much do you make as an intern?

684
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,190
And you ask us to do it every time.

685
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,900
How can you afford your meal expenses?

686
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,929
I don't have time to eat, anyway.

687
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,000
It's better than being criticized by patients.

688
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,239
Just do it.

689
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,400
I have some money left.

690
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,840
Oh.

691
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,680
Thanks to you, I have money left from next month's salary.

692
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,650
I bought it with that money.

693
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,880
The patient can pay the expenses in 12 installments.

694
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,920
Thank you.

695
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,650
Well…

696
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,220
Yeah?

697
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,960
You have grains of rice in your hair.

698
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,200
Uh, I just got them at lunch.

699
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,170
I'm so hungry.

700
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,080
What a sweet person.

701
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,380
You will be in luck.

702
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,180
Thank you.

703
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,040
Yeah, what's up?

704
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,340
If it isn't an emergency, you and Dr. Lee Seon Ho...

705
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,780
Hey! Hey!

706
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,450
Doctors, please be quick.

707
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,080
What's the matter?

708
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,950
Hey! Go Seung Tak?

709
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,690
Ah.

710
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,490
(To be played in 60 seconds)
Ah.

711
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,490
(To be played in 60 seconds)

712
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,740
Dr. An Tae Hyeon had an emergency in the Emergency Room.

713
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,410
So, I came in his place.

714
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,680
I seldom accept such a request.

715
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,050
Give an injection and monitor the symptoms three times a day, right?

716
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,890
That guy is so honest.

717
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,000
He comes here four times every day without a single slip.

718
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,640
Let me see.

719
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,780
This is adrenaline. It's a cardiac stimulant.

720
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,350
Furosemide. It's a diuretic.

721
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,410
Just say you have to monitor the patient.

722
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,820
He exhorted me repeatedly to monitor the patient.

723
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,150
You know what?

724
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,620
The dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure and urine volume.

725
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,330
7 microliters of adrenaline was injected per hour before.

726
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,630
7 microliters of adrenaline was injected per hour before.

727
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,130
So, what is it now?

728
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,400
If I can't inject it on time,

729
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,540
President Jang may have a cardiac arrest or heartbleed.

730
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,110
Or,

731
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,110
he may open his eyes suddenly.

732
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,810
What?

733
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,150
I told you it would work.

734
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,250
So, do you want me to just leave?

735
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,120
No. Please come in.

736
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,120
(VIP Room 2)

737
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,580
Are you really gonna do this?

738
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,320
What else should I do?

739
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,520
I came in for an injection.

740
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,720
It's weird if I don't inject.

741
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,360
Others can't see you.

742
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,890
So, you don't care.

743
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,030
But it bothers me.

744
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,800
Don't you see they are watching me from behind?

745
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,830
Hey! You're in my way. Get out.

746
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,780
Uh, wait a minute.

747
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,490
It's not good to act rashly.

748
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,550
Very bad.

749
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,590
Use this!

750
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,730
There's no place in this hospital I can't go.

751
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,900
How about we ask the patient if he wants an injection?

752
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,240
What are you talking about?

753
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,940
How can you talk to the President this way?

754
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,150
Hey, come on. I want you to get out!

755
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,250
Give it to me.

756
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,920
Give it to me!

757
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,750
Eh!

758
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,620
Eh!

759
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,190
Eh!

760
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,290
Stop!

761
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,760
What are you doing?

762
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,870
Then, I'm leaving.

763
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,880
This kid is good at acting.

764
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,850
What's going on?

765
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,370
Gosh!

766
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,770
You scared me.

767
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,140
How come you came out from there?

768
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,080
With Jang Min Ho's bad temper,

769
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,780
if he finds out that I was here,

770
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,280
you two will be in trouble.

771
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,920
So, you'd better stay out of my way in the future.

772
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,850
But don't be pushovers either.

773
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,620
I won't make you lose your job.

774
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,590
Darn it.

775
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,130
Have you changed your mind?

776
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,570
It's more of a change of situation.

777
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,250
Luckily, we have a fingerprint ID system.

778
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,490
The Professor Cha I know

779
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,730
has a high sense of responsibility toward patients.

780
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,500
Why was such a responsible doctor

781
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,000
absent from duty before the patient woke up?

782
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
Because of me.

783
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,640
I called Professor Cha out.

784
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,110
(I want to see you now, could you come out?
I will go back to America by air tomorrow morning.
There's something I really need to talk to you before I leave.
I will be waiting for you at the place we used to go a lot.)

785
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,380
Some of the jerks you just talked about

786
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,980
used me.

787
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,320
I wonder why you don't expose

788
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,590
the things you know.

789
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,190
I don't do well with complicated matters.

790
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,630
Besides, I don't have evidence.

791
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,370
However,

792
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,940
we have a witness.

793
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,510
This is the motorcyclist who also got involved in the accident with Professor Cha.

794
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,810
We may be able to find a solution if he wakes up.

795
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,610
I'll take care of this patient from now on.

796
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,220
Let me take a look at his chart.

797
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,490
Is it okay to get her involved?

798
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,260
That's why I want to cooperate

799
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,860
in the least risky way.

800
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,130
The Se Jin I know

801
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,700
would always fight for justice.

802
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,400
She's a brave woman.

803
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,570
She won't give up even if you try to stop her.

804
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,770
I'm really curious

805
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,540
about your relationship.

806
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,580
Stop prying into my personal life.

807
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,780
I'm also curious about

808
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,650
why you can see ghosts?

809
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,650
Are you asking me? You think I'd answer that?

810
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,590
Are we that close?

811
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,590
Oh, boy! How narrow-minded you are!

812
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,360
That's bad.

813
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,730
Isn't it obvious?

814
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,540
Actually, I don't even know

815
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,540
what our relationship was.

816
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:54,830
My Seung Jo is brave. You can do it, right?

817
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,370
Yeah. I can do it.

818
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,790
Let's go.

819
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,390
(Operating Room)

820
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,600
It's the brain MRI room, right?

821
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,440
(EunSang University Medical Center)

822
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,450
One, two, three.

823
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:44,870
No. No.

824
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,010
Seung Tak! Go Seung Tak! Can you hear me?

825
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,680
Come out, Go Seung Tak!

826
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,810
Please.

827
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,680
No.

828
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,100
Shall we start?

829
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,830
Yes. Let's do it.

830
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,570
O Seung Jo, seven years old. His right ventricular catheter ruptured.

831
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,570
Let's start the operation.

832
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,010
Scalpel.

833
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:59,320
Hey, where's Jeo?

834
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,820
The one who tells me first will be saved first.

835
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,850
-Emergency Room!
-Emergency...

836
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,850
Emergency...

837
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,990
Yeah!

838
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,900
Give me the tweezers.

839
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,170
Eh? Ah-oh.

840
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:30,880
Are you… out of your mind?

841
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,120
We can't drop our hands like that during operation,

842
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,120
right? I placed my hands too low.

843
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,490
Why did you ask for the tweezers?

844
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:43,090
Huh? I can't hold them? I'm sorry.

845
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,730
Go and wash your hands.

846
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,500
Okay.

847
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,210
Gosh, look how silly he is.

848
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,080
Sorry. Give us a moment.

849
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,240
(Operating Room)
Sorry. Give us a moment.

850
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,650
(Operating Room)

851
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,500
Where is he and what is he doing?

852
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
O Su Jeong, are you crazy?

853
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,830
How could you feed water to a patient

854
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,730
who might receive an emergency surgery?

855
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,470
You might as well feed him a meal, too!

856
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,740
I didn't feed him water, but

857
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,510
it was my fault that I didn't inform his family in advance.

858
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,510
I apologize.

859
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,780
Are… Are you trying to mess with me?

860
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,750
No. I'm just reflecting on my mistake.

861
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,750
Well…

862
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:47,760
Like I said,

863
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,560
the pretty ones are all trouble-makers.

864
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,760
Exactly. There are people

865
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,330
who always walk on the floor I just cleaned.

866
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,130
Where are they?

867
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,970
Here's one.

868
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,640
-How come here is so…
-What are you doing?

869
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,380
So dirty! Let me clean it!

870
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,550
Hey, Jeo!

871
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,950
It's urgent! Urgent!

872
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,290
What are you doing? You won't do the suction?

873
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,430
Oh, the suction.

874
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:32,600
You can't put it there.

875
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh, not here.

876
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,340
That'll cover the bleeding point.

877
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,450
Avoid the area of bleeding.

878
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:46,380
You need to put it on the side!

879
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,380
Here.

880
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,590
Who are you? Where?

881
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:31,360
Please. Please. What to do?

882
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:49,210
Lift it up. A little bit more. More.

883
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,150
Will you keep it stable?

884
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,860
What is he…?

885
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,840
Sorry. I'm late.

886
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,250
What's up, man?

887
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,980
What? Are you crazy?

888
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,980
Come on. Or what?

889
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,530
You can't even… We are so out of tune.

890
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,800
But this is an operating room. Here.

891
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,600
What was that about?

892
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,110
What…

893
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,220
Eh? How did I get here?

894
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,510
Tweezers, please. Let me hold it. Give it to me.

895
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,140
He… He… He…

896
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,640
The right ventricular catheter ruptured.

897
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,340
What are you supposed to say?

898
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,650
Give me the Prolene suture 5-0.

899
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,500
Darn it.

900
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,730
The catheter is so close to the bone. How can you sew it up?

901
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:26,900
Hand me the electrotome.

902
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,970
What are you waiting for? Stop the bleeding.

903
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,010
You aren't gonna do anything?

904
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,180
Electrotome.

905
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,570
Alright. Now give me the Prolene suture 5-0.

906
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,720
Cut.

907
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:19,720
Cut.

908
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,270
Cut.

909
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,380
Please move. I'll take your place.

910
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,090
What are you trying to do now?

911
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:54,190
The operation will take 12 hours, and adhesion is the easiest problem to deal with.

912
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,760
(Adhesion)
The operation will take 12 hours, and adhesion is the easiest problem to deal with.

913
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:55,860
How can a surgeon who can't even handle that right
(Adhesion)
The operation will take 12 hours, and adhesion is the easiest problem to deal with.

914
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,030
How can a surgeon who can't even handle that right

915
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,800
tackle the following potential difficulties?

916
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,640
In that case, if the kid died,

917
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,980
you couldn't even keep your job,

918
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,750
let alone be promoted as a professor.

919
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,930
Next, we'll dissect the internal mammary artery.

920
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,170
Retractor.

921
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,040
(Michael, I send you the result of today's test. Please call me as soon as you can.)

922
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,060
Open it bigger.

923
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,770
Finally, we'll change the right ventricular catheter.

924
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,440
Give me the artificial valve.

925
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,190
Cut.

926
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,460
Cut.

927
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:41,860
That's it.

928
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,920
Mike, have you checked it?

929
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,450
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

930
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:08,820
Yes. I spoke with Dr. Martin.

931
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,090
Fine.

932
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,290
Thanks.

933
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,930
So,

934
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,570
what's your conclusion?

935
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,470
I think you know the answer.

936
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,450
So…

937
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,990
He doesn't have much time.

938
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,260
It's over.

939
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,330
How long?

940
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:56,940
Maybe about a month at the longest.

941
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,370
I'm sorry, Se Jin.

942
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,840
Oh, gosh…

943
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,150
-=Preview of the next episode=-

944
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,880
Fortunately, that ghost is a doctor.

945
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,020
What if he's Emperor Jade or a Buddha?

946
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,420
What's going on?

947
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,620
Be careful. Just be careful.

948
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,790
I can't be the only careful one.

949
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,320
You are afraid that I'd find your home?

950
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,320
You have to face your passion head-on.

951
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,760
You can't even treat me a meal?

952
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,830
I'm not a fool.

953
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,130
Doctor,

954
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:27,730
why did you enter there?

955
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,700
Am I the first ghost who's possessed your body?

956
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,270
Wait, you can only possess my body?

957
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,270
Are you going to leave soon?

958
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,600
Are you afraid that they'd find out?

959
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,300
Operation?

960
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,800
What took Go Seung Tak so long?

961
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,610
Let's end our agreement.
