(Episode 12)

2
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,740
It is Cha Yeong Min.
(Episode 12)

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,610
It is Cha Yeong Min.

4
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,410
You said last time

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,680
that I spoke as if I were in Cha Yeong Min's body.

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,990
Stop talking.

7
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,090
It's not that I'm in his body.

8
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,160
It's actually the other way around.

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,430
Shut your mouth.

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,030
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,700
He's standing

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,410
right next to me at the moment.

13
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,040
And he's looking very mad.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Don't you dare say one more word!

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
Dr. Go.

16
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,690
Why are you saying that to me?

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,700
Don't you see that she's scared?

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,230
Let's go outside and talk.

19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,370
Try to act naturally, and say goodbye.

20
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,509
Even now he's still worried about Dr. Jang.

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,410
Do you want to be possessed now?

22
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,820
What's the matter with you?

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,030
Why did you tell her

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,530
without discussing it with me first?

25
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,860
Isn't that what you did?

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,259
Acted on your own without discussing it with me?

27
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,470
I've apologized to you, haven't I?

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,270
I tried to hold back but I couldn't help.

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,370
You lost your senses suddenly because of Dr. Jang.

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,770
Yes, that's right. And I still feel sorry for that.

31
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,539
I may feel sorry for Dr. Jang, too.

32
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,210
What?

33
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,110
Perhaps she hates me for this.

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,650
So, she forces herself not to get close.

35
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,350
She even has built a wall between us.

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,120
When will he wake up? Can he wake up?

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,760
Seeing her stay with the one who has no consciousness

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,000
and keep blaming herself when she did nothing wrong,

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
I feel so sad for her.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
So, you told her

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,470
that I've become a ghost, wandering around her,

42
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,240
and that I can possess your body?

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,340
You think

44
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,150
she'd believe you like Han Seung Won did?

45
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,480
Aren't you worried that she'd get scared and confused?

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,150
You have something urgent to tell her, don't you?

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,220
I think she has things to tell you, too.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,290
I will hear her myself and talk to her in person.

49
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,630
I'll look at her in her eyes

50
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,830
and tell her with my mouth.

51
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:11,940
I'll be patient, and I'll tell her everything

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,100
with my own mouth!

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,810
But you don't even know when you'll wake up.

54
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,810
No matter when!

55
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,210
You'd forget everything when you wake up.

56
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,610
Then I'll just start over.

57
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,680
What if you can't wake up?

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,010
I've seen so many people like you since I was eight.

59
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,890
And most of them ended up staying unconscious forever.

60
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,420
Until one day they were gone quietly.

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,590
Have you ever thought that you could miss

62
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,130
your chance to say goodbye to the girl you love?

63
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,840
So you mean I'll die soon

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,700
and I need to say goodbye to her?

65
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,540
I didn't mean that.

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,210
Yes, I'm aware

67
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,010
that any complication

68
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,640
such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, and septicemia

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,250
would make me die and disappear.

70
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,450
I know that.

71
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,490
But even if I can't wake up, even if I die…

72
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,430
Seung Tak, do you know why people can't remember anything

73
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,070
when they wake up from a coma?

74
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,600
Even the fact that they once became ghosts?

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,570
Because they wouldn't be able to live if they remembered.

76
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,970
Anyone who has such experience is like that.

77
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,680
But the living people will remember.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,210
She'd remember the words I wouldn't even remember.

79
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,680
Like you said, if I die,

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,690
even I can't even take that,

81
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,020
how is she supposed to take it?

82
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,890
The world can only go back to normal

83
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,530
when neither of the two sides remembers.

84
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,270
The world of the living has its rules.

85
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,740
Who do you think you are to break the rules?

86
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,909
She'll suffer like hell if her beloved

87
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,750
leaves without saying anything to her.

88
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,080
No one knows that better than you do.

89
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,860
You talk about privacy a lot.

90
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,090
This is apparently an invasion of privacy.

91
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,560
Please don't cross the line again.

92
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,340
You'd better solve the problem you created.

93
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,770
You are good at that. Make things right.

94
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,280
Dr. Go, what did you say just now?

95
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
What did you mean exactly?

96
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,080
What did I say?

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,280
Hey, you brat…

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,590
I don't remember anymore.

99
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,190
I can't recall what I said,

100
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,159
so just pretend that you heard nothing.

101
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,290
What kind of answer was that?

102
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,890
Hey, Go Seung Tak!

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,270
I think I was really wrong about you.

104
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,740
Yes, that's right.

105
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,910
I admit that sometimes your words make me upset.

106
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,340
I think it's my fault.

107
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,040
Because the thought of losing someone I love is too painful,

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,340
and it's the hardest thing I need to deal with.

109
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,410
I appreciate your help these days.

110
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,550
And I think we are dealing with this difficult time together.

111
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,320
I believe that you truly cared about Professor Cha.

112
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,630
But how could you say that you can't recall

113
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,460
and ask me to pretend I heard nothing?

114
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,870
Do you think this is the time for jokes?

115
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,800
How could you make fun of one's life?

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
What kind of freak

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,040
would say those things about an unconscious person?

118
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,010
Well, Dr. Jang…

119
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,780
Let me warn you, Dr. Go.

120
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,120
Don't you dare get involved in anything that concerns Professor Cha.

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,350
And don't go to his ward again.

122
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,720
If I see you there one more time,

123
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,020
regardless of who you are,

124
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,030
I'll throw you into the fire.

125
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,760
Do I make myself clear?

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,010
Gosh! Am I in big trouble?

127
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,610
Yep. You are.

128
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,680
It's the first time you've seen her like that, right? I've seen it many times.

129
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,210
She can be very terrifying when she's angry.

130
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,510
Three or four times more than I am.

131
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,010
But you are truly in big trouble.

132
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,550
What should I do? She said she'd throw me into the fire.

133
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,120
I'll have to possess your body again

134
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,620
and ease her anger to forgive you.

135
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,420
Why don't we just tell her the truth?

136
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,590
Just drop that thought. I told you the answer is no.

137
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,810
He's standing right next to me at the moment.

138
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,040
And he's looking very mad.

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,650
Even now he's still worried about Dr. Jang.

140
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,550
Jerk. How could he make such a joke?

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,790
She'll suffer like hell if her beloved

142
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,890
leaves without saying anything to her.

143
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,289
No one knows that better than you do.

144
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,380
When he got home, he saw

145
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,410
that many of his friends had arrived.

146
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,820
They all said hi to him.

147
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,120
"Hi, I'm Ji Won. What's your name?"

148
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,060
Hi, I'm Seung Jo.

149
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,690
Do you know why people can't remember anything

150
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,260
when they wake up from a coma?

151
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,300
Even the fact that they once became ghosts?

152
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Because they wouldn't be able to live if they remembered.

Who do you think you are to break the rules?

156
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,290
Can you move?

157
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,590
Like this.

158
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,360
Hey.

159
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,230
Come on.

160
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,240
Just forget it. Forget it and live a happy life.

161
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,710
Say whatever you want to say.

(Intensive Care Unit)

164
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,130
I was so happy that day.

165
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,570
I thought I'd become rich.

166

Anyway, I wonder

167
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,040
if Jun Yeong has grown taller.

168
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,810
Son, I hope you can come to see me.

What? Are you scared?

171
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,030
I thought you were an expert. It's not like you've never done it before.

172
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,040
No, but this is…

173
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,870
Dr. An, you seem to have forgotten about it.

174
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,310
I never touched President Jang.

175
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,680
I didn't even tuck him in.

176
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,480
It's also not me who stabbed Professor Cha in the back.

177
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,550
If we let it be,

178
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,690
Professor Cha may wake up any time.

179
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,830
Can you face him?

180
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,600
Since we started it together,

181
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,100
let's finish it together.

182
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,870
You also want to get back to the hospital soon, right?

183
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,740

188
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,990
What's the matter? What's wrong with Professor Jang?

189
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,360
Se Jin, wake up. Jang Se Jin.

190
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,390
Professor Cha?

191
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,130
Check her vital signs.

192
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,530
Yes.

193
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,640
CBC, and ABG test.

194
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,480
Okay.

Are you back?

196
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,290
Uh? Yes.

197
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,730
But why am I here?

198
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,430
I fell asleep in the duty room.

199
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,570
Fear of cold caused by excessive fatigue and lack of sleep.

200
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,040
Slightly malnourished. It's said that she fell down in the ward.

201
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,880
He must've been in a hurry. He didn't even wake me up.

202
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,780
His face was pale when he carried her here.

203
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,650
Is he beside her now?

204
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,890
Right, he's watching her.

205
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,930
Why would she be like this? What did you do to her?

206
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,960
You asked me to help her...

207
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,770
Then you should do a good job. Ask her to have meals on time.

208
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,930
And take shift breaks.

209
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,540
Then be nice to her from now on.

210
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,810
Even a strong man can get sick

211
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,380
if he works like her for months in the hospital.

212
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,120
I know their relationship without you telling me.

It's time to give full scope to your expertise

I'm not forcing you.

218

Dr. An, make your own choice.

219
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,860
Do you want to be confined to a prison in prisoner's garb

220
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,730
or walk in the hospital in a doctor's coat?

It's a nice day today.

222

he may feel better.

He may want to wake up even for you.

Did you cook these dishes with your injured hand?

298
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:12,120
Well, as for that… Though they don't look very good,

299
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,680
they may taste not bad.

Ah, Professor Cha often invited me here.

308

Don't you hate each other?

309
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,860
It's complicated, I guess.

Actually, we are pretty close.

311
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,930
And he mentioned you a lot.

312
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,740
Have some.

313
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,990
Are you leaving so soon?

314
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,860
Why don't you take some rest before leaving?

315
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,000
I've slept well and had food here. I'm fine now.

You can fulfill Professor Cha's wishes for him.

322
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,520
It should also be what Professor Cha wants.

323
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,790
It's slippery here. Be careful.

324
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:03,330
I really... Hoon Gil, what are you doing here?

325
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,070
It's so empty here today.

326

Professor Cha and the new comer are not here. Chun Hui also…

Isn't it also like this in the past?

00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,310
It's nice to be quiet.

329
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,050
(Intensive Care Unit)
It's nice to be quiet.

330
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,880
The past is the past.
(Intensive Care Unit)

331
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,280
Now the quietness makes me feel empty.

332
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,050
Will he be back today?

333
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,260
Of course he will. His body is still there.

334
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,820
Where else can he go?

335
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,630
Nice. He can still go out for fresh air.

336
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,200
It's tiring to wait like this every day.

337
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,740
What? Coma patients?

338
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,740
It's a trouble to keep patients who may wake up any time or never

339
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,870
in our hospital.

340
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,540
Talk with the families and ask them to transfer soon.

341
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,780
Uh, well… I know something happened yesterday.

342
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,120
But the patient is now in a stable state.

343
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,320
Chief Ban, what's wrong with you recently?

344
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,020
Ah?

345
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,160
I've let you go in the kid's case last time.

346
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Shall I mention it to you again?

347
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,360
Now that we've mentioned it, let's have a good talk.

348
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,430
About the patient next to the one who had an accident yesterday.

349
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,140
Little Fish or Walnut Cookie?

350
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,840
The chief surgeon…

351
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,240
Our hospital is short of beds now.

352
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,870
They've stayed here long enough.

353
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,280
It can't go on like this. Of course, right.

354
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,110
Then don't delay it any further.

355
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,920
I have a headache at the sight of those coma patients.

356
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,760
Do you feel uncomfortable?

357
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,830
(Mom)

358
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,700
It can be a little uncomfortable.

359
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,750
Mom, I'm in the middle of something.

360
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,850
I'll call you later. Sorry.

361
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,490
I'm going to put it in.

362
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,090
Just a little uncomfortable.

363
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,660
Hello.

364
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,860
I just want to bring you some snacks. Then I'll leave.

365
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,930
Baby girl.

366
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,230
Did you hang up?

367
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,830
(EunSang University Medical Center)
Did you hang up?

368
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,000
She hung up.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
I haven't come to this hospital for long.
(EunSang University Medical Center)

370
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,410
I haven't come to this hospital for long.

371
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,610
Why does she have to work here?

372
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,910
What floor is the eye department?

373
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,220
Which one is better?

374
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,620
Are you familiar with this store?

375
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,100
Yeah, I came here a few times with Professor Cha.

376
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,930
He asked if I was tired of always wearing the same clothes.

377
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,740
And he criticized me and called me a fashion terrorist.

378
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,370
He said things like that?

379
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,440
What?

380
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,040
Yes.

381
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,880
He said he was good at matching clothes now.

382
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,150
Oh, that one is nice.

383
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,790
Aren't you tired of always wearing the same clothes?

384
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,290
You've worn this one for years.

385
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,030
Do you know what others say about you behind your back?

386
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,700
They mock you and call you a fashion terrorist.

387
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:35,410
Professor Cha has never hated you.

388
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,210
He said he always thought of those happy days.

389
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,910
He just couldn't hate you.

390
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,820
He doesn't hate you at all.

391
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,450
On the day when you met again,

392
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,260
he was angry with you

393
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,560
because you came back too late.

394
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,160
He waited for you so long.

395
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,660
But you didn't return till now.

396
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,000
I guess this should be the reason.

397
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,300
Over the years, Professor Cha…

398
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,110
has become quite twisted

399
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,140
and small-minded.

400
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,450
And now,

401
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,220
in order not to keep you waiting

402
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,160
and to come back as early as possible,

403
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,460
he is doing his best

404
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,470
to fight for recovery.

405
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,870
I know that clearly.

406
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,310
After all, we are close.

407
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,620
It's all done.

408
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,890
As long as you take the prescribed drug,

409
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,220
you'll get better soon.

410
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,920
Well, you look so young,

411
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,560
but you are very skilled.

412
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,730
Thank you very much.

413
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,090
Thank you.

414
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,430
This is my work.

415
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,630
Mom.

416
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,000
Mom, I will explain this to you.

417
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,870
O Su Jeong,

418
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,570
the patient here needs the ABG analysis.

419
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,540
It's an emergency case.

420
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,570
OK, I'll be right there.

421
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,010
Mom, wait here.

422
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,660
O Su Jeong!

423
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,260
Why are you looking around? Hurry to come.

424
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,630
I am coming.

425
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,170
Did you call the patient's family?

426
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,740
Oh, gosh.

427
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,070
Right. Ask them to come to the hospital first.

428
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,040
We'll talk with them.

429
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,710
OK.

430
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,010
Ban Tae Sik, your life is really a mess.

431
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,150
This is not right.

432
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,420
A doctor is also a worker and wage-earner.

433
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,350
In today's world, if I make a small mistake,

434
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,490
I might be ruined.

435
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,360
Well, look! Who is this guy?

436
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,200
(Carry Out EunSang Group's Core Values)
Well, look! Who is this guy?

437
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,630
Ban Tae Sik,
(Carry Out EunSang Group's Core Values)
Well, look! Who is this guy?

438
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,400
(Chapter 5 People-centered Future Medical Culture Creation)
Ban Tae Sik,

439
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,130
you look so handsome.
(Chapter 5 People-centered Future Medical Culture Creation)

440
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,370
you look so handsome.

441
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,170
At the beginning,

442
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,970
I was a doctor with high aspirations.

443
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,270
I got lectured about the doctor's sense of mission

444
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,610
all the time.

445
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,550
Ah, here is

446
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,810
the walking sense of mission.

447
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,950
He was such a great doctor.

448
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,450
He was respected a lot by his juniors.

449
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,290
So what?

450
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,620
He died all of a sudden.

451
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,690
Life is so futile.

452
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,470
That disobedient girl, that disobedient girl.

453
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,470
What? Ophthalmology?

454
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,040
When did ER become ophthalmology?

455
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,340
How could she?

456
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,810
She lied to her mother.

457
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,450
Well, I don't want anything from her.

458
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,850
I only want her to have a good life.

459
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,650
What an unfilial girl!

460
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,150
You are right.

461
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,720
Is there any child who can understand the parents' good intentions?

462
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,560
They all think self-important.

463
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,730
Well.

464
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,630
When your heart is tortured by worries,

465
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,200
you need to calm down.

466
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,710
Drink this.

467
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,670
It's alright.

468
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,610
Your daughter is a doctor at this hospital, right?

469
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,520
Yes, she is.

470
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,150
Oh, you raised her so well.

471
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,660
But you didn't expect that she would work in the ER, right?

472
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,360
It's tough to work in ER.

473
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,760
ER is the most tiring department.

474
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,170
I can't agree more.

475
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,130
She chose the hardest job.

476
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,640
I am so mad at her.

477
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,800
Oh, it's so infuriating.

478
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,810
It is understandable that you are angry.

479
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,410
These days, who will consider being a doctor as a noble

480
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,380
and respectable profession?

481
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Rescuing and curing patients exhausts them every day.

482
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,720
Besides, they work around the clock.

483
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,460
They are too busy to see their family.

484
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,720
What kind of life is that?

485
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,260
It is not a good life.

486
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,930
Nowadays, if one can live comfortably

487
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,330
and make a lot of money,

488
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,960
that will be the best

489
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,300
and that will make one's parents happy.

490
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,500
Am I right?

491
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,800
Madam, how could you say this?

492
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,570
How could a person working at the hospital say this?

493
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,580
If you just want to make more money,

494
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,180
what... what kind of doctor is that?

495
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,510
Why can I still hear this nonsense theory?

496
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,210
Are you alright? If you feel too cold then you should get back into the car.

497
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,180
I'm OK.

498
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,950
It's nice here.

499
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,550
I thought I would never see such nice scenery.

500
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,720
Since you are in so much pain,

501
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,790
why are you staying with Professor Cha Yeong Min?

502
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,000
Nobody knows when he'll wake up.

503
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,230
I apologize. I'm talking too much.

504
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,640
Because I'm scared.

505
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,210
I'm scared that I would let go of his hand again.

506
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,120
12 years ago, I took the initiative to let go of his hand.

507
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,290
I was a fool and lack of courage.

508
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,430
I don't want to let go of him again,

509
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,660
so I'm going to muster up the courage.

510
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,070
But I'm starting to feel scared.

511
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,840
I promised to save him,

512
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,380
but I'm worried that I won't be able to keep the promise.

513
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,150
What I can do is little.

514
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,650
You are doing...

515
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,550
what you can.

516
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,690
Which is staying by his side.

517
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,679
The store doesn't pick up. Director Jo must be very angry.

518
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,150
Grandpa.

519
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,159
My mom has found out,

520
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,290
what will happen to me in the future?

521
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,699
(Entrance)

522
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,710
It seems that I've seen this picture somewhere before.

523
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,910
That being said, it wasn't Go Seung Tak last time.

524
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,650
Ah, Professor.

525
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,880
I've heard that you are not feeling well.

526
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,820
Are you feeling better now?

527
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,450
Are you alright?

528
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,450
I was scared when I heard the news.

529
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,990
Dr. Jang, see.

530
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,760
After taking one day off,

531
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,690
you look better.

532
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,760
To be honest, I've been doing too many meaningful things lately.

533
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,830
By the way, did you take away the black card?

534
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,930
Do you mean that?

535
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,570
It's in Bro Jae Won's hand,

536
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,270
to subsidize the cost of the Department.

537
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,370
I lend you my body and car,

538
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,870
and you still want my card?

539
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,410
It's okay to just use my money once or twice…

540
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,480
Anyhow,

541
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,750
thank you for today.

542
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,750
Why are you thanking me suddenly?

543
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,850
Ah, well...

544
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,150
The cost of the clothes

545
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,860
is 584,000 Won... or 585,000 Won?

546
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,920
Anyhow,

547
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,460
remember to transfer the money to Dr. Jang.

548
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,760
Thank you.

549
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,360
Eh?

550
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,360
The c... cost of the body.

551
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,430
And clothes.

552
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,270
I'm not in Cha Yeong Min's body,

553
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,040
but he's in mine.

554
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,120
I know

555
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,750
how absurd this sounds.

556
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,620
But I hope it's all true,

557
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,360
even only for a day.

558
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,660
I hope it's all like a dream.

559
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,510
I actually study so sincerely like this.

560
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,350
It's such a high wall.

561
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,690
My God.

562
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,060
Son,

563
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,890
you wake up so early.

564
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,300
My God.

565
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,230
Did I wake you up?

566
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,530
So Mom,

567
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,970
what did you do

568
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,470
to wake up your son who hadn't come home for several days?

569
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,340
It's the water pipe construction.

570
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,710
The water has been on and off recently, how troublesome.

571
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,980
I don't know where it's stuck,

572
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,850
the worker says the whole pipe should be replaced.

573
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,920
What should I do? My God.

574
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,520
-Dad.
-Yes.

575
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,620
Are you alright?

576
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,490
Yes.

577
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,960
My dear Grandpa,

578
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,360
why did you stand there?

579
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,330
What should I do?

580
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,060
My God, my God, Dad, what should I do?

581
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,700
If you have something to say, just say it,

582
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,830
don't spray water on me.

583
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,300
My son,

584
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
don't just stand there,

585
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,270
go get a towel.

586
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,540
The pipe, the wall.

587
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,110
-Seung Jo.
-What should I do?

588
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,690
Eureka!

589
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,860
What's going on? Who is it?

590
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,860
What are you doing?

591
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,330
Why are you here at this time?

592
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,600
Well, I'm Go Seung Tak.

593
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,760
Take your time and get changed, I'll wait.

594
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,730
I found something.

595
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,700
What did you find?

596
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,000
What did you find?

597
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,740
It's blocked by a wall!

598
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,900
What?

599
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,810
Blood flow. The blocked blood flow.

600
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,840
You brat, can't you just say it?

601
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,140
Although the brainwaves have improved,

602
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,980
there is a wall blocking something.

603
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,110
That wall, blood vessel, Seung Jo.

604
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,680
Compression of the internal mammary artery due to increased blood flow.

605
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,250
Is it possible that Professor Cha's blood flow there also got compressed?

606
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,050
The examination of this aspect...

607
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,720
We have done it.

608
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,590
CT scan of blood vessels. It was nothing at the time,

609
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,990
and after that, we just watched his brainwaves

610
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,830
because that's the most important thing.

611
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,100
And now the brainwaves are turning better.

612
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,760
Angiography.

613
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,830
What are you talking about?

614
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,830
Let's go.

615
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,020
Let's begin.

616
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,850
OK.

617
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,760
Inject.

618
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,590
The left subclavian artery is OK.

619
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,200
Let's check the common carotid artery.

620
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
OK.

621
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,410
The left common carotid artery is fine.

622
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,510
It's there.

623
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,350
There.

624
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,450
It's the humeral head artery.

625
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,280
The humeral head artery is constricted.

626
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,590
We found it.

627
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,690
It's this one.

628
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,430
Hey, how did you find it?

629
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,360
Unlike somebody, I'm a genius.

630
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,070
When a genius sees the apple falling, he thinks of gravity.

631
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,940
When seeing a bathtub overflowing, he understands density measurement.

632
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,340
Um, hey, hey.

633
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,610
What should I do?

634
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,900
My God, sorry, I couldn't help myself.

635
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,800
It's okay, it's understandable to be overly happy.

636
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,340
We found a solution to Professor Cha Yeong Min's low consciousness.

637
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,070
-What?
-Really?

638
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,440
-Awesome!
-How did you find it?

639
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,290
Here are the results of the angiography performed this morning.

640
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,020
Here, you can see the constriction of the humeral head artery.

641
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,820
As a result, blood flow to the brain is reduced,

642
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,890
which in turn leads to impaired consciousness.

643
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,030
Oh, that's true.

644
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,930
Why did we miss it all the time?

645
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,500
Didn't we do the MRI and CT?

646
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,770
I checked the CT taken at the initial stage,

647
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,400
but did not notice any problem.

648
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,210
After that, the state was not stable,

649
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,040
so it was not reflected in the CT results.

650
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,680
Professor Cha's brainwaves have improved recently.

651
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,110
Could it be because of increased blood flow?

652
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,720
Maybe it... can't be explained by medicine.

653
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,420
Because it happened in an unfathomable territory beyond human measure.

654
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,430
-Unfathomable territory?
-What unfathomable territory?

655
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,500
He was fine just now, why is he like this again?

656
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,330
How remarkable, Go Seung Tak.

657
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,700
You actually found this.

658
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,240
In short, as long as the humeral head artery problem is solved, Professor Cha can wake up?

659
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,580
How should we resolve it?

660
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,310
Artificial blood vessel replacement.

661
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,810
Replace the entire humeral head artery

662
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,910
to improve blood flow inside the brain.

663
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,950
Of course, there is also a safe way, which is to use a shunt.

664
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,020
But since he is a young patient,

665
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,950
the fundamental solution is correct.

666
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,660
Has the surgery been scheduled?

667
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,460
Yes.

668
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,990
It's scheduled for 8 tomorrow morning.

669
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,570
I am going to do Professor Cha's surgery?

670
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,340
Dr. Go, why are you doing this to me?

671
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,170
Thank you for doing Seung Jo's surgery last time.

672
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,910
What?

673
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,980
Knowing that you might be in trouble because of that,

674
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,150
you still bravely grabbed the patient's hand.

675
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,810
You have stepped on the same boat as me since then.

676
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,220
The same boat? I haven't gotten on the boat.

677
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,990
Professor Cha will get on the boat after he wakes up.

678
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,960
Can I get off the boat? I feel dizzy.

679
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,290
Huh? Can I?

680
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,500
OK.

681
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,100
Then, Dr. Go, you will be the assistant, right?

682
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
What? No.

683
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,800
Didn't you hear what Bro Tae Sik said?

684
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,070
How can we do surgery in a state like this?

685
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,580
We successfully completed Seung Jo's surgery, didn't we?

686
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,410
Perfectly done without flaw.

687
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,510
It was dangerous.

688
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,210
Because of that buffer.

689
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,850
You said it was temporary.

690
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,120
Do you know how anxious I was at the time because of that so-called temporary?

691
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,020
There was also something that happened that day we went shopping.

692
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,020
I'll pay you back.

693
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,530
Thank you.

694
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,330
Gee, did I buy too much?

695
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,800
Are you not confident?

696
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,140
Forget it then.

697
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,840
I'm not confident? I'm Cha Yeong Min.

698
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,210
Could it be that my belief in wanting to save patients is inferior to others?

699
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,080
You said that you are afraid of this kind of thing.

700
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,750
You saved countless patients with this state of mind.

701
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:33,190
Is there a doctor who wants to save you more than you right now?

702
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,900
He's making a hit like that. Are you just going to stand by the side?

703
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,230
You said you were going to let him go up the altar and then let him fall.

704
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,000
But why does he keep going up?

705
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,670
When will he fall?

706
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,440
He's such an unenthusiastic boy,

707
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,680
why did he suddenly start working hard?

708
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,080
And now they say he's a genius. How?

709
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,350
Is he really possessed?

710
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,590
My God. We have to resort to exorcism.

711
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,020
Hey, what are you talking about early in the morning?

712
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,030
Aren't you busy?

713
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,000
Being like this, aren't you afraid that he will take away the hospital?

714
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,130
Gee, as an older brother, why have you always been in your younger brother's shadow?

715
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,170
You keep losing to him.

716
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,400
Director Go.

717
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,940
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

718
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,340
Gee, I thought you were going to

719
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,040
grasp the asset that belongs to you like what I did.

720
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,710
I'm so disappointed.

721
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,630
What's the matter?

722
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,030
What? Who is going for a surgery?

723
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,830
No, after taking it, then Professor Cha...

724
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,370
So who is going to perform it?

725
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,070
The surgery is not the most difficult.

726
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,210
Because it's a second surgery, there may be some small problems.

727
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,380
But I can manage to do it even with shaking hands.

728
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,510
It's like Seung Jo's surgery.

729
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,050
What is the most dangerous part?

730
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,880
Where there can be no mistakes.

731
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,790
Here, the native blood vessel and the graft blood vessel

732
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:09,990
will be sutured

733
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,120
(Native: Native blood vessels / Graft: Artificial blood vessels)
will be sutured

734
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,460
when connecting the humeral head artery.
(Native: Native blood vessels / Graft: Artificial blood vessels)

735
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,390
If we accidentally tore the native blood vessel,

736
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,990
we have to go deeper.

737
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,390
Then the operation becomes very difficult and dangerous.

738
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,460
If the suture fails here…

739
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,540
It'll be a disaster.

740
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,690
The chief surgeon is Chief Ban Tae Sik.

741
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,630
The assistant is Dr. Go Seung Tak.

742
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,330
He'll perform on himself.

743
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,870
Tweezers.

744
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,120
Something must have happened.

745
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,360
There must be something between those two.

746
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,870
I'm doing this well now, aren't I?

747
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:38,340
In the beginning, I left scars on your face.

748
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,010
Was that painful?

749
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:45,280
My apology. It was my first time, I had no control over it.

750
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:52,150
I... I can't remember.

751
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,790
Do you know why should we shave unconscious patients?

752
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,800
Because we don't know when they will wake up,

753
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,600
and we hope they won't feel too surprised seeing their face.

754
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,870
So many things happened during that time.

755
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:15,440
When you wake up and see me, you might get angry again.

756
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,980
But if you could get angry wearing a good-looking face,

757
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,680
then you might feel better.

758
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,750
It's OK.

759
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,860
We can start from the beginning.

760
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,930
That's all.

761
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,900
It's the last time I shave for you.

762
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,500
Next time you will do it yourself.

763
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,670
You know what I mean, right?

764
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,380
I heard that you solved the problem.

765
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,850
It's a reward for you, good job.

766
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:58,920
Wow, finally a reward.

767
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,190
Carbonated drink? I'd prefer some milk.

768
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,230
I have to take some protein.

769
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,530
That's a protein drink.

770
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,660
You can supplement protein with that.

771
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,660
Really?

772
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:13,900
How refreshing. Nice.

773
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,940
Like our relationship.

774
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,340
Nonsense.

775
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,540
I haven't been eating much. I use this as a supplement.

776
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,150
Since you mentioned it, I must say you look listless today.

777
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,250
What's wrong? Is it because you haven't been able to go home?

778
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,720
Have you been on duty all along?

779
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,460
To put it accurately, I have been avoiding something.

780
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,830
I don't have the guts to start a fight now.

781
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,300
Against whom?

782
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,530
Has your mom found it out?

783
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,970
Let's talk about my problem later.

784
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,770
You should finish Professor Cha's surgery successfully first.

785
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,040
You must psych yourself up for tomorrow's surgery.

786
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,710
Why need I do that? I am not the one who will operate.

787
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,040
Stop calling me after tomorrow.

788
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,310
Well, it's the last day of such a life.

789
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,250
I feel relieved.

790
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,050
Many people will be happy about this

791
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,890
and many people will be disappointed by it.

792
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:09,990
How about you?

793
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,490
How will you feel?

794
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,500
What do you think?

795
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,640
Well, you said you saw something 20 years ago.

796
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,810
What was it? What did you see back then?

797
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,940
Let's talk about this later, too.

798
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,780
A lot is going on with me these days.

799
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,450
I don't know whether I should hope that kid

800
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,820
would forget everything and live a comfortable life

801
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,920
or hope the kid would live a proper life even if it might be a bit hard.

802
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,230
There is a new patient.

803
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,690
Try to make tomorrow's surgery a success.

804
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,700
Bye.

805
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:01,740
(119 Rescue Squad)

806
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,650
This patient fell while riding an electric scooter.

807
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,990
I guess there is the rib fracture and lung injury.

808
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,220
The chest might also be injured.

809
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,660
Have Go Seung Tak's hands got better?

810
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,430
Call him immediately.

811
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,830
Uh, now Go Seung Tak…

812
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,260
I will call Chief Ban first.

813
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,370
Sir, excuse me…

814
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,040
I finally see you.

815
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,770
Why is it so hard to see you?

816
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:34,010
Professor Cha, I am sorry for asking for your help twice.

817
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,780
Could you help me bring this to the walnut cookies shop?

818
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,610
What?

819
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,780
I heard that you would undergo surgery tomorrow.

820
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,920
That's great! Congratulations!

I know you don't have time for this now,

Anyway, the cookies I made don't sell well.

837
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,990
That's because they don't taste good.

00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,780
Are you afraid that something might go wrong while you're operating?

854
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,850
Right?

Because patients' lives depend on your hands,

00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,570
you must treat them as you treat your patients.

Why must I go that far?

876
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,210
You should go into the operating room more than once a day.

877
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,250
You can either watch others operate or work as an assistant.

Do what you did back then.

If you often go into the operating room, you'll get used to it.

What's wrong? What happened to the patient again?

893
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,640
He has been bleeding in the chest.

His heart is beating faster and his blood pressure is dropping.

He fell while riding a scooter.

896
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,450
Professor Jeong checked his X-ray and CT

897
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:45,980
and said he would do the rib fixation surgery in the morning.

Though the patient has got multiple rib fractures,

his main artery hasn't been torn by the bone.

902

We have drained the blood, and observe him overnight.

903
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,020
Professor Jeong will operate on him in the morning.

904
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,430
The blood is bright red. This means the main artery has been torn.

905
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:01,030
I guess a rib pierced it while he was breathing.

Move him to the operating room immediately.

It's the main artery.

909

Professor Gim is in some other place.

How can we operate now?

Professor Jeong won't arrive till two hours later. That's not good, right?

925

It's the main artery.

926

It is a major operation and a risky one.

927
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,170
That's even more reason for you to do it.

928

What if my hands shake during the operation?

930
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:52,150
During such an operation, if something goes slightly wrong with my hands,

931
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,120
the patient will die. Don't you know?

932
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,150
Then what about your operation?

933
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,950
You will still take the risk, right?

934
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:00,060
That's my life.

935
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,790
When I operate on myself, even if something goes wrong…

936
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,600
Anyway, the patient's life depends on this operation.

985
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,620
I don't have much time left.

986
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:03,990
I am going to die.

987
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,220
You might die before entering the operating room.

988
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,420
There's a patient you need to operate on.

989
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,890
If there is any slip-up, he might die on the operating table.

990
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,600
You want me to operate on Professor Cha?

991
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,730
This will probably be the last time.
