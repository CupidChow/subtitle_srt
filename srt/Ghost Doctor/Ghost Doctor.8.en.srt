1
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,280
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,310
Ah, I'm leaving.
(Episode 8)

3
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,550
Ah, I'm leaving.

4
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,920
Ooh, date?

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,650
-Of course it is. Goodbye.
-Okay.

6
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,660
Oh, darn it.

7
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,760
It's the abdominal artery rupture patient we just told you over the phone.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,500
We don't have a doctor who can do the operation. Didn't I just tell you that?

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
What are we gonna do about him?

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,940
He's in the state of hypovolemic shock. Now we can hardly maintain his vital signs.

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,570
He'll die if you don't do the operation now.

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,310
We can't.

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,310
Please leave.

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,510
I've thought it for hundreds of times.

15
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,980
If I had made another choice that day,

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,650
would I still have lost that person?

17
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,530
If I hadn't grabbed it,

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,160
would I be a different doctor?

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,130
Stop!

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,240
Isn't this a hospital?

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,640
Aren't we doctors?

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,370
If doctors abandon patients, then who will…

23
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,710
You fool, think you are a doctor now.

24
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,150
Hey, why don't you do the surgery on him then?

25
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,350
If I had let it go then,

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,350
would I have a more comfortable life?

27
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,190
Dad.

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,570
Will I be the same?

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,830
Will my whole life get changed

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,370
because of this choice?

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,470
But what to do?

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,340
I can't let go.

33
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,140
I just can't.

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,650
Me, either.

35
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,950
I just couldn't.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,260
I still remember that part till today.

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,390
Please call Professor Min.

38
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,990
I'll try to keep him alive before he comes.

39
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,760
This way, please.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Hurry up.

41
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,570
Hey, Go Seung Tak, what are you doing?

42
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,910
Well,

43
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,070
should we drive a dying patient out?

44
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,380
This can't happen in my hospital.

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,510
This patient has a large abdominal aneurysm.

46
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,210
Go Seung Tak, what can you do?

47
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,220
What should I do?

48
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,690
Severe bleeding.

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,590
If it goes on like this, he'll die before Professor Min comes.

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,560
But… I don't remember what happened next.

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,430
I've totally forgotten as if I had blacked out.

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,370
Start the operation now.

53
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,240
Scissors.

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,900
We're the same on this.

55
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,670
I'm also a nut in the operating room.

56
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,510
What's the matter? Isn't it Chief Ban's operation?

57
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,310
It got his name on it.

58
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,780
I think he'll come.

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,850
Bro, I'm counting on you.

60
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,120
Be prepared.

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,450
Um… Yeah…

62
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,520
Let's keep him alive for Chief Ban.

63
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,590
I don't remember at all.

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,230
Like I fell asleep from that moment.

65
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,260
Hey, are you crazy?

66
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,829
Stay away from the patient!

67
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,500
50% patients with abdominal aortic rupture die.

68
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,140
The rate increases 1% per hour.

69
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,440
He may have had intestinal necrosis now.

70
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,110
There's no time left to delay. Or he must die.

71
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,110
Suction.

72
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,520
Suction.

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,630
Gim Jae Won, suction.

74
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,630
OK, suction.

75
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,630
This is Operating Room 8.

76
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,370
Get any doctor here.

77
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,130
Suction.

78
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,100
We're short of hands here.

79
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,269
They are all interns.

80
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,570
Even Dr. Bak will do.

81
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,270
Scissors.

82
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,310
Retractor.

83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,780
Suction.

84
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,790
Get deeper.

85
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,920
Suction.

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Vascular clamp.

87
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,170
It's under control now.

88
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,170
Blood pressure is rising.

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,370
What are you doing now!

90
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,409
Put on your gown and come to help.

91
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,190
Hold tight.

92
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,830
Wake up and focus!

93
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,730
Don't you see the blood pressure is dropping?

94
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,230
Wait.

95
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,630
Be careful not to touch the vascular clamp.

96
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,200
Oh, right. Careful.

97
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,350
Be careful with the vascular clamp.

98
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,920
Don't touch it.

99
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,810
It seems to be under control.

100
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,550
He survived.

101
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,020
The patient survived.

102
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,920
The patient survived.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,020
You lunatic!

104
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,830
When I woke up suddenly

105
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,630
and looked at myself,

106
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,900
I really felt like a madman.

107
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,550
Professor Min.

108
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,580
What? What's going on?

109
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,350
This intern saved the patient.

110
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,430
But I was afraid back then.

111
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,130
Weren't you?

112
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,140
Wow, have I done it so well?

113
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,480
Oh, why am I always so great?

114
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,080
Lunatic!

115
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,320
I just felt a special feeling.

116
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,650
That's why I wanted to be a doctor.

117
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,420
The patient survived, didn't him?

118
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,090
When Seung Tak was 18,

119
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,030
I thought it was just temporary.

120
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,130
But it seems that he has always been like that.

121
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,770
Or, has he suffered a relapse?

122
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,970
What are you saying?

123
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,950
You know what I'm saying.

124
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,520
It's me.

125
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,890
I can see you, Miss.

126
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,830
I thought it was the aftereffects of the accident.

127
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,800
Besides, since he came to the hospital,

128
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
he has acted weird sometimes.

129
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,270
I'm not the only one who has noticed.

130
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,960
So I asked my friends who once studied in America about it.

131
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,390
Unexpectedly,

132
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,289
I heard something interesting.

133
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,090
I thought when in America,

134
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,659
he would skip classes and have fun outside all day.

135
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,630
But it turned out that he frequented hospitals.

136
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,299
And he visited only Neurosurgery and Psychiatry departments.

137
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,840
It seems that Seung Tak has taken a lot of efforts

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,680
to get himself treated.

139
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,640
So you are still not aware of it.

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,250
That means his grandpa also doesn't know it.

141
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,050
Han Seung Won.

142
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,620
My poor little brother.

143
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,260
He has struggled so hard

144
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,860
to impress his grandpa.

145
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,930
But the hospital is the place of life and death.

146
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,770
And even more coincidentally,

147
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,610
he is a doctor.

148
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,610
(Lee Seon Ho)

149
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,250
What's up?

150
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,980
What operation did Go Seung Tak do?

151
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,150
An ER patient with abdominal aneurysms.

152
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,420
All professors were out. The patient was supposed to be transferred to another hospital.

153
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,190
But Go Seung Tak stopped it

154
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,130
and arranged an operation in Chief Ban's name.

155
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,360
He ordered Gim Jae Won to arrange it.

156
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,260
He also wrote the record yesterday.

157
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,170
Shortly after Lee Ji Woo's surgery,

158
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,500
the same thing happened again…

159
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,340
And these surgeries are not ordinary ones.

160
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,310
It's not just once or twice.

161
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,340
There must be something wrong with him.

162
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,920
Are you okay?

163
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm good.

164
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,960
Where's Go Seung Tak?

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,860
Where is he now?

166
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,700
That is to say,

167
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm not the only one who has experienced this.

168
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,640
The once victim became the victimizer.

169
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,710
Are you passing it down from generation to generation?

170
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,580
What's that expression?

171
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,750
Right, will a person who can see ghosts

172
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,950
be surprised and scared by my story?

173
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,150
Aren't you curious

174
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,520
how I became a genius doctor from an intern?

175
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,730
So what if I knew?

176
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,530
I won't follow suit.

177
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,030
But I do want to know

178
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,300
how you became an ill-tempered doctor

179
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,030
from an intern.

180
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,200
Do you know

181
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,740
who that ghost was?

182
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,840
I don't know.

183
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,770
Because I couldn't see him.

184
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,110
It must be an excellent doctor.

185
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,310
Just like me.

186
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,750
Good for you.

187
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,880
Luckily it wasn't the Jade Emperor or a Buddha.

188
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,450
I was indeed lucky.

189
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,920
I would have been screwed if it had been a doctor like you

190
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
who knows a lot but can't perform.

191
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,390
Did it just happen to you that one night?

192
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,990
Or…

193
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,760
It also occurred several times when I was a resident.

194
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,270
When there were no doctors to operate

195
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,570
and the patients were going to be driven away.

196
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,540
Just like what happened today.

197
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,340
(EMC VIP ICU)

198
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,880
Ji Woo is also one of them.

199
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,510
Her parents failed to notice her symptoms

200
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,350
so that it was too late to operate.

201
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,620
They carried their unconscious daughter to the hospital in the middle of the night.

202
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,260
Hello.

203
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,420
Open your hands.

204
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,930
This is a magic candy.

205
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,800
Hold it tightly in your hand and it won't hurt.

206
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,770
At that time, I promised her

207
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,670
that if she came back in ten years

208
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,180
I would operate on her with my own strength.

209
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,250
I didn't expect that she heard it.

210
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,680
A decent man must keep his promise.

211
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,920
You were being irresponsible.

212
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,650
I almost broke my promise

213
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,550
because of you.

214
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,590
It was not my fault

215
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,260
you had that accident before the surgery.

216
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,760
What?

217
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,990
As you just said,

218
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,230
as a person who can see ghosts,

219
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,060
I'm not surprised or scared.

220
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,930
So…?

221
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,500
Now that you possessed my body,

222
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,030
you should keep your promise.

223
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,200
You borrowed my hands by force,

224
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,270
so you must save her no matter what.

225
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,940
Why are you trying to let go halfway?

226
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,210
What should I do then?

227
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,110
You... So you…

228
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,920
You should be grateful that you didn't die that day.

229
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,550
But didn't you tell me that you would die

230
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,790
if you possessed me too frequently?

231
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,490
Even though I'm not a lifesaving doctor,

232
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,590
I can't kill people, right?

233
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,360
So let's stay away from each other in the future.

234
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,270
Keep a two-meter distance

235
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,900
between man and ghost.

236
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,010
Don't you remember

237
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,010
that it was you who grabbed that patient

238
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,550
and asked me to possess you to save him.

239
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,020
It was you who saved him.

240
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,490
Great.

241
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,560
It was you who grabbed that patient.

242
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,230
It was you who saved him.

243
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,170
I was like you back then.

244
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,210
I also wanted to escape at first

245
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,310
because I got so scared and worried.

246
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,210
But do you know

247
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,650
why I didn't leave but stayed instead?

248
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,530
As you said, because the patient survived.

249
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,640
Though it wasn't my own strength,

250
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,940
it was my hands that saved the patient.

251
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,810
I did my part.

252
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,480
In my operating room,

253
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,180
you must felt the same

254
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,220
when you held the scalpel.

255
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,490
Luckily, I grabbed your hands.

256
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,060
Also because of that, I'm still here and alive.

257
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,030
You are right.

258
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,000
I may never wake up if I keep doing this.

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,170
But even if I had known, I would have made the same choice.

260
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm a doctor after all.

261
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,010
You bought me some time.

262
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,150
But it is running out.

263
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,390
I'd rather do something meaningful

264
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,730
than do nothing and wait to die.

265
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,030
That's why I need your help.

266
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,270
If you don't want me to do it,

267
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,840
then I won't possess you.

268
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,040
After all, you are the Party A.

269
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,090
Su Jeong, don't keep popping up.

270
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,560
I heard the surgery went well.

271
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,360
Why slap me

272
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,060
when you ought to reward me

273
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,830
for such good news?

274
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,940
OK. Come on, I'll give you a reward.

275
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,670
Really?

276
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,470
What kind of reward?

277
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,810
Something to eat?

278
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,240
Expensive one?

279
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,650
What are you doing?

280
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm giving you a reward.

281
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,220
I'm giving you this to make you a strong thoracic surgeon.

282
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,820
What are you waiting for? Di it with me.

283
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,260
Oh! Why deep squat?

284
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Do thoracic surgeons operate with their legs?

285
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,230
You've been so low lately.

286
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,100
It's like you are having some after-effects from puberty.

287
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,040
What's the matter with you?

288
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,740
Nothing.

289
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,310
Maybe just some confusion about self-identity cognition.

290
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,910
If there's something wrong with you identity,

291
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,010
that's a big deal.

292
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,310
What's bothering you?

293
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,950
What about you? Do you have to work in Thoracic Surgery Department?

294
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,220
Do you have to convince your mom?

295
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,760
That's right.

296
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,560
I want to be a doctor like you.

297
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,530
What?

298
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,430
You just saved that patient's life.

299
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,370
Do you know how many patients you've saved recently?

300
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,640
Don't you want to save a patient's life with your own hands

301
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,980
instead of someone else's hands one day?

302
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,120
What do you mean?

303
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,260
I want to be like that someday.

304
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,560
So, I'm gonna work hard and dedicate my life in it.

305
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Oh, my legs.

306
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,030
You don't have to dedicate your life, do you?

307
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,530
Would you risk your life to save someone else's?

308
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,130
You're just a doctor.

309
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,230
You might even die working so hard.

310
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,640
Do you have several lives?

311
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,970
Why would you do that?

312
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,860
You're too tired. Go home and have a rest.

313
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,570
If you keep doing this, you will die.

314
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,140
Thank you.

315
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,080
Thank you so much.

316
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,850
Is he in there?

317
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,190
I'm sorry, Brother.

318
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,900
Brother.

319
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,210
He woke up.

320
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,380
I knew you could do it.

321
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,540
You've had a long day.

322
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
You need to protect your son.

323
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,680
After all, he is very important to you.

324
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,760
Seung Tak had two surgeries.

325
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,790
Two very difficult ones.

326
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,630
Very difficult surgeries?

327
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,870
(EunSang University Medical Center)

328
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,920
Is there something wrong with my husband?

329
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,020
What?

330
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,390
There's no problem.

331
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,920
His operation went well.

332
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,390
I never got a chance to thank the doctor.

333
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Which doctor did the operation on my husband?

334
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,470
It's me.

335
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,610
I'm Chief Ban Tae Sik, the chief surgeon for his operation.

336
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,070
Yes, that's right.

337
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,040
I don't know how to Thank you, Chief Ban.

338
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,410
Thank you very much indeed.

339
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,150
You're welcome. I just did what I was supposed to do.

340
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,950
The operation was difficult.

341
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,250
It's more difficult now.

342
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,220
Why hasn't he come yet?

343
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,210
You are late.

344
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,410
What are you doing here?

345
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,810
I came to greet you.

346
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,710
Are you all right?

347
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,250
You're not worried about me right now, are you?

348
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,450
You were weak yesterday, but you had two surgeries.

349
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,460
Why don't you do some deep squats?

350
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,230
What are you doing?

351
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,500
I'm trying to please you. Because I am the Party B.

352
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,070
Let's get back to normal.

353
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,600
But still, remember you are Party B.

354
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,240
You brat! What time is it?

355
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,310
You are so lax. Come with me.

356
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,880
Dr. Jang is probably waiting.

357
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,480
Why do I get the feeling I've already been conquered?

358
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
Case, timing and state adjustment.

359
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,120
Prior consent is required.

360
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,750
Report in advance.

361
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,420
It is true that young people recover quickly.

362
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,690
Although it's gonna take a while,

363
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,690
with the way things are going,

364
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,530
you may start your rehabilitation soon.

365
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,600
Thank you, doctor.

366
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,670
Hello. Welcome back to the real world.

367
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,110
You know who I am, don't you?

368
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,810
Who are you?

369
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,720
Take a closer look.

370
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,390
Look at my face. You're happy to see me again, aren't you?

371
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,920
It's the first time I've seen you.

372
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,090
He is lying.

373
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,960
What?

374
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,330
How can you refuse to admit now?

375
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,700
A Cheong, maybe…

376
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,770
Don't worry about the hospital fees.

377
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,130
It has been paid.

378
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,540
Who paid for it?

379
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,110
Don't worry about hospital fees.

380
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,080
Everything related to the accident was agreed to with the police.

381
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,650
Just focus on your recovery.

382
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,390
You are young after all. You will stand up again soon.

383
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,330
Right.

384
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,730
What did he say?

385
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,500
He'll give you money if you keep your mouth shut?

386
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
You know that.

387
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,840
While you were in a coma,

388
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,270
who pretended not to know, and who saved you?

389
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,440
Seung Tak. Seung Tak.

390
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,210
Doctor.

391
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,280
How is the driver who hit me in the accident?

392
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,350
He…

393
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,960
Hi, Go Seung Tak, what's the matter so early in the morning?

394
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,400
What's wrong?

395
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,670
Nothing. I just have something to tell you.

396
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,300
Don't cross the line again.

397
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,470
What are you talking about?

398
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,810
It's you who shouldn't cross the line.

399
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,970
You've been giving me a hard time lately.

400
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,710
Yeah, because people keep trying to stop me.

401
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,450
That's why I've been trying so hard not to cross the line.

402
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,350
I'm experiencing identity confusion.

403
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,680
It's not puberty.

404
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,150
So, don't involve yourself in it.

405
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,790
It's not good for you.

406
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,090
-I'm warning you…
-I just warned you.

407
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,590
Just keep it in your mind.

408
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,500
Oh, Go Seung Tak.

409
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,920
Both of you were brought here

410
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,750
after the accident

411
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,090
and had surgery at the same time.

412
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,890
But one of you...

413
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,790
As you can see, he's in this state.

414
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,860
Will he wake up?

415
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,700
With God's help.

416
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,840
You still need a rest.

417
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,510
I shouldn't have asked you that.

418
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,940
But is there anything

419
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,780
you want to tell us about the accident?

420
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,710
No…

421
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,350
Nothing.

422
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,380
Because I don't know why I had an accident.

423
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,190
Oh.

424
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,330
You're a disappointment.

425
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,180
Brother, I'm going to buy something to drink.

426
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,480
Just wait here for a moment.

427
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,360
He didn't lie. He just doesn't remember.

428
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,560
Have you ever met anyone who remembers their past lives?

429
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,200
No?

430
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,970
It's the same thing.

431
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,370
Well, of course he can't remember.

432
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,770
Could he have lived to remember that

433
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,070
he was a ghost in a previous life

434
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,940
and wandered around?

435
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,340
He's not gonna make it.

436
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,710
Is it also an act of God?

437
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,690
The world goes on as it should

438
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,930
when ghosts and the living have no memory.

439
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,530
Do you have any memories you can't lose?

440
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,700
What?

441
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,000
No, it's not for that reason.

442
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,270
Well, I probably don't have to worry about what you're doing.

443
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,550
Either you won't wake up or you'll die.

444
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,450
I'm gonna go.

445
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,670
If he doesn't remember, just tell him.

446
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,500
That's not difficult.

447
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,550
You took the pills that day because you were feeling sick, right?

448
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,690
And you were sleepy.

449
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,820
What?

450
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,530
You didn't mean for an accident.

451
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,600
You were just trying to buy time with a simple crash.

452
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,630
You woke up and found out what had happened.

453
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,340
So, you're in a panic right now.

454
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,440
How do you know that?

455
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,610
Do you know the term cognitive dissonance?

456
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,380
Strange symptoms that arise when one's beliefs

457
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,480
collide with what one is actually doing.

458
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,120
I don't mean to, but I know you.

459
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Why don't you just live your life the way it is?

460
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,950
Otherwise, you'll be miserable.

461
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,060
Where is my soju?

462
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,630
How does it disappear every time I put it here?

463
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,830
Man or ghost.

464
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,900
You're not being obedient.

465
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,670
Don't do it

466
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,610
and don't drink when you're told not to.

467
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,050
You're shortening your own life.

468
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,320
I told you not to throw out the trash.

469
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,420
Don't move.

470
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,160
Take your hands off when I say something nice.

471
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,760
I told you not to take it.

472
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,500
Really. Ghosts are the same as human beings.

473
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,710
But sometimes soju is better than medicine.

474
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,310
Once you taste it, you'll never forget it.

475
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,420
It's out of that world's league.

476
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,820
Come on.

477
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,550
What a pity. We should drink beer.

478
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,060
That's right.

479
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,420
I…

480
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,690
want to drink it. Is that okay?

481
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,810
Can ghosts be drunk?

482
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,450
How can she get drunk with that much alcohol?

483
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,480
I had a hard time getting soju.

484
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,850
-It's good.
-Yeah, soju is good.

485
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,620
Pour me a cup, please.

486
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,190
You…

487
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,260
If you could just let me have that drink?

488
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,710
President.

489
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,640
I heard you wanted to see me.

490
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,510
What are you doing out?

491
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:13,680
I don't want to play go. I wanted to get some air.

492
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,520
I haven't seen such a good view for a long time.

493
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,300
The world is beautiful.

494
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,530
-Why are you standing there? Sit down.
-Okay.

495
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,170
-Can you have a drink?
-Yes.

496
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,010
But I mostly drink red wine...

497
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,110
Soju is the best.

498
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,950
This is for you.

499
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,160
Thank you for your amazing operation.

500
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,590
Drink it.

501
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,670
This one's for being sorry.

502
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,940
Sorry for ruining your beautiful life.

503
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,480
Drink it.

504
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:26,920
This is because I broke you up. I'm sorry.

505
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,070
She has suffered a lot since she went to America.

506
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,270
She refused all my support and persevered alone.

507
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,280
She said that

508
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,210
when I went to see her.

509
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,350
She said she left the most precious people in her life.

510
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,820
She didn't deserve a good life

511
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,090
when she came to America.

512
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,160
She would punish herself for the rest of her life.

513
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,160
I knew when you and Se Jin ran into each other in my ward.

514
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
This is my daughter.

515
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,840
He is that man.

516
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,640
I'm really disappointed.

517
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,480
What are you waiting for?

518
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,980
Drink it.

519
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,120
You are so narrow-minded.

520
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,860
Because of you, she didn't say what was on her mind.

521
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,860
I guess she just left like that.

522
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,130
Her mother died suddenly.

523
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,570
Someone said she was an illegitimate child for no reason.

524
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,470
And her half-brother

525
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,040
treated her like a pest from the first moment he met her.

526
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,900
There's nothing I can do for you.

527
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,030
It was

528
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,030
and it is now.

529
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,270
Sorry.

530
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,480
Sorry, Yeong Min.

531
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,949
Why didn't you

532
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:41,290
try to pluck up the courage before she left...

533
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,580
Se Jin.

534
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,300
The number you dialed is not being answered.

535
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:29,340
Why didn't you wait a little longer?

536
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,220
Are you crying?

537
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,960
No, who's crying?

538
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,360
You did cry.

539
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,190
Your eyes look red.

540
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,790
It's only that sand got into my eyes.

541
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,700
What is wrong?

542
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,060
Here is the good news. Good news.

543
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,430
-The motorbike...
-Bad news!

544
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,900
What? What happened to the motorbike?

545
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,470
I have both good news and bad news. What do you want to hear first?

546
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,140
Tell me the bad news first.

547
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,310
The President calls for an end.

548
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,880
What?

549
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,780
What?

550
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,350
Then tell me the good news first.

551
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,390
Time out.

552
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,730
How could it be possible?

553
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,460
Why? Why does the President call for an end?

554
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,000
Because he is a father.

555
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,300
Pour me one cup too.

556
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,110
This is the drink of consolation.

557
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,970
What?

558
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,780
You have seen it, right?

559
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,880
I am a failure as a father in my life.

560
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,320
Why does this alcohol taste so bitter?

561
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,060
Life is bitter, so is alcohol.

562
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,760
He is my only son, so I spoiled him.

563
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,930
However, I never really trusted him.

564
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,900
I am an unsuccessful father.

565
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,140
My son didn't grow up to be a good person as a matter of course.

566
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,710
I know I am cheeky to ask this of you,

567
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:22,720
but could you take pity on me?

568
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,460
Let me bear the sins

569
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,130
my son committed.

570
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,900
So,

571
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,140
he doesn’t want people to know

572
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,070
the sins of his horrible son, right?

573
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,970
Even if parents are stabbed by their children,

574
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,210
they will help hide the murder weapon.

575
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,240
That is true only when parents are stabbed.

576
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,010
How about you, professor?

577
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,610
What will you do to the person who stabbed you?

578
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,180
Are you as sad and angry as I am?

579
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
It was not easy for him to make such a decision.

580
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,160
Because he knows his son better than anyone else,

581
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,630
he wants to stop him from hurting more people

582
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,160
and to protect his daughter.

583
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,500
I'll take care of the rest in due time.

584
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,340
Let's deal with the urgent matter first.

585
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,540
-He is here.
-He is here.

586
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,580
(Emergency Medical Center)
-He is here.
-He is here.

587
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,980
Is it true that President Jang is still unconscious?

588
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,520
Has something gone wrong with the surgery?

589
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,420
Is it medical malpractice?

590
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,720
Have you been deceiving the people?

591
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,550
Why did you do that?

592
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,790
-Say something, please.
-Say something.

593
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,790
What is this?

594
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,700
(President Jang Gwang Deok of Tianming Group is in a coma — Is his son lying to the public?)

595
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,640
The numbers were indeed abnormal back then.

596
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,610
(President Jang Gwang Deok of Tianming Group is in a coma — Is his son lying to the public?)

597
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,420
(Han Seung Won, Vice President of Administration)

598
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,030
(Emergency Medical Center)

599
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,200
Can he do his job? Darn it!

600
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,810
Keep the media away first.

601
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,470
Can't you see the reporters out there?

602
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,740
Hello, sir!

603
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,810
You are noisy!

604
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,810
Yeah.

605
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,120
What is the reaction of the board of directors?

606
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,190
Keep them silent before I come over.

607
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,760
What's going on?

608
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,130
Why are you here?

609
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,300
Dad looks thinner today than yesterday.

610
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,540
I am so sad as his daughter.

611
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,340
Since when did you start…

612
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,450
Oh, it was you.

613
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,880
You did it, right?

614
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,990
You want to know what exactly I did?

615
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,690
Then you must come clean with me about the bad things you did first.

616
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,290
What?

617
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,990
You didn't do them alone, right?

618
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,230
Speak of the devil. Here he is.

619
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,010
What exactly happened?

620
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,880
Why did the President suddenly…?

621
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,820
Here comes the last one.

622
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,320
Now you are all here.

623
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,160
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

624
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,070
I said this would work.

625
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Mr. Im.

626
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,190
Sir,

627
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,090
I am late.

628
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,100
I'm sorry.

629
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,550
This is the punishment I'll impose on my son.

630
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,450
For that brat,

631
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:51,920
(Rose Gold Hotel 1303)
For that brat,

632
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,860
this punishment will be harsher than being imprisoned.
(Rose Gold Hotel 1303)

633
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,430
this punishment will be harsher than being imprisoned.

634
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,140
This is the President's last will.

635
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,440
When something bad happens to him,

636
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,080
I will only read his will in the presence of all his immediate family.

637
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,520
Also, this is the letter of DNR intent signed by the President.

638
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,390
(Letter of Intent for Life-prolonging Treatment Options: A document indicating in advance that in the event of an irreversible condition, no life-prolonging treatment will be accepted)
Also, this is the letter of DNR intent signed by the President.

639
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:33,030
I think you all know what it means.

640
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,470
What do you mean?

641
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,740
DNR… what?

642
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,140
What is that?

643
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,810
What is that for?

644
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,700
I did what you told me,

645
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,070
but I still don't quite understand.

646
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,670
This is not simple malpractice, but a calculated crime.

647
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,480
Do you have other reasons for doing this?

648
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,980
One reason is that the dead soul can't leave this world peacefully.

649
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,280
For example, he wants to protect someone

650
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,220
or is indignant at what has been done to him.

651
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,790
It's also possible that he can't forget the taste of something.

652
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,430
When you think about it, you'll find there are many reasons.

653
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,900
What do you mean?

654
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,700
For the time being,

655
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,070
could you trust me and wait patiently?

656
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,970
If you don't trust me, trust Professor Cha Yeong Min.

657
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,180
Let him handle the rest after he wakes up.

658
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,850
First, let's enable the President to leave this world peacefully.

659
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,250
Let's deal with the urgent matter first.

660
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,220
Will Dr. Jang agree to do that?

661
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,660
She will.

662
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,460
She is a doctor and his daughter.

663
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,970
How could I…

664
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,510
I can't do that.

665
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,810
Is there anyone else you can trust?

666
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,510
I definitely received a report saying that President Jang came around.

667
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,980
The details will be found out through investigations.

668
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,850
It might be the malpractice or mistake of the medical team in charge…

669
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,450
That is to say…

670
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,090
You didn't know, right?

671
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,890
It's my negligence.

672
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,490
I should have checked upon him in person in the ward.

673
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,990
So it has nothing to do with you?

674
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,730
What are you trying to say?

675
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,530
Well, come on.

676
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,070
You know clearly what I mean.

677
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,970
-Ms. Sung.
-Han Seung Won.

678
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,010
Whatever you did and whatever you want to do,

679
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,250
leave it at that.

680
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,980
If you take another step,

681
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,050
you'll fall off the cliff.

682
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,050
Remember this.

683
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,760
Handle this matter properly.

684
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,660
Handle it only on the basis of medical facts.

685
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,600
This is a hospital that decides whether people can live.

686
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,610
And you happen to be the vice president of administration.

687
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,170
Right?

688
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,750
Seriously though, why have you made things so complicated?

689
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,320
I am sorry.

690
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,050
Do you think you can conceal this?

691
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:45,090
You have made such a big mistake.

692
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,090
What?

693
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,630
This is why doctors are blamed.

694
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,230
If doctors make mistakes and hurt the patient,

695
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,630
they should admit their fault honestly and undertake the liability.

696
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,070
Because doctors always try to cover their mistakes up,

697
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,000
patients tend to sue doctors.

698
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,170
Is this okay?

699
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:02,770
No…

700
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,240
Luckily, his son doesn't want to make a big deal out of this.

701
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,210
Therefore, the hospital won't file a criminal complaint against you.

702
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,310
You will leave the hospital quietly.

703
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,020
Then this matter will be settled.

704
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,990
Sir!

705
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:17,520
If you have anything else to say,

706
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,820
let's go to the police station first.

707
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,960
(Emergency Medical Center)

708
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,700
Stop.

709
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,810
Are you the person

710
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,140
who has transferred me to the hospital close to my home?

711
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,140
Thank you.

712
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,550
Though it was not my idea,

713
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,880
I will pass on your thanks.

714
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,280
I will keep my promise

715
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,390
and subject myself to legal punishment.

716
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,650
Regain your health first.

717
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,060
After he wakes up, he will make his own decision about

718
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,160
your punishment.

719
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,160
Do wake up, please.

720
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,300
Please.

721
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,300
Let's go.

722
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:12,810
What have you been doing since a while ago?

723
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,420
I have been doing nothing.

724
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,090
What? Are you afraid that I'll jump from here?

725
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,790
That won't happen.

726
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,610
You need to have several medical examinations.

727
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:50,750
I'll escort you.

728
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,160
There is something for you to do now.

729
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,570
I am fine. Go be with her.

730
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,170
She must feel very sad.

731
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,150
If you feel bored, will you

732
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,320
play a game of Go with me?

733
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,660
We have to make one thing clear.

734
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,930
Why don't you use honorifics talking to me since you look much younger than me?

735
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,860
Though I look younger than you,

736
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,730
I have been dead for 20 years.

737
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,200
In this sense, I am much older than you, right?

738
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,770
Ah, is that true?

739
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,580
Gosh, I am sorry.

740
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,780
Sir.

741
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,620
You go first.

742
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,050
OK. I will give it a try.

743
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,490
Let's see.

744
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,670
His brain pressure is high.

745
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,210
The antiphlogistic didn't make it to the brain.

746
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:28,140
There are signs of Pseudo SAH.

747
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,180
(Pseudo SAH: Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by serious brain edema after hypoxic brain injury)
There are signs of Pseudo SAH.

748
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,310
(Pseudo SAH: Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by serious brain edema after hypoxic brain injury)

749
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,290
Well, your shoulders are so tense.

750
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,260
You have lived your life that way. You still want to be like that?

751
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,800
I've never lost in my whole life.

752
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:14,890
The brain waves are gone.

753
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,160
Let me see.

754
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,800
At this rate we'll have to stay up the entire night, bro!

755
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,240
You talk too much.

756
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,870
I don't have much time left, bro.

757
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,780
Stop pushing me! Stop! Gosh.

758
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,260
You pushed me!

759
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,590
Diagnosis conclusion,

760
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:34,570
no brain function detected.

761
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,840
Seriously, at your age,

762
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,810
how could you still not understand what Go is really about?

763
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,610
Look, what is Go? Playing Go is a hobby.

764
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,350
And what is hobby? Hobby is relaxation.

765
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:48,620
Why do you have to think when you try to relax?

766
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,150
Back to my time, flipping Go stones was a very popular game.

767
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,590
It requires wrist skills

768
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,190
and the flexibility of your knuckles.

769
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,860
It's a very nice practice.

770
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:06,900
Bro, you talk too much!

771
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,770
(Only one guardian allowed for emergency meeting.)

772
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,500
I'm sorry!

773
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,100
I'm sorry!

774
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,700
I'm sorry!

775
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,710
Come on, bro, could you please go easy on me?

776
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,980
You want to win?

777
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,720
This is my very last Go game in my life, isn't it?

778
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,630
Look at you.

779
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,700
There's no winning or losing in game.

780
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,800
Neither is there in life.

781
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:18,210
A life without winning or losing is actually a good life.

782
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,680
President Jang,

783
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,980
rest in peace.

784
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,190
(Jang Gwang Deok)

785
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,790
I think Professor Cha Yeong Min would also want to pay his respect.

786
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,190
(Jang Gwang Deok)
I think Professor Cha Yeong Min would also want to pay his respect.

787
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:52,870
Did it go well?

788
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,200
Thanks to your help.

789
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,070
I mean my car.

790
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:00,340
Hmm. I've driven it back.

791
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,780
Did you park illegally?

792
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,410
I didn't.

793
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,010
How's my kid doing?

794
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,820
That kid is a tough creature.

795
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,620
Bring it to me when I'm ready.

796
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,020
You should pay my money back first.

797
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,490
Gee, you are such a rude brat.

798
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,320
How did I wind up with you?

799
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,890
If you think I'm brazen-faced, you can find another host.

800
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,860
Are you going to stop now?

801
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,170
I think you are about to put an end to your mission.

802
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,700
My mission?

803
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,970
Anything else you want to do?

804
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,580
What is it?

805
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,610
There's no point for idling. I have plenty of time.

806
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,350
Maybe you don't get it,

807
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,780
but time is all a ghost has, and it always waits for something to do.

808
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,400
So…

809
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,000
(EunSang University Medical Center)

810
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,370
Let me do it!

811
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,100
(EunSang University Medical Center)

812
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,700
What?
(EunSang University Medical Center)

813
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,200
What?

814
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,210
You mean you want to do it, Dr. Go?

815
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,940
I've done many heart operations.

816
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,580
I'd like to try lung operations, too.

817
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,610
Before I become a specialist, I need to be knowledgeable about all kinds of illnesses.

818
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,110
Are you serious?

819
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,480
Sometimes I do think that I should follow the trend

820
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,180
and put into my full dedication.

821
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,650
Cooperation. What do you say?

822
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,490
Of course!

823
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,390
A specialist should be willing to challenge himself.

824
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,720
If he's good at one field only, his development will be limited.

825
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,360
When shall we start next week?

826
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,130
Monday!

827
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,930
(EunSang University Medical Center)
Monday!

828
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,100
Hold on. I also have a few operations here.

829
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,900
Let's work together. We'll form a golden team.

830
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,000
If you'd like, you can join all my operations.

831
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,690
Am I your avatar?

832
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,720
Nope. You are Go Seung Tak.

833
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,690
Hurry and run! What are you waiting for, brat?

834
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,400
Feels like I'm being bullied again.

835
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,700
Have you lost your mind? I am Party A!

836
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,800
Gloves.

837
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,940
Go Seung Tak?

838
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,710
Intern O, take the knife out gently.

839
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,040
What?

840
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,040
Yes.

841
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,480
Well… Oh.

842
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,580
Slowly.

843
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,490
Retractor.

844
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,660
Go deeper.

845
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,830
There's arterial bleeding.

846
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,160
Prepare for hemostasis.

847
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,340
He's been very active at work.

848
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,180
The rumor said that he was crazy and possessed.

849
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,350
But now people think whatever Seung Tak does is normal.

850
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,890
They start to believe that he's that type of person to begin with.

851
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,590
Everybody thinks

852
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,960
that he's a talented doctor

853
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,790
who has golden hands.

854
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:02,060
They all think so.

855
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,990
How about his body?

856
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,800
Anything wrong with that?

857
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,540
I haven't been home for days.

858
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,080
What am I doing?

859
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,680
Are you out of mind?

860
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,510
I don't feel tired at all doing this.

861
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,680
I feel fine.

862
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,580
I'm not at all tired.

863
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,550
It's so nice that you are a ghost.

864
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,860
But I'm a human being.

865
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,560
I need break and sleep.

866
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,430
You aren't a human being.

867
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,530
You are a 1st year resident doctor.

868
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,700
In my first year at work,

869
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,400
I didn't go home for a whole week.

870
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,440
And I couldn't even get two-hour sleep every day.

871
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,540
You are so lazy.

872
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,280
Stop talking about your first year.

873
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,880
Are you asking me to keep working till I die?

874
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,910
Just give me a break.

875
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,680
One should always keep his promise.

876
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,620
Don't be irresponsible.

877
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,290
Who said that?

878
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,400
It's getting so…

879
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,670
I've never done abdominal artery surgery before.

880
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,770
What's going on with Go Seung Tak?

881
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,100
Well, Chief,

882
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,070
in that case, about Professor Cha's patients, shall we…

883
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,570
I don't think that was his intention considering what he said.

884
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,910
But judging by the two patients he's operated on,

885
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:31,310
you can tell that he prefers children and young female patients.

886
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,520
As the Chief, it's not proper for me to say anything.

887
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,690
I guess we'll have to transfer the rest patients to another hospital.

888
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:48,560
What do they mean by "prefer"?

889
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,200
What kind of person do they take me for?

890
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,570
A doctor who's picky about his patients?

891
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,600
How dare they touch my patients?

892
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,810
I'm talking about doctors, not regular people.

893
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,610
And I didn’t pick Seung Jo and Ji Woo on purpose.

894
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,780
Besides, I can't afford to give you a break.

895
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,880
Just hang in there for a few more days.

896
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,150
It'll be over soon.

897
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,790
If you don't want to,

898
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,390
I'll give up.

899
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:21,160
After all, you are Party A.

900
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,480
Go Seung Tak… How come he knows everything?

901
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,890
Though he knows, he only let out half.

902
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:49,890
That wicked woman.

903
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:53,290
I knew she'd do that.

904
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:56,630
She must have talked to Lawyer Im and found out everything before she came back.

905
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,440
The Bokji Group is all hers now.

906
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,700
That old man took everything that should've belonged to me away from me.

907
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,870
And he said he'd give all his money back to the society.

908
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,510
He must've had a great sense of responsibility.

909
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,180
My father was so extraordinary.

910
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,180
Stop drinking. Let's go.

911
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:16,990
Here.

912
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:19,990
Hey,

913
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,690
are you laughing at me, too?

914
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,860
Because I'm broke?

915
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,830
What's so great about you then?

916
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,970
You told me that you are also overshadowed by your cousin.

917
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,040
Darn it, you jerk…

918
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,880
I heard he's a talent.

919
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,940
Somebody must be so happy

920
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,980
that he has such an outstanding cousin.

921
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:57,460
I won't let that woman off.

922
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:02,560
I'm going to kill Jang Se Jin!

923
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,590
Alright.

924
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,360
Ouch! My leg!

925
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,690
Ow! Ow! It hurts!

926
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,360
Ow! Ow! Ow!

What are you doing? Hurry up!

930
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,610
He's so excited.

931
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,050
Okay, be right there.

932
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,680
Wait for me!

933
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,360
Why did you call me to come here this late?

934
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,200
I have something to show you.

01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,150

01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:39,230
Are you with me by any chance?

940
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,910
What's this?

Is it true that Professor Cha shows brain function?
(Special thanks to guest star Ahn Hee Yeon)
The fate changed.

947
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,480
Is it true that Professor Cha shows brain function?

948
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,550
I heard about the theory of "happy hormone".

949
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:46,720
It can produce positive boost to the brain and change the patient's condition.

950
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,920
Come on, let's go catch the Gyeok Ryeol.

There aren't enough.

Let's work together from now on.

953
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,290
We'll target the alive and the dead at the same time.

954
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,590
Is it the time to chat?

955
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,860
I'm not chatting.

956
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,830
If you use me for something sweet…

957
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,670
Don't worry. I won't do that.

958
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,770
It's you, isn't it?

959
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,200
I'll prove it to you.

960

Go Seung Tak is Cha Yeong Min.
