00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,342
Pricks. Move!

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,242
You son of a bitch!

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,361
And who are you?

6
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,104
I'm Shining Muroto.
I've come to challenge your dojo!

7
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,265
Bring out your master!

8
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,244
I am Rin Saejima.

9
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:51,114
I am the master of this Shin-Kage Itto-ryu dojo.

10
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,078
Huh. Well, well. A WOMAN, huh?

11
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,092
I shall be your opponent.

12
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:09,201
If I win, this dojo is mine.
And you'll be my woman.

13
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,087
I'll fuckin' kill you!

14
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,300

00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,196
Man, that's nice!

18
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,188
Is someone there?

19
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,154
W-wait!

20
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,275
She's burning up!

21
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,239
Wh-what are you...?!

22
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,271
You had a terrible fever,
so at the risk of being forward...

23
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,274
I see. Thank you.

24
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,147
There's no need for thanks.

25
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:02,187
You seem to be of a military family.
Why were you dressed so?

26
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,099
I cannot say. Do you
also practice the sword ans?

27
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,267
I'm still just a student.

28
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,270
What is your name?

29
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,313
L-| am Yasaburo.

30
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,314
I came here to Edo from a small village
in Shimofusa to study the sword ans.

31
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:38,321
I am Rin Saejima. I am master
of the Shin-Kage Itto-ryu dojo.

32
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,098
Come visit my dojo.

33
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,297
You shouldn't be moving yet.

34
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,270
Ah! I-I'm sorry.

35
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,080
I wish to thank you.

36
00:06:56,216 --> 00:07:00,346
Th-there's no need for thanks.

37
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:43,352
A dream?

38
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,328
An illusion? No.

39
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:54,200
This is definitely real. My hand is still warm.

40
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,242
In any case, I'm glad that you're safe.

41
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:18,354
I'm very sorry. I'd hoped the plan would go well,
but THIS was the result.

42
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,188
Still, for my infiltration
to have been so easily noticed...

43
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,323
I can only think they must
have been told beforehand.

44
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:34,235
I know full well how careful you are.
I will look into this matter.

45
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:39,167
If there is a betrayer,
he won't escape investigation.

46
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,213
Still, I'm glad it was just anesthetic.

47
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,252
If it had been the aphrodisiac, then right now...

48
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:54,251
I received word earlier.
It seems a third victim has surfaced.

49
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,165
No matter what, we must find
the source of that drug.

50
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:06,331
I have an idea. Will you leave this matter to me?

51
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,335
Welcome!

52
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,203
It's no good!

53
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,241
That woman's naked body distracts me.

54
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:47,206
When I try to rid it from my thoughts,
I put too much strength into my technique.

55
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,227
It's you!

56
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:19,236
I am the master of the
Shin-Kage Itto-ryu dojo, Rin Saejima.

57
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,307
I ask that we cross swords.

58
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,243
This isn't a dream.

59
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,289
Why is she here?

60
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,061
WHY?

61
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,262
No! I have to concentrate.

62
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,140
Still, her stance has no opening...

63
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,335
It's no good! At this rate, I'll get nowhere!

64
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,321
I've lost.

65
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:10,318
I wish to again give thanks for the other day.

66
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,065
Thank you.

67
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,172
Why are you here?

68
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,236
I have something to ask of you.
Are you free now?

69
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,318
You know of Edo's inner palace, yes?

70
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,109
Yes.

71
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:39,054
A forbidden aphrodisiac
is being passed around there.

72
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,251
Aphrodisiac?

73
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:46,224
It's said that if you rub it on a woman's
private areas, she'll crave sex till death.

74
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:51,300
Climax after climax, she will seek men
until finally it kills her.

75
00:12:54,107 --> 00:13:00,240
It's claimed three victims in the palace.
We are still searching for the source of the drug.

76
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,275
Why is someone from a military family,
a master like you, involved?

77
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:09,317
I am a secret Guard of the Inner Garden.

78
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,126
"Guard of the Inner Garden"? I've heard of that.

79
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,230
They look into incidents in Edo
that can't be made public.

80
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:24,170
Exactly. This matter cannot be made public.

81
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:30,243
The matter fell to me, but...
my infiltration was a failure.

82
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,338
The day that I met you?

83
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,276
The previous night, dressed as a courtesan,

84
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:42,187
I'd infiltrated a meeting about which
we'd heard strange information.

85
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:48,193
Perhaps because my identity was known,
anesthetic was slipped into my saké.

86
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:54,124
Sensing danger, I attempted to flee,

87
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:59,128
and after a fight with my pursuers
I somehow escaped into the forest alive.

88
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,240
So that's what happened?

89
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:20,251
I've gauged your skill, and would ask a favor.
Will you perform this search in my stead?

90
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,185
M-me?!

91
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:29,167
Given that this concerns aphrodisiac,
a woman was chosen to head the search.

92
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,266
But I think a man would be better suited.

93
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,110
Is something the matter?

94
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:46,210
It's nothing. First, seek out the girl Onami
at the Uega-ya drapery shop.

95
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:51,283
She was recently allowed leave from the
inner palace yet refuses all talks of marriage.

96
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,317
Onami may be distributing
the aphrodisiac at the palace.

97
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,355
Very well.

98
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,166
I'll do it.

99
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,101
You agree to this?

100
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,263
Yes. I'll do my best.

101
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,335
I'm counting on you.

102
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,268
<i>Okay-</i>

103
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,276
Good morning.

104
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:24,223
I quickly began following Onami,
the girl at the drapery shop.

105
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,335
And a few days later...

106
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,263
M-may I help you?

107
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:24,326
Huh? Uh, I am Yasaburo,
a servant of the authorities!

108
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,299
We've received word of a forbidden aphrodisiac!

109
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,237
Could THAT... not be it?

110
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,185
Why do you run?

111
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,350
I cannot stand being seen, having been
caught in such embarrassment!

112
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,063
Yeah, I bet... Rather, what
you were doing isn't important!

113
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,089
So, this is the aphrodisiac?

114
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,331
I've heard of the rumors. But this is...

115
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,333
But what?!

116
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:07,179
This is... It's taro root paste,
made to cheer me up.

117
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,342
In that case...

118
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,345
Do it.

119
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:26,157
YOU do it, please. With your hand.

120
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,260
Such thick fingers!

121
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:18,339
P-please! Put your member inside of me.

122
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,305
Is this REALLY taro root paste?

123
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,083
It's not aphrodisiac?

124
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,056
If it were aphrodisiac, I would already have cum.

125
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:38,129
Onami. You know something
about the aphrodisiac, don't you?

126
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:45,102
P-please enter me! Then I'll...

127
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,184
Quickly!

128
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:10,329
Onami.

129
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,195
And from behind as well, please.

130
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,291
Onami! Tell me what you know!

131
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,111
M-Miss Miyuki, the lady-in-waiting...

132
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:43,181
They say she knows Master Genemon,
head of the Fujinoya shipping agency,

133
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,215
and that she frequently comes and goes.

134
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,128
I-it could be...

135
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:57,067
Miss Miyuki is... bringing the forbidden
aphrodisiac to the court...

136
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:03,074
Miss Miyuki the lady-in-waiting...
That's some good information!

137
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:20,155
I raced to deliver the news.
I long to see Mistress Rin's smiling face!

138
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,128
<i>Xmv-nﬂm: (WO-IZVU DOJO</i>

139
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,100
Are you all right?

140
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:10,300
Can I beat you not even once, Mistress Rin?
I am truly worthless.

141
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,105
That's not true.

142
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:23,188
Why can I not win against this slender body?

143
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,250
Perhaps you are holding back your strength.

144
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:31,287
Not at all. Were I to do that,
your father would have rebuked me.

145
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:39,332
You have truly become strong.
I'm sure your father would be proud.

146
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,299
<i>Yasaburo'?</i>

147
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,283
That is an unfamiliar fellow.

148
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:01,315
Yes. He is Yasaburo, and he's
assisting me with the search.

149
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:04,324
He's from Shimofusa and is
studying the sword ans.

150
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,133
And? Is he good?

151
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,169
He is skilled in his own right.

152
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,131
He looks like a man to be trusted.

153
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:21,144
Now then, if you'll excuse me.

154
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,056
What are you doing out here?

155
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,192
Who was that man just now?

156
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:49,197
That was Kageyama, my father's
trusted friend. I owe him much.

157
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,270
Owe him, huh?

158
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,113
Are you jealous?

159
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,250
Why would I be jealous?!

160
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:04,053
In any case, you've found
something out, haven't you?

161
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,251
Join me in a drink. I'll hear your story.

162
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,251
I'll go get ready.

163
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:14,098
SAKE

164
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,268
Miyuki the lady-in-waiting?

165
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,293
Yes.

166
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:23,173
I've heard of her. She is a strict woman.

167
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:28,336
Her age is not known, and there are
many strange rumors about her in the court.

168
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,344
She's that remarkable?

169
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:35,313
I've only heard rumors,
and have never seen her in person.

170
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:45,094
Also, about the Fujinoya shipping agency...
It was Fujinoya that held the meeting I infiltrated.

171
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,264
Then that means...

172
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:51,264
This is big news indeed.
You've done well, Yasaburo!

173
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,209
No, it's hard to take praise
from you, Mistress Rin.

174
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:11,180
Kageyama is a secret Guard of the Inner
Garden, the senior who gives me my orders.

175
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,283
Is that so?

176
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,255
My father worked as a secret guard as well.

177
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,160
He died one year ago.

178
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:34,137
My father set out to investigate this aphrodisiac.

179
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:39,277
At the time, there weren't yet any victims.

180
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:45,250
But a woman appeared in the court
who'd lost her wits, was acting violent.

181
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:51,154
My father, being a secret guard, acted covertly...

182
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,335
And one day, he was struck
from behind and killed.

183
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,185
That's terrible. Who did it?!

184
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,318
The crime was done at night,
and there were no witnesses.

185
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:23,158
The matter is unsolved, with no criminal caught.

186
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:33,299
By this investigation, I intend to find
who killed my father.

187
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:42,077
Your father found the source of the aphrodisiac,
and was killed to keep him quiet.

188
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,344
Is that your thinking, Mistress Rin?

189
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,314
Well done, Yasaburo. You're quite clever.

190
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:50,288
No.

191
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:58,060
If I locate the aphrodisiac's source,
I believe I'll find my father's killer.

192
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:06,271
This is an extremely personal matter, but...
I wanted you to know, Yasaburo.

193
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:14,271
If one such as I will do, please tell me anything
at all! I think it would do your heart well.

194
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,305
Thank you.

195
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:23,111
Kageyama knows of this as well.
He was, after all, my father's man.

196
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:30,159
Since my father's death, he has looked after me
like a member of his family.

197
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,128
He is important to me.

198
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:41,264
I did not know he was such a man. I'm
ashamed at having had such strange thoughts!

199
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:51,078
Enough of that. I was happy
to know your feelings, Yasaburo.

200
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:13,328
Yasaburo. The moon is beautiful.

201
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:52,110
Yasaburo... The pain continues
till it's unbearable.

202
00:31:54,246 --> 00:32:00,208
Even without drugs, that's how
a woman's body becomes.

203
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,316
I'm counting on you, Yasaburo.

204
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,233
<i>Fill!</i>

205
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,082
Has Onami been dealt with?

206
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,120
Yes, earlier.

207
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,095
So you were enough of a man to silence her?

208
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:50,201
A mere peasant. More importantly,
are you all right with this?

209
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:53,236
Doing it yourself, Mistress Miyuki.

210
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,211
I'd like to have a little fun, too.

211
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,154
It's been two days since then.

212
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,351
Miyuki hasn't taken a single step
outside the castle.

213
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,069
Has something happened?

214
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,066
A dead girl, wrapped up in a bamboo mat.
It's a terrible thing.

215
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,301
Did you... know Onami?

216
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,134
Recently. Not for long.

217
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,343
I left the imperial court with her.

218
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:19,247
I never dreamed this would happen.
I should have been more watchful!

219
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:26,187
I am investigating a forbidden aphrodisiac
that has been circulating the palace.

220
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,230
That is how I encountered Onami.
You know something, don't you?

221
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:42,271
My apologies. But why try to flee?

222
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,216
Let us go somewhere private.

223
00:34:55,127 --> 00:35:07,233
I... cared for Onami as a younger sister.
But when she took that drug, she lost her mind.

224
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:15,110
I'm grateful it was a small dose. Somehow,
she was able to rid her body of it...

225
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:20,342
It was around then that she and I
became estranged.

226
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:34,132
That drug has no place in this world! If you know
something about the aphrodisiac, please tell me.

227
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:38,262
I know nothing about the aphrodisiac.

228
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,207
Furthermore, I've not been to
Fujinoya even once.

229
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,335
Then why kill Onami?

230
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:54,177
Perhaps out of spite toward me.
Onami and I were once a couple.

231
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,052
But you're both women!

232
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:06,130
It happens often at the court.
Two women, fulfilling each other.

233
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:11,166
"Fulfilling"? You mean you had relations?

234
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:17,166
Onami had relations with YOU as well.

235
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:23,146
She no doubt resented the fact
I no longer cared for her.

236
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:29,279
I wanted to meet you.
That's why I went to see Onami, so...

237
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:34,316
Who would do something so terrible?!

238
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:49,199
I will find the culprit, for sure.

239
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:06,156
This small vessel... Onami and I
used this when we had relations.

240
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,290
I continue to use it to comfort myself.

241
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:25,202
Won't you please comfort
this lonely body of mine?

242
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:29,307
No... No! I'm not worthy...

243
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,083
H-hey!

244
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,223
No, no...

245
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,284
Hey!

246
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,247
Such a splendid member.

247
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,276
I'm jealous of Onami.

248
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,345
Hey!

249
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:14,155
Do I repulse you?

250
00:38:15,227 --> 00:38:18,288
N-no. But, our statuses...

251
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,331
Never mind status!

252
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,276
No.

253
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:38,205
A man and a woman have no need of status.

254
00:41:54,279 --> 00:42:00,184
Mistress Miyuki...
We may be back to square one.

255
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:07,282
That was incredible.
I have to get back to the castle.

256
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:18,327
I don't know if this will be of any use,
but hearing of Fujinoya from Onami,

257
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:23,137
I grew suspicious and did some investigating.

258
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:27,201
Anything will help! Please tell me!

259
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:36,248
At six tomorrow morning... A package from
Nagasaki will arrive at Fujinoya.

260
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:40,191
Once he's sorted it, he'll deliver
something to the castle.

261
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,317
What's inside?!

262
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:50,228
That I do not know. But deliveries always
come to the castle at the start of the month.

263
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,100
It is unusual for him to deliver it himself.

264
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,104
Six in the morning...

265
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:06,208
If you could strike Onami's killer...
It was with this in mind that I told you.

266
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:15,057
I'll do some investigating.
I WILL get Onami's killer.

267
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,337
A duel for real, huh?

268
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,085
I'll have to prepare myself.

269
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,188
What is it?

270
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:48,088
Uh, nothing really.

271
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,328
Do you have more good news?

272
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,155
Nothing in particular.

273
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,191
I see.

274
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,329
You should beware of Miyuki.

275
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:07,202
I've heard from another source that
her connection to Genemon is a close one.

276
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,343
Mistress Rin, have you ever
dueled with live swords?

277
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,277
Why do you ask?

278
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,186
Uh, no reason.

279
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:25,093
Yes, I have. But all ended in a strike
with the back of my blade.

280
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,357
YOU sure are strong...

281
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:36,164
Striking someone down requires anger.
Being strong or weak isn't enough to kill.

282
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:41,338
When I find my father's killer,
I'm sure I can strike him down.

283
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,207
Anger?

284
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:55,122
I'll get back to the investigation.
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

285
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:58,119
<i>Yasaburo!</i>

286
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,234
There's really nothing going on?

287
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,299
That's right.

288
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:37,317
Well. You're quite good.

289
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,219
Bitch!

290
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:59,346
Don't worry. It's just an anesthetic.

291
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,252
C-coward!

292
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,112
Cowardice ain't got nothin' to do with it.

293
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,321
Everything for the sake of that
pretentious woman, eh?

294
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:17,091
What I'm after is... HER.

295
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,072
I want you to take this.

296
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:22,231
Sir.

297
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,331
Hello, sir.
Sir.

298
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:23,101
Hello, sir.

299
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:23,130
Hello, sir.
Okay, get on it.

300
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:23,266
Okay, get on it.

301
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:24,172
Sir.
Okay, get on it.

302
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,176
Let's go.

303
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,200
Sir.

304
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:33,311
<i>FUJXNOVA</i>

305
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:41,181
The world's economy is dire,
yet business is booming.

306
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:45,289
We must eat too, yes?

307
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:54,169
If the people want something,
though they know it to be illegal, then...!

308
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,106
We MUST trade in it, no matter what it be, yes?

309
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,076
People are dying because of it!

310
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:09,247
That is no concern of mine! Such is the choice
of he who desires till death, yes?

311
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:16,288
Business is business.
Individual taste is individual taste.

312
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:24,100
Someone near and dear to you
shall be coming here shortly.

313
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:29,103
What will you do to Mistress Rin?!

314
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:39,114
That is one FETCHING woman!
Fetching women have a poison of their own.

315
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:44,084
She desires the drug.

316
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,183
Liar! There's no way that's true!

317
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:48,351
It's a lie.

318
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:58,292
That person has caught the fancy
of SO many others.

319
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:09,102
One of those has stated that he wishes
to try the drug upon her.

320
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,141
Onami's body?

321
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:17,244
Yes. I just received word.

322
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:19,221
Any clues as to the culprit?

323
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,157
Not at this time.

324
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:23,057
What about Fujinoya?

325
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:27,288
I was thinking of investigating it shortly,
but what was the name of that man from before?

326
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,262
Yasaburo. He should be staking out Fujinoya.

327
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,237
He got word that the courtesan
Miyuki was suspicious.

328
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:40,208
Then I'll send word to my men.
Shall we storm them at once?

329
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:46,115
I'll go to Fujinoya alone first.
If something were to happen to Yasaburo...

330
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,280
Are you in love with him?

331
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:59,087
What? No, not in the slightest.
It's just, he's only a peasant samurai.

332
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:03,200
But I've put him in danger, so I worry for him.

333
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,314
I worry for YOU.

334
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,117
Kageyama...

335
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:27,124
Don't get the wrong idea. I am concerned
for your safety, nothing more.

336
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:31,184
I will soon instruct my men to go to Fujinoya.

337
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,155
You just stay safe till then.

338
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,164
Sir.

339
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:57,211
I'm responsible for involving Yasaburo in this.
If something were to happen to him...!

340
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:35,053
Do you know...

341
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,116
what this means?

342
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:40,095
Where is Yasaburo?! Is he safe?

343
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,323
He's waitin' for you.

344
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:07,188
<i>FUJXNOVA</i>

345
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:14,130
Sir.

346
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,104
Take her sword.

347
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,131
Sir.

348
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,317
Before we go inside...

349
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,346
why don't we have some fun?

350
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,257
Mistress Rin!

351
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,259
<i>Yasaburo!</i>

352
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,300
Kill this man!

353
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,140
No!

354
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:36,302
Once the fun is over, I'm gonna finish you off.

355
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:59,102
It would seem, Miss Rin, you haven't grasped
the situation in which you've been placed.

356
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,156
What are you doing?!

357
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:33,227
Stop it! Don't lay a hand on him!

358
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:43,214
Such beautiful breasts!
You have a truly beautiful body.

359
00:54:56,327 --> 00:55:01,094
This is for what you've been searching, yes?

360
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,190
Shall we try some?

361
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,154
Kageyama!

362
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:27,072
You're rather late, Kageyama.

363
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:46,256
A lovely sight. Seeing you like this
has been my dream.

364
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,132
Have you applied the drug?

365
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,170
Yes. Plenty.

366
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:10,119
Why? Why would you...?

367
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:16,057
Secret orders mean nothing
in the face of our ruler's personal desires.

368
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:22,097
When I learned that, I thought this job
nothing but foolishness.

369
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:29,263
So I decided I would act
according to MY desires.

370
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:36,045
Your father was about to learn of my actions...

371
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,344
He was a nuisance.

372
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,220
Sol killed him.

373
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:27,323
He called your name till the very end.

374
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:36,095
I knew you were a splendid daughter,
but I never thought you'd be this beautiful.

375
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:46,107
Has the drug taken effect?
Your eyes are saying they want me.

376
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,294
How's THAT?

377
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:11,331
Hey. Don't go untyin' him.

378
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,340
Oh, shut up. You can't order me.

379
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:27,146
Say it!

380
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:29,285
Say that you want it!

381
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:33,255
If you say you want it, I'll give it to ya!

382
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:48,143
Yasaburo... It might be easier to accept it.

383
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:55,183
I want it! I want your member,
Kageyama! I want it!

384
01:00:56,353 --> 01:01:01,189
Is that so?! Then I'll give it to ya!

385
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,092
I'll give it to ya till you die!

386
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:21,266
Miss Miyuki... I can't hold back anymore!

387
01:01:58,115 --> 01:01:59,173
You pest.

388
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,149
Let's go...

389
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:12,319
You're not getting away!

390
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,256
Bastard.

391
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:21,263
Rin.

392
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,108
Can you strike me down?

393
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,340
Mistress Rin!

394
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:05,342
<i>Yasaburo.</i>

395
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,311
Mistress Rin.

396
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:41,343
After that, Rin slept for three days and nights.

397
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:51,319
When she awoke, circumstances
began forcing me from Edo.

398
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:54,257
And then the day came.

399
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,331
You're determined to go?

400
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:08,107
When I get back to my village,
I'd like to open a sword-fighting dojo...

401
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:12,082
While helping my father in the rice fields, that is.

402
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:17,310
If I hadn't asked you to help with the search...

403
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:23,293
That's not it. My father's hip pains
have gotten worse.

404
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:30,191
I wanted to stay with you, Mistress Rin,
for much longer.

405
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,298
Will you come again?

406
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:40,100
Of course! Please call for me
should you need anything.

407
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:47,182
What you taught me,
about killing someone in anger...

408
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,277
It would be nice if we didn't live in
that son of world, wouldn't it?

409
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:56,087
The sword ans don't exist to kill people.

410
01:04:57,294 --> 01:05:00,229
My father taught me that.

411
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,139
Well, then.

412
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,144
Yes. See you again.
