SUPARB SRIPUEK

7
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,083
Quiet, everyone.

8
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,916
Suparb, why are you crying, huh?

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,666
I just asked what your mom
does for a living.

10
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,125
It's no big deal. Everyone's sharing.

11
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,541
Be brave in your thoughts,
words, and actions.

12
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:12,666
Come on. Your friends are waiting.

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Crying like this…

14
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,416
Suparb's story must be super touching.

15
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,083
Ouch!

16
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,416
Why do you act out aggressively?

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,541
I'll punish you with two hits.

18
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,458
I live with my mom, just the two of us.

19
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,666
My mom…

20
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,916
sells drugs.

21
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,500
Twenty tablets…

22
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,625
Can I pay 600 in cash?

23
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,041
The other 600,

24
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,666
I'll pay with a watch.

25
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,333
A genuine TAG watch. No need to check.

26
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:36,875
Here.

27
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,208
Alright, wait here.

28
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,125
Hey.

29
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,333
Thank you, auntie.

30
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,291
Puek, here's your allowance.

31
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,958
And this is for your excursion to the zoo.

32
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,125
<i>Mister Suparb Sripuek.</i>

33
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,083
Mister Suparb Sripuek.

34
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:19,791
Yes.

35
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,583
Can you still recall
the events of that day?

36
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,875
What day was that day?

37
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,833
Calm down, Officer.

38
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,125
She asked you nicely, so answer properly.

39
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,250
Why are you fucking around?

40
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,416
Mister Suparb.

41
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,833
Have you ever taken drugs?

42
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,666
I hate drugs.

43
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,916
But your mom sells drugs.

44
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,791
And what about it, sir?

45
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,500
Doc, did you know…

46
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,166
It's true, my mom sells drugs.

47
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,625
But no matter how bad they say my mom is,

48
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,375
she has never hit me.

49
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,500
Not like how I was beaten
last night by the police.

50
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,666
Listen to me, you bastard!

51
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,500
You shot people dead, you bastard.

52
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,250
How many people did you kill?

53
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,250
Enough, Officer.

54
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,625
This scumbag, damn!

55
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,750
Please let me handle this, sir.

56
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Sit up straight.

57
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,708
So…

58
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,583
why did you do that on that day?

59
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,291
I don't know.

60
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:42,416
Can you try to briefly explain to me

61
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,083
what led to the events of that day?

62
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,791
My mom works by selling drugs.

63
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,708
She sold drugs to raise me
since I was young.

64
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:09,000
KATURI FLOWER

65
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,000
<i>And I grew up with drug money.</i>

66
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,083
I can't go with you today, son.

67
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,333
I can go with Par, Mama.

68
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,333
Oi! What?!

69
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,083
Can't take a fucking sip, can I?!

70
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,666
What the fuck do you want with me, huh?

71
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,708
What do you fucking want, huh?

72
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,083
What do you fucking want with me?

73
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,166
<i>But where I grew up…</i>

74
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,916
Ever thought about your kid?

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,291
<i>You can't imagine because it was…</i>

76
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,041
-What do you want?
-Go?

77
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,375
<i>It was full of scum and bastards.</i>

78
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,125
Stop. Enough. Stop!

79
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,625
Flip! Flip! Flip!

80
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,375
-Damn, gone. Again, again.
-Shitty High-Lows.

81
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,208
<i>My mom never wanted me</i>
<i>to grow up like that.</i>

82
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,583
Hurry, hurry. Come on. More.

83
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,166
-Wait. Put it down first.
-More, more.

84
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,458
<i>She always said…</i>

85
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:23,875
<i>"Puek…</i>

86
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,166
<i>go study far away.</i>

87
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,500
<i>You would have a better life."</i>

88
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,916
<i>I promised her that…</i>

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,291
<i>when I graduate,</i>
<i>we'd move out of this shithole.</i>

90
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,375
Oi, Peuk, heading to school?

91
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,041
What's up with you lately?
You don't even answer.

92
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,708
-You're too good for us now?
-I'll smack your head.

93
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,625
<i>But the worst thing is drugs.</i>

94
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,125
<i>My mom got 25 years, Doc.</i>

95
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,375
<i>She's been sentenced</i>
<i>to 25 years in prison.</i>

96
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,916
<i>And I hate when people</i>
<i>talk about my mom. I hate it.</i>

97
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,708
<i>Don't ever talk about my mom like that.</i>

98
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,666
Auntie.

99
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,666
Oh, as usual. Vitamilk.

100
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,791
Goddammit!

101
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,333
Thank you.

102
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,375
Guzzling milk every morning…
Miss mommy's boobs?

103
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,291
-Sis.
-Hm?

104
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,625
Ten baht cigarettes.

105
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,333
Here.

106
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,208
Wanna know why your ma got caught?

107
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,166
What's got into you, dick?

108
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,375
What's got into you, huh?

109
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Whatcha starin' at me for?

110
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,458
I'll tell you this.

111
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,875
Your mama wanna quit,
that's why she got caught.

112
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,875
-You fucker!
-Fuck!

113
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,291
-Come on, shit-stain!
-Paan!

114
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,791
-Got guts, fucker? Got problems, huh?
-Hey!

115
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,416
-Puek, let go.
-Don't ever talk about my mom.

116
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,416
-Pickin' fights, huh?
-Let go.

117
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,333
-Puek! Puek, Puek! Stop!
-Fucker!

118
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,416
-You're your mama's son!
-Why are you listening to him, Puek?

119
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,875
Stop! Walk away!

120
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,166
-Come on!
-Walk.

121
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,833
Come on, you sissy wouldn't dare!

122
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,583
Puek, my son, are you heading to school?

123
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,750
-Puek!
-Damn, Paan, you're sharp-tongued.

124
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,583
Puek!

125
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,166
-I've fucked his mom.
-Puek, I'm begging you.

126
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,291
-She was horny in bed.
-Let's go.

127
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,625
Mech boy, you think you're so big?

128
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:32,125
Fucker, the money
his mom got from selling drugs…

129
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,125
It came from me.
How else would she have raised you?

130
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,541
Shut the fuck up!

131
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,166
Par, shut the fuck up! Fuck off.

132
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,000
-I'll make you a pornstar, whore!
-Puek, stop!

133
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,125
Let him. Fuck him. Walk away.

134
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,666
Puek, listen to me. Walk.

135
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,458
-I'm begging. I'm begging you.
-I've already fucked your mom.

136
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,250
I'll bend you over one day.

137
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,833
-No, Puek!
-Motherfucker!

Hi, Warden Ruerng-rit.

145
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,250
Warden, Lieutenant Tum
sent him here for correction.

146
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,625
I know.

147
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,166
Tum already called me.

148
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,291
You already searched them thoroughly?

149
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,375
Yes, sir.

150
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,666
Then you should head off.
I'll handle this.

151
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,291
Aren't you picking up your kid?

152
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,958
I am. I'll take him
to tutor at Kumon later.

153
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,458
Well, I'm off, sir.

155
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,625
Yes.

156
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,333
Sold drugs?

157
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,333
Yes.

158
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,541
You're from Nang Lychee.

159
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,375
Then, you can stay in Klong Tei block.

160
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,750
There's no one from Nang Lychee, uncle?

161
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,708
Think I'm your playmate?

162
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,875
Huh?

163
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,375
Keep in mind,
don't be too curious in here.

164
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,666
You'll be knocked out before you know it.

165
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,375
Yes.

166
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,916
And that girly "yes", fucking stuff it.

167
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,958
Suparb Sripuek.

168
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,416
What is so funny?

169
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,708
Sorry, yes.

170
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,708
And I said not to say that girly shit.

171
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,166
Yes, sir.

172
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:16,166
Your house is in Saparn Yow,
Dow Kanong, Thonburi, isn't it?

173
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,916
You'll stay
in Klong Tei block with this fruity.

174
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:29,916
My house is in Thonburi.
Why aren't I in Thonburi, sir?

175
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,916
Curious?

176
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,541
So curious, you want an answer, hm?

177
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,208
You scum, you dare look at me!

178
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:02,875
Damn!

179
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,666
You know who's in charge here?

180
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:09,958
Me!

181
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:18,083
Don't know too much.
Don't think. Don't cause trouble.

182
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,625
And don't defy me.

183
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,541
Remember that.

184
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,041
You, too!

185
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,583
You still curious?

186
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,291
Fucker!

187
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,625
Are his relatives here?

188
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,250
I'll be with you in a bit.

189
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,083
Get up! You two, follow me. Come on!

190
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,375
-Hello, boss.
-Hello, boss.

191
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,166
Beer.

192
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,166
Yes, sir.

193
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,791
I'll leave these two to you.

194
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,708
Yes, sir.

195
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,000
And for this brat,

196
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,583
help me straighten him out.

197
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,125
Leave it to me, boss.

198
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,750
He'll be lapping at your feet
when we're done, boss.

199
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,583
Good.

200
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,291
Hey!

201
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,375
Nice lace.

202
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,500
Can I have it?

203
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,791
Hey.

204
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,791
What the…? Can I have it?

205
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,166
Quit stalling, you fuck. Come, let me.

206
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:26,875
That's it.

207
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,875
Thank you.

208
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,125
Oh, shit!

209
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,333
Your jeans are cool. Authentic label?

210
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,166
Can I have them?

211
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,083
What are you lookin' at, fucker?

212
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:49,958
Off!

213
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,125
I think you're too stressed.

214
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,000
You have to be relaxed in here.

215
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,083
Relaxed, you know? Stop buckling so much.

216
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,625
This is just the first day.

217
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,375
Give this fucker some pants
and shave his hair.

218
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,916
What the fuck are you looking at?

219
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,208
Calm down, big boy.

220
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,000
So smart, fuckin' ass!

221
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,666
Fucking good lunch today.

222
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,416
I bet the inspector's here.
Even got a whole chicken.

223
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Damn, in here for over ten years
and I just see an orange.

224
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,541
Never changed.

225
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,458
Hey, you're really digging in?

226
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,708
Slobbering like a pig. You want mine, too?

227
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,000
Aw, really, Bung?
Then I'll have the chicken.

228
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,000
Look at him.

229
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,458
Whoa, what's with the stuffing?

230
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,375
Hey, can I have one piece of chicken each?

231
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,791
There are only eggplants. Take 'em.

232
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,208
Farang! Why are you taking your friends'?

233
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,500
Give them back.

234
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,541
Take mine. Here.

235
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,000
Bung, if I did, then what will you eat?

236
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,625
Just eat it. I'm happy to see you eat.

237
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,958
Eat well, so you'll grow big and strong.

238
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,916
Not your body, your brain, ya ass.

239
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,666
Hey, Bung, I heard there's a new guy here.

240
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,000
He shot someone down in Dow Kanong.

241
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,625
Ugh, damn, shot it
like a school shooting--

242
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,625
Shit!

243
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,125
Sorry, sorry.

244
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,750
-It sprayed, you dog.
-Like a tsunami.

245
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:21,250
Your fucking rice
is everywhere. Eat properly.

246
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,833
Always talking, goddamn chatterbox.

247
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,375
I was waiting for him,
but he never came to our block.

248
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,750
Why? He from Thonburi?

249
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:36,416
God, Bung! Aren't you from Thonburi?

250
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,916
Dow Nong, dawg, Dow Nong.

251
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,583
What fucking Dow Nong?

252
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,208
Do I have to know everything?

253
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,708
Of course, you have to!

254
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,083
I'm not you, creep.

255
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,375
Always knowing every goddamn thing.

256
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,875
So smart, ya ass!

257
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:57,750
Against the rules.

258
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,541
Such pretty nails.

259
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:14,000
Wipe it all off. Make them shine.

260
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,375
Don't make me see a single one.

261
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,458
I'll tear your nails right off, faggot.

262
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,125
Go clean 'em over there.

263
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,666
Go!

264
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,500
I'm cutting a celeb's hair, wow!

265
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,291
It's your turn, your majesty.

266
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,708
Welcome.

267
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,083
Why do I need to have my hair cut?

268
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,000
Always so curious.

269
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,208
Or do you want me
to cut something else first?

270
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,541
Fuck.

271
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,583
Sit still, fucker.

272
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,458
Come here. I'll wipe it.

273
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:24,666
Please, I beg you!

274
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,458
Ah, shit!

275
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,166
Your hair's stuck everywhere.

276
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,083
Damn, sorry, man. Forgot the powder.

277
00:26:55,916 --> 00:27:00,416
It's so hot. Your hair's everywhere.

278
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,000
Ah, sorry, sorry, sorry.

279
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,291
Need to powder first. I forgot.

280
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:15,958
Done!

281
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,375
Welcome to the twilight zone, you fuckers.

282
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,875
One, two, three,

283
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,166
four, five, six, seven,

284
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,750
eight, nine, ten,

285
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,458
11, 12, 13,

286
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:37,916
14, 15, 16.

287
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,291
Boy.

288
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:28,666
Move over.

289
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,208
Hey.

290
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,958
Boss wanna take care of ya. You in?

291
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,208
What do you mean? Like, a welcoming?

292
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,500
You wanna know, you gotta find out.

293
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,500
But I think… it's your kind of thing.

294
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:09,291
And you…

295
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,708
Boss wants a massage from you.

296
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:20,666
I'm not going.

297
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,333
Your choice, bastard.

298
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,166
So?

299
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,791
You're going or not?

300
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,875
Can we go together?

301
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,625
I don't want to go alone.

302
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,791
It's your life, your choice.

303
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:03,041
Yes, your life. Decide for yourself.

304
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,708
What's it gonna be?

305
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,916
Come on. What is it?

306
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,416
Hmm?

307
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,625
Hi, guys.

308
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,916
Took your sweet time, pretty boy.

309
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,333
You know what ya gotta do?

310
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:20,666
And if I don't do it?

311
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,958
You should be used to it, shouldn't you?

312
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,791
Fucker, stop!

313
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,958
Can I not do it? I'm begging you.

314
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:47,750
Please.

315
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,791
Don't wanna do it?

316
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,708
Fine, you don't have to.

317
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,625
Come here. Come here.

318
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,708
Come closer. Here.

319
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,541
Come closer. Don't be scared. Come here.

320
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,333
Come here.

321
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,500
If you really don't
want to do it, it's okay.

322
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,166
I've got options for you.

323
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,166
I've got some options.

324
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,333
First option…

325
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,666
You give me a blow job.

326
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,083
And I'll take you as my property.

327
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,916
You won't be a bitch for everyone here.

328
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,083
Second option…

329
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,000
If you don't do it…

330
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,750
you'll be passed around and around.

331
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,083
Don't cry, don't cry.

332
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,666
It's just everyone
that will fuck you dry, hmm?

333
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,125
You'll be a public toy.

334
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,875
And not only will you get your ass taken,

335
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,916
but you'll also get kicked.

336
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,000
So, it's your choice.

337
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,541
This idiot is slow as hell.

338
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,125
Two options aren't enough, right?

339
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,333
Don't worry.

340
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:49,166
Someone as kind as me has a third option.

341
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,208
I'll let you choose whether you want

342
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,958
the iron…

343
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,333
or the tendon, hmm?

344
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:33,375
That's all it is, you drama queen.

345
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:50,916
Boy…

346
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,708
that new guy who just got here,

347
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,125
I gave him a choice, but he didn't come.

348
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:04,208
Why don't you give Y Not-7 to him?

349
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,833
Shit!

350
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,458
So tough, aren't you?
So fuckin' tough, right?

351
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,958
Pussy, shithead.

352
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:38,333
<i>Sweat pours down, soaking her through</i>

353
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,625
<i>Soaking her through</i>

354
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:45,416
<i>This sweat is her labor for survival</i>

355
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,333
<i>For survival</i>

356
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:51,708
<i>To send him to school</i>
<i>Hoping he'll thrive</i>

357
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:53,541
<i>Hoping he'll thrive</i>

358
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:58,333
<i>Though she doesn't eat much</i>
<i>She wishes her son a life of ease</i>

359
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,000
<i>A life of ease</i>

360
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:04,708
<i>She hawks goods</i>
<i>Drenched in sweat, never tired</i>

361
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,500
<i>Never tired</i>

362
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:11,041
<i>No matter the heat, she presses on</i>

363
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,750
<i>She presses on</i>

364
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:19,791
<i>Saving for his tuition, so he can study</i>

365
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:23,375
<i>Paying bills as the month ends</i>

366
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,083
<i>As the month ends</i>

367
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:31,458
<i>It's a shame her son ruins his life</i>

368
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:36,083
<i>Fell in with bad friends</i>
<i>Indulging in intoxicants</i>

369
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,333
<i>Intoxicants</i>

370
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:42,541
<i>Smoke weed, smell glue, drink booze</i>

371
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,541
<i>Smell glue, drink booze</i>

372
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:48,375
<i>Writhing in agony</i>
<i>Nearly dying from withdrawal</i>

373
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,791
<i>From withdrawal</i>

374
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:54,833
<i>Out of hope, out of strength to strive</i>

375
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:55,791
<i>Strength to strive</i>

376
00:36:55,875 --> 00:37:00,250
<i>Hugs her son while she's crying</i>

377
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,125
<i>While she's crying</i>

378
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:06,375
<i>Almost out of strength to be strong</i>

379
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,125
<i>Strength to be strong</i>

380
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:12,500
<i>Mother lost her sanity</i>
<i>As her son dies before her</i>

381
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,125
<i>Fell with a thud</i>

382
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:18,458
<i>Who would be with mom when her son dies?</i>

383
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,083
<i>It's your dad</i>

384
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:26,458
<i>Like a mother's tears</i>
<i>Flowing down… almost like blood</i>

385
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:30,625
<i>I will consume this meal</i>
<i>to sustain my life.</i>

386
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,000
<i>I am the owner of my own karma,</i>
<i>so I bear its consequences.</i>

387
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:41,250
<i>I will behave well</i>
<i>and obey the laws of society.</i>

388
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,791
Beer, isn't the Thonburi
kinda quiet lately?

389
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,333
Because they're pussies.
Why give a shit 'bout 'em?

390
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,833
But that Bung Gus…

391
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,000
has been on a down-low.

392
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,250
So?

393
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:24,750
Maybe they're planning
to wipe us off the map?

394
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,875
Shit. Wipe us off?

395
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,583
Those bitches like Bung Gus and Golf?

396
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,541
I don't see anyone
with half a brain on their block.

397
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,375
Just set the date, honey.

398
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,916
With fists, boxing,
or whatever, I'm always ready.

399
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,875
You're not eating?

400
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,250
Here, some noodles.

401
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,416
You won't have any strength otherwise.

402
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:09,166
Fuckin' hell, the noodles are hard.

403
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:14,125
Oh, you want spaghetti carbonara?

404
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,083
I'll have Kla order some for you.

405
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,291
Cold Mama, what more do you want?

406
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,750
Not a single piece of meat,
only the spirit of chicken.

407
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,833
Bird.

408
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:32,750
What?

409
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:36,250
This afternoon, take the food scraps
and lure some pigeons.

410
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,166
-Sure.
-I'll shank one and boil it with noodles.

411
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,291
Want to eat some rats?

412
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,000
I saw a couple around here.

413
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:45,458
You want some?

414
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,166
Who the hell eats rats, man?

415
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,083
In Ayutthaya, they do. They eat rats.

416
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,375
-Right, Bird, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

417
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,375
You don't know jack shit.

418
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:59,500
Even though I didn't
finish school, I'm not stupid.

419
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,041
Those are field rats, man.

420
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,500
Hey, Bung, that's the guy
I told you about yesterday.

421
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,541
Looks like he's been through hell.

422
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,916
Hey, kid.

423
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,083
You're the shooting case, right?

424
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,916
You're from Thonburi, aren't you?

425
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,083
Why don't you stay with us?

426
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,875
Wanna be in our block?

427
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:48,541
Damn, no answer.

428
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,333
Just eat, Farang. You chatterbox.

429
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,958
What are you staring at? Just eat.

430
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,916
Out of rice.
You'll have to eat at another meal.

431
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,666
Scraps will do.

432
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,375
Scraps will do?

433
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,708
You can eat dog food, right?

434
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,416
Why are you doing this to me?

435
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:20,416
Don't poke your nose where
it doesn't belong. You'll know soon.

436
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:23,500
Annoying as yours, shouldn't be eating.

437
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,000
You should be kicked.

438
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,250
Fuck off outta here.

439
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,000
Peel this for me.

440
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,125
Eat up, dumbass.

441
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,250
What's up, big boy?

442
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,625
Did you sleep well last night?

443
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,708
Hard stare, motherfucker?

444
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,000
When asked, fucking answer.

445
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,250
You're such a rude little shit.

446
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,166
You wanna play?

447
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,291
And what are you gonna do, hmm?

448
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,625
What the fuck
are you looking at? Just eat.

449
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,500
Miss your girlfriend?

450
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,083
Damn, why didn't he fight back?

451
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:33,625
If it were me,
I would've smacked him with the tray.

452
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:37,791
-He fucking picked up the rice to eat.
-Goddamn.

453
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:38,791
Is he mental?

454
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:41,000
Bonkers.

455
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:42,250
I would do the same.

456
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,458
Eating rice is better than being kicked.

457
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,875
You'd starve otherwise.

458
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,458
I'm telling you, man.
This kid got potential.

459
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,541
We should recruit him into our block.

460
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,166
Let's not mess with it.

461
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:01,541
It's not our business.

462
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,250
Just eat up.

463
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,458
What's up, big boy?

464
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,375
Is the cold water refreshing?

465
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,208
When you shower,

466
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,541
there are water bills.

467
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:59,875
When you use the fan to sleep,
there are electric bills.

468
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:03,375
Everything has a price.

469
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:06,791
Because of that…

470
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,416
I'll bill you for 'em.

471
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,083
I don't have any money.

472
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:16,208
Fucker, everyone knows
you don't got a penny.

473
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,291
What do you want from me?

474
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,250
Kneel, you motherfucker!

475
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,250
I said kneel.

476
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:44,166
Hands behind your back.

477
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,083
I said put your hands behind your back.

478
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:11,708
This asshole wanna know
what the water and electric bills are.

479
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,416
I'll demonstrate for you.

480
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,041
So, does that hurt?

481
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,208
Plugged, bitch?

482
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,541
What the fuck are you looking at?

483
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:38,666
Total is five.

484
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:40,875
You need to pay four more.

485
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,166
Come here.

486
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:51,875
Hurry, slut!

487
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,583
I called you, faggot. Come here.

488
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,625
Collect the water
and electric bills for me.

489
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,541
You can choose.

490
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:05,416
If you don't, you'll be passed around.

491
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,833
So?

492
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:13,958
Won't do it, you whore?

493
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,125
Won't do it?

494
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,083
Won't do it?

495
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,666
I'll kick your ass, bitch!

496
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,000
You choose.

497
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,750
Get beaten up, or get fucked?

498
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:28,791
-I'll do it.
-What?

499
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,541
-I'll do it.
-Louder.

500
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,458
I'll do it!

501
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:50,916
Hurry, fag!

502
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:54,583
Or will you trade your ass
for this dog, huh?

503
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,708
So?

504
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,916
Damn, this pussy.

505
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,875
Too soft, slut. Too soft.

506
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,916
I'm giving you a last chance here.

507
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,125
If you don't kick,

508
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,583
you'll get fucking passed around.

509
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,041
Understood?

510
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,166
I'm sorry.

511
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:59,833
A fag beat you, motherfucker!

512
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:01,458
Still too soft.

513
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,791
What the hell are you doing?
Don't crawl to him.

514
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,291
Your job is fucking over.
Fuck off already.

515
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,875
Go the fuck away.

516
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,708
Don't look at me. Way more are coming.

517
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,250
Oh, oh, startin' to bruise?

518
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,333
It's my turn, motherfucker.

519
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:36,083
You'll cry for your mama, motherfucker.

520
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,625
You dare fucking fight back? Motherfucker!

521
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,541
Enough, assholes. He'll die.

522
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:09,041
We're going, whore.

523
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:09,958
Come here.

524
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,333
Don't pity the fucker.

525
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:25,875
Fight!

526
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,916
Swing your fists!

527
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,458
You're always on the defense, fuck!

528
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:33,541
Footwork, footwork.

529
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,583
Why didn't you fight back?

530
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,291
How can you let him
be the only one punching?

531
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:42,833
If you're hurt,

532
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,250
he's just as hurt as you. Remember.

533
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,125
Box! Yes!

534
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:55,000
Get his ass.

535
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:39,208
Why did you go boxing?

536
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:42,666
Just that much money,
I can get you some for school.

537
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:51,666
I don't want to use drug money.

538
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,833
I'm embarrassed.

539
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:01,541
But if I don't sell drugs,

540
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,250
how will we live?

541
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:10,875
If you get caught,

542
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,791
who will I have?

543
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:54,708
So?

544
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,291
Got a good sleep, huh?

545
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,833
I give you five minutes.

546
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,791
Get up and get in line.

547
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,250
Or I'll fucking get you.

548
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:11,458
Five minutes.

549
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,791
Where are you going, huh?

550
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:25,583
Beer made…
Beer made me bring him to the lineup.

551
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,625
Good. He sneaked in some shuteye there.

552
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,041
I'm sorry.

553
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,875
I really didn't mean it.

554
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,833
I can't defy him.

555
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,750
You're Suparb, right?

556
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,583
What's your name?

557
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,416
I'm Fluke.

558
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,041
Are you hurt badly?

559
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,458
Those bastards…

560
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,791
The more we give in,
the more they'll push.

561
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:07,250
Come over when you're done eating.

562
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,791
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

563
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,666
You beat him black and blue

564
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,250
and got him an orange to eat.

565
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:32,416
What orange? I didn't know about that.

566
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,625
Over there. Here he is.

567
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:42,166
I'll smoke two cigarettes, then scram.

568
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,916
Such a whore, huh, fag?

569
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,333
Do you know the "I Hate Faggots" song?

570
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:52,500
You know why I hate them?

571
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:54,500
Because they're full of shit, whore!

572
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,916
I fucking took care of you.
You don't like it?

573
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,750
What the fuck did you do, fag?
What did you fucking do?

574
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,416
What did you fucking do, slut?

575
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,500
You like it rough, right?

576
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,583
What did you do? What did you do?

577
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:06,583
What did you do, huh, fag?

578
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,625
Faggot. Huh? Huh?

579
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,000
Hey!

580
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,291
You hate fags.

581
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,666
Why did you fuck me?

582
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,541
Fags, fags, fags, that's all you say.

583
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:21,833
And what's wrong with it, huh?

584
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,666
If you're so tough, then do it.

585
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,375
-Come on. Give me your all.
-Stop, stop, stop it.

586
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:26,708
The fag's fighting back.

587
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:29,833
Fucking hell,
a long trip to RCA at this point.

588
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:33,416
-Come on, fucker. Come on!
-Hey, stop!

589
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,541
Fucking what?

590
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:35,791
Or do you want a one-on-one?

591
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:38,916
You're a fucking pussy.

592
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:43,625
You're getting too bold, motherfucker.

593
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,916
Hey! Enough!

594
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,416
Enough, I'm asking.

595
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,625
You, come to my block.

596
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:11,541
You too, pretty boy.

597
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:19,833
Don't you think that's too easy, Farang?

598
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,541
If it ends like this,

599
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,416
you might as well slap me with your shoes.

600
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:26,583
Farang…

601
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:29,875
You can only choose one.

602
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:32,875
Choose whoever you want.

603
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,208
Butting in, are you?

604
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,375
I choose this one.

605
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:52,250
What's your name?

606
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:56,416
Puek.

607
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:10,916
I'll have this one in my block, then.

608
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,375
And if I don't let you?

609
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:18,541
If you don't,

610
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,958
then you'll have to slap me
with your shoe, Beer.

611
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:26,541
Hey.

612
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:33,375
What the fuck is going on?

613
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,083
-Warden, I--
-I know.

614
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:45,500
Alright, go back to your blocks.

615
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,666
Farang.

616
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:56,916
Get up.

617
01:00:58,208 --> 01:00:59,875
You faggot, get up.

618
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,958
What? What?

619
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,041
What are you fucking looking at?
Love him so much, huh?

620
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:11,166
Forty-seven, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53,

621
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,833
54, 55, 56. All here.

622
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:53,291
If you're still not over it,
you can get a hit on me.

623
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,625
Why did you help me?

624
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:01,791
I didn't fuckin' help you. I helped him.

625
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:07,166
You know what's coming for him.
Why didn't you help him?

626
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,916
You wanna die, huh?

627
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:13,250
You would fall over
by a flick of the fingers.

628
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,458
That pretty boy isn't like you.

629
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:27,958
He'll live by not
pissing people off like you did.

630
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:32,375
He wouldn't get
anything worse than you did.

631
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:35,416
Oi, quiet again.

632
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:44,333
You don't ever think to say anything, huh?

633
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,000
Fucking brain dead?

634
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:50,166
What's fucking up with you?
Come on. What do you want?

635
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:53,916
What do you want?

636
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:55,750
Farang.

637
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,041
Thanks, man.

638
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:42,458
I'm Bung Gus.

639
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,208
And this here is Farang.

640
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,208
Farang, my ass.

641
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,666
I don't know English.

642
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:56,958
Nice to meet you, man.

643
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:13,958
I'm Puek.

644
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:28,333
I'll have a guy get you some drugs
for your face tomorrow.

645
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:31,041
Just sleep well tonight.

646
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,041
Your pillow's red.

647
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:34,708
Farang got it for you.

648
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:38,083
Carry this with you at all times, pal.

649
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:40,750
I'm lending it to you.

650
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,041
Made in Thailand.

651
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,541
I'll teach you how to make one.

652
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:47,625
Your very own.

653
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,791
And I will… head to bed now.

654
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,083
Go to sleep, you all.

655
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:57,666
Sleeping late will leave you rings
like a panda's.

656
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,208
Look at Bung.

657
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,333
I let you sleep nicely
and you don't like it?

658
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:35,250
Go sleep at your old end
of the fucking block.

659
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:37,916
And don't fucking
come near me again, faggot.

660
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,291
Move.

661
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:14,750
Go. Come out and line up.

662
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:15,666
Hey, come out!

663
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,583
Hurry.

664
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:21,125
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Line up.

665
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,041
Hurry. Walk over.

666
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,666
Get out, get out.

667
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,625
Hey, wake up.

668
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,458
Hey!

669
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:44,791
Is he dead?

670
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,125
Stock-still.

671
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:54,333
He's still breathing, Bung.

672
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,375
Hey!

673
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:02,666
Hey, you.

674
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:10,458
Wake up, fucker.

675
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,000
-Shit.
-What are you fucking doing?

676
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,875
What are you fucking doing?
What are you fucking doing?

677
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,000
What are you fucking doing?

678
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,041
What are you fucking doing? Calm down.

679
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:24,416
Is it deep, Bung?

680
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,041
Just a slash.

681
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,083
Time to wake up. What?

682
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:45,458
Slept with a strong grip on the shiv.

683
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,833
Are you really that paranoid of us?

684
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,916
It's good that was Bung.

685
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,666
If it were me, my skin's no good.

686
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,666
Here, right in my throat.

687
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,041
I'm sorry.

688
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:03,958
Alright.

689
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,500
Go and get breakfast.

690
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:10,958
And that shiv, you keep it.

691
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:14,750
Your first day here
and you already fucking stabbed me.

692
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:17,750
Come on, Farang.

693
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,083
Go get breakfast.

694
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:29,416
Come on!

695
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,083
<i>Goodbye, youth</i>

696
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:41,166

01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,541
<i>Only friends' voices are heard</i>

704
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:03,541
<i>All those who visits but never seen</i>

705
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:08,041
-What the shit are you doing?
-<i>Goodbye, youth</i>

706
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,250

-Hey, hey, hey!
-Look at him.

709
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,166
-What the heck, Farang.
-Hey!

710
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,250
-What's with you?
-You jackass…

01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,625
<i>I wish you the best of luck</i>

723
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:37,291
13 14

724
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,375
Hello, Par.

725
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:02,750
How are you?

726
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:08,541
I'm good.

727
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,833
Got a new haircut.

728
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,000
And how are you?

729
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,250
I'm okay.

730
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:26,416
How's school?

731
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,458
I'm interning by next term.

732
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,208
I'm happy for you.

733
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:54,958
Par, don't cry.

734
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:00,791
It was hard at first,

735
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,291
but now I've been adjusting bit by bit.

736
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:08,416
Puek…

737
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:15,875
I have something to tell you.

738
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,833
Auntie Bua passed away…

739
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,916
in jail.

740
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:35,583
But I handled everything. A good funeral.

741
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,291
She's finally resting in peace, Puek.

742
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,416
You don't have to worry.

743
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,291
But after this…

744
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,083
I can't come to see you anymore.

745
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,958
Par… Just wait, Par…

746
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:05,291
It's too much for me, Par.

747
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,625
I'm sorry, Puek.

748
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:13,125
I'm paying for it, Par.

749
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:17,416
I really am.
I'm getting stomped on every day.

750
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:25,375
Par, can't you give me a chance?

751
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,666
I thought… I thought you said…

752
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,833
You said we'd be together.

753
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:49,750
You said… we'd move out and…

754
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:53,208
Don't go. Don't go. Don't…

755
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:56,041
You said we'd move in together.

756
01:13:56,125 --> 01:14:01,000
You said… I'd box and you'd live with me.

757
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,458
Par…

758
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:09,083
Par, I love…

759
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:11,500
Par…

760
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:36,666
Suparb Sripuek, go back inside.

761
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,625
Just a moment, please. A moment.

762
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:43,500
Go back inside!

763
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,333
Par, wait…

764
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,166
Up!

765
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,625
Get back inside.

766
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:57,250
Your visitor is gone.

767
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,375
Chop-chop!

768
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,291
Next time, you'll get a pardon.

769
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,416
The warden said you need to behave.

770
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:16,041
Then, you'll finally be out.

771
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:24,041
When you get out,
I think you should go down South.

772
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:28,208
Your aunt will help
send you to a new school.

773
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:32,375
Hold on a little longer. Get your degree.

774
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:35,791
My boss already gave his word
he'd take you on.

775
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:39,041
Why do I have to go live
in the South with Aunt, Pops?

776
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:42,791
Can't I live here with you?

777
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:46,666
I tell you to do something,
you do as I say.

778
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,958
Believe me, I've thought it through.

779
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:55,541
Thought through to that bitch Nid, right?

780
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,708
Bung Gus, Nid is my wife.

781
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,458
And who am I?

782
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,291
Who am I?

783
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,916
My whole life,

784
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,708
I didn't live with you
half as long as that bitch.

785
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,625
Because you're fucking stuck in jail.

786
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:34,375
You did this to yourself, Gus.

787
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,958
Right, Pops, I did this to myself.

788
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:45,208
But I'm holding myself accountable here.

789
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,541
Is that still not enough, pops?

790
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:56,083
Ten years…

791
01:16:58,916 --> 01:16:59,875
8 months…

792
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:04,333
21 days.

793
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,916
I'm repenting here, Pops.

794
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,125
What about you?

795
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:17,333
Have you ever been
accountable for anything?

796
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:18,333
Gus!

797
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,791
And all the hustling I've been doing

798
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:25,125
and selling the farmland…

799
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:29,250
and everything I've been doing
for the past ten years…

800
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:30,500
Who have I been doing it for?

801
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:01,666
Come on.

802
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,791
Come on. What's fucking up with you?

803
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:05,958
Fucking ganging up on me? Come on!

804
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:10,125
How many holes do you want, Farang?

805
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,125
Fucking what? Come on!

806
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:19,583
You're so daring, right?

807
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:22,041
Oi!

808
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:25,166
You fuckers again.

809
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,458
Four limbs out!

810
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,583
Hey, what the fuck's going on?

811
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:32,875
Four limbs out!

812
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:35,208
Four limbs out!

813
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,958
Trouble magnets, shitheads.

814
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,625
Warden Ruang-rit, they're fighting again.

815
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:46,791
You've been on my fucking nerves lately.

816
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:50,125
And what will you do, Shitlock?

817
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,875
Did you learn nothing from last time?

818
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:55,458
You can 1v1 me again.

819
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:59,000
I'll even tie my hand back this time.
Wanna go?

820
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:01,916
You're crossing the damn line, Beer.

821
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,583
Are you going to war with my gang?

822
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:14,458
I'm not backing down. Set the date.

823
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:16,958
Let's fucking go.

824
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,500
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

825
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:52,416
Hey!

826
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,083
Hey!

827
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,000
Boy.

828
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:00,791
Respect the fuckin' faggot, will you?

829
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:06,416
Beer, you don't want him anymore, right?

830
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:19,208
Get up, faggot.

831
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,125
I said get up.

832
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:44,000
I said fucking get up, faggot.

833
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:48,458
C'mon, whore. I said get up.

834
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,333
C'mon!

835
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:06,791
We'll have some fun tonight.

836
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:22,041
Fucker…

837
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:25,083
You're a piece of shit.

838
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:47,833
Fucker!

839
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:56,916
Just fucking let him do you, faggot.

840
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,416
Don't dillydally. Wanna bleed that bad?

841
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,416
Look how many are here.

842
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,750
Think of the time for others.

843
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:09,333
It'll be morning soon.

844
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:11,666
Come here, whore.

845
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,000
Don't make a sound.

846
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,750
Warden Ruang Rit'll come and we'd be done.

847
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:22,458
<i>And on this night,</i>
<i>the cold breeze will turn warm</i>

848
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,666
<i>if we have someone beside us.</i>

849
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,791
<i>A special request from Fluke.</i>

850
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,708
<i>"Wanna Be With You All Night, Sepia".</i>

851
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:33,541
<i>And see you tomorrow night. DJ Gi 99.5.</i>

852
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,666
Thank you for being with me every night.

853
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:48,208
Stay with me for another night.

854
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,375
I love you.

855
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:04,333
Hello?

856
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:05,416
Yai, what's up?

857
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,708
<i>Dammit, Tub, Snitch 8's here.</i>

858
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,333
<i>Leave the stuff and hurry out!</i>

859
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:12,083
<i>They're turning in.</i>
<i>I'm waiting downstairs.</i>

860
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:14,625
Right, right, I'm going.

861
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,083
What's wrong with Yai?

862
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:21,041
A car accident at the corner.

863
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:22,500
Gotta hurry.

864
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:23,708
Did he get hurt?

865
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,500
No. I'll be right back.

866
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:28,958
Hurry back.

867
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:55,541
Down!

868
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:58,583
Stay down.

869
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:00,041
I said, fucking stay down.

870
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,500
Hands behind your back.

871
01:25:03,625 --> 01:25:04,541
Where are your drugs?

872
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:05,458
I don't know!

873
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:07,250
I don't know!

874
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,541
Sarge, search.

875
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,666
Found it, Chief.

876
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:22,208
What the fuck is this?

877
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,833
Huh?

878
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,875
Selling drugs?

879
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:34,875
It's not mine.

880
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:35,791
Huh?

881
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:36,750
It's not mine!

882
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:39,000
Then why is it in your room?

883
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,708
You're gonna be full of iron, baby.

884
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:43,500
TO… TUB, HOW ARE YOU? ARE YOU WELL?

885
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:44,833
I HOPE YOU'RE SAFE…

886
01:26:44,916 --> 01:26:46,791
I ONLY KNOW YOUR OLD ADDRESS
DUNNO IF IT'LL REACH YOU

887
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:48,666
Eat the vegetables.

888
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:52,458
Eat well.

889
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,583
You, too.

890
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,333
You eat. They're all good.

891
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:57,250
Puek.

892
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:00,708
Want some Mama? Expand your palate.

893
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:04,166
Fucking hell.

894
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:07,000
Why is that fucker
Bung Gus butting in now?

895
01:27:07,083 --> 01:27:09,583
It's okay, Bung. I can eat the porridge.

896
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:13,166
Mama noodles are top-tier, man.

897
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,333
Top-tier, eh? Then I'll have some.

898
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,583
He called dibs.

899
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:27,208
It's fine, really.

900
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,125
You've saved me before.

901
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:31,083
I can have the porridge.

902
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:33,708
But cold water Mama is only found here.

903
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:36,208
It's fine. I wanna eat porridge too.

904
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,500
Fucking Bung Gus is so fucking nosey.

905
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:40,833
Not really.

906
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:46,166
Anyone can eat. I'm happy with anything.

907
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:48,708
So fussy. I'll take 'em myself.

908
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:56,541
Why are you starvin', huh?

909
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:57,958
All you do is eat, Farang.

910
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:00,041
-Enough. Give it to Bung.
-Damn.

911
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:01,083
You're mean, Bung Gus.

912
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:04,208
It's better spent on me.

913
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:07,291
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing, pretty boy?

914
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:09,666
What the fuck are you doing?

915
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:19,041
I said what the fuck are you doing?

916
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,791
What the fuck are you doing?

917
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:29,958
Shit! Kill hit!

918
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:31,208
Shit!

919
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:33,416
Fluke! Fluke!

920
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:38,833
Shit! Puke it out. Fluke!

921
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:39,875
Puke it out!

922
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,458
Fluke!

923
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:51,250
Puking is more suffering. It's too late.

924
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:54,166
He'd die either way.

925
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:57,708
Puek!

926
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:01,333
-Puek!
-Stop! Stop it!

927
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:04,208
Jay! Chi, take him to the medical ward.

928
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:07,416
Puek!

929
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:11,416
Motherfucker!

930
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:19,583
You've sunk so low to use
this fucking playing field?

931
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:21,750
Low-life bitch.

932
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:24,083
What you gonna fucking do, mama's boy?

933
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:27,541
Tomorrow's Saturday.

934
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:38,708
Stay calm. Stay calm for now.

935
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:40,291
Not today.

936
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,708
Let's go.

937
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:06,916
HIGH VOLTAGE, DANGER AREA

938
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:19,833
Puek.

939
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:26,125
You know it's not your fault, right?

940
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,041
It already happened.

941
01:30:34,291 --> 01:30:35,666
You can't go back and change anything.

942
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:43,125
Tomorrow, it might be me… or you…

943
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:47,166
or anyone here.

944
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,208
It's the way of prison.

945
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,791
Bung Gus, can we play in the water today?

946
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:04,875
Boss, can my guy play in the water?

947
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:09,333
Go on. Whatcha waiting for?

948
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:38,208
-What's with you, Toh?
-Water got in my ear, man.

949
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:40,250
Come. I'll get it out.

950
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:01,458
Don't worry. They'll surely come.

951
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,500
Hey, what band's playing today?

952
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:10,708
Silly Fools.

953
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:19,000
THE MIND IS FOR REFLECTION

954
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:21,583
-<i>Oh, yeah! Come on, everybody.</i>
-<i>Why did you have to scream like that?</i>

955
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:23,208
<i>I'm Rock, that's why. "Rock concert."</i>

956
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,666
<i>Scream, so everyone can hear.</i>
<i>They can hear.</i>

957
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:26,750
<i>Those at home, too.</i>

958
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:27,708
Puek.

959
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:30,875
If you get out today…

960
01:32:32,916 --> 01:32:34,208
what do you think you'd do?

961
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:39,333
-<i>158 countries, man.</i>
-<i>Around 800 million people watching.</i>

962
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:42,416
-Dunno.
-<i>Please greet the eskimos</i>

963
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,375
<i>who eat seals.</i>

964
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,125
Probably go to the concert.

965
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,708
<i>It's Environment Day today.</i>

966
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:50,875
What about you, Farang?

967
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:54,125
I'd probably bring Irada to get donuts.

968
01:32:57,208 --> 01:33:00,708
Been ten years, I haven't ever seen her.

969
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:02,125
She making a ditch for you already?

970
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:06,125
Hey, be nice. Be nice.

971
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,333
-It's working.
-Hey, Farang.

972
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:12,541
For real… Is your Irada even real?

973
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:15,250
Real or fake, they're this big.

974
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:24,708
<i>So that our world has clean air</i>
<i>and we can breathe with full lungs.</i>

975
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:28,708
<i>Today, we'll have fun.</i>
<i>Let's see if everyone's ready.</i>

976
01:33:28,791 --> 01:33:31,333
Bung, they're coming.

977
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:33,833
<i>Make some noise for…</i>

978
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:36,250
<i>Silly Fools!</i>

979
01:34:06,458 --> 01:34:09,333
<i>Our children feel left out</i>

980
01:34:09,916 --> 01:34:13,500
<i>So, I wanna write this song to explain why</i>

981
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:16,250
<i>It's because parents don't pay attention</i>

982
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:20,500
<i>Too busy making money</i>
<i>Just to save it away</i>

983
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:23,875
<i>Dad, Mom, can you help me?</i>

984
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:27,958
<i>Can you look at the world we live in?</i>

985
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:31,958
<i>If you're making money</i>
<i>It's good to use it</i>

986
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:35,250
<i>Better than saving it like this</i>

987
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:37,666
<i>Your heart's only set on money</i>

988
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,416
<i>And all you gain from it is just that</i>

989
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,375
<i>Why keep working</i>
<i>If you don't use the money?</i>

990
01:34:42,458 --> 01:34:44,791
<i>Your heart's only set on money</i>

991
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:46,750
<i>And all you gain from it is just that</i>

992
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:49,625
<i>Why keep working</i>
<i>If you don't use the money?</i>

993
01:34:57,083 --> 01:34:58,083
-Go!
-Fuck yes!

994
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:03,250
Gonna die for him. Come on!

995
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:11,958
Come at me! Come on.

996
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:13,916
Come on. Let's go.

997
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:17,083
Go!

998
01:35:17,916 --> 01:35:19,208
Go!

999
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,208
<i>Dad, Mom, can you help me?</i>

1000
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:32,791
<i>Can you look at the world we live in?</i>

1001
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:37,541
<i>If you're making money</i>
<i>It's good to use it</i>

1002
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:40,583
<i>Better than saving it like this</i>

1003
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:43,125
<i>Your heart's only set on money</i>

1004
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:44,958
<i>And all you gain from it is just that</i>

1005
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:47,875
<i>Why keep working</i>
<i>If you don't use the money?</i>

1006
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:50,333
<i>Your heart's only set on money</i>

1007
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:52,083
<i>And all you gain from it is just that</i>

1008
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:55,208
<i>Why keep working</i>
<i>If you don't use the money?</i>

1009
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,583
You're brave, but you're stupid!

1010
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:59,416
<i>And all you gain from it is just that</i>

1011
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:02,541
<i>Why keep working</i>
<i>If you don't use the money?</i>

1012
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,833
So tough, huh?

1013
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:10,541
Delinquent shit much?

1014
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:11,583
Die already!

1015
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:12,833
So tough, right? Huh?

1016
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:14,291
So tough.

1017
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,125
So tough.

1018
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,000
Right?

1019
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:20,083
You fucking shit.

1020
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:22,125
So though, Beer?

1021
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:24,875
-Boss, he started it.
-Here!

1022
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:25,791
Here!

1023
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:29,000
Want more? Fucker!

1024
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Fucker!

1025
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:32,458
Want more?

1026
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:35,833
Want more?

1027
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:40,375
You like it, right?
The fucking fighting, don't you?

1028
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:42,708
Huh? You, too!

1029
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:45,833
Want more?

1030
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:48,000
Say you want more!

1031
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:50,833
Never fucking think!

1032
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:53,333
Need it beaten into you.

1033
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,750
Bastards like you.

1034
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:59,291
Go back to your damn blocks.

1035
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:02,125
I'll put you all
on an entire investigation by Monday.

1036
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:06,875
Waiting for Monday,
wouldn't they start again?

1037
01:37:08,166 --> 01:37:11,625
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Not a lot of us on parole.

1038
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:14,250
If we question 'em separately,

1039
01:37:14,958 --> 01:37:16,958
it's just more difficult work.

1040
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,666
Then, I'll take them back to the blocks.

1041
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:24,708
I'll ask again
if anyone can work tomorrow.

1042
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:29,625
Please, I'm not forcing anyone.

1043
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:32,250
I understand everyone
has a family to take care of.

1044
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:35,541
Yes, sir.

1045
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:41,000
Go!

1046
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:58,791
Bung…

1047
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:03,125
Aren't you hot?
You've been under the blanket.

1048
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:08,333
I'm coming down with a fever.

1049
01:38:19,041 --> 01:38:20,125
Shit!

1050
01:38:21,208 --> 01:38:22,416
-Fuck!
-Fuck, Bung was stabbed!

1051
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,208
Fuck, Bung got stabbed!

1052
01:38:24,291 --> 01:38:25,291
Bung got stabbed!

1053
01:38:25,791 --> 01:38:27,416
Fuck, Bung got stabbed.

1054
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,583
Find a straw.

1055
01:38:28,666 --> 01:38:29,625
Find a straw. Find a straw.

1056
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:32,333
Find a straw.

1057
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:34,208
Got any?

1058
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:36,291
Tod!

1059
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:37,791
Where's your Amps straw?

1060
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:39,291
Here, fucking here.

1061
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:43,541
I saw it yesterday, dickhead. The straw?

1062
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,625
Find a straw. Quickly.

1063
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:47,583
Bung got stabbed!

1064
01:38:47,666 --> 01:38:48,750
Got any there?

1065
01:38:49,916 --> 01:38:50,750
Tod!

1066
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:53,958
Golf! Come here!

1067
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:55,541
Still not seeing any straws.

1068
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:57,791
Golf! Come here!

1069
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:01,375
Bung.

1070
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:04,458
Hold him tight!

1071
01:39:06,666 --> 01:39:08,375
Hold him tight!

1072
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:10,291
Hold him tight!

1073
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:16,208
Bung, Bung, Bung, just a bit. Just a bit.
Hang tight.

1074
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:28,291
Just a bit, Bung.
Bung, just a bit. Just a bit.

1075
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:32,500
Bung.

1076
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,416
Just a bit, Bung.

1077
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:40,333
Hold him right!

1078
01:39:45,375 --> 01:39:46,208
Bung.

1079
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,708
Bung, Bung, Bung, Bung, it's bleeding out.

1080
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:51,625
Just a bit.

1081
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:53,833
Just a bit.

1082
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:57,625
I…

1083
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:12,083
I can't.

1084
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:15,041
It's not right.

1085
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:17,250
Fucker!

1086
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:20,291
Boss! Boss, my friend got stabbed!

1087
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:22,875
-Boss! Boss!
-Boss!

1088
01:40:22,958 --> 01:40:25,083
-Help me shout!
-Boss!

1089
01:40:25,166 --> 01:40:26,333
Boss, my friend got stabbed!

1090
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:30,250
-Boss! Boss!
-Boss! Sir!

1091
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:32,291
Help me shout! Boss!

1092
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:36,041
-You did right, man.
-Boss, my friend got stabbed!

1093
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,375
-You did the right thing.
-Boss!

1094
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:39,625
Boss!

1095
01:40:39,708 --> 01:40:41,875
-Boss!
-Boss!

1096
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:43,458
Boss, my friend got stabbed!

1097
01:40:44,916 --> 01:40:48,041
Let them go to sleep. That's enough.

1098
01:40:48,666 --> 01:40:51,583
Boss, my friend got stabbed! Boss!

1099
01:40:51,666 --> 01:40:52,791
Call for help, man!

1100
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,041
Boss!

1101
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:55,750
Boss, my friend got stabbed!

1102
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:57,041
-Boss! Boss!
-What the fuck, huh?

1103
01:40:57,125 --> 01:40:59,083
Puek, enough!

1104
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:00,708
Boss, my friend got stabbed!

1105
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:05,083
-Fuck! Motherfucker! Boss! Boss!
-Puek.

1106
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:06,791
Dammit, Puek, enough!

1107
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:01,583
Puek…

1108
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:06,875
I have something to tell you.

1109
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:12,666
Farang.

1110
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:16,041
Tell everyone to go to sleep.

1111
01:42:19,041 --> 01:42:19,958
It's done.

1112
01:42:26,458 --> 01:42:29,208
Hey, everyone, go to sleep.

1113
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:32,000
Bung's asking.

1114
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,708
Bung, I'm sorry.

1115
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:52,708
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1116
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:54,375
Tonight…

1117
01:42:59,666 --> 01:43:02,291
Can you two stay with me?

1118
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:06,875
Lie down, Bung.

1119
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,583
Farang.

1120
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:26,291
You know I love you, right?

1121
01:43:29,625 --> 01:43:30,750
You know, right?

1122
01:43:38,416 --> 01:43:39,375
Puek.

1123
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:48,500
Take care of our guys for me.

1124
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:54,666
Those guys… They're like us.

1125
01:43:57,041 --> 01:43:58,583
No house.

1126
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,416
No loved ones to go back to.

1127
01:44:07,166 --> 01:44:08,458
I want you two…

1128
01:44:10,666 --> 01:44:12,125
to take care of them.

1129
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,458
Yes, Bung.

1130
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:29,583
The moon's so beautiful tonight.

1131
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,125
Can you see it?

1132
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,375
Yes, Bung.

1133
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:51,291
Yes, Bung.

1134
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:02,291
Can you see starlights?

1135
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,333
I can see starlights everywhere.

1136
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,208
Is there a shooting star, Bung?

1137
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:31,000
Yeah.

1138
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,291
Make a wish, Bung.

1139
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:39,750
You can wish for anything you want.

1140
01:46:58,041 --> 01:46:59,291
Warden.

1141
01:47:22,541 --> 01:47:24,083
My son's so shitty, right?

1142
01:47:24,625 --> 01:47:25,875
That's why he died like this.

1143
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:28,083
You're the warden.

1144
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:31,125
How could you let my son die?

1145
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:34,875
-I'm very sorry--
-Sorry my fucking ass!

1146
01:47:41,416 --> 01:47:42,541
You ever got a kid?

1147
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,875
If your kid dies,
what will you fucking do?

1148
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:49,916
What the fuck are you doing?

1149
01:47:50,541 --> 01:47:52,291
And the fucker who killed my son?

1150
01:48:05,208 --> 01:48:07,750
-Fucker! You, fuck off!
-What the fuck?

1151
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:08,833
You, fuck off.

1152
01:48:08,916 --> 01:48:10,166
Fucking 1v1 me, fucker!

1153
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:25,416
Why only two of you?

1154
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:27,791
Where's the other one?

1155
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:30,541
Wanna go against me?

1156
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:33,166
Alright.

1157
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:35,875
But there are no guns here.

1158
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:37,375
Heard you're only good with 'em, right?

1159
01:48:37,458 --> 01:48:39,833
Hand to hand with me, can you handle it?

1160
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:43,250
What I'm good at is my damn business.

1161
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:47,583
You, shithead, are only good in here.

1162
01:48:50,708 --> 01:48:52,541
Then cross blades with me.

1163
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:54,333
Can you?

1164
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:58,166
Yeah, but only you, motherfucker.

1165
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:00,791
The one who should be doing it is me.

1166
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:02,541
Hey, fucker, alien.

1167
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:05,583
This fucker already said so.

1168
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:08,791
Gotta keep his fucking word, eh?

1169
01:49:09,833 --> 01:49:13,833
Okay, then we have a date.
Before the tally.

1170
01:49:13,916 --> 01:49:16,083
Ten spotters each.

1171
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,333
And the bet…

1172
01:49:19,166 --> 01:49:21,333
My life and my friend's.

1173
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:29,458
Great words. I'm impressed.

1174
01:49:30,833 --> 01:49:31,666
As you said.

1175
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:36,750
But now, can you shitheads
fuck off from us?

1176
01:49:36,833 --> 01:49:38,125
We're showering.

1177
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:40,125
Rude ass bitch.

1178
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:43,250
No need to hurry, no need to hurry.

1179
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:44,708
-No need to rush, big boy.
-Go, Puek.

1180
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:45,958
Go!

1181
01:49:46,041 --> 01:49:48,000
Eh! Fucker.

1182
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:10,791
Farang.

1183
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:18,416
Ever thought you'd be in here one day?

1184
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:20,458
What do you think?

1185
01:50:22,458 --> 01:50:23,625
It's a fucking prison.

1186
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:27,416
Not the moon people dreamed of walking on.

1187
01:50:28,041 --> 01:50:29,291
Or did you dream about it?

1188
01:50:32,625 --> 01:50:33,500
Never.

1189
01:50:38,416 --> 01:50:40,458
What did you dream of
when you were outside?

1190
01:50:44,791 --> 01:50:45,708
Dunno.

1191
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:48,250
But trust me…

1192
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:53,375
all my dreams are about in here now.

1193
01:50:56,625 --> 01:50:57,791
Are you fucking with me?

1194
01:50:57,875 --> 01:50:59,375
Fucking with you? Shithead.

1195
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:05,833
Puek.

1196
01:51:06,875 --> 01:51:08,375
I give you five years.

1197
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:10,041
Then you'll understand

1198
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:13,291
how it feels to be jailed
even in your dreams.

1199
01:51:15,666 --> 01:51:17,541
But if you get out one day,

1200
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,333
can you dream again?

1201
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:24,833
Depends on when I can get out.

1202
01:51:36,375 --> 01:51:38,416
I think I'm gonna die today, Farang.

1203
01:51:41,541 --> 01:51:43,041
I heard that…

1204
01:51:44,416 --> 01:51:45,833
people who are gonna die…

1205
01:51:46,458 --> 01:51:47,666
would think of their moms.

1206
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:50,875
I miss my mom.

1207
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,583
Listen…

1208
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,958
I don't have a mom or dad.

1209
01:52:24,916 --> 01:52:26,416
Don't think too much of it.

1210
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:34,916
If you wanna pull out,
just tell me honestly.

1211
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:38,708
I'll take the fall for you.

1212
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:41,000
I can't pull out.

1213
01:52:42,708 --> 01:52:44,750
You know I fucking can't.

1214
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:51,125
If I pull out, those fuckers
will never stop pushing us.

1215
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:04,666
Thank you for everything.

1216
01:53:29,166 --> 01:53:30,166
Make it fucking fair.

1217
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:33,375
Take off your shirt and your armor.

1218
01:53:33,458 --> 01:53:35,291
Don't be sneaky, motherfucker.

1219
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,250
That fucker Bung Gus
came to tell you in a dream?

1220
01:53:47,791 --> 01:53:48,833
That's good.

1221
01:53:51,041 --> 01:53:52,875
You won't make the same mistakes as him.

1222
01:53:56,791 --> 01:53:58,833
The fuck you doing in here for? Calm down.

1223
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,750
A kill needs a countdown.

1224
01:54:02,833 --> 01:54:03,666
Boy.

1225
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:05,416
One…

1226
01:54:06,375 --> 01:54:08,083
-Come on, come on.
-Make it deep.

1227
01:54:08,166 --> 01:54:09,416
Come on. Get me.

1228
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:10,708
Come get me. Get me.

1229
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:14,125
Come on, come on, come on.

1230
01:54:14,208 --> 01:54:15,791
You can't wield, can you?

1231
01:54:18,541 --> 01:54:21,000
-Come on, boxer.
-Get him!

1232
01:54:22,166 --> 01:54:23,000
Yeah!

1233
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:25,208
Think you're the only one
who can kick? I can, too!

1234
01:54:26,666 --> 01:54:27,958
Come at me, huh?

1235
01:54:29,666 --> 01:54:31,041
Hey, what's outside?

1236
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,833
You don't dare, pussy. Fucking coward.

1237
01:54:37,916 --> 01:54:39,958
Dafenvise move? What are you scared of?

1238
01:54:40,041 --> 01:54:42,041
Come at me, fucker. I'm open. Get me.

1239
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:43,083
Come at me, bitch! Go on!

1240
01:54:47,125 --> 01:54:48,291
Fucker, gotcha!

1241
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:07,000
So, boxer? Come on, fucker. Come here.

1242
01:55:07,083 --> 01:55:09,750
Come on, come on.

1243
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,291
Shit!

1244
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,083
Boy, you fuck off!

1245
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:23,208
Let him finish the job
and you come 1v1 me.

1246
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:27,416
-Let's go, let's go.
-Come on, come on.

1247
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,208
-Come on, come on.
-Get the fuck out.

1248
01:55:29,291 --> 01:55:31,625
Boy, help me.

1249
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:40,875
I give up. Let me go.

1250
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:21,833
Ouch!

1251
01:56:22,416 --> 01:56:23,708
Ouch!

1252
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:26,875
Ouch!

1253
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:34,833
Take them back to the barracks.

1254
01:56:35,458 --> 01:56:37,208
I'll handle these two.

1255
01:56:38,125 --> 01:56:38,958
Yes, sir.

1256
01:56:39,666 --> 01:56:40,750
Go! Go back!

1257
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:42,666
Get up!

1258
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:46,750
Quickly.

1259
01:57:02,333 --> 01:57:04,291
What's fucking up with you, huh?

1260
01:57:04,958 --> 01:57:06,875
What's fucking wrong with you?

1261
01:57:06,958 --> 01:57:08,916
Always wanna fuck shit up.

1262
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,375
Careful, warden.
My friend got stabbed, too.

1263
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:12,458
Oh, really?

1264
01:57:12,541 --> 01:57:13,500
You love your friend, right?

1265
01:57:13,583 --> 01:57:16,916
Love him so much, right? So much, right?

1266
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,250
Love him so much, right? Motherfucker!

1267
01:57:21,333 --> 01:57:23,458
You arranged the knife fight, didn't you?

1268
01:57:23,541 --> 01:57:25,166
Did I fucking force you
to stab each other?

1269
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:26,083
Huh?

1270
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:29,875
You're in here
and still can't think for shit.

1271
01:57:31,666 --> 01:57:33,791
And you dare ask for my pity.

1272
01:57:35,875 --> 01:57:38,125
You don't give a shit about your lives.

1273
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:41,000
How could you ask others
to care about you, huh?

1274
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:42,375
You fucking scum!

1275
01:57:43,166 --> 01:57:44,291
Here!

1276
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,083
Let me see.

1277
01:57:50,333 --> 01:57:52,833
Just a scratch. It won't kill you.

1278
01:57:52,916 --> 01:57:56,333
I was the only one who started it.
I'm taking the blame.

1279
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:01,416
You two motherfuckers.

1280
01:58:03,708 --> 01:58:04,541
Go!

1281
01:59:01,291 --> 01:59:02,500
Just like you said.

1282
01:59:08,166 --> 01:59:10,166
My dream's locked in here.

1283
01:59:21,416 --> 01:59:25,250
I think you should sleep.
Tomorrow will come.

1284
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,125
Couldn't sleep?

1285
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:12,875
Who fucking could, really?

1286
02:00:17,291 --> 02:00:20,750
Hey, Puek, I forgot to ask you yesterday.

1287
02:00:23,333 --> 02:00:24,291
Ask what?

1288
02:00:26,833 --> 02:00:28,625
Why the fuck's your name Suparb?

1289
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:34,166
My mom…

1290
02:00:35,666 --> 02:00:38,333
She wanted me to grow up polite.

1291
02:00:39,166 --> 02:00:41,000
So, she named me Suparb Sripuek.

1292
02:00:42,208 --> 02:00:43,375
And look at me now.

1293
02:00:43,458 --> 02:00:45,333
So fucking polite.

1294
02:01:17,708 --> 02:01:19,541
You fuckers ain't hungry?

1295
02:01:20,708 --> 02:01:22,541
Just eat.
I won't do anything to you shits.

1296
02:01:45,583 --> 02:01:46,416
Eat it.

1297
02:01:59,125 --> 02:02:00,125
Is it good?

1298
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:04,041
Wanna eat like this again?

1299
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,583
I know you do.

1300
02:02:08,875 --> 02:02:11,041
But if you wanna eat
delicious things like this,

1301
02:02:12,125 --> 02:02:13,250
you gotta be outside.

1302
02:02:16,041 --> 02:02:19,041
As long as you're in here
and still act like this,

1303
02:02:21,458 --> 02:02:23,958
you're never gonna get
to eat anything good.

1304
02:02:24,833 --> 02:02:27,791
You have to eat
the same boring fucking slop.

1305
02:02:29,916 --> 02:02:32,208
You wanna end up like your friend, Golf?

1306
02:02:35,958 --> 02:02:37,291
It's all over, boss.

1307
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:44,333
I'm asking you two here.

1308
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:50,791
Why did you fucking do it? For what?

1309
02:02:50,875 --> 02:02:53,291
Huh, Golf? Why did you do it?

1310
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:55,958
I don't know.

1311
02:02:56,708 --> 02:02:59,583
And you, Puek, why did you do it?

1312
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:05,750
I don't know.

1313
02:03:07,625 --> 02:03:10,958
I just know the outside you speak of,

1314
02:03:12,833 --> 02:03:13,750
I don't have it anymore.

1315
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:16,875
That's fine.

1316
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:20,708
You two's lives need to go on.

1317
02:03:23,125 --> 02:03:24,958
But you can't be here anymore.

1318
02:03:39,458 --> 02:03:42,083
Puek, you'll go to Chaopraya prison.

1319
02:03:45,083 --> 02:03:46,208
And you, Golf,

1320
02:03:48,375 --> 02:03:49,750
you go to Bang Bon.

1321
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,375
Good luck.

1322
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:00,208
Warden.

1323
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:11,708
Go.

1324
02:04:13,041 --> 02:04:14,083
Walk faster.

1325
02:04:25,916 --> 02:04:27,416
