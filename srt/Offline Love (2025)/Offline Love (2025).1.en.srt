1
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,390
This is it.

2
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,905
Wow.

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,871
This must be it.

4
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,667
"Good morning. Your trip begins here."

5
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:48,256
"This is where letters are exchanged
as the sole means of communication."

6
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:53,053
"There is a mailbox for each participant
In the center of the café."

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,721
I see.

8
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,809
"Please turn off all your digital devices
and place them in the lower mailbox."

9
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,145
The lower mailbox. Okay.

10
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,191
"Please place the key
in the key box next to the mailbox."

11
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,776
Oh, this.

12
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,863
"Next, please take the guidebook
and travel funds from the upper mailbox."

13
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,910
"From now on, you can use
this mailbox to exchange letters."

14
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,871
"Your journey in search
of dramatic encounters begins."

15
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,247
"Bon voyage!"

16
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,041
Well, then.

17
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,044
My power bank.

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,764
And this.

19
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,185
Done.

20
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,442
Okay.

21
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,572
A guidebook,

22
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,575
money, and a credit card.

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,163
TEN PEOPLE TRAVELED
FOR TEN DAYS WITH NO DIGITAL DEVICES

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>So, the participants</i>

25
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,584
can't use any electronic devices,
not even cameras.

26
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,342
A FATEFUL LOVE BEGINS

27
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,177
<i>It's only ten days.</i>

28
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,012
We don't know if we’ll even meet.

29
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,141
You might suddenly
run into someone in the streets.

30
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,769
Yes, I believe fate exists.

31
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,397
A MIRACLE OF TEN STRANGERS

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,024
MEETING IN A FOREIGN CITY

33
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,025
Excuse me.

34
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,319
<i>I didn't think I'd meet</i>
<i>anybody in a church.</i>

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,405
<i>I thought, "This must be fate."</i>

36
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,614
<i>It's a miracle we met.</i>

37
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,782
<i>That's fate too.</i>

38
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>Thank you for meeting me.</i>

39
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,996
<i>I hope I can meet you again in Japan.</i>

40
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,123
<i>I already had my heart set.</i>

41
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,126
BUT BEING "OFFLINE" PLAYS WITH THEIR FATE

42
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,295
We can't exchange our contact info.

43
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,422
We don't know when we'll meet again.

44
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,551
Without a phone,
I wonder how we'll get in touch.

45
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,845
I wonder if he's coming.

46
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,393
<i>I'll be here all night.</i>

47
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,604
<i>I really want to see her.</i>

48
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,230
<i>I didn't think you'd be here.</i>

49
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,528
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE PROMISES…

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,365
<i>I wonder if this will decide my fate.</i>

51
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,701
<i>Writing letters</i>
<i>is the only way to communicate.</i>

52
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,121
<i>I thought today might be</i>
<i>the last time I get to see you.</i>

53
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,584
WHAT WILL BECOME OF ALL THE PROMISES?

54
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,216
So, this is it.

55
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,550
- It has started.
- Yes.

56
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,636
<i>Offline Love </i>is a record

57
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,931
of ten men and women
traveling without any digital devices.

58
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,559
- They spend ten days in a foreign country.
- Ten days.

59
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,395
Can they meet their soulmate

60
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,023
and fall in love with them
while being offline?

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,400
We are the witnesses.

62
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,778
The two of us from Reiwa Roman,
and of course,

63
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,862
Ms. Kyoko Koizumi.

64
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,239
Thank you for joining us.

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,658
- For some reason.
- It's not a given?

66
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,868
For some reason, I'm here.

67
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,787
- Isn't this the usual crew?
- No.

68
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,205
Not at all.

69
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,873
You don't seem like the type.

70
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:13,503
I heard the two of you
from Reiwa Roman would be here.

71
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,214
I think you're a new generation,

72
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,635
and you're not really
confined to the old norms.

73
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,264
I thought it might be interesting
if we could do this together.

74
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,974
We're being tested.

75
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,269
I'll say stuff I've never said before.

76
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,646
Also, what they're doing in <i>Offline Love</i>

77
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:37,235
is actually something
that I experienced when I was young.

78
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:41,656
Looking back now, each and every moment

79
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,993
felt like such a treasure.

80
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:45,910
I see.

81
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,955
If they are able to recreate those things,

82
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,250
I feel like it could really make us dream.

83
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,002
Did you make sure it's like that?

84
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,923
But just from the opening scene,
it felt like watching a movie.

85
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,841
That's true.

86
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,926
The city itself is so stylish.

87
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,803
The way they filmed it was chic.

88
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,972
- It looks surreal.
- Right.

89
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,809
There are many
dating reality shows out there.

90
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:14,689
Basically, the purpose is
to help people meet their soulmate.

91
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,275
We're taking that element of fate

92
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,902
and pushing it to the extreme.

93
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,071
True. Fate plays a major role.

94
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,240
Right? They have no smartphones,

95
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,284
so they can't make plans on social media.

96
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,952
They can't use maps either,

97
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,620
like Google Maps.

98
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,166
What's more, they're not in Japan
but in an unfamiliar foreign country.

99
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,002
With all the uncertainties,

100
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,420
when you meet someone,

101
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,256
it’s probably going to feel more like fate

102
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,927
than meeting in a regular setting
or on a dating reality show.

103
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,471
I think so too.

104
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,638
- I do.
- Right?

105
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:07,658
GARDEN OF ARENAS CIMIEZ

106
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,286
This is huge.

107
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,038
CIMIEZ MONASTERY

108
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,498
Amazing.

109
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,249
Wow.

110
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,086
It's beautiful.

111
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,296
<i>I often use social media</i>

112
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,173
and electronic devices…

113
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,257
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

114
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,385
…for my work.

115
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,261
Other than when I'm sleeping,

116
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,014
there’s hardly any time
when I’m not on my phone.

117
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,100
<i>My mind gets overwhelmed,</i>

118
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:36,104
<i>so I’ve always wanted</i>
<i>time away from my phone.</i>

119
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,730
I also draw pictures.

120
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,108
<i>So I like visiting art museums.</i>

121
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>If I met someone in a place like that,</i>

122
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,447
it can't be described
as anything other than fate, right?

123
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,366
- She's perfect for this show.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,951
She's very digital.

125
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,454
CASTLE HILL

126
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,414
Wow.

127
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,168
This is beautiful.

128
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,631
<i>Until about a year ago,</i>

129
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,009
I was part of
the national water polo team in Japan.

130
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,556
I had the privilege
of competing in the Olympics twice.

131
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,517
<i>After leaving the national team,</i>

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>I started my own team</i>
<i>to continue my activities.</i>

00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:24,444
OLD TOWN OF NICE

134
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,372
<i>I actually live in Paris right now.</i>

135
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,916
I want to walk the runway
in Paris Fashion Week.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,419
That's why I came to Paris from Japan.

137
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,880
<i>Considering my age,</i>

138
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,299
I want to get married,

139
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,843
<i>and that is a dream I've always had.</i>

140
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,472
<i>So I hope to meet someone nice.</i>

<i>I'm in my third year of my comedy career.</i>

143
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,692
I’m part of a comedy duo named Kanon.

144
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,903
I work night shifts at a karaoke place

145
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:11,324
and also work as a waiter,
going around various embassies.

146
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,410
<i>I believe every encounter is fate.</i>

147
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:19,123
<i>I’ve got plenty of energy,</i>
<i>so I plan to walk around the city</i>

148
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,627
<i>and do whatever it takes</i>
<i>to find my soulmate.</i>

149
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,921
I'm popular with girls. I am.

150
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,923
- Popular with girls?
- Shut up.

151
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,926
Are there really comedians this cool?

I don't feel jealous,

155
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,745
and my heart doesn't stir.

156
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,457
I want to experience
what it's like to cry because of love,

157
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:06,212
to feel excited, and to truly understand
what it means to be in love.

158
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,381
I hope she does.

I'd like this one, please.

162
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,262
You like this?

163
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,346
Yes.

164
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,430
- Merci.
- Thank you.

165
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,266
Thank you very much.

<i>My ideal type</i>

<i>Someone who's gone through struggles</i>
<i>and isn't living carelessly.</i>

I'm originally from Niigata,

170
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,943
so I like to drink.

171
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,989
There were times
when it snowed heavily for days,

172
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,824

<i>I'm a model.</i>

00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,777
<i>Two years ago, I would find</i>
<i>relationships through social media.</i>

181
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:16,741
<i>Now, in a situation</i>
<i>where digital devices are banned,</i>

182
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,784
I hope to have a new fateful encounter.

183
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,787
GARE DU SUD
FORMER SOUTH TRAIN STATION

184
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,084
<i>I think I'm the type</i>
<i>to fall in love easily.</i>

185
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,046
If they say they like me,
I’ll end up liking them too.

186
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,048
MIMI, 20, PART-TIME WORKER

187
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,966
<i>I like people who are older than me.</i>

188
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,761
<i>The older, the better.</i>

189
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm pretty competitive and a bit stubborn,

190
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,684
so I tend to take the initiative.

191
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:48,064
<i>Since it's only ten days,</i>
<i>and we can't use our phones,</i>

192
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,232
<i>I feel like I really have to give my all</i>

193
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,444
and try harder than usual
to go after what I want.

194
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,279
She's a reassuring participant.

195
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,197
No doubt.

196
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,157
What?

197
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,201
GARIBALDI SQUARE

198
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,830
<i>I'm a model and actor.</i>

199
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,750
It's not exactly a hobby,
but I have a sweet tooth.

200
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:12,505
<i>My favorite dessert,</i>
<i>crème brûlée, originated in France.</i>

201
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,342
I’d love to find a few great places
and visit them with a girl.

202
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,179
<i>I want to say things like,</i>
<i>"This place has the best desserts."</i>

203
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,389
That's tasty.

204
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,227
What?

205
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,068
<i>I've never been outside of Japan.</i>

206
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,653
Of course, I have my worries.

207
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,571
There's the language barrier.

208
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,409
My passport is still being applied for.

209
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,203
Where am I right now?

210
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,747
I'm lost.

211
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,250
<i>I've fallen in love once or twice.</i>

212
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,629
I've never been in a relationship.

213
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,924
- It might feel even more like fate.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,971
Excuse me.

215
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,724
<i>Maybe I'm influenced</i>
<i>by dramas and manga too much,</i>

216
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,185
but I dream of girls looking up like this,

217
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,314
so I might be attracted
to someone taller than me.

218
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:33,085
- We've seen nine out of ten participants.
- Yes.

219
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,087
- They're all cute.
- I agree.

220
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,715
- Both the guys and the girls.
- Right?

221
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,467
The setting is in Nice,

222
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,053
a city located in southeastern France.

223
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,638
It's by the Mediterranean Sea

224
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:49,435
and is a popular destination
for tourists from all over the world.

225
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,813
Nice has an area
of 71.9 square kilometers.

226
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,732
That's about 141 Tokyo Disneylands.

227
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,903
So meeting someone
without smartphones is extremely hard.

228
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,114
Yeah. It's the size of Shibuya
and Setagaya wards combined.

229
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,617
And the main stage is right here.

230
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,827
The city center of Nice is behind us.

231
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,745
Oh, this.

232
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,790
- You wouldn't be able to find Waldo here.
- You're right.

233
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,917
- This is hard enough.
- It's impossible.

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,878
- Don't hide Waldo here.
- This is definitely challenging.

235
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,756
- But that's why we have this guidebook.
- The guidebook.

236
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,051
- It was made just for this program.
- Seriously?

237
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,262
So if you have this with you,
they'll know you're on this show.

238
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,806
You should hold it like this.

239
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,557
- They'd know right away.
- Right.

240
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,394
In the past, people meeting
for the first time at a café

241
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,105
would share in advance
what they have with them.

242
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,982
- I've heard of that.
- As a mark.

243
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,900
Exactly.

244
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,527
Like a hair accessory?

245
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,405
Yeah, or something like,
"I have a red rose with me."

246
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,157
That was how people met.

247
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,494
As for reading the map,
we can find our current location

248
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,913
by using these to figure it out.

249
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,582
But without these, reading a map

250
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,085
can be a challenge for younger people.

251
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,420
- You need to be used to it.
- True.

252
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,048
Tohko seemed to be having a hard time.

253
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,426
<i>- Yes, I agree.</i>
<i>- She looked at two maps but had no idea.</i>

254
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,887
I believe humans and living beings

255
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,933
are naturally born with intuition.

256
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,352
But if we rely too much on technology

257
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,272
and don't use that innate ability,

258
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,233
it could just be waiting to blossom.

259
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,194
- I see.
- Your senses would become sharpened.

260
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,445
- Yeah.
- Wow.

261
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,240
Does it really turn out that way?

262
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,325
- Stop that already.
- Do they blossom?

263
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,578
- Don't overthink it.
- Do they?

264
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,803
#ILOVENICE

265
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,265

266
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,268
AND SHOWS A PANORAMIC VIEW OF NICE

267
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,313
<i>- They're nearing each other!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>

268
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,273
<i>- Wait, really?</i>
<i>- Oh?</i>

Oh, how cute.

272
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,196
This is amazing.

273
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,952
It's beautiful.

274
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,255
- They didn't meet.
- No.

275
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,424
- No?
- They missed each other.

276
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,885

277
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,429

NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

281
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,329
Bonjour.

282
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,376
<i>Nanami is getting closer.</i>
<i>But he's inside the shop.</i>

283
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,544
<i>- Souvenirs?</i>
<i>- Get out!</i>

284
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,989
Merci beaucoup.

285
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,324
- Au revoir. Merci.
- Au revoir. Merci.

286
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,667
Meeting on the first day is really fate.

287
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,044
Who will meet first?

288
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,130
I wonder if anybody's here.

289
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,050
Is anybody around here?

290
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,926
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

291
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,180
It would be nice
to walk here with somebody.

292
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,015
I wonder where I should go.

293
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,102
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

294
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,855
Is it possible to not meet anyone at all?

295
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,777
I don't think I'll meet
anybody on the first day.

296
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:57,367
PORT OF NICE

297
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,119
<i>Oh!</i>

298
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,330
<i>- It's two guys.</i>
<i>- Oh, that's possible too!</i>

299
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,372
<i>That would happen.</i>

302
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,611
Um, nice to meet you.

303
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,071
Are you part of this?

304
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,865
- Good to see you!
- Likewise. I'm Arai.

305
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,409
Let's get you out of the crosswalk. Wow!

306
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,286
Really? They met!

307
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,955
Because they had the guidebook.

308
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,581
I'm surprised! And relieved.

309
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,043
- Have you met anybody yet?
- No, nobody.

310
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,796
- Wow, you startled me.
- Yeah.

311
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,715
I didn't expect anybody
to talk to me in a crosswalk.

312
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,178
I noticed you were holding this guidebook.

313
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,139
- Ah, I see.
- Yeah.

314
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,141
So I thought, "Maybe it is."

315
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,434
- I'm relieved.
- Same here.

316
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,104
- Truly.
- I'm Yudai Shimamura.

317
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,939
- I'm Atsushi Arai.
- Atsushi?

318
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,024
- Atsushi.
- Nice to meet you.

319
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,527
Yudai. Are you headed somewhere?

320
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,364
It's getting late,
so I thought I'd grab something to eat.

321
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,450
Maybe something sweet
since I have a sweet tooth.

322
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,412
A kind of dessert, perhaps.
Would you like to join me?

323
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,457
Sure. I was thinking of going
to a café over there.

324
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,792
Let's go then.

It's stunning.

334
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,494
Amazing.

335
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,914
Wow.

<i>- Oh!</i>

00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,133
<i>- The three of them?</i>
<i>- What's gonna happen?</i>

339
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,141
Where should I go?

340
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,936
Is anybody here?

341
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,869
What should I do?

342
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,621
Should I go that way?

343
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,666
Yeah, I'll go that way.

344
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,878
Wow, look at that.

345
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,676
Huh?

346
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,520
Hi.

347
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,939
Seriously?

348
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,775
Wow, you surprised me!

349
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,277
For real?

350
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,904
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

351
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,030
I met someone!

352
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,408
You startled me.

353
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,493
I finally met someone.

354
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,161
Yay!

355
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,288
- It's Mimi.
- Wow!

356
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,623
Whoa! This is amazing.

357
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,292
I still can't believe it.

358
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,210
- Nice to meet you.
- You too. I'm Sho.

359
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,461
- I'm Mimi.
- Mimi.

360
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,754
- Sho.
- Hi.

361
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,006
Hello. Yay!

362
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:39,923
I'm so relieved.

363
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,133
Yes!

364
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,050
Shall we walk?

365
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,303
Yeah, let's walk.

366
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,722
- This is shocking.
- I'm still surprised.

367
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,932
I didn't find anybody at all,

368
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,769
so I thought
nobody was at the beach today.

369
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,522
I was walking along the beach all day too.

370
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,316
- Really? All day?
- From over there.

371
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,609
- I was walking along this way.
- Seriously?

372
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,154
I thought nobody was there,
so I walked this way.

373
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,615
- I'm so glad.
- You surprised me.

374
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm amazed we actually met.

375
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,453
Yay!

376
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,455
So, what should we do?

377
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,666
- Should we try going down?
- Yeah?

378
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,126
- Go down?
- Or…

379
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,380
That's a good idea
since we met at the beach.

380
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,175
- Should we?
- Let's get lost in thought.

381
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,384
Get lost in thought?

382
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,928
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

383
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,472
Caffe latte?

384
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,723
Okay.

385
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,724
Um.

386
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,935
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

387
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,521
Sorry, excuse me.

388
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,274
What is this?

389
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,028
What are these?

390
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,031
Confectionery with hazelnut and caramel.

391
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,699
- Caramel?
- Yes.

392
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,868
Um.

393
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,870
I'll take this.

394
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,290
- Tohko's cute. She's trying so hard.
- She has her own pace.

395
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,750
- "Excuse me."
- Tohko.

396
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,667
You can do it.

397
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,294
CALIPAGE FRANCE STATIONERY SHOP

398
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,588
They're pretty. So colorful.

399
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,840
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

400
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,883
Wow.

401
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,220
I'll choose this.

402
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,057
Merci beaucoup.

403
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,725
Thank you. Bye-bye.

404
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,269
Kanaka has a different perspective.

405
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,105
- She has an air of elegance.
- Yes.

406
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,318
Your main job is modeling?

407
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,738
- I do more modeling now.
- I see.

408
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,450
- Have you always played water polo?
- Yeah, since elementary school.

409
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,286
There was a water polo course
at my swimming club.

410
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,664
- Wow.
- That was where I started it.

411
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,834
It's amazing that
you've continued it this long.

412
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,379
Last year, I retired
from the national team.

413
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,005
Wait…

414
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,591
- I think I've seen you somewhere.
- Seriously?

415
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,136
- It was…
- I wonder what it was.

416
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,971
You don't have your phone.

417
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,224
- I know.
- You searched for your phone just now.

418
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:58,854
You've never lived
without digital devices, right?

419
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,272
- Right.
- That's why.

420
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,692
- Have you ever had a pen pal?
- No, never.

421
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,278
- I'm the last generation to write letters.
- Really?

422
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,488
I think so. I'm 30.

423
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,074
It's nice to go back to those days.

424
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,995
I've always wanted
to fall in love like that too.

425
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:19,291
You need a lot of emotion
and feelings to write letters.

426
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,502
I wonder if we'll meet a woman

427
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,046
that will make us feel that way.

428
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,299
I think so.

429
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,967
I believe we'll find her.

430
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,555
What would you do if you didn't find
anybody for the next ten days?

431
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,475
I really didn't
expect to meet anybody today.

432
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,686
- Same. I was counting on the second day.
- This was a miracle.

433
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,813
- You're right. This was fate.
- Yeah.

434
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,816
LETTER LOUNGE MAISON MARGAUX

435
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,697
A PLACE TO EXCHANGE LETTERS
TO MAKE PROMISES

436
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,659
WITH MAILBOXES FOR EACH PARTICIPANT
(OPEN 8:00 A.M. TO 10:00 P.M.)

437
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,086
Five people.

438
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,297
I wonder if this will decide my fate.

439
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,395
The sun is setting.

440
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,563
Yeah. It's stunning.

441
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,066
It's beautiful.

442
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,484
It's setting.

443
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,487
Oh, no. The sun's really setting.

444
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,821
It's so beautiful.

445
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,031
Are you hungry?

446
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,032
Yeah, I am.

447
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,784
- Should we eat something?
- Yeah.

448
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,412
- We should go eat something.
- Let's do that.

449
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,499
- Maybe Mediterranean.
- Mediterranean?

450
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,252
I think I saw something like that.

451
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,212
You mean Mediterranean cuisine?

452
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,756
- Yeah, in the food section.
- I found it.

453
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,841
Yeah, that's the one!

454
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,886
What time does it close?
Oh, it's still open.

455
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,348
Or we could just see what's around.

456
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,058
- We're new here.
- True.

457
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,142
We could do that.

458
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,310
- Yeah?
- This area.

459
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,895
This area looks good.

460
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,813
Yeah.

461
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,941
- We first need to meet with women.
- Yeah.

462
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,111
I guess we just have to walk
all over the place.

463
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:16,491
- But then, tomorrow…
- Yeah.

464
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,786
- You know that "I Love Nice" monument?
- Yes.

465
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,664
- You're bound to meet somebody there.
- Yeah.

466
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,042
You could just sit and wait.

467
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,170
That's true. We might
run into somebody at tourist spots.

468
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,298
Yeah. And if we meet someone here,

469
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,258
we'll definitely think of it as fate.

470
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,011
- Anybody would think that.
- For sure.

471
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,971
My name is Tohko.

472
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:42,100
Please meet me tomorrow
at 4:00 p.m. at Place Masséna.

473
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,811
I look forward to meeting you.

474
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,896
From Tohko

475
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,774
This is a creepy letter.

476
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,193
I'm sorry it's so sudden.

477
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,342
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

478
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,719
I guess I won't find anybody today.

479
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:24,851
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

480
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,618
- I didn't expect two guys to meet first.
- Yeah.

481
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:45,538
We saw a scene
very notable to this show there.

482
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,374
He tries to find his phone.

483
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:51,044
<i>- But he notices he doesn't have one.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

484
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,713
You'd find almost everyone
if you looked them up.

485
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,217
- Right. There are several actors.
- That's true.

486
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,427
But none of that matters here.

487
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,471
- They can't look each other up.
- No.

488
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,890
The show has prepared this guidebook

489
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,476
and the letter lounge, Maison Margaux.

490
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,727
It's like Margiela.

491
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,855
<i>- You're right. It's like Margiela.</i>
<i>- Margiela.</i>

492
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,275
They can come and go freely
between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.

493
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,569
- I see.
- So it's not open 24 hours?

494
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,781
To make plans, they either meet in person

495
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,241
or write letters.

496
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,534
- That’s it.
- Right.

497
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,787
Tohko was doing eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

498
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,623
<i>Their first impression</i>
<i>is solely their names.</i>

499
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,791
<i>That's a first.</i>

500
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,044
And for the person
who receives that letter,

501
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,587
it's their handwriting.

502
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,297
- Right.
- That's true.

503
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,384
- So, what did you think of Mimi and Sho?
- Only they met.

504
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:43,096
<i>They have good chemistry,</i>
<i>as if they were originally a couple.</i>

505
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,514
<i>- They look good.</i>
<i>- A good vibe.</i>

506
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,684
- He approached her so naturally.
- Yeah.

507
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,893
He came from behind.

508
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,894
<i>It was so natural.</i>

509
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,021
<i>- It's amazing he went from behind.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

510
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,982
You would check from the front first.

511
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,526
- Yeah.
- Like this.

512
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,611
Doesn't that happen a lot?

513
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,573
When people think, "Is that Kyon Kyon?"

514
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,491
they would run past me

515
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,994
and turn back,
like they remembered something.

516
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,412
- Wait, you knew?
- You knew.

517
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,081
- They all know.
- The celebrities know this tactic.

518
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,499
We shouldn't do it then.

519
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,419
You'd want to do that,
but he was very casual.

520
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,671
- Very casual.
- He seemed confident.

521
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:21,551
The fact that they met
gives a strong sense of fate.

522
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,971
Yeah, and when they meet
new people later on,

523
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,056
the level of fate is the strongest here.

524
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,226
- They met on Day One at the beach.
- Right.

525
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,062
- You'd be able to believe in that fate.
- Yes.

526
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,733
Kensuke must have felt
some fate with that rock he threw.

527
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,067
Fate with a rock?

528
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,696
<i>- It's deep in the ocean already.</i>
<i>- They have the strongest fate for now.</i>

529
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,698
Kensuke hasn't done anything yet.

530
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,700
He only bought souvenirs.

531
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,786
<i>We need to teach him how to spend money.</i>

532
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,787
<i>It's true though.</i>

533
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,540
Why did he get himself
souvenirs on the first day?

534
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,958
- So true!
- I agree.

535
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,977
NICE CÔTE D'AZUR AIRPORT

536
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,204
He's got a special aura to him.

537
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,581
Why is he joining later than the others?

538
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,750
<i>Are they drawing near?</i>

539
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,126
<i>Will they meet this time?</i>

540
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,586
<i>But it's a bit dark.</i>

541
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,090
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

542
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,593
MAHO, 30, MODEL

543
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,205
- What? Seriously?!
- Huh?

544
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,748
- Why?
- Why didn't they notice?

545
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,876
- How could they miss that?
- No way.

546
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,891
If I go straight up this street…

547
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,183
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

548
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,896
…I will find Maison Margaux.

549
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:44,319
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

550
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,863
<i>Will Kensuke and Kanaka meet?</i>

551
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,907
<i>- Maybe they will.</i>
<i>- Kensuke?</i>

552
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,463
It's good old Margaux.

553
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,519
Wait.

554
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,649
- Oh?
- Really?

555
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,025
Hey!

556
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,902
Are you…

557
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,029
- Finally!
- Yes, I am.

558
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,783
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

559
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,787
- How they noticed each other was cute.
- They're so cute!

560
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,830
These two are kind of nice too.

561
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,748
So cute.

562
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,417
- My name is Kanaka.
- I'm Kensuke.

563
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,669
- Kensuke?
- Yes.

564
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,504
- Nice to meet you.
- Same to you.

565
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,713
I'm so relieved!

566
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,466
I thought I would be all alone.

567
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,343
- You haven't met anybody?
- No. You?

568
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,511
No.

569
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,931
I was walking around,
hoping I would run into someone,

570
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,684
but I didn't, so I was about to give up.

571
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,144
That's why I came to Margaux.

572
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,480
- And then I found you!
- I see.

573
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,524
I'm so happy.

574
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,526
- Have you had dinner?
- Not yet.

575
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:07,860
Let's eat.

576
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,445
I'd love to.

577
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,114
- Thank you.
- I'm so glad!

578
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,365
I’m so happy.

579
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,868
I was thinking of
eating alone back at the hotel.

580
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,953
Same here.

581
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,870
Really?

582
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,872
- Let's go somewhere.
- How about pizza?

583
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,165
That sounds good!

584
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,042
Where is La Villa d'Este?

585
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,546
- Oh.
- Oh!

586
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,965
- It's right there.
- It's nearby. Let's go.

587
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,968
Wow. It's crowded.

588
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,220
- Do they have seats?
- We'll see.

589
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,014
Let's go see.

590
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:36,973
Is it this way?

591
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,685
Thank you.

592
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,353
Bonjour.

593
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,107
I’ve heard that the portions
in France are huge.

594
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,316
Seriously?

595
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,445
This old lady
had a pizza this big just now.

596
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,656
- She was eating it.
- For real?

597
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,616
The plate was this big,

598
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,493
and the pizza was this big.

599
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,787
So the pizza was really thin?

600
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,497
- No. A normal one.
- A normal one?

601
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,042
- And the plate was?
- This big.

602
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,419
- And the pizza?
- This big.

603
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,129
I'm serious.

604
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,881
Kanaka is leading him in.

605
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,257
It's for his punchline.

606
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,009
She's giving him a good lead-in.

607
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:17,847
It's only our first day,
but how is it going without your phone?

608
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,349
I actually don't think much of it.

609
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,394
You don't usually use your phone?

610
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,146
- Just to listen to music.
- I see.

611
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,441
We can’t listen to music right now.

612
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:32,987
But then, I don't normally
pay attention to the sounds of the city.

613
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,573
I usually wear my earphones or headphones

614
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:39,410
and listen to my favorite songs.

615
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:44,290
It’s been a while since I listened to
all the different sounds of the city,

616
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,667
and it's kind of fun in its own way.

617
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,211
I know what you mean.

618
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,464
There was an old man doing this.

619
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,801
Doing what? Are there really such old men?

620
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,636
What do you call this thing?

621
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,346
- An accordion?
- An accordion.

622
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,390
Babel Babel.

623
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,308
Huh?

624
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,937
Babel Babel. Look, it's right here.

625
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,355
Huh?

626
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,654
- I found it!
- It's right there!

627
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,114
We found it.

628
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,740
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

629
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,992
- Do you live in Tokyo?
- Yeah.

630
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,661
- I see.
- Yeah.

631
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,870
Where do you live?

632
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,247
I live in Nagoya.

633
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,832
- Nagoya?
- Yeah.

634
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,875
- You live in Nagoya.
- Yeah.

635
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,628
I have so many things I want to ask you.

636
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,756
But I'm still in shock
that we actually met today.

637
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,175
- Yeah.
- I'm kind of overwhelmed right now.

638
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:41,180
- But you want to find more people, right?
- Yeah.

639
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,224
I wonder what will happen tomorrow.

640
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,851
Right. Tomorrow.

641
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,354
There are so many places
I want to visit in this guidebook.

642
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,897
- Oh!
- You found it?

643
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,399
- Yeah.
- What is it?

644
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,483
- Yeah.
- Where?

645
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,819
- There's something I want to do.
- Okay.

646
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,071
I want to wear the "I Love Nice" T-shirt.

647
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,991
I definitely want to wear
the "I Love Nice" T-shirt too.

648
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,909
I want to find it, no matter what.

649
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,202
How about tomorrow?

650
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,663
Let's find it together.

651
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,499
So you know,
we would usually use our phones

652
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,918
to arrange a meetup, right?

653
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,212
- You're right.
- That's the hard part.

654
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,007
- What should we do?
- Yeah, what should we do?

655
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,134
How about we meet up

656
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,386
at Maison Margaux at 10:00 a.m.?

657
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,721
That's the best way.

658
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,638
- Yeah.
- Okay.

659
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,225
- If we can't meet up…
- Yeah?

660
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,477
- I'll leave you a letter.
- Oh!

661
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,688
- I'll tell you where I am.
- That's great.

662
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,064
So smart of you.

663
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,067
Right? But you know what?

664
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,197
- We might find two letters in the mailbox.
- You're right.

665
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,033
That's a possibility too.

666
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,244
Even if we haven't met,
we could say, "I want to meet you."

667
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,746
That's one way to do it.

668
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,839
Who should I write to?

669
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:02,345
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

670
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,888
I am Atsushi Arai.

671
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,558
Can we meet up on Day Three,
this Saturday at 11:00 a.m.?

672
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,651
To Nanami

673
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,619
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

674
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,059
Huh?

675
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,608
Who could it be? Yudai?

676
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,822
Dear Atsushi,

677
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:07,785
Please meet me tomorrow
at 4:00 p.m. at Place Masséna.

678
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,662
From Tohko

679
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,418
Wow.

680
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,879
- He should have checked his mailbox first.
- True.

681
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,174
- Why didn't he check Tohko's letter first?
- No kidding.

682
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,803
- Check before you start writing.
- That's the correct order.

683
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,806
HOTEL BRICE GARDEN

684
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,519
Time to eat.

685
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,522
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

686
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,529
HOTEL NICE RIVIERA

687
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,698
Time to dig in.

688
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:53,497
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

689
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,832
Yum!

690
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,256
Man, I'm exhausted.

691
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,843
So, what do you usually do in Tokyo?

692
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,595
I'm a comedian.

693
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,138
- Really?
- Yes.

694
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,349
No wonder you're funny.

695
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,516
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

696
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,684
Exactly.

697
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,812
I'm really into comedy,
so I go to watch shows a lot.

698
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,064
- Live shows?
- Yeah.

699
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,023
Seriously?

700
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,358
Are you the funny man?

701
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,194
- It's not like that.
- Oh.

702
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,445
You're a solo comedian?

703
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,156
- I do sketches as a duo.
- I see.

704
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,576
- We don't do funny man and straight man.
- I get it.

705
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,745
- Like a mixture?
- We exchange jokes.

706
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,205
That sounds interesting.

707
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,539
Sorry, guys.

708
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,250
Here you go. This is for you.

709
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,710
Thank you.

710
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,711
And your pizza.

711
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:41,629
- Yeah.
- Merci.

712
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,172
Do you have some spicy things?

713
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,298
- Of course.
- Thank you.

714
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,508
- Yes!
- It's huge.

715
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,842
Let's eat.

716
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,513
Wow.

717
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:54,308
I haven't had a proper meal in hours.

718
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,395
- Delicious, right?
- Delish!

719
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,358
So, what made you join this show?

720
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:06,237
I thought I could
go overseas and eat meals.

721
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
Don't you normally eat?

722
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,950
- Well, I don't have a lot of money.
- Okay.

723
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,743
So I cook a huge amount of pasta

724
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,622
and eat one meal at night.

725
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,540
What?

726
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,166
That's what comedians do.

727
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,209
I didn't know.

728
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,670
Yeah, we ate pasta every day.

729
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,797
Do you fall in love at first sight?

730
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,006
Yeah, definitely.

731
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,467
- What kind of girls do you like?
- My type?

732
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,262
- You're so straightforward.
- Was I too direct?

733
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,892
I like girls who share my interests
or have a similar mindset.

734
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,688
Also, people who have
their own individuality.

735
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,857
- I like to surf.
- Oh!

736
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,650
- Really?
- Yeah.

737
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,026
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

738
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,780
I started surfing about two years ago.

739
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,158
- I surf too.
- Really?

740
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,493
- Wow!
- Yeah!

741
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,329
We have something in common. Yay!

742
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,914
- Surfing is great.
- Yeah.

743
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,916
That's cool you like to surf too.

744
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,918
- How about you?
- Me?

745
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,712
I like really happy people.

746
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,214
- Really happy people?
- Yeah.

747
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,757
Someone who's always smiling.

748
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,092
That's great.

749
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,969
But you laugh a lot too.

750
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,053
- Me?
- Yeah.

751
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,472
I'm having fun.

752
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,308
- You are?
- I'm glad I met you.

753
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,893
You know what?

754
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,687
This is kind of exciting.

755
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,522
- Yeah?
- Is it just me?

756
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,859
I haven't been
in a relationship for two years.

757
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,944
- Oh?
- So…

758
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,156
This kind of situation makes me nervous.

759
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,866
There's another thing I want to do.

760
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,783
What's that?

761
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,786
I want to walk along the beach

762
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,580
with a bottle of wine in one hand.

763
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,374
- Okay.
- And a baguette in my other hand.

764
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,835
- And I'll just watch the ocean.
- That's amazing.

765
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,629
- Isn't it?
- That's the best.

766
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,756
- Let's do that.
- Yeah, let's do it.

767
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,049
- Let's do it.
- Promise.

768
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,469
Yeah!

769
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:57,348
I can tell that Mimi is a skilled player
with exceptional technique.

770
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,641
The love expert.

771
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,059
Any plans for tomorrow?

772
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,354
I was thinking of going to Old Nice.

773
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,065
There are secondhand clothing stores.

774
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,900
Thrift shops?

775
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,109
Yeah.

776
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,069
And also,

777
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,656
I want to go to a spice shop
because I like to cook.

778
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,824
So, you cook.

779
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,159
How about you?

780
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,204
- I want to get a good view of Nice.
- Oh!

781
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,455
Like a vantage point?

782
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,250
- A vantage point?
- Somewhere with a panoramic view.

783
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,793
- Of Nice?
- Yeah.

784
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,379
Wow. So you're going there.

785
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,172
That was what I was thinking.

786
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,259
But can I join you at Old Nice?

787
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,387
Then let's do this.

788
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,600
We'll buy spices
that will make your pasta tastier.

789
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,520
Thank you. That's a great idea.

790
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,982
- Yeah. Olive oil?
- Olive oil is famous here.

791
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,025
Nice is famous for that.

792
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,778
Let's meet at 12:00 p.m. at the fountain.

793
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,363
Which side?

794
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,241
The front or the back side of the statue?

795
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,659
Which do you prefer?

796
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,578
The back.

797
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,870
The back side, then.

798
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:06,959
What if it's just
the two of us like this for ten days?

799
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,712
If that's the case, that's fate.

800
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:11,714
Yeah, I guess.

801
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,007
If that happens.

802
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:18,137
- They make a good pair.
- They look good together.

803
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,265
If we really had someone like Kanaka,

804
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,017
it would help us a lot.

805
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,184
- Right.
- True.

806
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,521
She's what I imagine
a comedian's wife to be like.

807
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,606
- Is that so?
- True.

808
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,983
- Someone reliable who can take charge.
- Yes.

809
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,776
Kensuke is kind of adorable.

810
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,862
- Yes. He's cute.
- Kensuke is adorable.

811
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,072
For me, it was his hands.

812
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,074
<i>- Powdery hands.</i>
<i>- He's not used to it.</i>

813
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,618
<i>Pizzas from supermarkets</i>

814
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,077
don't have that powder.

815
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,788
- No, they don't.
- Pricey pizzas leave flour on your hands.

816
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,665
- Yeah. On the surface.
- The good pizzas.

817
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,419
It was probably his first time,
so he felt like the powder was on him.

818
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,172
And when he was asked
why he joined this show,

819
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,383
he answered that
it was because he can eat meals.

820
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,928
Did you invite him
as a clinical trial or something?

821
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,264
So, that game between Mimi and Sho.

822
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,850
<i>Mimi's constant display</i>
<i>of technique was amazing.</i>

823
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,602
<i>We saw about seven moves.</i>

824
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:10,606
She asked what kind of girls he likes
and got closer to him.

825
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,359
When Sho mentioned surfing,
she kept quiet at first.

826
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,819
- Right. She kept it.
- She kept it once.

827
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,446
Then, she reveals she surfs too.

828
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,366
"This is kind of exciting. Is it just me?"

829
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,992
Oh, the high five.

830
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,577
- The high five.
- We both surf.

831
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,953
High five,

832
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,497
"I'm excited. Is it just me?"

833
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,917
- Then, the pinky promise.
- She's so skilled.

834
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,461
It's the same for Kanaka and Kensuke
and Mimi and Sho.

835
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,589
When they meet in person,
it really makes them feel

836
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,925
like they have to
make plans for the next day.

837
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:38,842
That's true.

838
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,471
But they might also
want to find other people.

839
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,849
If they promise to meet at 9:00 a.m.,
they're stuck with them.

840
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,143
But it's okay to leave.

841
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,397
In a normal dating reality show
where everyone is together,

842
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,066
it would feel like
they clearly chose someone else.

843
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,234
Ah, I see.

844
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,695
- But they haven't met everyone yet.
- Right.

845
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,029
That's true.

846
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,699
Maho and Atsushi missed each other again.

847
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,492
<i>- Not again.</i>
<i>- This isn't good.</i>

848
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,952
<i>Both day and night.</i>

849
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,080
Please allow me
to call him Atsushi the Misser.

850
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,542
- He might end up being called that.
- Yeah.

851
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,710
And why?

852
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,294
<i>He's late.</i>

853
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,838
<i>- I wonder why.</i>
<i>- Yeah, why?</i>

854
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,550
Why do we have to care
about why Aru was late?

855
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,927
Maybe he got caught in immigration.

856
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,471
- That could be it.
- Did he look shady?

857
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,974
Maybe he was caught up in some trouble.

858
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,143
Nanami is on the terrace.

859
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,311
<i>- Waiting for somebody to pass by.</i>
<i>- Alone.</i>

860
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,771
<i>- She likes wine.</i>
<i>- It's cold.</i>

861
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,275
- But she sits outside so she can be found.
- I see.

862
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,776
- That's why.
- I see.

863
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,777
That's endearing.

864
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,446
- That's cute.
- And laudable.

865
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,823
Tohko and Yudai had dinner on their own.

866
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,491
Tohko was inside a cage.

867
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,452
<i>- It's not a cage.</i>
<i>- I've never seen that.</i>

868
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,495
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>she feels comfortable there.</i>

869
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,456
- It's like a playpen.
- A playpen?

870
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,167
- What is that?
- She's cute.

871
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,961
It's not just about love.

872
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,798
Everyone also has the time to reflect

873
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,884
on themselves, right?

874
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,636
In normal dating reality shows,

875
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,514
everyone is focused
only on the romantic aspect.

876
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,518
Here, when they're just walking around,
they're also reflecting on themselves.

877
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,520
It's really fascinating to watch.

878
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,730
- Right.
- I see.

879
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,733
- Tohko must be reflecting on herself.
- Yeah.

880
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,557
Mailbox? Oh, this.
