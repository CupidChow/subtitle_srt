00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,803
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

2
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,430
DEAR AKKUN

3
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,059
FROM MIMI

4
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:09,903
Dear Akkun,

5
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:15,033
When I found out about the Last Letter,
I immediately knew I would send it to you.

6
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,994
I want to see you again at the beach.

7
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,038
I hope you feel the same way too.

8
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:20,997
From Mimi

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,253
I want to see you again at the beach.

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,735
- I see.
- I see.

11
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,655
- Finally, it's the last day.
- The last day.

12
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,406
- It's Day Ten.
- Day Ten.

13
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,574
Oh, no.

14
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,701
Let's go over the rules again.

15
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,287
Today is the last day.

16
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,331
Each participant chooses one person.

17
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:07,127
They will wait for that person
where they want to see them again.

18
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,629
They can wait for that person

19
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,548
until sunset.

20
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,802
If they don't wish to meet anybody,
they can retrieve their digital devices

21
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,595
at Maison Margaux.

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,764
<i>The lower mailboxes can be unlocked.</i>

23
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,058
<i>I see. They can use these keys.</i>

24
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,685
- That ends their trip.
- Right.

25
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,855
- They can choose to do that.
- Yeah.

26
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,815
What will everyone do?

27
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,067
First, Atsushi received
a letter from Mimi.

28
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,236
<i>She wrote, "The beach."</i>

29
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,821
<i>To us,</i>

30
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,573
that sounds pretty vague.

31
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,284
- The beach is vast.
- Which part of the beach?

32
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,536
We don't know who Atsushi wrote to yet.

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,204
We haven't seen his letter yet.

34
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,373
Let's say he also wrote to Mimi.

35
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,835
Will he wait at the place
he designated as the meeting spot?

36
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,756
- Or will he leave it to fate or intuition?
- Right.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,843
That's all they can do in the end, right?

38
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,136
- Right.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,180
Tohko wrote to Yudai.

40
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,891
- "I'll be waiting at the white bench."
- Yes.

41
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,767
<i>This gave me goosebumps.</i>

42
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>Doesn't she have bad memories there?</i>

43
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,564
That's where Yudai
canceled their parachuting date.

44
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,481
- Yes.
- Right.

45
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,734
Does she want to restart from there?

46
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,069
- Yes.
- That was her letter to Yudai.

47
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,574
<i>But we still don't know</i>
<i>what Yudai wrote and to whom.</i>

48
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,577
And Kensuke wrote to Nanami, of course.

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,746
<i>"You're the prettiest. I love you."</i>

50
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,165
<i>"I'll be waiting for you</i>
<i>at the gate that was closed."</i>

51
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,001
- He chose that meeting spot.
- It was surprising.

52
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,836
He must've had other choices.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,339
- He might be trying to be funny.
- Yeah.

54
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,716
- Probably.
- Maybe.

55
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,426
- Maybe.
- Most likely, right?

56
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,470
- I think so.
- And Nanami.

57
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,139
<i>- We don't know who she wrote to.</i>
<i>- It might not be Kensuke.</i>

58
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,307
<i>We don't know yet.</i>

59
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,935
- Sho wrote to Kanaka.
- Yes.

60
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,603
<i>"We were together since Day Three."</i>

61
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,188
<i>- "Very merci."</i>
<i>- Very merci.</i>

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,857
He combined English and French together.

63
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,609
- Very merci.
- Very merci.

64
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,945
He chose the park
where they painted together.

65
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,405
"The place where we painted together."
How lovely!

66
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,324
- It's like lyrics for a song.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,369
- Where they painted.
- He can be a songwriter.

68
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,954
And Kanaka.

69
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,248
<i>- What did she write and to whom?</i>
<i>- We don't know.</i>

70
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,292
We're unsure from what she said
at the dinner gathering.

71
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,919
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,964
Aru chose Maho in the end.

73
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,715
- Yeah.
- For his Last Letter.

74
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,511
<i>He initially had feelings for Mimi,</i>
<i>but he wants to know more about Maho.</i>

75
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,888
<i>He will be waiting</i>
<i>at Place Masséna, of course.</i>

76
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,306
<i>Aru chose Place Masséna.</i>

77
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,685
- He was there often.
- He is dubbed "Mr. Place Masséna."

78
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:33,189
Everyone will be thinking, "We'll miss
that Japanese guy when he's gone."

79
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,732
Has he become famous?

80
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,776
They'll peek and cheer him on.

81
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,528
- Saying, "Good luck!"
- "Good luck!"

82
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,238
He hasn't made any local friends.

83
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:44,534
<i>- We don't know what Maho wrote or to whom.</i>
<i>- We don't know.</i>

84
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,286
We really don't know.

85
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,329
- This is exciting.
- Yes.

86
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:09,225
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

87
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,109
DEAR NANAMI

88
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,569
- Whoa.
- She got two letters.

89
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,405
- They must be…
- It must be him and him.

90
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,324
One is definitely from him.

91
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,576
The one with huge letters is from Kensuke.

92
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,753
FROM YUDAI

93
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,885
Dear Nanami Asahi,

94
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,264
I only got to spend time with you
on our Wish Letter date on Day Five

95
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,267
and a couple of other times
when I asked you to see me.

96
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,811
But each and every time was special to me.

97
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,272
I didn't get to spend
a lot of time with you,

98
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,693
but my feelings for you
are stronger than anybody else's.

99
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,324
I love you, Nanami.

100
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:12,163
I will be waiting at Nissalentours,
the meeting place of our Wish Letter date.

101
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,247
From Yudai Shimamura

102
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,125
- Morning.
- Morning.

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,628
- Thanks for joining me this early.
- A doggy!

104
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,297
- It's owned by this shop.
- Oh, really?

105
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,341
- So cute.
- So cute and fluffy.

106
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,342
Looks warm too.

107
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,806
I thought they had
good chemistry that day.

108
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,099
I thought so too.

109
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,815
FROM KENSUKE

110
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,112
Dear Nanami Asahi,

111
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,030
You're the prettiest girl in the world.

112
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,240
I love you.

113
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,784
I'll be waiting for you
at the gate that was closed.

114
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,868
From Kensuke Omodaka

115
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,286
It closed at six?

116
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,329
Oh, well.

117
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,123
- I see.
- Let's go.

118
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,291
- Too bad.
- Too bad.

119
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,252
- We'll come some other time.
- Yeah.

120
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,840
This sort of summarizes
the frankness between the two.

121
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,134
- Yeah.
- Like, "Wanna go?" "Oh, never mind."

122
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:22,442
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

123
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,907
It's for present?

124
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,701
- Yeah, for present.
- Yes.

125
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,579
And she likes yellow.

126
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,456
It's for tonight, sir?

127
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,749
- Yeah. Tonight.
- Okay.

128
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:48,968
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

129
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,554
FROM SHO

130
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,145
We were together since Day Three.
Very merci.

131
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,440
I'll be waiting for you
at the place where we painted together.

132
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,357
From Sho

133
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,609
What are you drawing?

134
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,569
I'm not showing you yet.

135
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,197
This is super fun.

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,573
- It's fun, right?
- Yeah.

137
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:16,746
SHO, 22, UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND MODEL

138
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,006
- He got a letter! This is nerve-racking.
- He got a letter.

139
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,342
It's from Kanaka, right?

140
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,557
Thank you for spending
the last six days with me.

141
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,643
I want to share my feelings with you.

142
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,230
I will be waiting for you
at the highest spot of Castle Hill.

143
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,147
From Kanaka

144
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:54,659
CASTLE HILL

145
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:14,845
MIMI, 20, PART-TIME WORKER

146
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,889
It's the same sticker.

147
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,933
- Whoa.
- Really?

148
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,643
- Wow.
- So cute.

149
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,686
A perfect pair.

150
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,731
FROM ATSUSHI

151
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,698
Dear Mimi,

152
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,867
I enjoyed every minute
from Cannes on Day Four until today.

153
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,121
I'm glad we got to go
to the beach and the zoo together.

154
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,873
You're the one
I want to meet on the last day.

155
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,791
From Atsushi

156
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,464
I will be waiting for you at the place
where you had espresso for the first time.

157
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,800
Here. Cheers.

158
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,434
- It's good.
- It's good?

159
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,685
- It is.
- Really?

160
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,728
Yeah.

161
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,372
He went to the place he chose.

162
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,249
- It's by the beach too.
- Yeah.

163
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,167
So, it's okay.

164
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,085
And he has two cups of espresso.

165
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,593
It's Day Ten. Oh, man.

166
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:49,148
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

167
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,333
Of course not.

168
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,927
Please come. I hope he comes.

169
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,478
She'll wait on that bench.

170
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:46,664
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

171
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,802
Dear Yudai,

172
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,179
I will be waiting for you
at the white bench.

173
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,097
From Riko

174
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,684
- I've never been on a proper date.
- Right.

175
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,519
I want to do so many things.

176
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,605
- A date like this?
- Today's date is great too.

177
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,233
- We promised to go parachuting.
- Yeah.

178
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,360
Can I cancel it?

179
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,695
Yeah.

180
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,531
They had gelato on this bench too.

181
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,658
- It's her third time at this bench.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,751
FROM RIKO

183
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,039
Wait. Is he here?

184
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,875
I don't think
this is the way to the bicycle shop.

185
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,001
Huh?

186
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,086
What does this mean?

187
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,058
What about Maho then?

188
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,393
- Who did she write to?
- Who did she write to?

189
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:42,863
MAHO, 30, MODEL

190
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,337
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

191
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,672
He's Mr. Masséna.

192
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,090
It's his last day.

193
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,217
He's dressed like a Mr. Masséna.

194
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,647
Dear Maho,

195
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,775
Thank you for a fantastic time
yesterday and today!

196
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,902
I want to know more about you.

197
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,864
I will be waiting
at Place Masséna on Day Ten.

198
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,824
I hope to see you tomorrow.

199
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,741
From Aru

200
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:32,997
Did you wait?

201
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,457
- No. I just arrived.
- Oh? Okay.

202
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,627
I have a place in mind, so let's go there.

203
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,965
I thought maybe we could talk easily
since we're the same age.

204
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,384
- You're the easiest to talk to.
- Right?

205
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,887
I thought this would look good on you.

206
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,638
And I got this scarf.

207
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,724
What? For me?

208
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,309
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

209
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,562
It's cold, huh?

210
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,188
Yeah, but it's good.

211
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,213
She's leaving.

212
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,549
That's what she chose to do?

213
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,465
Excuse me.

214
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,801
Your guidebook.

215
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,011
Really?

216
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,765
It's raining.

217
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,520
- It's getting heavier.
- Yes, it's pretty heavy.

218
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,523
- I wanna see over there too.
- Yes, go ahead.

219
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:23,983
Like this?

220
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,569
- What did you put there?
- Wait. Huh?

221
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,613
- Isn't this it?
- Oh, yeah. That looks good.

222
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,116
I want you to join me tomorrow.

223
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,867
What? Sure.

224
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,202
- Will you?
- Yes.

225
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,706
This is amazing.

226
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,666
So sweet!

227
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,585
I want to talk more.

228
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,295
You can't?

229
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,425
You startled me!

230
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,759
So sweet!

231
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,015
That reminds me of yesterday.

232
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,518
I really want to meet someone
and tell her my feelings.

233
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,186
So…

234
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,356
I can't go on a date with you today.

235
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,041
She didn't write to anybody.

236
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,877
I see. Not writing
a letter was an option too.

237
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,295
That's right.

238
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:12,508
She had decided to leave
if she didn't receive a letter from Yudai.

239
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,425
I see.

240
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,676
Goodbye, Maho.

241
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,678
- Goodbye.
- She went back to Paris.

242
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,472
She was wonderful.

243
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,848
Aru doesn't know this.

244
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,100
He'll continue to wait.

245
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,726
That Mr. Masséna.

246
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,771
<i>Aru would probably wait</i>

247
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,189
until sunset, wouldn't he?

248
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,316
- Yeah.
- He probably wouldn't give up.

249
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,610
Maybe some music will start playing.

250
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,239
The people of the city will join him,
and they'll all start dancing.

251
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,450
- All together.
- For the finale.

252
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,743
Like a Bollywood movie.

253
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,162
I want them to dance
like in a Bollywood movie.

254
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,541
Tohko chose to wait at the white bench,

255
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,668
<i>although she didn't get</i>
<i>a letter from Yudai.</i>

256
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,169
<i>Yudai told Nanami</i>

257
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,755
that he would wait
in front of the bicycle shop.

258
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,549
But there was no letter from Nanami.

259
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,218
He has read the letter from Tohko.

260
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,178
Where is he headed to?

261
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,305
It seemed like
he headed to the white bench.

262
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,431
It kind of did.

263
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,475
<i>- Did he head to the beach?</i>
<i>- So exciting.</i>

264
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,102
<i>How will this turn out?</i>

265
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:09,022
We still don't know
what Nanami wrote on her letter.

266
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,900
- What does that mean?
- Yeah.

267
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,487
- What if she didn't write to Kensuke?
- What's going on here?

268
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,623
CASTLE HILL

269
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,428
I really want to see him.

270
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:01,241
They would probably think back
to everything from the past ten days.

271
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,619
- Yeah.
- They want their love interest to come.

272
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,661
That's true.

273
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,093
Huh? Where is he?

274
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,013
She's at the blue bench.

275
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,390
She's at the wrong bench.

276
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,521
Oh.

277
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,902
I was wondering
which place I should wait for you at.

278
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,488
I didn't think you would move.

279
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,450
Hi.

280
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,827
- There are so many people here.
- It's crowded.

281
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,205
This view is always beautiful.

282
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,122
Yeah.

283
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,843
You're awfully quiet.

284
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,555
I'm thinking about
what I should talk about.

285
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,849
It's our last day, after all.

286
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,645
My feelings haven't changed.

287
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,565
- I put my feelings into a letter.
- Oh?

288
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:20,028
- A letter?
- I had a feeling I might talk too much.

289
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,822
So, this morning…

290
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,740
- You organized your thoughts?
- Yeah.

291
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,243
"Dear Sho."

292
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,538
"Thank you so much for the last six days."

293
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
Kanaka.

294
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,208
- What? Me?
- Yeah.

295
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,627
- It's a bit early tomorrow.
- Not at all.

296
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,546
Thank you. I'm so happy.

297
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,133
<i>"To be honest,</i>
<i>I initially thought of this trip</i>

298
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,677
<i>as a way to relax</i>
<i>from my busy everyday life."</i>

299
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,223
<i>"But everything turned into</i>
<i>a beautiful memory since I met you."</i>

300
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,394
"You remember my offhand comments."

301
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,313
She's crying.

302
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,066
<i>"You chose flowers for me one by one."</i>

303
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,485
<i>"I wanted this peaceful time I spent</i>

304
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,573
<i>with such a wonderful person</i>
<i>to last forever."</i>

305
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,659
"On the night of Day Eight,
you told me your feelings."

306
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,328
"And while I was truly happy,

307
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,997
I also felt like
I couldn’t fully embrace that joy."

308
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,125
I never shared my feelings with you.

309
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,002
I like you.

310
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,672
<i>"I’m not yet able to reply</i>
<i>to your confession of love."</i>

311
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:26,470
"Because love, for me, is not something
so light that can be decided in six days."

312
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,514
"I'm sorry I can't make
a decision right now."

313
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,059
"Whether my feelings for you

314
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,062
are those toward a friend
or something more,

315
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,231
I hope we can take our time
in Japan to figure it out."

316
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:42,527
"Without rushing, at our own pace."

317
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,112
"Let's meet again in Japan."

318
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,655
"Very merci!"

319
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,325
"Very merci!"

320
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,118
- She repeated that!
- That was great.

321
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:52,996
Here.

322
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,084
Thank you.

323
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,712
I didn't expect to cry so much.

324
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,841
Our next stage will be in Japan.

325
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,096
- At our own pace, right?
- Yeah.

326
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,411
Wait. Where is he?

327
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,415
Atsushi's not moving,
so Mimi needs to find him.

328
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,374
Yeah.

329
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,725
I hope he comes here.

330
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,158
- He's here.
- Oh, no. He's here.

331
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,452
The bicycle shop. The dog's not even here.

332
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,162
It's a tough place to wait at.

333
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,539
- He needs to stand.
- He can't sit.

334
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,531
- What's wrong?
- Who is she going to meet?

335
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:01,791
Akkun.

336
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,127
There you are.

337
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,588
Oh, my.

338
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,882
I couldn't find you anywhere.

339
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,095
- I got us espressos.
- Really?

340
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,389
- Oh, good.
- Phew.

341
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,474
Nice.

342
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,434
She found him.

343
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,145
Let's drink this.

344
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,066
It's super cold.

345
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,737
- It's pretty cold.
- It's cold.

346
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,700
- Where were you?
- I went over to that white arch there.

347
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,119
I looked all over the place for you.

348
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,957
- I was surprised when I saw your letter.
- Me too!

349
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,459
- We used the same sticker.
- It was the same.

350
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,213
The only place I could think of
as our last meeting place

351
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,297
was the beach.

352
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,382
Yeah.

353
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,594
- All of our memories were at the beach.
- Yeah.

354
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,182
- Every view we saw had the beach in it.
- Yeah.

355
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,018
- I hope you don't mind.
- No.

356
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,645
Thank you.

357
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,232
I'll be looking forward to this.

358
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,151
- Did you think, "Why?"
- I wasn't sure you'd be okay with me.

359
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,070
I wanted it to be you.

360
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,656
The kanji characters
for Mimi mean "beautiful sea."

361
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,784
Man, today was the best.

362
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,829
- Have you caught a cold?
- No, I'm fine.

363
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,331
You can warm me up if I get cold.

364
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,338
Why are you crying?

365
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,757
Wait…

366
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,180
- At 6:00 a.m.
- At 6:00 a.m. Promise.

367
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,473
Look there…

368
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,100
Hey!

369
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,979
- It's not easy to meet every day.
- No.

370
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,439
We'll go back on that.

371
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,898
Yeah.

372
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,736
- So much happened in just ten days.
- Yeah.

373
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,946
I've never found myself

374
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:00,076
feeling so fond of somebody,
or thinking they're so pretty.

375
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:08,251
- This was such a wonderful encounter.
- Yeah.

376
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,764
Do you like me, Akkun?

377
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,349
Yeah. I like you.

378
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,018
- I don't like you.
- What?

379
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,436
I don't like you.

380
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,605
- You don't like me?
- I don't.

381
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,106
I love you.

382
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,418
I don't want to go back today.

383
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,671
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

384
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,967
- Should we go to Margaux?
- Yeah. Let's go get our stuff.

385
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,968
Yeah.

386
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,054
Let's go get our luggage.

387
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,723
- Yeah. Our stuff is still there.
- Yeah.

388
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,893
- Okay.
- Okay.

389
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,937
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

390
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,772
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

391
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,065
Thank you.

392
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,707
They kissed again.

393
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,920
She asked, "Do you like me?"

394
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:34,921
"I like you."

395
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:35,964
"I don't like you."

396
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,007
- We thought, "What?"
- It was shocking.

397
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,217
"I love you."

398
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,098
It was like a <i>rakugo </i>ending.

399
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,310
"Do you like me?" "I don't."

400
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,229
"You don't?" "I love you."

401
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,814
That's all for now.

402
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,816
That's all for now, huh?

403
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,067
A great ending.

404
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,737
- So, what will they do now?
- Right.

405
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,573
I expected them to talk
about their future,

406
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,408
but they just kissed three times.

407
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,618
They kissed three times.

408
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,203
- They kissed, right?
- They did.

409
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,289
- It's unforgivable.
- Unforgivable?

410
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,707
Unforgivable.

411
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,459
Why can't they kiss?

412
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,878
- Isn't it against regulations?
- What regulations?

413
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:15,837
They can kiss?

414
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,173
- "No kissing" isn't in the rules.
- I see.

415
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,424
You get mad every time.

416
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,968
- Isn't it "No devices and no kissing"?
- No way.

417
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,429
On the other hand,

418
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,307
Kanaka and Sho found each other easily.

419
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,975
- Yeah.
- They did.

420
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,144
Sho said, "I didn't think you would move."

421
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,814
<i>It was a beautiful letter,</i>
<i>and Kanaka was crying.</i>

422
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,443
- She's usually very mature.
- That was unexpected.

423
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,780
It revealed her innocence.

424
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,742
She can't respond yet
because she faced him with pure sincerity.

425
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:50,079
She can't think of love so lightly.

426
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,583
That was what she told Sho.

427
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,586
She's very mature and charming.

428
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,172
- She's very independent.
- She is.

429
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,050
- I'm sure she runs a great business.
- I agree.

430
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:06,095
- I wonder if she produces 2XL products.
- No way.

431
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,015
- No way.
- No?

432
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,597
Hi.

433
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,564
Great.

434
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,280
Thank you!

435
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,740
Thank you.

436
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,535
Flowers?

437
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,036
Thank you.

438
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,038
I'm so happy.

439
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,123
That makes me happy.

440
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,042
- Let's climb up.
- Yeah.

441
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,627
I love the flowers.

442
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,254
Thank you.

443
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,923
Let's climb up.

444
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,675
This place, right?

445
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,430
- We wrote the same place.
- Yeah.

446
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,640
The same place.

447
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,434
It's open.

448
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,060
We can go in.

449
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,855
I still doubted if you would come.

450
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,232
- What?
- Even though I got your letter.

451
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,775
Really?

452
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,165
DEAR KENSUKE

453
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,795
Castle Hill!

454
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,758
- Wow.
- Wow.

455
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,343
- Lovely.
- It's the same place.

456
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,845
I laughed out loud when I saw it.

457
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,305
We wrote the same place.

458
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,431
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

459
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,059
- Amazing, right?
- You wrote in huge letters too.

460
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,394
So did you. It was like, bam!

461
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,980
"Castle Hill!"

462
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,273
"Castle Hill!"

463
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,191
Bam!

464
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,611
We couldn't come up here last time.

465
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,656
This was the only place we couldn't visit.

466
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,158
Yeah. We stopped down there.

467
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,578
Days Three, Four, Five,
Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten.

468
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,790
Eight days!

469
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,960
A lot of things happened, huh?

470
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:53,554
Please meet me on Day Four
at 1:00 p.m. at Place Masséna.

471
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,889
From Nanami Asahi

472
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,810
Hi.

473
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,813
- Thanks for waiting.
- Oh, no. Here.

474
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,314
Let's use this umbrella.

475
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,983
- It's nice.
- Yeah!

476
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,109
Yes!

477
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,903
- I got this.
- It's nice.

478
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,073
I'm glad I wrote you… that letter.

479
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,161
Nanami.

480
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,750
- Oh, good.
- Oh, good.

481
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,879
Wait, no.

482
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,799
- Do you watch comedy?
- Yeah.

483
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,135
Please come watch when we're in Japan.

484
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,303
I will! I was thinking the same.

485
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,304
Okay.

486
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,974
- Don't look so much.
- Sorry.

487
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,892
Can I hold your hand?

488
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,816
- Like this?
- Like this.

489
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,738
Whoa!

490
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,282
Good morning. Hey, wait!

491
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,826
- You startled me.
- Morning.

492
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,247
I'm the one that loves you the most.

493
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,416
Believe me.

494
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,710
Just stick with me.

495
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,760
I love you.

496
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,308
Me too.

497
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,854
If you don't mind…

498
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,107
will you go out with me?

499
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,574
I will.

500
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,496
- What?
- Whoa!

501
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,538
They're going out.

502
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,956
They're a couple.

503
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,335
Thank you.

504
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,941
- Don't cry.
- Yeah.

505
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,325
- I'm okay now.
- You're okay?

506
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,952
- I'm okay.
- You're okay?

507
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,081
- I can't drink at all.
- That's totally fine.

508
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,875
- I'll drink on my own.
- Please do that.

509
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,504
I'm not stylish at all.

510
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,755
That's fine.

511
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,134
You should wear what you want to wear.

512
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,804
Can I ask you out again
when we're back in Japan?

513
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,557
Okay.

514
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,601
I won't change my mind though.

515
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,188
This was such a wonderful trip.

516
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,569
Come here.

517
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,117
I wanna be with you.

518
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,411
Forever.

519
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,329
Yeah.

520
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,308
Time's almost up.

521
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,583
- It's for tomorrow.
- Yes.

522
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,001
Will you spend time with me?

523
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,127
Yes.

524
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,170
Thank you.

525
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,422
Wow, this is stunning.

526
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,507
Wow!

527
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,259
I can't read it.

528
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,515
Here. How is it?

529
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,770
- Thank you.
- The green looks good on you.

530
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,938
Thank you.

531
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,941
If I happen to see you in the city,

532
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,361
would it be possible
to have a little bit of time to talk?

533
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,278
Yes.

534
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,534
They're not here either.

535
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,912
Is it Kensuke?

536
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,585
I love you, Nanami

537
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,167
It's over.

538
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,427
This is so difficult.

539
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,059
- Hey. Tomorrow…
- Yeah?

540
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,478
- Will you go on a date with me?
- Tomorrow? Sure.

541
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,774
That was the first time
I ever asked somebody on a date.

542
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,320
- Yeah. I thought so too.
- Oh. "Yeah."

543
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,779
You said, "Myeah."

544
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,115
I want to

545
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,910
spend time with you.

546
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,912
I want to hold hands.

547
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,624
Here.

548
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,883
I'm happy, but I'm scared.

549
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,260
I guessed
his name's kanji characters right.

550
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,262
Is it Nanami?

551
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,598
Yeah.

552
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,643
- See you.
- Yeah.

553
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,065
I really loved him.

554
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,406
I wish I could be loved back too.

555
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,052
I had fun.

556
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,946
Okay.

557
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,831
This was a great trip.

558
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,340
Nanami went to meet Kensuke.

559
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,843
- They wrote the same place.
- Yeah.

560
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:33,013
We thought Kensuke wrote
his letter in a simple way.

561
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,057
It said, "At the gate that was closed."

562
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,642
He wrote that in huge letters.

563
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,352
But Nanami's was even simpler.

564
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,813
<i>- It said, "Castle Hill!"</i>
<i>- "Castle Hill!"</i>

565
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,273
<i>Just that.</i>

566
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,233
- That was cute.
- Yeah.

567
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,820
Nanami probably liked
how laid-back they can be together.

568
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,699
- It proves how close they've gotten.
- It was nice.

569
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,160
<i>They hugged, and Kensuke gave her flowers.</i>

570
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,411
<i>They climbed Castle Hill.</i>

571
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,746
He asked, "Will you go out with me?"

572
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,458
- She said, "I will."
- They did it formally.

573
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,210
We have our first couple.

574
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,920
Born from <i>Offline Love.</i>

575
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,964
They're a couple from <i>Offline Love.</i>

576
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,926
I liked their conversation
after they started going out.

577
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,971
Kensuke checked if she was okay
that he's a non-drinker.

578
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,349
- She said, "I'll just drink on my own."
- On her own.

579
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,977
I love that kind of conversation.

580
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,190
He asked her if he could
ask her out again back in Japan.

581
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,691
- That was great.
- Yeah.

582
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,026
Kensuke has a way

583
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,987
of making the best move at the best time.

584
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,281
- He does.
- I agree.

585
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,492
Will he get his big break?
I think he will.

586
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,744
I wonder. Will he?

587
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,746
I wasn't looking at him that way at all.

588
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,165
- He does well under pressure.
- Yeah.

589
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,584
He might enter
the M-1 Grand Prix or <i>King of Conte</i>.

590
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,921
He might become the next big thing
when the timing's just right.

591
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,464
- Maybe.
- You're right.

592
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,384
- I'm no expert, but I think he's lucky.
- Yeah.

593
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,762
- Anyway, that was great.
- Definitely.

594
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,640
- But on the other hand, we have Yudai.
- Yeah.

595
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:01,560
<i>- I was surprised that Yudai shed tears.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

596
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,854
- He didn't seem like the type.
- That was sad.

597
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,941
- I can't help but think he was too late.
- Yeah.

598
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,443
- Yudai was too late in general.
- I agree.

599
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:14,448
He was popular. Tohko and Maho
approached him to get close to him.

600
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,577
Because he's so kind, he prioritized
their feelings before his own.

601
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,789
They looked like tears of frustration.

602
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,625
Let's say, if he had given it his all…

603
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,794
You heard what Aru said.

604
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,171
- "It was a great trip."
- He left saying that.

605
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,258
- Tohko probably did all she could.
- Yeah.

606
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,426
She said some endearing things.

607
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,470
"This is so difficult."

608
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,724
- "I wish I could be loved back too."
- That was an amazing phrase.

609
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,936
Yeah. But at the end,
she was able to say, "I had fun."

610
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,646
Now, they'll go back to Japan.

611
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,691
Kensuke and Nanami
will go back as a couple.

612
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:52,903
I came to like everybody more and more.

613
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:58,576
As we went through the episodes,
I continued to think about them at home.

614
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,997
I would be like, "Was Aru in the wrong?
Wait, it could have been Mimi."

615
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,124
It got you thinking.

616
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,294
The next morning, I'd be like,
"No, Mimi did the right thing."

617
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,920
It was on your mind.

618
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:14,800
- Each participant was charming.
- Yes.

619
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:19,513
Anybody could have ended up
in a relationship with each other.

620
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,889
- Yeah.
- That's true.

621
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,684
I honestly think
there is such a thing as fate.

622
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,643
- Yeah.
- Right.

623
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,937
I felt that for the first time.

624
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,940
I'd like to know

625
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:36,989
how everyone felt about these ten days
without their digital devices

626
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:42,328
when they look back on this trip.

627
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,871
- Yeah.
- I agree.

628
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,833
The city of Nice itself
kind of felt offline.

629
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,336
It's common in Europe.

630
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:55,299
They have cobblestone streets
and old buildings that are centuries old.

631
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,717
And the nature too.

632
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:02,306
- These things were all wonderful.
- Yeah.

633
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,768
We can't do the same thing in Japan.

634
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,395
Our country is prone to natural disasters.

635
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,689
- Yeah.
- The buildings need to be updated.

636
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,984
- So, we're more of an online country.
- I agree.

637
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,779
I think it's a good experience

638
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,781
to go to places like this

639
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,200
and learn to be offline for a while.

640
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,078
We should all do this, if possible.

641
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,580
This show made me feel that way.

642
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,999
With work and all,
we're forced to be online.

643
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,751
- Yeah.
- But you know what?

644
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,588
The love that you keep in your heart

645
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,633
is always offline.

646
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,053
Your Day One starts now!

647
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,682
You're talking to the viewers?

648
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:48,185
All of you. Your Day One starts now!

649
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,021
- Wow.
- It's offline?

650
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,857
Our feelings are
always offline to begin with.

651
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,275
- You're right.
- Exactly.

652
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,319
But we connect that to the online world.

653
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,322
In reality, the things
and people we’re connected to,

654
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:04,118
and what’s in our hearts,
are separate from the online world.

655
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,120
We can think of them as distinct.

656
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,454
I think so too.

657
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,331
- I agree.
- That's what I learned.

658
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,833
- Totally.
- Exactly.

659
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,292
Let's start our Day One too.

660
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,294
- Yeah. Day One.
- Day One in Japan.

661
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,926
My guidebook.

662
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,060
Credit card and cash.

663
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,918
So, where's yours?

664
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,586
- Here.
- Mine's here.

665
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,802
It's been so long.

666
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,929
- Wow.
- It feels like ages.

667
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,349
- It was ten days ago that we came here.
- Yeah.

668
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,892
It feels longer than that.

669
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,395
- It feels like half a year ago.
- Yeah.

670
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,439
Shall we go back?

671
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,774
Yeah, let's go back.

672
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,026
Bye-bye, Margaux.

673
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,861
We're going back to Japan.

674
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,864
We'll meet in Japan next time.

675
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,369
Thank you very much.

676
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,957
Were smartphones always like this?

677
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,043
Wow.

678
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,886
It's over.

679
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,806
- I should have told you earlier.
- What?

680
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,058
I wrote you a letter last night too.

681
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,309
For what?

682
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,811
To show my appreciation.

683
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,772
- I'm not good with words.
- What? Where is it?

684
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,899
I have it here.

685
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,609
Really?

686
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,695
- I have it with me.
- Wow.

687
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,863
Can I have it?

688
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,407
You don't have to read it here.

689
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:53,453
- I'll read this later on my own then.
- Please do that.

690
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,664
I'm so happy.

691
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,748
Thank you.

692
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,584
Thank you.

693
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,086
Thank you so much for everything.

694
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,546
It was a wonderful trip.

695
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,800
Thank you very much.

696
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,615
- Do you wanna turn it on?
- Yeah.

697
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,078
Wow. It's the apple.

698
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,582
- Oh, it's Winnie the Pooh.
- Yeah. Winnie the Pooh.

699
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,917
Winnie the Pooh.

700
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,879
- Mine is a boxed lunch.
- Is that food?

701
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,672
It's our last time at Margaux.

702
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,300
Thank you for everything, Margaux.

703
