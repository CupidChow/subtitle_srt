49
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,980
The cityscape and everything is new to me.

00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,473
Salmon.

65
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,016
It's salmon.

The name is cute.
And it's got a heart on it.

00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,611
Maybe I'll get two.

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,145
<i>Oh! Maho and the two.</i>

94
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,356
<i>- They haven't met.</i>
<i>- No, they haven't.</i>

95
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,194
- There's a place nearby I wanted to visit.
- Okay.

96
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,153
It's…

97
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,864
This one.

98
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,783
This place.

99
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,247
"Gare du Sud Mediterraneo"?

100
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,165
Yeah.

101
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,710
- I want to visit this place.
- All right.

102
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,171
Is it all right with you?

103
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,966
Then let's go there first.

104
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,928
And then we'll go that way?

105
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,138
But what about the thrift shops?

106
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,349
- Oh, yeah.
- Do you have a shop in mind?

107
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,310
Oh, no. Not really.

108
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,230
I was actually thinking

109
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,859
of going to Margaux later
because I haven't met a lot of people.

110
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,902
Okay.

111
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,655
- I want to write letters.
- I see.

112
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,408
Was she like,
"They're in the middle of a date"?

113
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,286
Then let's go eat something at that place.

114
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,040
This one?

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,251
- This way?
- What's on the map?

116
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,336
Is it this way?

117
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,880
- Here?
- This way?

118
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,965
- Yeah.
- Oh.

119
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,051
- Um…
- It's like a food court, right?

120
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,680
So, this was originally a train station.

121
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,682
Wow.

122
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,559
- It's huge.
- This is a big station.

123
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,532

124
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,450
Detective Maho.

One o'clock.

127
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:50,386
I'd love to have the chance
to meet up, just the two of us.

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:56,309
I'll be waiting for you at 2:00 p.m.
at the fountain in Place Masséna.

129
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,984
- It's Aru!
- For today?

130
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,235
- Today.
- Today?!

131
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,904
Her waffle date is at eleven.

132
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,739
A three-hour waffle date, huh?

133
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,372
Good morning.

134
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,874
- Morning.
- Morning.

135
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,834
I made you wait again.

136
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,586
Your mailbox.

137
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,172
Huh? Is there something inside?

138
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,469
There is!

139
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,429
There are two letters.

140
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,805
Oh?

141
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,767
From Tohko.

142
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,727
She sent me one too.

143
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,812
She couldn't make it in time.

144
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,730
Yeah.

145
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,649
She wanted to join us.

146
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,484
Good for you.

147
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,694
There's one more.

148
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,280
Something will happen.

149
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,949
DAY THREE AT 5:00 P.M.

150
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,535
- Something will happen.
- Definitely.

151
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,037
Do you wanna eat here? Or shall we go?

152
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
What should we do?

153
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,415
Look. They have rice balls.

154
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,751
Rice balls?

155
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,754
- Wow.
- Yeah. Rice balls.

156
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,047
Did you have breakfast?

157
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,173
No, I haven't.

158
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,466
- No?
- No.

159
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,927
I didn't eat to save space for the waffle.

160
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,471
Let's go then.

161
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,474
So, the place we're going today

162
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,978
is somewhere I've wanted to visit
since I saw this on the map.

163
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,982
They have these small, white stones.

164
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,441
Small stones?

165
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,237
- I'll avoid seeing the photo.
- Oh, really? Okay.

166
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,949
But it looks really tasty. Pretty, too.

167
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,494
Pretty, tasty-looking, small stones?

168
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,580
- Exactly.
- What the heck?

169
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,956
They're adorable.

170
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,542
These two seem like they would get along.

171
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,594
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

172
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,181
I wonder if anybody will walk by.

173
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,112
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

174
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,666
Hi, thank you. Wow!

175
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,879

Bonjour.

There are so many stalls.

182
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,561
- Right. We should take a look around.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,189
Wow.

184
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,815
I can't tell what they have.

185
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,108
What is this?

186
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,195
- What should I eat?
- Yeah, what should I get?

187
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,112
Oh, wait!

188
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,113
What's this?

189
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,031
What?

190
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,450
- It says something.
- Oh!

191
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,535
- Maybe we order here.
- Really?

192
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,497
- They have hamburgers.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,832
Do you want a hamburger?

194
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,168
- Have you had any here?
- Not yet.

195
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,836
- Have you?
- No.

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,837
Should we try it?

197
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,214
That's a good choice.

198
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,426
- It's this one.
- Yes, we're here. Oh, yes!

199
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,387
Here, you see? Look.

200
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,846
- Wow.
- These here.

201
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,890
- Oh, this.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,392
- The stones?
- The stones.

203
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,351
This?

204
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,144
Bonjour.

205
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,147
- Wow!
- See? They're really stones.

206
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,985
- Wow.
- They have a whole variety.

207
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,822
- I'm interested in the olive flavor.
- Olive?

208
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,742
As a sweets aficionado,
you shouldn't lose your curiosity.

209
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,203
- For discovering new things.
- Exactly.

210
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,539
- So cute.
- These two are adorable.

211
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,873
They're having fun.

212
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,959
Just the two of them, though?

213
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,505
They should be out
looking for other girls too.

214
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,507
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

215
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,717
This looks delicious.

216
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,595
Yum.

217
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,973
We met for the first time yesterday.

218
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,058
- Me and you? Yes.
- Yeah.

219
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,602
You looked outdoorsy.

220
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,104
The way you looked.

221
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,939
Like your outfit.

222
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,942
- It was more outdoorsy.
- You're right.

223
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,530
- You look totally different today.
- Oh, yeah.

224
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,657
I'm glad I got to see you today.

225
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,618
That's true.

226
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,997
You can be more casual with me.

227
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,708
Okay.

228
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,668
- Yeah. Okay?
- Okay.

229
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,965
MASSÉNA STATION

230
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,967
Can we get there without getting lost?

231
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,302
Can we?

232
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,762
We're here now.

233
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,850
We'll make a turn at this corner, right?

234
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,604
We're here.

235
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,521
Here?

236
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,689
It's raining.

237
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,566
Yeah, it started raining.

238
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,318
We're here!

239
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,613
- Merci.
- Merci beaucoup.

240
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,156
Wow.

241
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,366
I should have tied my hair too.

242
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,870
- I like your hair up.
- Really?

243
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,080
- Yeah, you look good.
- Thanks.

244
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,624
Everything looks good so far.

245
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,792
Really?

246
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,751
Thank you.

247
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,922
You seemed to be having
so much fun with Aru.

248
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,634
- I thought maybe you wouldn't come today.
- No way!

249
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,970
I was really nervous
when I asked you out last night.

250
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,056
- Why?
- I wasn't sure if you would come.

251
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,390
- Why not?
- I was relieved.

252
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,392
- I was happy you asked me out.
- Really?

253
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,477
Yeah.

254
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,645
That's good to know.

255
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,522
Why did you ask me out?

256
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,775
Well…

257
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,862
You said you wanted to eat waffles,
but we never got the chance.

258
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,905
I see.

259
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,324
We knew it would rain today.

260
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,701
So I wanted to go eat waffles.

261
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,870
But it's not waffles again.

262
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,456
- That's true.
- Again.

263
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,624
Yeah.

264
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,584
Remember our plan to walk around Nice

265
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,336
with a bottle of wine in one hand

266
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,963
and a baguette in the other?

267
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,965
We pinky promised.

268
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,759
- Do you remember that?
- I do. Of course.

269
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,720
- We have to do it.
- We have to do that.

270
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,264
We have so many things to do.

271
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,515
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

272
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,725
We haven't done much yet though.

273
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,643
Right?

274
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,978
It's Day Three already.

275
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,689
- Time flies, doesn't it?
- No kidding.

276
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,108
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

277
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,276
Wow!

278
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,501
Dear Aru,

279
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,421
I'd love to have the chance
to meet up, just the two of us.

280
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,966
I'll be waiting for you at 2:00 p.m.
at the fountain in Place Masséna.

281
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,884
From Mimi

282
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,852
- He looks so happy.
- He really savored that.

283
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,855
- Wow.
- He really took that in.

284
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,232
"We were interrupted yesterday."

285
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,026
"I mentioned asking her out."

286
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,903
"But she asked me!"

287
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,365
We can't really tell
what Mimi is thinking.

288
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,536
- We can't tell.
- They might still be neck and neck.

289
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,829
And Detective Maho.

290
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,375
<i>She stealthily followed</i>
<i>Nanami and Atsushi.</i>

291
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,627
<i>- Now what?</i>
<i>- Also…</i>

292
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,587
The heartwarming Kensuke and Yudai.

293
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,588
- So cute.
- Oh, yes.

294
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,549
<i>- They're about the same height.</i>
<i>- And the same age.</i>

295
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,970
After they found out
Kensuke had bought that coat,

296
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,972
they might have made plans for today.

297
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,265
- Yes, probably.
- Yeah.

298
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,435
They probably had drinks
afterwards in their hotel room.

299
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,855
<i>- Maybe.</i>
<i>- They know they have similar tastes.</i>

300
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,108
"Hey, listen. Let me try it on once."

301
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,737
"No way! If I let you wear it,
you'll take it with you."

302
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,198
- They're besties.
- "I'll never let you wear it."

303
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,325
They must have said stuff like that.

304
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,077
Kensuke took a nap and now this.

305
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,037
He spends time on the wrong things.

306
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,916
He napped and went out
to eat sweets with a friend.

307
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,833
He had dessert.

308
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,585
- Please go find girls.
- So cute.

309
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,505
How about that mysterious letter
from the show staff?

310
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,965
<i>- What is that?</i>
<i>- What is it?</i>

311
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,174
<i>Day Three at 5:00 p.m.</i>

312
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,593
<i>- Everyone will be there, right?</i>
<i>- Everybody?</i>

313
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,054
Maybe only the ones who go
will hear something.

314
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,055
Maybe.

315
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,390
- I see.
- So, right now…

316
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,351
<i>Mimi, before her date with Sho,</i>

317
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:22,147
<i>wrote a letter to Aru asking to meet her</i>
<i>at 2:00 p.m. at Place Masséna.</i>

318
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,483
<i>- Aru has read the letter.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

319
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,777
<i>Nanami wrote to Kensuke.</i>

320
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,364
<i>She asked to meet him</i>
<i>at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow at Place Masséna.</i>

321
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,574
<i>So that is on Day Four.</i>

322
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,410
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- They should be meeting up.</i>

323
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,829
<i>And Kensuke to Kanaka.</i>

324
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,790
<i>He wrote a letter</i>
<i>thanking her for the olive oil,</i>

325
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,333
but she hasn't read it yet.

326
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,835
That's not a problem at all.

327
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,797
- She can read that any time.
- They might miss each other.

328
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,509
- They won't.
- This is unique to <i>Offline Love.</i>

329
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,552
No, it's not.

330
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,763
Things will go on without Kanaka
knowing Kensuke thanked her.

331
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,182
It's okay.
Kanaka won't reply to that letter.

332
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,518
- Day Three is moving along.
- It's only a thank-you.

333
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,145
- It's okay.
- How will this turn out?

334
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,063
Nothing will happen here.

335
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,874
You lived in Greece for a year, right?

336
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,791
Yeah.

337
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,211
When did you come back?

338
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,922
I came back

339
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,425
around May.

340
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,887
- To Japan?
- Around May, yeah.

341
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,097
I've been in Japan ever since.

342
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,182
I see.

343
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,018
So it's been about a year already.

344
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,144
Right.

345
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,773
- Nice has a different atmosphere.
- Bonjour.

346
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,775
- It's great.
- It is.

347
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,444
It's my first time in Europe.

348
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,575
- Yeah.
- Excuse me. Are you…

349
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,577
- Oh?
- Oh!

350
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,789
- Hello!
- Sorry to interrupt.

351
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,873
Not at all.

352
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,832
I'm Nanami.

353
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,709
- Oh, right. I'm Maho.
- Maho.

354
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,086
Maho. I'm Atsushi.

355
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,170
- Atsushi.
- Yes.

356
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,047
- Wow.
- What should we do?

357
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,465
- Do you want to join us?
- May I?

358
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,008
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

359
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,302
- We'll bring the tables together.
- Thanks.

360
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,720
- Oh!
- Really?

361
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,889
Maho is pretty assertive.

362
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,767
- Did she decide after seeing Atsushi?
- Maybe.

363
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,561
- This was unexpected.
- Yes, it was.

364
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,647
But I actually saw you guys earlier.

365
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,398
I noticed you two walking.

366
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,361
But I didn't have
the courage to talk to you.

367
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,154
I was hoping I'd see you again.

368
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,031
- You found us.
- Amazing!

369
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:41,411
- I wanted to come here today as well.
- Oh, okay.

370
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,956
- But I didn't expect to meet anybody.
- Yeah.

371
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,625
- Have you eaten?
- Do you want to eat?

372
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,129
- I haven't eaten yet.
- You haven't?

373
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,798
- May I join you?
- Yes, of course.

374
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,550
I want to visit so many places.

375
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,844
Me too. I want to go to so many places.

376
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,428
We still have some time.

377
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,306
We could go look for other people.

378
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,474
Or…

379
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,268
It's around here.

380
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,688
The poster shop
you mentioned the other day.

381
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,399
We still have time.

382
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,527
- It's nearby.
- Can I say something?

383
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,738
- You know what?
- What?

384
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,784
Aru asked me out last night.

385
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,619
- Or like…
- Oh, really?

386
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,996
- Yeah.
- Okay.

387
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,332
While you were in the restroom.

388
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,876
Yeah. So…

389
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,960
Okay.

390
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:34,631
- You're gonna see Aru?
- I'll go meet him around two o'clock.

391
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,842
You should go.

392
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,385
Thanks.

393
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,098
- So, he asked you out back there.
- Yeah.

394
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,059
You should go.

395
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,397
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

396
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,317
- That hit me hard though.
- Huh?

397
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,526
That hit me hard.

398
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,863
- It did?
- Yeah.

399
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,073
Aru asked her out?

400
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,783
That's not exactly true.

401
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,912
He did say he wanted to ask her out.

402
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,165
- Well, yeah.
- He did kind of say that.

403
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,167
At two, right?

404
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,128
Yeah. I still have some time.
Do you wanna go shopping?

405
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,590
- Let's do that.
- Oh!

406
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,508
- The art gallery?
- Nice Pocket.

407
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,260
Should we go to Nice Pocket?

408
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,610
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

409
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,613
- Oh, it's this. We're here!
- Wow.

410
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,614
This is socca.

411
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,407
Whoa, this looks delicious.

412
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,867
It's like a pizza.

413
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,662
Yeah, I heard it's a bit like pizza.

414
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,121
Wow. Thank you.

415
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,415
- Merci.
- Bon appétit. Thank you.

416
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,461
Yeah! What is this?

417
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,713
What is this?

418
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,174
- No idea. Is it bread?
- Bread?

419
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,092
Is it tofu?

420
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,803
Tofu?

421
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,513
He's brushing his hands again.

422
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,265
He hates having things on his hands.

423
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,225
I went to Margaux this morning.

424
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,685
I opened my mailbox,

425
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,228
and there was this letter.

426
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,855
I need to be at Margaux at 5:00 p.m.

427
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,107
It was an order.

428
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,567
- What?
- You haven't checked yet?

429
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,488
- Maybe you should go there.
- To Margaux?

430
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,864
It's Day Three.

431
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,159
- Things might start moving.
- You're right.

432
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,244
We're finally here.

433
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,662
- Nice Pocket.
- Nice Pocket.

434
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,497
Wow.

435
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,250
Oh my gosh!

436
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,502
- They have "I Love Nice" products.
- They do!

437
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,796
- Wow. This is amazing.
- These are great.

438
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,798
Oh, no! What should I get?

439
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,593
You know, rather than going for these,
we should get these here.

440
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,012
Yeah. These are cute.

441
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,097
- The white one?
- I like the white one.

442
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,181
The Nice cap.

443
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,520
- You look good.
- Yeah?

444
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,105
You have a small face.

445
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,190
Hey, look. Those are cute.

446
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,150
Which color?

447
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,693
I want this one.

448
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,069
- The green one?
- Yeah.

449
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,321
So these,

450
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,824
the green one, and the orange one.

451
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,742
Here.

452
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,164
- Merci.
- Merci.

453
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,333
"I Love Nice."

454
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,377
Wait, where's mine?

455
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,047
- Found it.
- I'll put it on.

456
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,216
- Merci.
- Merci.

457
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,134
- Merci.
- Yeah!

458
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,302
I love Nice!

459
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,722
- Yay, thank you!
- I like this cap.

460
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,349
Let me check the time.

461
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,309
I better get going.

462
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,226
Yeah?

463
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,897
- Then I guess I'll go that way.
- That way?

464
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,026
Why are you so far away?

465
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,986
- Then I'll go that way.
- Okay.

466
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,113
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

467
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,615
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

468
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,034
- Bye.
- Bye. See you.

469
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,285
- See you later.
- Later.

470
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,418
Hey.

471
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,087
Bonjour.

472
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,340
- Yay!
- Hey. How was it?

473
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,634
- You're here. I had fun.
- Yeah?

474
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,802
Was it tasty?

475
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,887
Yeah, it was.

476
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,765
- I checked out the cafés around here.
- Oh!

477
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,434
There's a nice place nearby.

478
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,145
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

479
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,772
Yay.

480
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,983
- I'm so happy.
- Yeah?

481
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,193
You're here.

482
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,320
Hey, is that "I Love Nice"?

483
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,614
- Did you buy that?
- Yeah.

484
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,324
- I did.
- With Sho?

485
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,076
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

486
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,078
Oh.

487
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,913
Huh?

488
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,039
I better get going.

489
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,209
I want to send letters at Margaux.

490
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,127
Oh.

491
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,713
- So I'll excuse myself.
- Yeah, of course.

492
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,257
- See you.
- See you.

493
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,633
- See you.
- See you.

494
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,885
- Bye.
- Bye.

495
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,433
When did you start water polo?

496
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,393
- In elementary school.
- That's long.

497
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:02,607
There happened to be
a water polo course at the pool I went to.

498
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,194
I wanted to continue
until I became good at it.

499
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,737
- Right.
- Then…

500
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,365
- I couldn't quit.
- I see.

501
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,869
- I wanted to go as far as I could.
- Right.

502
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,163
I was a national member until last year.

503
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,875
I participated in the Olympics
in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro.

504
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,376
What? Wow!

505
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,378
That's amazing!

506
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,255
- Nah.
- Yes, it is!

507
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,632
- I was just doing what I liked.
- Oh, wow.

508
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,676
- So, you retired last year?
- Yeah.

509
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,761
If you don't mind me asking,

510
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,263
why did you retire?

511
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,223
- The reason? I don't mind.
- Yeah.

512
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,351
Turning 30 was a major turning point.

513
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,563
There was a match in November

514
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,066
that would determine
our qualification for the Paris Olympics.

515
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,319
Japan became the champion.

516
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,238
We secured our place for the Olympics.

517
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,239
Right.

518
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,574
And that, to me,

519
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,370
was more valuable
than actually going to the Olympics.

520
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,790
That victory meant so much to me.

521
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,669
- The qualification kind of satisfied you?
- Yeah.

522
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,507
I wasn't sure if I could
maintain my performance.

523
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,633
Right.

524
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,760
Especially for another year.

525
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,595
In that case,

526
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,682
I wanted to focus on things
I truly wanted to do, like creating a team

527
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,060
or introducing water polo to more people.

528
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:23,688
That was what I wanted to do.

529
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,567
- So I decided to stop there.
- You put it to an end.

530
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,571
It's so much warmer than yesterday.

531
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,283
- I was freezing yesterday.
- Yeah, it was suddenly cold.

532
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,160
- This way.
- Oh!

533
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,120
- Wait. The blue chairs.
- Yeah.

534
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,249
- They're very Nice-like.
- They are.

535
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,376
Wow.

536
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,796
- Can I bite into this?
- Yeah.

537
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:52,926
Oh!

538
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,554
Good?

539
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,013
You want a bite?

540
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,899
Oh.

541
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,318
Huh? Right.

542
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,571
- Can I eat it?
- Sure.

543
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,364
- I'll eat it. Okay?
- Okay.

544
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,533
Isn't he a bit too nervous?

545
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,411
- Just eat it. Don't say anything.
- Aru!

546
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,037
- Aru!
- Aru?

547
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,081
- I'll eat it. Okay?
- Okay.

548
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,165
All of it?

549
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,626
- Thanks.
- Don't eat all of it.

550
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,919
- Thanks.
- Go ahead.

551
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,840
It's full of chocolate.

552
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,468
Nice, right?

553
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,386
That reminds me.

554
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,056
Oh, no. It's all crumpled up.

555
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,351
You gave me that letter.

556
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,022
- So I wanted to give something back.
- What is it?

557
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,607
- As a thank-you.
- Wow!

558
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,025
Thank you!

559
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,110
- It's nothing much.
- Can I look?

560
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,028
Of course.

561
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,822
What could it be?

562
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,784
- It's a pen! It's <i>The Little Prince.</i>
- Yeah.

563
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,288
- Wow. Thank you!
- I chose that for you.

564
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,541
You're always decorating stuff.

565
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,501
You were decorating your guidebook.

566
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,296
- And the colors.
- I thought you'd want multiple colors.

567
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,548
Merci beaucoup.

568
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,634
Thank you.

569
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,136
- I'll write with this each time.
- Thanks.

570
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,262
I'll keep it here.

571
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,141
You know, on the guidebook,

572
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,268
on 347…

573
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,396
- "Parachute ascensionnel"?
- Yeah.

574
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:33,818
- You can fly over the sea in a parachute.
- Really? We can do that?

575
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:38,573
- I don't know if you like that stuff.
- I do!

576
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,075
- Really?
- I love that stuff!

577
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,826
The weather is nice next week.

578
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,370
If you'd like, will you join me?

579
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,789
- You're okay with me?
- What? Of course.

580
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,083
- Definitely!
- You'll go?

581
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,084
- Yes.
- Awesome.

582
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,251
This is great!

583
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,670
I'll write it down.

584
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,004
Awesome.

585
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,882
- You're using that pen.
- I am.

586
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,258
I wrote it down.

587
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,011
That's one more on my wish list.

588
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,096
That's nice.

589
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,431
- Shall we eat?
- Let's eat.

590
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,183
- I'll try the plain flavor.
- Okay.

591
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,726
- Try it.
- I'll take a bite.

592
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,233
This is delicious.

593
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,901
This is great.

594
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,363
- What's with their dessert time?
- We don't need this.

595
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,532
They're adorable.

596
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,908
The plain one is good.

597
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,201
I'll try one too.

598
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,665
- So, what exactly is this?
- This is good!

599
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,999
- Really?
- Wow!

600
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,420
- I'm so happy to hear that.
- This is excellent.

601
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,004
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

602
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,297
- Wow.
- This is great.

603
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,718
HOTEL BRICE GARDEN

604
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,726
Oh, right.

605
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,773
Excuse me.

606
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,233
Oh.

607
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,651
- Hi.
- Oh my gosh!

608
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,445
- Hello.
- Hello.

609
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,071
I'm Nanami.

610
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,740
- I'm Tohko.
- Tohko.

611
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,868
- Come here. There's a roof.
- Excuse me.

612
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,871
- I'm so glad I noticed you.
- Yes, me too.

613
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,999
- I'm so relieved.
- Same here.

614
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,419
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Likewise!

615
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,004
- Did you get the letter?
- Yeah.

616
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,088
- At 5:00 p.m.?
- Yeah.

617
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,047
Same!

618
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,841
- What?
- I got one too.

619
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,386
Do you think everybody's gonna be there?

620
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,929
What?

621
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,474
- Wow.
- Oh.

622
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,560
- So that's what it is?
- Really?

623
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,021
Detective Maho went to talk to them.

624
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,191
- Maho talked to them, and Nanami left.
- Right.

625
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,944
<i>Did Nanami not think much of Atsushi?</i>

626
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,363
Maybe she wants to meet more people.

627
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,948
They'd met the day before.

628
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,617
<i>- At the letter lounge.</i>
<i>- Oh, right.</i>

629
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,202
<i>- They've met already.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

630
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,454
She wants to use time effectively.

631
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,707
And Maho joined them,
so she may want to chat with Atsushi.

632
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,209
How about Mimi and Sho?

633
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,378
I think there was a problem there.

634
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,799
<i>Mimi said Aru</i>
<i>had asked her out yesterday.</i>

635
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,843
- We should consider this.
- It didn't quite happen that way.

636
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,429
- Mimi's the one that sent the letter.
- Right.

637
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,681
But on Day Two,

638
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,851
Aru did say he wanted to ask her out.

639
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,977
He certainly did.

640
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,939
What do you think about this, Kyoko?

641
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,025
- This is difficult.
- What's your call?

642
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,319
Hmm.

643
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,445
But I think

644
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:27,784
she could have lied in that situation.

645
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,203
When Sho asked, "What do you wanna do?"

646
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,914
she could have said,
"I'll go around on my own."

647
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,499
That's true.

648
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,086
But she mentioned Aru's name.

649
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,172
I found that surprisingly admirable.

650
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,173
She was honest.

651
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,218
To me, it felt like she was trying

652
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,428
to get Sho fired up through that.

653
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,972
- Is that what it was?
- Maybe.

654
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,432
She asked, "Why did you ask me out today?"

655
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,309
But his response was wishy-washy.

656
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,604
He didn't say anything like,
"Because I wanted to see you."

657
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,940
But I think that lit a fire under him.

658
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,109
That's why he got matching bracelets.

659
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,362
<i>He left his mark on her</i>
<i>before passing her to Aru.</i>

660
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,363
<i>Yeah.</i>

661
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,408
<i>And Aru gave her a pen.</i>

662
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,910
By giving her things,

663
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:15,081
it's like Mimi is earning
all these medals.

664
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,250
They indirectly kissed with the éclair.

665
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,044
They did.

666
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,090
I'm really sorry,
but Aru was acting way too nervous.

667
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,425
"I'll eat it."

668
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,969
He didn't have to say that.

669
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,847
Mimi could have passed it this way.

670
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,891
But she ate it and passed it this way.

671
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,225
- That was strange.
- This side.

672
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,978
<i>- She turned it and gave it to him.</i>
<i>- That's unnatural.</i>

673
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,271
<i>This might just be me,</i>

674
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:42,025
but I loved how Nanami
was smoking an IQOS.

675
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,526
<i>It was nice.</i>

676
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,236
<i>- So that's her vibe.</i>
<i>- She smokes.</i>

677
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,530
- She's an actor.
- Yes.

678
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,867
I also do some acting.

679
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,786
I'd like to see her on set.

680
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,872
She met with Tohko.

681
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,123
And at 5:00 p.m…

682
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,500
I wonder what will happen there.

683
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,006
I'll get that.

684
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,758
- Sorry. Thanks.
- Go ahead.

685
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,598
What's this?

686
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,351
- Wow.
- Huh?

687
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,770
- Should we sit down?
- Yeah.

688
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,025
- What is this?
- Dunno.

689
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,277
Huh?

690
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:31,199
But you see? There are one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

691
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,868
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

692
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,745
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

693
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,206
- That's right.
- There are ten seats.

694
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,043
- Wow.
- Look.

695
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,673
- Hello.
- Hello.

696
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,257
Please.

697
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

698
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,303
Should we sit over there?

699
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,638
Yeah.

700
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

701
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,813
- Kensuke's like, "They're so pretty."
- He's gaping at them.

702
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,856
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

703
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,651
- I'm Yudai.
- Yudai.

704
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,652
Wow.

705
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,991
- I'm a bit nervous.
- Yeah.

706
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:13,908
I'm Kensuke.

707
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,951
- Kensuke.
- Kensuke.

708
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,120
You're in unison.

709
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,456
- I'm Tohko.
- Tohko? Tohko.

710
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,916
I'm Nanami.

711
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,668
- Nanami?
- Yes.

712
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,670
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

713
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,380
Oh.

714
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,008
She never looked like that with Atsushi.

715
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,969
She wasn't like that. What's going on?

716
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,178
- Oh!
- Oh!

717
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,556
We've both met him.

718
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,641
- Hello.
- Atsushi.

719
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,559
Good to see you!

720
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,477
- They've met too.
- Hello.

721
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,396
- Hello.
- Hello.

722
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,732
Can we sit anywhere we want?

723
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,525
- I think so.
- Right?

724
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:51,154
I'll be able to see everybody
from that seat.

725
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,488
- Yeah.
- True.

726
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,990
- You can sit there.
- Yeah.

727
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,283
- Can I?
- Yeah.

728
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,035
Okay.

729
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,288
- Hello.
- Wow.

730
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,042
- Hi.
- How have you been?

731
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,501
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

732
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,420
- I'm Kanaka.
- My name is Atsushi.

733
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,337
Hello.

734
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,673
- Hello.
- Hi.

735
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,008
We met yesterday.

736
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,426
- Hello.
- I'm Kensuke.

737
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,178
Kensuke. I'm Maho.

738
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,473
Maho gets cuter the more she talks.

739
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,474
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

740
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,601
She does seem aloof at first.

741
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,977
How have you been?

742
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,774
- The olive oil.
- Yes, the olive oil.

743
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,525
Yes, that's right.

744
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,402
- We couldn't go together.
- Right.

745
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,653
So I bought it for you.

746
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,946
Wow.

747
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,867
- Hello.
- Hello.

748
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,119
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Sho.

749
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,288
- Sho.
- Yes. Good to meet you all.

750
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,623
- Hello.
- Hello.

751
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,042
- Oh, wow.
- Nice to meet you.

752
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,003
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

753
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,713
Wow.

754
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,885
Wait. Are you shy around new people?

755
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,221
I definitely am.

756
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,430
You look that way.

757
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,683
We're all so quiet.

758
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,145
I actually feel comfortable
when nobody's speaking.

759
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,065
Me too.
I don't mind us being quiet forever.

760
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,775
- Yeah, I get it.
- Really?

761
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,069
After you.

762
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,828
- Hello.
- Hello.

763
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,663
Where should I sit?

764
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,082
- Here or there.
- There are only two seats left.

765
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,750
Whichever you like.

766
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,670
- Which one?
- I'll go over there.

767
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,214
- Excuse me.
- Nice to meet you.

768
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,216
- Nice to meet you.
- I'll sit here.

769
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,135
- This is everybody.
- Wow.

770
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,761
- Everyone's here.
- Yeah.

771
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,680
We're all here.

772
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,765
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

773
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,768
- This looks amazing.
- Wow.

774
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,730
- This looks delicious.
- All right.

775
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,607
- Shall we eat?
- Let's eat!

776
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,192
- Yeah, let's eat.
- Bon appétit.

777
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,945
- I'm 30.
- Let's eat.

778
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,155
Born in 1993?

779
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,322
- Huh?
- What?

780
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,741
In 1994, but we're in the same grade.

781
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,909
What is this?

782
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,744
"Wish Letter"?

783
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,955
- "Wish Letter"?
- What's that?

784
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,291
- Are there names on them?
- No, nothing.

785
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,377
- What?
- So do we each take one?

786
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,172
- Women on the right, men on the left.
- Oh, I see.

787
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,423
- I see.
- Oh my gosh.

788
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,924
Should we open it together?

789
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,384
- Let's do that.
- Yeah.

790
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,428
I'll take the last one.

791
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,098
- I took one.
- Go ahead.

792
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,516
- Oh, you can't reach.
- Right.

793
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,227
Then… Here you go.

794
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,479
- That's how we're doing this?
- Pass it around.

795
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,566
- Please pass it around.
- Thanks, Mimi.

796
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,483
Here you go.

797
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,152
There's no name?

798
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,486
- Like this?
- Here.

799
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,281
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

800
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,449
Here you go.

801
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,118
- And for the guys.
- The guys.

802
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,204
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

803
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,414
- Thanks.
- What is this?

804
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,708
- Can we open it?
- Yeah.

805
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,335
- Let's open it.
- Okay.

806
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,336
Ready? Open.

807
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,297
Oh? "Day Four, Cannes."

808
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,798
- Huh?
- What?

809
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,425
- Huh?
- What is this?

810
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,470
- What does this mean?
- It has the name of a region.

811
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,181
Does everybody have a different region?

812
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,724
- Huh?
- Wait.

813
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,060
- Huh? What is this?
- Wait a minute.

814
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:14,440
"A different 'Travel Guide'
is enclosed with each of these letters."

815
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:19,278
"Each of you has the right to visit
the destination enclosed in your letter."

816
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,238
Wow.

817
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,199
"By giving this letter to someone
of the opposite gender,

818
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,953
you can make a guaranteed promise
to go to that destination." Wow!

819
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,704
- Wow.
- Really?

820
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,207
- You could go to five places at most?
- Wow!

821
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,124
Seriously?

822
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,336
"The person who receives this letter
cannot reject the invitation."

823
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,297
"You may give this letter
to one person only."

824
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,926
"You may not give this to someone
with a Wish Letter of the same date."

825
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,803
Same date?

826
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,514
Oh, I see.

827
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:51,227
"You may exchange Wish Letters
among the same gender."

828
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,146
I see. Like, if you prefer
another destination?

829
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,648
Oh, I get it.

830
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,860
"It is only valid
when you hand it to them in person."

831
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,323
"The Wish Letter can only be given
on the day before the date."

832
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,533
The day before?

833
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,411
- So that's how it works.
- I get it.

834
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,748
So if you have Day Eight,
you give it to someone on Day Seven.

835
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,042
Wait, which means…

836
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,963
I have Day Four. Am I the first one?

837
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,048
Mine was Day Four too.

838
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,136
Wait. What should I do?

839
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,388
Let's eat.

840
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,809
- We should eat. Especially you, Sho.
- Thanks. Yeah.

841
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,603
I'm in no mood for eating.

842
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,272
I have no appetite.

843
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,858
Can you eat? Are you full?

844
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,236
- Wow.
- So, everyone gathered at Margaux.

845
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,072
- There's something new. A Wish Letter.
- Wish Letter.

846
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:50,077
Each Wish Letter
contains a different travel guide.

847
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,246
It tells you the destination

848
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,999
and on which day you will be traveling.

849
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,459
From Day Four to Day Eight.

850
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:01,088
- Like, you can go to Cannes on Day Four.
- On Day Four.

851
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,298
That's what's written.

852
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:06,886
So the men and women have five each,
with a total of ten destinations.

853
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:07,970
- Right.
- Yes.

854
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,264
None of them have the same destination.

855
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,640
They're all different.

856
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,934
By handing this letter
to the opposite sex,

857
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,145
they can definitely go
to that destination.

858
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,730
And they can't say no.

859
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,775
This is quite effective.

860
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,318
Right. They can't decline it.

861
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,320
But there is a restriction.

862
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,573
They cannot invite someone
with a letter of the same date.

863
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,035
The Wish Letters
all have separate destinations.

864
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,163
But those with the same dates

865
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,165
can't give it to each other.

866
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,543
From what we saw,
Mimi cannot hand hers to Sho.

867
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,128
So, Mimi…

868
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,422
Let's see…

869
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,468
If she wants to ask Sho out,
he has to exchange his with somebody else.

870
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,845
- Then Mimi could ask Sho out.
- Right.

871
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,472
- That's how it works.
- I see.

872
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,810
The Wish Letter can only be handed
on the day before the date.

873
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,270
- You can't make promises early.
- Right.

874
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,232
And you need to hand it in person.

875
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,567
They might have to go searching for them.

876
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,693
Yeah.

877
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,362
- No mailboxes.
- And on that day.

878
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,988
- That's right.
- Incredible.

879
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,325
Mimi seemed to have mixed feelings.

880
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,953
<i>She looked like she had</i>
<i>a good time with Aru.</i>

881
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,830
<i>In that case,</i>

882
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,249
Mimi could just hand her letter to Aru.

883
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,166
Right.

884
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,585
But why would she have mixed feelings?

885
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,838
Does she want to ask Sho out?

886
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,592
Or perhaps with everyone together,
she thought, "That person looks good too."

887
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,345
But there's not enough time
to carefully consider.

888
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,889
And she needs to decide today.

889
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,392
Not even one day.
She needs to hand it in person.

890
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,227
She needs to decide during dinner.

891
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,689
Is Mimi's supercomputer going to crash?

892
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,648
What will she do?

893
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,401
I'm worried about Kensuke.
Does he understand the rules?

894
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,363
He might be completely lost.

895
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,657
What if he asks Yudai to join him?

896
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,121
Can I ask which day everybody has?

897
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,956
- I think that's fine.
- Right?

898
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,960
- Day Five.
- Then you need to give it tomorrow.

899
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,837
- When is yours, Yudai?
- Mine?

900
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,797
- Mine is Day Five as well.
- Day Five?

901
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,715
- Yeah.
- Oh.

902
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,008
I don't have much time.

903
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,634
Yeah, that's true.

904
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,344
You need to decide tomorrow.

905
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,305
Day Four is tough, isn't it?

906
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,348
Yeah. Tomorrow is harsh.

907
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,516
That's true.

908
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,812
Is there somebody you have in mind?

909
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,110
I won't say there isn't.

910
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,987
- Oh!
- But…

911
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,822
But…

912
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,700
- Hmm.
- You can't decide?

913
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,620
I can't decide. Maybe?

914
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,872
I can't decide, I guess.

915
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,958
- What's she hiding?
- So vague!

916
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,838
I'd be devastated
if Mimi doesn't hand me hers.

917
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,509
- Of course you would.
- Yeah.

918
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,843
I spent the day with her.

919
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,515
So you have a good impression of her?

920
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,016
- Absolutely.
- Oh.

921
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,602
What kind of brand are you managing?

922
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:06,148
I was producing swimwear until last year.

923
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:11,028
I really like the sea.

924
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,197
That's why I produced swimwear.

925
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:19,245
But now I produce many things,
like a lifestyle brand.

926
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,496
You're really stylish.

927
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,872
I like to surf.

928
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,707
For real?

929
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,709
My dad was a professional surfer.

930
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,212
- Really?
- Yeah. That's why I like the sea.

931
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,213
Do you like clothes?

932
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,881
- Yeah.
- I can tell.

933
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,386
I definitely wanted to visit
vintage shops in France.

934
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,512
Definitely.

935
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,099
- I have a feeling Sho likes older women.
- True.

936
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,433
What is this?

937
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,978
- Is this cheese? I can't tell.
- Isn't it pork?

938
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,271
- Huh?
- I think it's pork.

939
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,273
- Pork?
- It's delicious.

940
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,191
I want to try this one.

941
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,110
What's that?

942
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,237
They're zucchini flowers.

943
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,780
Do you wanna try them?

944
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,034
Thank you. Zucchini flowers?

945
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,953
- Zucchini flowers.
- Wow.

946
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,246
They're good.

947
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,081
Oh.

948
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,166
- Oh.
- Thank you.

949
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,918
- Two?
- Yeah.

950
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,961
Thanks.

951
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,379
They have baguettes.

952
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,839
The bread here is great.

953
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,258
I love bread.
Actually, I have a sweet tooth.

954
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,217
- Really?
- Yeah.

955
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,135
Me too.

956
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,761
When I wake up in the morning,

957
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,598
I eat something sweet before I leave.

958
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,849
Wait. Same here.

959
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,851
- I only eat sweet stuff.
- Really?

960
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,728
- I dragged him around today.
- Yeah?

961
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,354
We had chocolate this morning.

962
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,898
- That's the best! I love chocolate.
- It was delicious.

963
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,985
Today, I wanted to have
dessert before a meal.

964
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,863
- And then another dessert.
- That's awesome.

965
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,907
- It was cold, but I wanted gelato.
- I wanna eat gelato!

966
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,909
Yeah. There's this great gelato place.

967
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,286
I wanna go. Where is it?

968
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,373
It was this place in Old Nice.

969
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,499
Excuse me.

970
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,418
Take your time.

971
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:50,836
They match.

972
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:54,298
Tohko seems to be
pretty locked on to Yudai.

973
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,799
Tohko, yes.

974
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,260
How about we change seats?

975
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,054
Maybe we should change seats.

976
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,722
- You wanna change seats?
- Yeah.

977
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,724
If everyone's okay with that.

978
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,935
- Oh?
- How about we change seats?

979
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,396
- Let's do that.
- Of course.

980
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,857
Should we point
at the seat we wanna go to?

981
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,983
Okay.

982
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,068
Ready?

983
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:14,985
The other side.

984
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,698
- Everybody chose different seats.
- Yeah.

985
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,784
- We all chose different seats.
- Let's move.

986
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,202
- Let's change seats.
- Yeah.

987
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,081
- Day Four is a tough one.
- Me?

988
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,459
- We have the same date.
- I know.

989
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,504
- Day Four can't hand it to Day Four?
- No. We can't do that.

990
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,297
What should I do?

991
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,132
If you wanna go together,

992
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,220
you'll have to consult
with someone to exchange your letter.

993
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,554
I…

994
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,224
You know who I like, right?

995
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,685
We have the same date.

996
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,437
So I can't hand my letter to him.

997
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,815
- She wants to go with Yudai.
- Yeah.

998
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,817
Right. She wants to go with Yudai.

999
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,860
How about switching with Mimi?

1000
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,531
If you ask him out today,
you can definitely go tomorrow.

1001
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,242
It might take a lot of courage.

1002
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:07,746
But he didn't seem interested in me
when we sat next to each other.

1003
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,333
Going on the date
might help you get closer.

1004
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,131
What should I do?

1005
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,008
We need to hand it in person,
so we don't have time.

1006
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,261
Will you switch with someone?

1007
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,807
- So?
- Mimi.

1008
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,726
- Yes?
- Do you wanna switch letters?

1009
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,644
- Switch?
- No?

1010
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,565
I can't decide. I really want to go here.

1011
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,733
Hey.

1012
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,027
Wait. Let's discuss this.

1013
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,154
We need to talk.

1014
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,072
Wait. Let's go over there.

1015
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,325
- Excuse us.
- Sorry.

1016
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,913
If Mimi switches letters,

1017
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,707
she can hand hers to Sho.

1018
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,084
But by suggesting a switch,

1019
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,711
Aru would get suspicious.

1020
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,213
It's not for him.
She could give it to Aru anytime.

1021
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,798
But switching letters

1022
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,468
would let Tohko go on a date with Yudai.

1023
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,385
Right.

1024
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,512
Wait. What should I do?

1025
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,222
We should calm down first.

1026
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,557
Let's calm down.

1027
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,725
Wait.

1028
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,769
You want to go with Yudai, right?

1029
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,978
You too?

1030
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,396
- No.
- Huh?

1031
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,106
- I…
- Let's keep it down.

1032
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,983
Yeah. I'll talk quietly.

1033
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,195
- My destination is Cannes.
- Okay.

1034
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,407
I looked at the date plan
and I really want to go.

1035
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:30,704
But I met with Sho and Aru today.

1036
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,373
It's like,

1037
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,252
I really can't decide between the two now.

1038
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,048
Why don't you go
on a date with Yudai tomorrow?

1039
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,091
Yeah. That makes sense.

1040
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,970
Then, you can tell him.

1041
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,516
"I want to go with you,
but we have the same date."

1042
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,976
"So can one of us
try to switch with somebody?"

1043
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,603
How about suggesting that?

1044
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:58,273
- I really wasn't sure.
- Yeah?

1045
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:02,820
I wasn't sure if I would
find somebody I like on this trip.

1046
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,155
- You found him?
- Yeah.

1047
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,990
But I can't even invite him.

1048
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,034
You have to say it.

1049
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,786
I'll ask him out.

1050
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,287
You should.

1051
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,415
- I'm sorry. I can't switch letters.
- Yeah.

1052
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,918
Let's do that. I'll do my best too.

1053
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,586
She's crazy about Yudai.

1054
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,921
Head over heels.

1055
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,555
I'll go first.

1056
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,647
- Have you decided?
- Oh, no. Not yet.

1057
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,357
- Seriously?
- I can't decide.

1058
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,733
I decided already.

1059
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,235
- Really?
- Yeah.

1060
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,696
I'll take it easy.

1061
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,072
- Easy?
- It's still Day Four.

1062
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,201
I have my date decided.

1063
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,203
Can I do it now?

1064
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,705
- Wow.
- I've decided.

1065
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,708
- I'll say it in front of everyone.
- Wow.

1066
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,001
Kanaka.

1067
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,836
- What? Me?
- Yeah.

1068
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,671
Really?

1069
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,298
I want to get to know you better.

1070
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,634
Wow, what a man.
He's the youngest of us all.

1071
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,052
Thank you.

1072
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,430
- It's a bit early tomorrow.
- Not at all.

1073
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,764
Let's have fun.

1074
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,433
Thank you.

1075
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,976
- Wow.
- I want to know you better.

1076
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,103
Thank you. I'm so happy.

1077
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,647
- You have cute handwriting.
- Nah.

1078
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,190
Thank you.

1079
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,860
- I'll look forward to tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1080
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,777
Thanks.

1081
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,696
I'll do my best.

1082
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,990
- It's tomorrow!
- Yeah.

1083
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,326
- The destination is nice.
- Where is it?

1084
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,328
It's pretty nice. Here.

1085
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,998
It's really nice.

1086
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,379
Oh, wow!

1087
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,048
It's a train journey in Provence.

1088
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,007
Wow!

1089
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,218
That's a cute pen.

1090
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,595
It's cute, right?

1091
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,015
- I gave her that pen that she's using.
- I see.

1092
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,517
- So that means…
- She's using the pen I gave her.

1093
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,479
- Whose name will she write with that pen?
- Oh, man.

1094
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,197
I think I'll go give it to him.

1095
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,589
- Can I have a minute?
- Sure.

1096
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,178
Hmm.

1097
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,481
Oh, no!

1098
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,775
- No!
- Hold on there.

1099
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,193
Wait a minute.

1100
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,486
Oh, my.

1101
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,948
- Aru was covering himself.
- Hey!

1102
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,783
<i>He was hiding his face.</i>

1103
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,493
<i>And he was sharing</i>

1104
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,412
his inner thoughts with Atsushi.

1105
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,123
- Yeah.
- "I gave her that pen."

1106
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,835
"I'd be devastated
if she doesn't ask me out."

1107
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,128
He said that to Atsushi.

1108
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,046
Yeah. And she gave hers to Atsushi.

1109
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,132
- Oh, boy!
- What is she doing?

1110
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,758
- Wow, Mimi.
- No way.

1111
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,760
It was really intense.

1112
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,179
<i>The way she went to tap him.</i>

1113
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,724
<i>Does she want to know Atsushi better?</i>

1114
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,268
Kensuke and Yudai
aren't an option for Mimi.

1115
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,228
- She's not really interested.
- Right.

1116
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,563
To put it simply,

1117
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,524
Sho is in the middle,
with Atsushi and Aru slightly higher.

1118
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,776
Yudai and Kensuke are lower
with Sho in the middle.

1119
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,446
And the three down to Sho are her options.

1120
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,282
When she had to choose out of the three,

1121
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:40,037
she casually chose Atsushi
since she can't go with Sho.

1122
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,873
She could get to know him better.

1123
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,458
It's still Day Three, after all.

1124
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,128
Sho said that too.
"It's Day Four. I'll take it easy."

1125
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,672
Yeah. "It's Day Four. I'll take it easy."

1126
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,132
That was so cool.

1127
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,844
So, Sho and Kanaka
are going to Provence tomorrow.

1128
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,137
"I've decided."

1129
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,431
"I'll say it here."

1130
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,974
What was that?

1131
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:01,892
<i>Such an extrovert.</i>

1132
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,769
<i>- An extrovert.</i>
<i>- Leader of the class.</i>

1133
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,146
For Tohko, it's Yudai.

1134
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,608
She was worried she might
not fall in love. But she met him.

1135
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,527
- It hit her in an instant.
- It struck her.

1136
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,989
She's crazy about him.
But they both have Day Five.

1137
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,492
- It's the same day.
- Right. She can't invite him.

1138
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,702
I wonder what Kensuke is thinking.

1139
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,662
Looking at his eyes,

1140
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,581
he seemed to be falling for Nanami.

1141
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,833
- He was gazing at her.
- "She's so pretty."

1142
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,252
He was like, "Do you want to eat this?"

1143
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,672
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- They're meeting tomorrow.</i>

1144
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,424
<i>He must have thought,</i>

1145
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,301
"She gave me that letter!"

1146
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,053
"She's so pretty!"

1147
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:41,431
Right! He thought, "This is Nanami!"

1148
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,975
That would make him so happy!

1149
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:48,146
He found out the girl
who sent him that letter was this pretty!

1150
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,191
He didn't have to make any moves here.

1151
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,984
- He was confident.
- Yeah.

1152
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,946
- So endearing.
- He's an adorable guy.

1153
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,531
There's a lot going on now.

1154
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,366
Now we know what a Wish Letter is.

1155
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,204
- Please.
- Thank you.

1156
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,833
Oh my gosh.

1157
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,335
- I hope you don't mind.
- No.

1158
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,628
Thank you.

1159
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,675
- I don't know the destination yet.
- But it's at 8:00 a.m.

1160
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,760
At Nice-Ville Station.

1161
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:19,845
Nice-Ville?

1162
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,346
Yes, the train station.

1163
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,892
Okay. I'll be looking forward to this.

1164
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,769
I can't wait.

1165
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,646
I'm so happy.

1166
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,648
Wow.

1167
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,817
- They seem so happy.
- Yeah.

1168
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,944
It's tough just hearing their voices.

1169
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,573
So you guys aren't going together?

1170
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,242
Not with the Wish Letter.

1171
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,660
Not with this.

1172
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,788
- You don't have to.
- I could do stuff without this letter.

1173
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,748
- This isn't everything.
- Yeah.

1174
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,670
Oh, man.

1175
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,548
What day do you have?

1176
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,966
I have Day Five.

1177
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,760
It's the day after tomorrow,

1178
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,096
so I can use this casually.

1179
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,725
I could ask someone
I haven't talked much with.

1180
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:11,605
Someone you're interested in,
or just want to get to know better.

1181
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,441
I want to use mine that way too.

1182
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,860
It depends on how you use it.

1183
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:17,903
True.

1184
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,032
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'm sorry, but we're closing.

1185
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,035
- Okay.
- Okay.

1186
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,872
- Merci beaucoup.
- Merci.

1187
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,958
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

1188
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,377
- I'll go enjoy myself tomorrow.
- Same here.

1189
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,340
Tap him on the shoulder and say,
"Let's go on a date tomorrow."

1190
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,592
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

1191
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,219
Let's meet again somewhere.

1192
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,305
- This was fun.
- I hope we can see each other again.

1193
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,641
- Let's meet up again.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1194
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,309
I hope we meet again.

1195
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,521
Tomorrow, here at ten o'clock.

1196
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:56,983
Now.

1197
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,652
Go! Now!

1198
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,111
Go!

1199
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,448
Will he come?

1200
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,033
Now. Go!

1201
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,451
Hey.

1202
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,661
Tomorrow…

1203
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,330
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1204
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,791
- Will you go on a date with me?
- Tomorrow? Sure.

1205
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,752
What time should we meet tomorrow?

1206
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,922
What time do you want?

1207
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,924
Do you have a place in mind?

1208
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,550
- Dessert?
- Yes.

1209
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,719
Let's see then.

1210
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,597
Have you been to Old Nice?

1211
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,558
It's around…

1212
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,269
Not really.

1213
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,896
Then let's go to that side.

1214
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,107
I know some places.

1215
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:38,733
I wanna go.

1216
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,860
Then we'll meet tomorrow

1217
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,698
at Place Masséna, that plaza right there.

1218
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:48,243
How about twelve o'clock?

1219
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,744
- Okay.
- At 12:00 p.m.

1220
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,662
Thanks.

1221
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,872
Have you seen my umbrella?

1222
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,333
Isn't it under your first seat?

1223
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,460
It's not there. But I guess it's okay.

1224
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,004
Are you sure?

1225
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:04,718
HOTEL BRICE GARDEN

1226
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,814
I want to get to know you better.
Let's have fun tomorrow!

1227
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,232
From Sho

1228
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,862
It says, "Kakaka."

1229
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,251
What should I wear?

1230
