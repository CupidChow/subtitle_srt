3
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,365
- Hey!
- Good morning.

4
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,951
- Hey.
- You're here.

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,911
- You're dressed in orange.
- Hey.

6
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,956
- Hey, you look good.
- I'm bundled up.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,082
Thanks.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,085
- Your Wish Letter was skiing, huh?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,337
Right, you didn't know.

10
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,589
It's the same as mine.

11
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,799
- Have you ever skied?
- Never.

12
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,842
Never?

13
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:51,801
Nice.

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,428
Me neither.

15
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,764
Who did you invite?

16
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,390
- Nanami.
- Oh?

17
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,228
- Did she oversleep?
- Oh…

18
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,773
She rode the bicycle a lot yesterday.

19
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,274
- Oh.
- The bicycle?

20
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,360
- With Yudai.
- I see.

21
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,862
She must be tired.

22
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,866
So if Nanami doesn't come,
will it be the three of us skiing today?

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,452
I'll wait for her.

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:23,291
Oh, I would have to go
if there are no more buses.

25
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,045
You know, this is…

26
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,590
Hey! She's here!

27
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,551
- I'm sorry. Good morning.
- Morning!

28
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,552
Morning.

29
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,890
- I'm glad you're here.
- Did you oversleep?

30
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,183
I overslept.

31
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,851
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,061
You're the best skier here.

33
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,813
Yeah. You're our teacher.

34
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,397
It's been a while though.

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,442
- Really?
- Yeah. It's been five or six years.

36
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,277
Is this yours?

37
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,613
Yeah. I got this in Old Nice.

38
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,697
- Really?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,824
- I see.
- It's cute.

40
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,620
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,166
- Is it this one? It says Isola 2000.
- Isola 2000.

42
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,084
Let's go.

44
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,801
Yes?

45
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,100
- Good morning.
- Hey! Good morning.

46
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,310
- I want to talk with you.
- What is it?

47
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,478
- Come in.
- May I?

48
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,980
- Come on in.
- Excuse me.

49
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,773
- I wanted to chat too.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,401
- Your room looks just like mine.
- Really?

51
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,571
- We can finally talk.
- Yeah, I thought the same.

52
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,740
You went yesterday, right?
You know what I thought?

53
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,409
- Can I say it?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,161
- You went with Kensuke?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,620
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

56
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,664
I guessed you didn't switch letters.

57
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,207
I couldn't switch with anybody.

58
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,750
What are you doing today?

59
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,836
- I'm meeting Yudai.
- Oh!

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,921
What are you doing?

61
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,174
We're going parachuting.

62
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,718
- What? Really?
- Amazing, right?

63
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,303
I wanna go parachuting.

64
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,804
I'm sure it'll be fun.

65
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,264
But he might say,

66
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,809
"I thought Nanami was better
so I can't see you anymore."

67
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,978
- "Sorry."
- He won't say that.

68
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,191
- He would never say that.
- I imagined he would say that.

69
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,194
So yesterday, I was like, "Ugh…"

70
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,448
You know what I just thought?
I think you should tell him.

71
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,785
Not that you like him yet,
but that you want to spend time with him,

72
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,579
or that you don't want to go back.

73
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,874
- I think boys like it when you tell them.
- Really?

74
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,250
I think so.

75
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,919
Are you into Atsushi right now?

76
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,712
Yeah, I think so.

77
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,840
We're actually holding hands every day.

78
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,051
What? I'm so jealous.

79
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,552
You're so lucky!

80
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,096
I'm not sure what he's thinking though.

81
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,474
He hasn't exactly said anything yet.

82
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,850
But we say things like,

83
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,685
"I wanna see you again tomorrow."

84
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,270
"Yeah, me too."

85
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,064
You guys are totally in love.

86
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,650
Huh?

87
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,361
Hold on a minute. You're so annoying.

88
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,657
It's like that right now.

89
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,367
I had no idea.

90
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,369
I wanna hold hands too!

91
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,745
- But I can't.
- Huh?

92
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,080
- You should tell him.
- No.

93
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,041
"There are so many people here."

94
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,252
"Let's hold hands
so that I don't get lost."

95
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,378
You're amazing.

96
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,880
- Wow.
- She's giving a lecture.

97
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,008
- A lecture.
- She's giving example sentences.

98
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,637
No, I just can't.

99
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,599
Oh, gosh.

100
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,352
"Let's hold hands"? No way.

101
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,812
Say it. "Let's hold hands."

102
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,689
"It's cold. Let's hold hands."

103
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,860
"Do you prefer to hold hands
like this or like this?"

104
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,279
"I like it this way."

105
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,739
- She's a genius.
- A genius.

106
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,700
- A teacher.
- Such a good teacher.

107
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,034
Let's hold hands.

108
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,121
You can say it when you go parachuting.

109
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:52,333
- "I'm a bit scared. Can we hold hands?"
- Wow.

110
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,627
Then, on your way back,

111
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,716
you could go,
"Let's hold hands, la, la, la."

112
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,552
You're incredible.

113
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,761
You can do that.

114
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,851
Easy-peasy.

115
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,604
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

116
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,064

117
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,658
Oh.

Yes, okay.

121
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,100
Dear Maho,

122
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,186
Thank you for asking me out!

123
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,106
But I'm sorry. I have plans to go out
for the whole day tomorrow.

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,817
I'm really sorry!

125
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,527
From Yudai

This is amazing!

131
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,007
- Whoa!
- Oh, wow!

132
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,592
Wow.

133
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,304
We came from the beach
to a snowy mountain.

134
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,181
Wow!

135
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,933
This is amazing!

136
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,019
- It's beautiful.
- It's sunny.

137
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,396
It's great weather.

138
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,563
We're skiing here?

139
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,482
- Yes.
- We're skiing here?

140
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,443
- We need a lecture, Ms. Nanami.
- Our teacher.

141
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,820
Hold on a minute.

142
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,530
- Okay?
- Ready?

143
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,865
Do a pizza.

144
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,827
Do a pizza! The other way!

145
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,994
Get away from me!

146
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,371
The other way!

147
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,999
- Look at Nanami!
- Like this?

148
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,918
I really can't do this.

149
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,128
First time snowboarding?

150
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,212
First time ever.

151
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,089
Why would you do that?

152
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,007
I'll just disappear into the snow.

153
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,635
Wait, it's been so long. I'm scared.

154
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,803
Oh, crap!

155
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,016
- Shift your weight to the right.
- To the right?

156
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,436
Yes, that's good.

157
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,396
Wait, no.

158
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,398
Shift your weight to the left.

159
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,315
The left!

160
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,151
To the left.

161
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,236
You can do it!

162
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,280
To the left!

163
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,037
Kensuke!

164
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,415
It's a blooper.

165
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,730
I like how Sho doesn't try to show off.

166
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,856
- I agree.
- Yeah.

I'm okay!

170
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,083
- Oh, wow.
- You're doing well.

171
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,754
Woo-hoo! This is so much fun!

172
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,257
Wow!

173
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,140
Kensuke!

174
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,226
Why did he slide off to the side?

175
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,978
Guys, show us your cool moves.

176
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,231
Kensuke?

177
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,737
Sho? There he is!

178
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,364
- Hey!
- Hi.

179
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,282
- Oh, wow.
- You're skiing?

180
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,327
I couldn't get the hang of snowboarding.

181
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,079
- I'll ski.
- Let's go with skiing.

182
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,664
- Let's go.
- Yeah?

183
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,957
Where's Kensuke now?

184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,167
- I think he's going up.
- He is?

185
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,585
Let's go!

186
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,896
Kensuke is like a fawn.

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,443
- But he's doing better.
- He is. He's looking good.

188
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:30,903
Kensuke.

189
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,905
What's he doing?

190
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,740
This is suddenly a variety show.

191
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,993
- Lift your leg.
- Okay.

192
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,037
Lift your leg
and bring your right leg to this side.

193
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,039
Yeah!

194
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,382
You're doing great.

195
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,426
Yes! You're doing well!

196
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,845
- Am I?
- Yeah. You got it.

197
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,513
You're amazing!

198
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,308
- I did it! Yeah!
- You did it!

199
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,977
I didn't know skiing was so fun.

200
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,478
You got it?

201
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,813
I get it now.

202
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,024
RICE WITH TEA

203
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,191
What should I eat?

204
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,360
Wow.

205
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,321
This is…

206
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,170
Maho must be wondering what to do today.

207
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,422
- She should eat some rice first.
- Yeah.

208
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,258
Let's eat.

209
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,182
Nice.

210
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,442
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

211
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,694
- Hey. Morning.
- Good morning!

212
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,529
- Morning.
- Hey.

213
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,822
Good morning.

214
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,449
What's up?

215
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,701
- Huh?
- Did you go in?

216
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,205
Yeah, I checked my mailbox and stuff.

217
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,498
Who are on dates today?

218
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,918
Sho, Kanaka, Kensuke, and Nanami.

219
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,044
Yours is tomorrow, huh?

220
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,504
- Yeah.
- I see.

221
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,257
Wait. Aru is going tomorrow too, right?

222
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,593
- Huh?
- Aru's date is tomorrow, right?

223
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,721
I see. You want to ask Aru out?

224
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,057
- Not really?
- Hmm.

225
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,185
- I'm still kind of thinking about it.
- I see.

226
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,063
- But you can't if he has the same date.
- That's right.

227
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,356
That's the thing.

228
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,565
Oh, man.

229
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,902
I'm still thinking about it too.

230
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,655
- Really? You're thinking about it?
- Yeah.

231
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,574
I mean, I think Mimi is wonderful.

232
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,119
- She's a nice girl.
- Yeah.

233
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,707
- Huh?
- Wait, who else would he ask?

234
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,084
He went out with Nanami and Tohko too.

235
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,087
JEAN MÉDECIN STATION

236
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,800
I should have specified
the station entrance.

237
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,636
That one?

238
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,973
Which one?

239
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,691
Thank you for waiting. Good morning.

240
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,443
Morning. You didn't make me wait.

241
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,027
You're actually early.

242
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,195
But you were waiting.

243
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,697
You're right.

244
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,659
You know how we were
supposed to go parachuting today?

245
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,746
Something came up, apparently.

246
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,789
- So we can't go today.
- What?

247
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,084
But I've prepared something else.

248
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,586
- Oh!
- I've got something.

249
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,629
- What could it be?
- So…

250
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,257
Do you want to ride the tram
and go on an outing?

251
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,593
- Or we can go to the church.
- Wow.

252
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,510
Which one?

253
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,890
- The outing.
- The outing?

254
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,141
Okay.

255
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,476
In that case…

256
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,977
I think it's this way.

257
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,023
Which one was it? We'll take the tram.

258
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,443
So we can't go parachuting today, huh?

259
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,155
They were like,
"We really can't do it today."

260
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,907
I was like, "Wait, really?"

261
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,410
- She planned to hold hands there.
- Yeah.

262
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,914
Nanami was the first girl I met.

263
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,290
Right.

264
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,083
We met here.

265
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,377
- The two of us.
- It was here? I see.

266
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,671
The first person you meet

267
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,759
is kind of special to you.

268
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,719
I totally agree with that.

269
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,971
- Who was the first person you met?
- Yudai.

270
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,307
- Oh, it was Yudai?
- Yeah.

271
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,353
- To me, it feels kind of special.
- Right.

272
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:39,109
I asked her when her Wish Letter was
because she hadn't gone on her date yet.

273
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,570
She said it was Day Eight.

274
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,697
I thought, "We have the same date."

275
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,159
So that means I can't ask her out.

276
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,955
If I had the chance
to ask her out with my Wish Letter…

277
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,458
Well, I did think about inviting her.

278
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,376
I see.

279
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,212
- So I feel like this is…
- That's crazy.

280
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,881
Everything is destined by fate.

281
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,259
- I completely agree.
- Yeah.

282
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,177
Things don't go as planned.

283
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,846
That's true.

284
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,933
- Especially because we have no devices.
- Yeah.

285
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,810
We can't ask people out easily.

286
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,312
- Not in a casual way.
- Right.

287
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:20,359
With letters,
it's not easy to ask people out casually.

288
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:24,572
It makes you think about
how you should write it

289
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,365
and how to convey your thoughts.

290
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,617
It's completely different from texting.

291
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,536
"You wanna grab coffee?"

292
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,163
That's how you'd text it.

293
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:38,002
But writing "Would you like
to go have coffee with me?"

294
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,129
carries a different weight.

295
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,464
But to me,

296
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,468
I think this is a really good thing.

297
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,429
Even after I go back to Japan,

298
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,058
I would want to value the words I use.

299
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,688
GARIBALDI STATION

300
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,692
- We're here.
- Yay!

301
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,905
We need to go to the bus stop.
It's number 33.

302
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,783
Where's number 33?

303
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,118
Number 33.

304
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,870
Have you been around here?

305
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,663
I don't think so.

306
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,207
- Yudai is so reliable.
- Yes.

307
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,125
He's diligent.

308
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,044
And he's kind.

309
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,463
I love bread. I eat bread every day.

310
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,925
- You eat <i>canelé </i>and bread every day?
- Yeah. <i>Canelé </i>and bread.

311
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,676
Let's eat this at the park later.

312
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,677
I can't wait.

313
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,012
Yay.

314
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,057
- I think number 33 is there.
- Number 33?

315
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,559
I think the bus stop is around here.

316
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,810
There are people waiting.

317
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,187
BOYER BUS STOP

318
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,230
It's here.

319
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,566
The bus looks new. And it's empty.

320
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,360
- Nice.
- Everyone's getting on though.

321
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,197
JEAN MÉDECIN STATION

322
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:55,913
Hey.

323
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,125
- Hi.
- Morning.

324
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,920
- Everyone's running today.
- Yeah.

325
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,255
We saw three girls running today.

326
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,257
You look cute today.

327
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,843
- Do I?
- Yeah. These are matching.

328
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,887
Yay.

329
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,347
I made myself cute for you.

330
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,100
- I think we go down here.
- Here?

331
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,435
- Let's go.
- Yay!

332
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,689
I'm so excited.

333
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,065
I thought you wouldn't come.

334
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,900
That's my line.

335
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,652
I thought the same.

336
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,780
Phew.

337
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:32,866
Huh?

338
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,702
Now of all times?

339
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,745
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

340
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,831
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

341
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,499
- His…
- His plan!

342
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,875
The Castle Hill!

343
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,255
Dear Aru,

344
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,215
I have plans tomorrow on Day Six.

345
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,386
I'll go to the restaurant
where we first met at around 6:00 p.m.

346
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,303
From Mimi

347
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,598
Oh, man.

348
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,314
Hmm.

349
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,442
Okay.

350
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,570
Plans?

351
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,492
Sho and Kensuke.

352
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,454
Yudai and Atsushi.

353
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,706
It's definitely Atsushi.

354
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,917
Damn.

355
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,379
- Well, after all that effort…
- Yeah.

356
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,049
He did so much research the day before.

357
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,385
He was like, "I'm ordering this tomorrow."

358
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,345
- He avoided the view.
- You're right.

359
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,555
To save it for tomorrow.

360
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,184
- He should have looked at the view.
- Yeah.

361
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,519
<i>Tohko took Mimi's lesson.</i>

362
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,730
- We saw a variety of examples.
- Yes.

363
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,398
"It's cold. Let's hold hands."

364
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,901
- "I might get lost."
- Yeah.

365
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,111
"How do you like to hold hands?"

366
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,072
"Like this or this? I like it this way."

367
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,158
She said Tohko has a chance
when they go parachuting.

368
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,118
But they ended up not going.

369
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,665
- But Yudai had something else prepared.
- Yeah.

370
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,210
- How kind could he get?
- Right.

371
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,545
He's not certain yet. He's still choosing.

372
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,424
If I were him
and the parachute plan got canceled,

373
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,510
I would just have lunch somewhere.

374
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,723
You know how Mimi said to Tohko,
"Boys like it when you tell them"?

375
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,393
Do guys prefer girls to be upfront?

376
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,603
Definitely.

377
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,856
- Do you like it when girls tell you?
- You need them to tell you?

378
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,025
It's not like I need them to tell me.

379
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,820
But I think most guys

380
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,073
like girls that are interested in them.

381
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,866
- I see.
- Of course.

382
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,285
- That's why she should tell him.
- That comes first.

383
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,706
People often talk about
their types and stuff.

384
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,960
But I'm pretty sure
a girl that likes you comes at the top.

385
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,131
It's true. I fell in love with every girl
that spoke to me in college.

386
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,341
- Every girl.
- Right?

387
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,177
- I went to an all-boys school.
- I see.

388
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,054
I also went to an all-boys school.

389
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,765
So, at my entrance ceremony in college,

390
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,226
I was like, "They're so pretty!"

391
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,228
"I'm surrounded by them!"

392
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,189
Tohko should speak up then.

393
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,983
Yeah. But she kind of did.

394
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,486
<i>When she chose the outing,</i>
<i>her face said it already.</i>

395
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,404
<i>I see.</i>

396
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,156
She was being proactive.

397
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,825
- I think she'll make a move today.
- Yeah.

398
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,702
Mimi encouraged her.

399
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,203
Also, the Wish Letters.

400
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,538
The deadline's approaching.

401
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:29,459
If Nanami and Maho were to switch letters,

402
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,837
Atsushi would have
the chance to go with Nanami.

403
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,297
- Yes.
- That's right.

404
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,885
- Kensuke is cute even when he's skiing.
- Absolutely.

405
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,928
I wanna teach him how to ski.

406
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,765
- Why is falling on skis so funny?
- It's funny.

407
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,309
<i>- It's cute.</i>
<i>- They look pathetic.</i>

408
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,394
<i>They become totally helpless.</i>

409
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:52,691
I liked how Sho tried snowboarding
for the first time and gave up.

410
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,734
- Yeah.
- I know.

411
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,860
It was nice.

412
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,820
<i>He could have put on airs.</i>

413
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,530
<i>He could have just not given up.</i>

414
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,241
I think Kanaka liked that too.

415
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,746
Yeah, Kanaka would prefer
that kind of person.

416
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,039
She runs a business.

417
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,833
She likes people
who think about profit and loss.

418
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,186
- Let's eat!
- Let's eat.

419
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,854
- Let's have beer.
- Yeah.

420
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,272
- Let's have a toast.
- Yeah.

421
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,443
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

422
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,868
SHO, 22, UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND MODEL

423
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,912
This beer is a treat.

424
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,955
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

425
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,041
- We all skied pretty well.
- Yeah.

426
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,918
- I managed.
- Yeah.

427
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,379
It's thanks to you all.

428
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:59,633
- I'm glad we're all here together.
- Yeah.

429
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,718
Did you give Wish Letters to each other?

430
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,928
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

431
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,973
Nice. You get to go to different places.

432
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,307
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

433
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,434
But we can't take pictures.

434
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,352
True.

435
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,145
It's like, "Wow."

436
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,856
- And I etch it into my memory.
- Yeah.

437
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,983
What will you do now?

438
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,484
I'm going skiing.

439
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,735
- Skiing.
- Skiing?

440
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,780
The hills are separate
for intermediate and advanced skiers.

441
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,532
Right?

442
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,242
Wanna try the intermediate hill?

443
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,619
- We can try that.
- Yeah?

444
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,579
I think I'll take a rest.

445
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,999
Here? Really?

446
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,042
Enjoy!

447
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,378
- I'm off!
- Have fun.

448
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,239
- Merci.
- Merci.

449
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,744
MONT BORON BUS STOP

450
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,787
This place is full of nature.

451
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,957
I like this path.

452
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,585
Did you know
there's a vantage point up here?

453
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,919
Yeah. It's right ahead.

454
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,714
- We're almost there.
- Oh, really?

455
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,299
I think it's over there.

456
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,678
- Wow. It's beautiful.
- Oh, wow.

457
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,682
This is spectacular.

458
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,728
I think I finally know
what the word "breathtaking" means.

459
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,690
- Nice has so many beautiful places.
- Yeah.

460
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,692
Finally.

461
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,235
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

462
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:47,157
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

463
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,494
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

464
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,411
Yum.

465
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,374
This is so delicious.

466
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,168
That was an intense "delicious."

467
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,962
- Really intense.
- It's tasty.

468
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,507
- The bread in France is good.
- Yeah.

469
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,717
The crusty bread looks good.

470
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,099
I can't get any words out.

471
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,895
I have so many things I want to say.

472
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,854
Yeah.

473
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,189
You know…

474
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,957
I…

475
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,421
I want to spend time with you.

476
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,384
Do you mean…

477
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:55,058
- You mean during this trip? Or…
- Yeah.

478
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,728
The last three days?

479
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,108
I don't mean to take
all of your time to myself.

480
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,530
But I do want to see you again.

481
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,702
To be honest,

482
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,998
I think I'm being indecisive.

483
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,877
I still can't decide.

484
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,253
Okay.

485
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,590
But I enjoy spending time with you.

486
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,134
That's for sure.

487
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,221
- Okay.
- It's me.

488
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,389
I'm just…

489
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,145
- I'm not ready to make a decision.
- Of course.

490
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:45,150
I came here to find the love of my life.

491
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,612
And I found someone

492
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,198
that I want to spend time with.

493
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,157
Yeah.

494
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,576
I'm happy about that.

495
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:59,998
I thought today might be
the last time I get to see you.

496
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,918
So I wanted to say how I feel.

497
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,546
I kind of have good news for you.

498
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,256
- Yeah?
- Here.

499
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,219
On Days Seven, Eight, or Nine,

500
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,387
we can go parachuting.

501
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,639
How about Day Nine?

502
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,934
Would you like to join me?

503
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,270
- Today isn't the last day.
- Okay.

504
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,065
- Should we meet at the same place?
- Yeah.

505
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,526
The same meeting spot.
How's twelve o'clock?

506
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,612
The blue station. Same as today.

507
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,739
What do you wanna do now?

508
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,491
Do you wanna eat something?

509
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,370
- He's so kind.
- He is.

510
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,373
He's kind, but he went off-topic.

511
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,875
Right. It does seem like
he diverted the conversation.

512
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,002
He held off on giving Tohko an answer.

513
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,671
You're right.

514
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,882
- We're at Parc Phoenix.
- Yay.

515
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,009
- Are you okay with birds?
- No.

516
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,889
I don't really like birds, actually.

517
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,309
- They only have birds here.
- They have lots of birds, right?

518
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,521
They're not flying around, are they?

519
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,897
Huh? Wait.

520
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,857
Those were children's voices.

521
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,442
Oh, really?

522
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,902
- I see something.
- What? Oh!

523
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,821
Are they real?

524
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,823
They're moving!

525
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,907
Wow.

526
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,744
Wow. I've never been anywhere like this.

527
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,413
It's my first time too.

528
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,832
Were you able to reschedule your date?

529
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,125
Yeah.

530
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,627
Or more like, I changed it without asking.

531
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,005
- It was one-sided.
- I see.

532
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,551
- Thank you for shifting the time.
- Thank you too.

533
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,636
Of course. I wanted to see you.

534
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,017
Let's drink.

535
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,105
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

536
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,196
- He's drinking a whole bottle.
- Is he okay?

537
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,407
He'll still be seeing Mimi later on.

538
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,076
- The date is still on.
- You still have your date, Aru.

539
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,915
Dear Mimi,

540
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,710
I enjoyed spending time with you today.

541
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,837
Let's make tomorrow the best day!

542
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,715
- It smells like the zoo.
- Wow.

543
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,010
- We're finally seeing animals.
- Yeah.

544
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,804
- Are those kangaroos?
- Kangaroos!

545
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,264
Are they really kangaroos?

546
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,016
It looks like an old man.

547
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,643
There are animals there too.

548
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,853
- They're so cute.
- They're cute.

549
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,855
This is nice.

550
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,149
- It's bigger than I thought.
- Yeah.

551
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,277
It would have been tough if it rained.

552
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,113
- You brought the sun.
- I did.

553
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,492
- They're walking arm in arm.
- They're naturally linking arms.

554
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,826
Aru doesn't stand a chance.

555
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,829
This looks so good. Let's eat.

556
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,761
I wanna come back to this place.

557
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,097
Why am I eating alone?

558
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,435
- That was cute.
- We can tell he's a nice guy.

559
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,021
He should have begged Maho to join him.

560
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,234
- This is beautiful.
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

561
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,736
- Are they skiing?
- They're probably resting.

562
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,697
I bet they're on their second coffee.

563
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,324
Who knows?

564
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,451
Nanami might be having beer.

565
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,081
She might have left him.

566
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,877
- Let's take a rest.
- Let's rest.

567
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,755
Phew. Let's sit.

568
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,924
Oh, man.

569
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,972
You're so pretty.

570
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,889
What?

571
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,851
Oh, thank you.

572
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,769
You're pretty all the time.

573
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,188
You looked so pretty,

574
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,816
I couldn't talk at all
with the four of us.

575
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,736
- What? Really?
- I couldn't say a word.

576
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,405
This is embarrassing.

577
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,241
Nice. I got to see
a really good side of you.

578
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,744
So adorable.

579
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,122
- Everybody's speaking up now.
- They're saying how they feel.

580
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,292
What did you and Yudai talk about

581
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,962
during your bicycle trip yesterday?

582
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,425
Well, we talked about
why we joined this trip.

583
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,343
- I see.
- What else?

584
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,264
How nice the view was, and about the food.

585
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,767
- As expected.
- Yeah.

586
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,310
What did you guys talk about?

587
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,270
Well,

588
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,189
Tohko mentioned

589
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,192
she doesn't quite understand what love is.

590
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,320
She said she's unsure of what to do.

591
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,696
- I see.
- She said that.

592
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,324
I could only tell her to go for it.

593
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,408
I see.

594
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,534
For me,

595
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,204
I think I might be

596
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,790
a bit similar to Tohko.

597
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,707
Really?

598
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:59,047
I don't really know
the feeling of truly loving somebody.

599
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,091
- Even now?
- Yeah.

600
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,968
- I see.
- So…

601
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,388
I want to know that kind of feeling.

602
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,390
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah.

603
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,769
You become sensitive
to all kinds of emotions.

604
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,189
- Because we don't have anything.
- Yeah.

605
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,608
- That's all we think about.
- Yeah.

606
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,235
Like writing letters

607
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,654
and meeting people.

608
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,572
We don't have our phones,

609
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,283
so we can't casually communicate.

610
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,329
It makes me think a lot

611
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,414
about those things too.

612
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,042
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

613
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,564
Isn't the view just amazing?

614
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,191
- It's a breathtaking view.
- Yeah.

615
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,193
Could this get any better?

616
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,820
This feels so nice.

617
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,906
We improved a lot.

618
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,825
In one day.

619
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,204
That went far.

620
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,750
Not bad.

621
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,424
- Oh!
- Who won?

622
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,178
- You won by a hair.
- You're so kind.

623
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,435
We haven't been to the beach at all.

624
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,394
That's right.

625
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,564
- How about tomorrow?
- Yeah. Definitely.

626
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:45,904
Nanami asked me out for dinner tomorrow.

627
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,363
I'm free until then.

628
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,699
- Nice.
- Let's eat something together.

629
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,950
Let's do that.

630
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,076
What do you wanna eat?

631
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,870
Let's see…

632
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,706
There's this… Whoa.

633
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:01,044
- Sorry.
- There's this place by the beach.

634
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,253
- Really?
- I found it.

635
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,839
These two always talk about the next day.

636
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,591
- True.
- It happens naturally.

637
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,801
What are you doing tomorrow?

638
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,929
Tomorrow? Nothing.

639
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:11,846
No?

640
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,598
Do you wanna eat ramen for lunch?

641
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,975
- Ramen for lunch?
- Yeah?

642
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,479
We'll meet at around one o'clock.

643
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,522
- Let's go eat ramen. Yeah!
- Ramen!

644
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,440
Yay!

645
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,777
Have you done laundry here?

646
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,986
No.

647
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,905
Do you wanna go to a laundromat?

648
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,449
- I was going to ask you too.
- Really?

649
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,743
But I wasn't sure

650
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,913
about asking a girl out to a laundromat.

651
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,331
- I don't mind.
- Really?

652
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,833
Yeah. I'm okay with it.

653
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,588
I'll do whatever
just to spend time with you.

654
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,259
You can do whatever you like.

655
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,806
Thank you.

656
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,059
That was cute.

657
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,145
Everyone's falling in love.

658
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,441
Everybody's speaking up.

659
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,404
I think having
their digital devices taken away

660
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,322
is starting to have an effect.

661
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,741
They're starting

662
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,452
to pay attention to their intuition

663
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,871
and reflecting on themselves.

664
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,164
They say things clearly.

665
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,710
If you have a smartphone,
you think you can say it anytime.

666
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,546
If he had his smartphone,

667
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,632
Aru wouldn't be eating alone
at a restaurant.

668
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,050
Probably not.

669
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,969
Is Aru the only one affected negatively?

670
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,595
But in a way,

671
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,141
<i>that was one way to face his situation.</i>

672
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,811
After all, they can only manifest
their emotions through their actions.

673
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,854
That's right.

674
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,607
<i>- Tohko was very honest with Yudai.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

675
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,611
Mimi probably meant for her to be
more discreet when she gave her advice.

676
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,739
But Tohko made it very clear.

677
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,490
"I want to spend time with you."

678
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,327
There's the question
of what Yudai intends to do.

679
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,247
Even our panel of experts
is divided on this.

680
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,374
You mean here? Are we the panel?

681
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,627
The panel of experts
is struggling for an answer.

682
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,131
It does seem like
he held off on his answer.

683
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,133
- Right?
- To give Tohko an answer.

684
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:16,763
He probably knew which days
the parachuting was available.

685
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,849
- But he said it at that timing.
- Exactly.

686
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,185
- He specified Day Nine.
- Right.

687
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:26,397
It's after Days Seven and Eight,
where he could receive Wish Letters.

688
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,859
It seems like he did the math perfectly.

689
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,862
- Yudai knows Tohko definitely likes him.
- Yes.

690
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:37,533
So what Yudai needs to confirm
is not his feelings towards Tohko,

691
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,036
but the others' feelings towards him,

692
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,539
and his feelings towards the other girls.

693
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,374
He'll see on Days Seven and Eight.

694
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,045
Even if that goes awry,
he can face Tohko on Day Nine.

695
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,172
How will he face her feelings?

696
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,132
- That's what it all hinges on.
- Yeah.

697
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,010
- Kensuke told Nanami she was pretty.
- That was adorable.

698
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,263
Kensuke said it clearly,
and Nanami asked him out for ramen.

699
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,390
<i>- And to the laundromat.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

700
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,352
He'll do whatever
just to spend time with Nanami.

701
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,561
Oh my gosh!

702
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,815
It's suddenly like
they're really attracted to each other.

703
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,150
Maybe this is the "Tohko effect."

704
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,820
When Tohko starts moving,
everything changes.

705
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,404
You mean the butterfly effect?

706
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,448
The Tohko version of the butterfly effect?

707
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,449
The Tohko effect?

708
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,327
Maybe research was done at a university.

709
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,205
It's just like what Kyoko was saying.

710
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,166
Everyone's emotions burst
on the sixth day without smartphones.

711
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,669
- Maybe that's just how it is.
- Yeah, maybe.

712
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,558
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

713
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,394
Aru is probably going to
ask you to join him tomorrow.

714
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,646
Will he?

715
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,107
- You're seeing him later, right?
- Yeah.

716
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,234
I have a feeling he will.

717
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,863
Why does he sound so confident?

718
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,739
- Did you hear him?
- What was that?

719
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,533
What will you do if he asks me?

720
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,326
It is what it is.

721
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,289
You have to go even if I ask you not to.

722
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,291
That's right.

723
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:14,046
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

724
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,344
Last one.

725
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,935
Those with Day Seven Wish Letters
will hand theirs tonight.

726
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,645
- That's Aru and Maho.
- Yeah.

727
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,647
You're handing yours tomorrow, right?

728
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,191
Yeah. I need to do it tomorrow.

729
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,483
Who do you have in mind?

730
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,404
Who should I hand it to?

731
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,322
Huh?

732
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,865
Who could it be?

733
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,576
- Well…
- You want some salad?

734
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,161
- I'll take a bite.
- Yeah.

735
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,626
What will you do?

736
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,710
On Day Eight?

737
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,712
I was wondering what you're gonna do.

738
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,507
I mean, we might not
see each other tomorrow.

739
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,260
- Huh?
- If Aru asks me out.

740
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,597
I feel sorry for Aru.

741
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,810
We would probably meet
if I seriously wanted to invite you.

742
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,438
You're going somewhere tonight, right?

743
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,649
I think so.

744
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,568
Like, a place with a view?
Somewhere high up?

745
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,613
We've been saying, "Let's go to Jumanji."

746
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,157
But the weather wasn't good,
or it was too late.

747
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,661
- We're going there.
- The weather's nice today.

748
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,287
We'd better go.

749
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,625
I'll miss you.

750
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,141
I need to push, not pull.

751
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,894
He's drunk. He pulled instead of push.

752
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,731
- He's drunk.
- You talk to yourself when you're drunk.

753
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,858
Can I help you?

754
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,405
I'm looking for stickers.

755
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,950
- How about this?
- Oh.

756
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,161
What kind of stickers?

757
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:14,625
Sort of like Nice, or like France?

758
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,918
No, I'm sorry.

759
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,422
- It's not like that.
- That's okay.

760
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,759
But I like this.

761
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,844
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

762
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,107
You're doing really well!

763
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,610
I'm sad this is coming to an end, Sho!

764
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,820
Yeah!

765
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,993
- You're actually skiing!
- I am!

766
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,661
- Yeah.
- Kind of.

767
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,247
You're doing well.

768
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,541
- Shift your weight to the left.
- To the left.

769
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,509
Ow!

770
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,640
Oof.

771
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,602
Wait, no.

772
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,356
- Oh, no.
- Stop.

773
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:35,206
- I'll help you.
- Thanks. But wait.

774
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,127
I'm sorry.

775
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:41,962
Sorry.

776
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,672
Are your legs okay?

777
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:49,553
Wait. I can't. Oh, no.

778
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,102
It's like an old-school romantic comedy.

779
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,853
They're showing us what we want.

780
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,188
They're laughing so hard.

781
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,774
This was so much fun.

782
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,705
He's going crazy.

783
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,207
He's too tired.

784
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,542
No, stop!

785
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,627
You're going the wrong way!

786
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,588
Let's go. We'll leave him here.

787
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,676
Come on. This way.

788
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,678
I'm super satisfied.

789
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,889
- I had so much fun.
- This was fun.

790
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,891
- Do we go this way?
- Yeah.

791
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,894
- Hey, no!
- Not that way.

792
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,105
Hey! You'll get tired.

793
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,108
Come on. Let's go.

794
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,945
Run!

795
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,822
Run for your life!

796
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,745
- What was that?
- What's going on?

797
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,414
This isn't that kind of show!

798
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,541
Oh, what fun.

799
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,085
We'll have our meal

800
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,088
at that place, where the doorman is.

801
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,715
- Wow.
- A doorman!

802
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,758
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

803
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,552
Wow.

804
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,138
- Merci.
- Welcome.

805
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,224
- Wow.
- Wow!

806
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,020
Wow, this is amazing.

807
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,691
Oh, wow.

808
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,693
Oh, my.

809
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,196
- This is incredible.
- Yeah.

810
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,200
This is amazing. I'm astonished.

811
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,785
Look at that bird.

812
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,663
Wow.

813
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,832
We're at the same height.

814
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,084
- They're flying at this height.
- Yeah.

815
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,504
The seagull's POV.

816
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,547
The seagull's POV?

817
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,354
- He's doing a little dance!
- He's dancing!

818
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,773
- We know he's a dancer.
- He's dancing.

819
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,325
I might drop something.

820
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,078
- Hi!
- Hey.

821
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,288
It feels like a long time
since we last met.

822
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,207
- It does.
- Yeah.

823
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,917
Thanks for waiting.

824
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,461
All right.

825
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,129
- I reserved a restaurant.
- Oh!

826
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,382
- Yeah. Let's go there.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

827
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,801
- No problem.
- Sorry.

828
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,302
Thanks for waiting.

829
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,845
- Ready?
- Yeah!

830
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,264
Let's go. Are you hungry?

831
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,224
- I'm starving!
- Really?

832
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,768
We're worried if <i>you're </i>hungry, Aru.

833
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,396
- We're worried about Aru.
- He ate a whole fish.

834
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,023
When we walked down this road,

835
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,692
you mumbled something.

836
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,695
- I mumbled something?
- You did.

837
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:56,031
- Really?
- We stopped at the red light here.

838
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:02,079
You looked to the right and said
you wanted to go to this restaurant.

839
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,081
- Do you remember?
- I do!

840
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,166
- I reserved us a seat.
- Nice!

841
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,169
Really? Awesome.

842
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,921
This way.

843
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,300
- This is our seat.
- Really?

844
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,887
- Where should I sit?
- Here.

845
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,055
- Here?
- Yeah.

846
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,558
- Oh, wow!
- Isn't this incredible?

847
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,060
Oh, gosh! This is the best!

848
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,271
The view is amazing.

849
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:31,942
They told me
that at around half past five,

850
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,903
the sun sets right there.

851
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,906
The view is the best at that time.

852
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:43,037
That's why I set
our meeting time at around that time.

853
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,372
He's giving away his recon.

854
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,458
She'll find out if he says it like that.

855
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,336
I don't know
if the staff will attend to us.

856
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,713
Should we order something?

857
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,340
Oh, wait a second.

858
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,424
Something to eat.

859
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,428
- The menu, right?
- Yeah.

860
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,180
Actually…

861
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,476
- I was here yesterday.
- Yeah?

862
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,229
- I wrote down what's on the menu.
- You're kidding!

863
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,190
Why would he say that?

864
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,941
Why'd he say that now?

865
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,026
He said it.

866
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,695
You should get the gist
by looking at this.

867
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,032
Really? You came in advance for me?

868
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,494
That's why I didn't see you yesterday.

869
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:28,332
- I didn't want to meet anybody yesterday.
- Oh, really?

870
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,877
If I met someone
and received a Wish Letter,

871
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,339
I thought I wouldn't be able
to see you today.

872
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:41,095
So, I decided I would act alone
and spend the day doing recon.

873
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,681
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

874
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,726
- Merci.
- Merci.

875
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,312
- Wow.
- I see! Because he would have to go.

876
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,939
So endearing.

877
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,441
Not that he would have
received one from anybody.

878
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,904
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

879
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,907
The ocean's beautiful.

880
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,910
- Or the outside. The view, I guess?
- It's beautiful.

881
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,245
Yeah.

882
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,499
- It's just like your name, Mimi.
- Oh, right!

883
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,043
- Huh?
- You know what?

884
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,338
I wanted to drink wine
while looking at the sea.

885
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,381
Oh, wait!

886
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,174
We need a baguette.

887
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,551
Do they have baguettes here?

888
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,928
Don't worry.

889
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,847
- They do.
- They do?

890
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,348
I have it all checked out.

891
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,434
Nice!

892
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,602
I can check this off my list.

893
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,023
- This one is really tasty.
- Wow!

894
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,066
Let's eat.

895
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,571
- Yum.
- Good?

896
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,489
Good?

897
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:43,907
And…

898
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,951
- We have the bread.
- The bread.

899
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,286
It's so crusty!

900
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,421
Is it that hard?

901
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,548
It is, isn't it?

902
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,843
It's nice.

903
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,678
- Nice?
- Yeah.

904
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,013
I'll eat too.

905
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,599
- I'm so happy.
- Yeah.

906
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,437
This is a local, small, square pizza.

907
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,105
It's a pissaladière.

908
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,106
Oh!

909
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,484
I ate this yesterday.

910
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,360
- Is it similar?
- Pissaladière.

911
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,904
- Pissaladière.
- Pissaladière.

912
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,072
And this is mushroom and potato.

913
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,199
Mashed potato?

914
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,993
- Egg and truffle.
- Egg? Truffle?

915
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,538
This looks delicious.

916
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,379
Huh? What is this?

917
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,298
What is it?

918
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,883
Is it olive?

919
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,676
- It's really tasty.
- Yeah?

920
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,304
- This is octopus carpaccio.
- Yeah.

921
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,972
Yum.

922
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,850
This is delicious.

923
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,020
- What is it?
- Huh?

924
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,731
Nothing. It's just…

925
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,483
You missed me?

926
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,194
Yeah, I missed you.

927
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,322
And you know,

928
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:09,326
the first people I met
were you, Sho, and Tohko.

929
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,036
- Yeah.
- Right?

930
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,332
- I've had feelings for you since then.
- What?

931
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,334
- Really?
- Yeah.

932
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,130
Wait. Well, that changes things.

933
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,175
You're the only one for me.

934
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,637
I won't be asking anybody out on dates.

935
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,097
You won't ask anybody out?

936
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,015
- No.
- Not even me?

937
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,562
I might ask you out.

938
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,482
You're not going to ask me out either?

939
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,692
If possible,

940
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:45,487
I want to continue seeing you
without writing letters.

941
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,698
That way, I can ask you out in person.

942
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,074
I see.

943
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,701
- That's what I was thinking.
- Okay.

944
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,995
That's how it was? I had no idea.

945
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,872
But I'm glad you told me.

946
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,999
I'm glad to know that.

947
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,834
- Really?
- I'm happy.

948
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,296
Good.

949
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:03,881
Oh, no.

950
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,633
I was too nervous to eat anything.

951
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,885
You should eat.

952
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:12,556
I haven't been in many relationships.

953
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,349
What? Really?

954
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,228
- I've only dated a few people.
- You must be popular with girls.

955
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,773
I'm nervous about making a move.

956
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,859
And we don't have our phones.

957
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,237
If we need to reschedule,
we can't really go another day.

958
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,867
I would have to act
according to the last letter you sent me.

959
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,454
You might not read it
even if I wrote back to you.

960
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,581
Thinking about that,

961
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:42,628
I was just nervously waiting
for you to appear.

962
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,755
At this age,

963
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,508
I felt nervous like a teenager.

964
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,510
Yeah.

965
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,262
That's how it was.

966
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,599
That's why I'm really nervous.

967
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,559
- You're nervous?
- Yeah.

968
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,774
- This was something.
- Wow.

969
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,442
"You missed me?"

970
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,320
- She said that so naturally.
- Yes, naturally.

971
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,739
Aru was very drunk.

972
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,824
He was drunk, so he spilled everything.

973
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,493
"I reconned this place."

974
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,287
- No, no.
- He said, "recon."

975
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,414
<i>- That was bad.</i>
<i>- He actually said the word.</i>

976
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,499
<i>He did.</i>

977
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,043
"Baguette? Yeah, they have baguettes."

978
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,255
Mimi would have wanted to
enjoy things together too.

979
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:33,053
If I were told that, I might feel
the pressure of having to act really happy

980
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,013
when they bring it to the table.

981
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,473
"They have it."

982
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:37,849
He said everything.

983
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,311
It's probably because they're so focused

984
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:45,440
and bursting with emotions
without their electronic devices.

985
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,150
So now,

986
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,362
Atsushi still has his Wish Letter.

987
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,240
What if he passes it
to somebody other than Mimi?

988
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:57,494
- Mimi's feelings might change.
- Yeah.

989
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,788
- Because Atsushi is too complacent.
- Right.

990
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:03,125
- Atsushi was confident.
- It's like <i>The Tortoise and the Hare.</i>

991
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,793
<i>He was super confident.</i>

992
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,129
<i>He seemed overconfident.</i>

993
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,673
"You're going with Aru tomorrow, right?"

994
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,049
"It is what it is."

995
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,884
"Like, a place with a view?"

996
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,053
<i>He suddenly made fun of the view.</i>

997
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,723
<i>He dissed the magnificent scenery.</i>

998
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,808
Nanami and Kensuke look good together.

999
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,977
- They do.
- They're so adorable.

1000
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,146
They are. I liked the four of them.

1001
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,814
- They were cute.
- A good group.

1002
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,651
When Sho was with Kanaka,

1003
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,195
he was trying hard to act a bit grown-up.

1004
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,199
<i>But with Kensuke, he was able</i>
<i>to show his childish side.</i>

1005
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,242
<i>Throwing snowballs.</i>

1006
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:41,246
I have a feeling
Kanaka would find that endearing.

1007
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,624
- She would.
- I feel like it's working positively.

1008
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,418
<i>Nanami and Kensuke fell down together.</i>

1009
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,211
<i>- That was cute.</i>
<i>- They toppled over.</i>

1010
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,423
The hurdles have been lowered in many ways

1011
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,133
because they don't have devices.

1012
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,595
Just watching them collapse
on each other made me feel very excited.

1013
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,972
- Oh, yeah.
- I completely agree.

1014
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,395
HOTEL NICE RIVIERA

1015
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,613
MAHO, 30, MODEL

1016
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,331
Hey.

1017
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,208
Hi.

1018
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,751
Waiting for someone?

1019
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,506
- Huh? Are you waiting for someone?
- What?

1020
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,841
Yeah. I am.

1021
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,968
Okay. See you.

1022
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,436
So, who is Maho waiting for?

1023
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,775
- You don't have a girlfriend now, right?
- That's right.

1024
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:55,695
- It's been about two and a half years.
- Two years?

1025
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,280
Two and a half years.

1026
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,950
Is that long? I guess it is.

1027
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,077
People say it's long.

1028
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,912
They're surprised when I tell them.

1029
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,871
I see.

1030
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,998
It's 24 years for me.

1031
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

1032
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,337
- A lot happened.
- Okay.

1033
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,798
I find it difficult to trust men.

1034
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,716
- I see.
- It's like that.

1035
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,806
I don't talk to them
or have any male friends.

1036
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,393
Even in college,
I couldn't look them in the eyes.

1037
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,645
It's the same for everybody.

1038
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,772
- I was like that too.
- Really?

1039
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,607
When I came to Tokyo,

1040
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,068
I experienced my first kiss on the job.

1041
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,237
Everything was through my job.

1042
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,864
I see.

1043
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,908
- It's like pseudo love.
- I see.

1044
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,203
I think it's different
from having your emotions stirred.

1045
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,246
Yeah.

1046
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,415
But you're talking properly.

1047
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,500
- Now I am.
- Yeah.

1048
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,003
Since time is limited.

1049
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,754
That's true.

1050
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,965
You know what?

1051
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,135
- I go by the name Tohko Asai.
- Tohko Asai?

1052
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,970
- But…
- Yeah?

1053
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:05,348
My real name is Riko.

1054
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,308
Oh!

1055
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:10,187
- You got a stage name for your job?
- Yeah.

1056
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,272
- What's this?
- There are people like that.

1057
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,900
She's giving away her name.
It's like <i>Spirited Away.</i>

1058
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,985
I'm told I look like a Riko.

1059
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,236
It fits you perfectly.

1060
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,487
- Right?
- Yeah.

1061
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,203
Delicious, isn't it?

1062
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,164
It is.

1063
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,336
- Ta-da!
- What is it?

1064
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,796
- Since you decorate your guidebook…
- Yeah.

1065
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,133
- Can I take a look?
- Yeah.

1066
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,927
MIMI, 20, PART-TIME WORKER

1067
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,639
- What is it?
- I chose French-ish stickers.

1068
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,140
Wow. Thank you!

1069
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:51,895
- You can make your guidebook fancier.
- You always give me presents.

1070
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,063
Well…

1071
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,315
I mean…

1072
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,734
It's nothing much.

1073
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,152
I really appreciate it.

1074
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,239
You always give me gifts.

1075
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,406
You're so kind.

1076
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,159
No, "kind" isn't the right word.

1077
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,911
You're romantic.

1078
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,456
After we finish our meal,

1079
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,334
can we take a walk?

1080
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,252
Of course.

1081
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,601
- Hi.
- Hey.

1082
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,603
- It's you, Atsushi.
- Hey.

1083
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,480
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

1084
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,192
- I wanted to chat with you.
- Sure.

1085
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:43,488
- So, you've switched over to Kanaka?
- Well, yeah.

1086
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,157
Kanaka is the only one for me.

1087
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,201
- It's like that?
- Yeah.

1088
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,494
Don't say "switch over."

1089
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,538
He's here to check.

1090
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,581
- Sho liked Mimi at first.
- Right.

1091
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,709
You seem so confident.

1092
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,837
- I'm not confident at all.
- Really?

1093
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,464
I'm constantly thinking about
how to make her fall for me.

1094
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,010
- I can't sleep.
- But you've got good vibes, right?

1095
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,178
I think we've got good vibes.

1096
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,098
But I haven't held hands
with her like you have.

1097
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,892
I haven't done any of that stuff.

1098
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,228
I still feel some distance between us.

1099
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,314
- You haven't hugged her?
- No hugging.

1100
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,816
I don't know her true feelings.

1101
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:20,942
I see.

1102
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:25,030
I haven't really asked her though.
I don't really want to ask.

1103
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,033
I haven't asked her, but I am curious.

1104
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,328
You don't have to ask her,
but maybe you should tell her.

1105
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,746
Tell her your feelings.

1106
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,332
- Maybe I'll do that tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1107
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,793
Since we're in Nice,
can we sit on the blue chairs?

1108
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,711
Of course!

1109
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,421
It's the sea.

1110
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,882
- The ocean!
- Let's sit.

1111
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,508
- Here?
- Yeah.

1112
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,426
Can I sit?

1113
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,095
- Phew.
- Phew.

1114
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,973
- Wow.
- I've been wanting to do this.

1115
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,850
But it's pitch dark.

1116
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,185
It's dark, but it's nice.

1117
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:58,563
It's like the sea
and the sky are connected.

1118
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,482
So it looks like it's all the ocean.

1119
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,401
It feels so good.

1120
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,402
Nice.

1121
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,989
Did you go up there already?

1122
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,658
- That one.
- Jumanji? Not yet.

1123
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,161
They light it up like that.

1124
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,746
But it closes at 6:00 p.m.

1125
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,206
So yesterday,

1126
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,084
because I wanted to bring you there,

1127
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:23,838
I checked where Jumanji is,
and how we would get there.

1128
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,048
Wow!

1129
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,716
Yeah.

1130
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,387
The entrance actually isn't on this map.

1131
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,890
- What?
- That's why I had to go check myself.

1132
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,060
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't want you to apologize.

1133
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,270
I'm so sorry we couldn't go there.

1134
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,980
What I want to say is,

1135
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,318
the view of Nice
from up there is spectacular.

1136
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:51,616
I'm hoping we can go there
on one of our remaining days.

1137
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,742
I wanna go too.

1138
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,495
- We need to go parachuting too.
- Yeah.

1139
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,249
The view from up there is incredible,
so I wanna take you there.

1140
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,458
- Yeah.
- That, and…

1141
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,545
Huh? What is it?

1142
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,923
I'd like to spend the day
with you tomorrow.

1143
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,468
Will you join me?

1144
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,512
Of course.

1145
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:14,764
For you.

1146
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,558
Thank you.

1147
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,435
- Can I look?
- Sure.

1148
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,943
We meet at Nice-Ville station.

1149
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,155
- Oh! Can I read this too?
- Sure.

1150
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:34,826
I ENJOYED SPENDING TIME WITH YOU TODAY.
LET'S MAKE TOMORROW THE BEST DAY!

1151
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,161
Thank you!

1152
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,247
Is there anything I should know?
How should I dress?

1153
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,207
- We might walk a lot.
- Walk a lot?

1154
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,334
We'll leave France on foot.

1155
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,336
What? We'll leave France?

1156
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,172
What? I don't get it.

1157
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,716
You'll be fine
if you're not in high heels.

1158
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,843
No high heels? Okay.

1159
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,344
I'm looking forward to this.

1160
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,054
I'm excited too.

1161
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,764
Tomorrow?

1162
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,267
I think Aru is…

1163
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,895
- Oh!
- He has the Wish Letter.

1164
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,397
He passed it to Mimi, then?

1165
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,774
- I think he passed it to her.
- Oh.

1166
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,945
I met Maho at Margaux this morning.

1167
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,865
You got the Wish Letter from her?

1168
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,492
- No.
- Huh?

1169
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,702
Then who got it?

1170
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:22,957
- Maho was waiting downstairs just now.
- What?

1171
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,543
So, what will you do tomorrow?

1172
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,797
- You like Mimi.
- Yeah.

1173
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,466
Will you meet anybody else?

1174
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,551
That's the thing.

1175
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,596
I'm still thinking.

1176
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,181
Thank you.

1177
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,099
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1178
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,601
Thanks.

1179
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,270
See you tomorrow.

1180
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,314
- It's in a few hours.
- Okay.

1181
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,607
- Bye.
- Good night.

1182
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,817
Good night!

1183
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,123
Hey.

1184
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,667
- Huh?
- What?

1185
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,627
- Hi.
- Hi.

1186
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,380
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

1187
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,299
- Are you here to see me?
- No.

1188
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,176
No, right? Oh, okay. You startled me.

1189
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,973
He's just too cute.

1190
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,809
I like how Maho reacts.

1191
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,435
- I'd better go, right?
- Yeah.

1192
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,353
Sorry.

1193
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,814
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1194
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,982
Good night.

1195
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,151
- That was delicious.
- Yeah.

1196
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,194
What should we do?

1197
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,238
Do you wanna go to Place Masséna?

1198
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,573
Sure.

1199
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,540
The fresh air will sober us up.

1200
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,125
I'm not drunk.

1201
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,627
It's cold.

1202
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,715
- I'm cold.
- It gets chilly at night.

1203
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,261
- So today…
- Yeah?

1204
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,856
- So today…
- Yeah?

1205
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,942
I had a goal in mind.

1206
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,986
What was it?

1207
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,253
I want to hold hands.

1208
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:35,840
Here.

1209
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,553
Oh, wow.

1210
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,687
Thank you.

1211
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,189
No problem.

1212
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:21,678
Take a seat.

1213
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:23,846
Thank you.

1214
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,606
- So today…
- Yeah?

1215
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:43,616
- I was able to tell you my feelings.
- Yeah.

1216
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,493
But I want you

1217
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,497
to find your true love.

1218
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,958
- Yeah.
- So…

1219
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,626
But

1220
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,547
I want you to keep me in mind as well.

1221
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,632
Yeah.

1222
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,259
Okay.

1223
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,222
Can we…

1224
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,100
Never mind.

1225
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,562
Hmm?

1226
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,566
Can we hold hands again?

1227
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,955
Thank you.

1228
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,665
No problem.

1229
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,920
I had fun.

1230
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,298
We still have parachuting.

1231
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,259
Yeah.

1232
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,809
- Wow, that was nice!
- Oh, wow.

1233
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,604
- Tohko tried so hard.
- She said things clearly.

1234
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:58,274
We thought she would use
the tactics she learned from Mimi.

1235
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,485
But she said, "I had a goal in mind."

1236
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,069
She went her own way.

1237
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,029
She was original.

1238
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:07,116
I would be scared
if a girl said, "I had a goal in mind."

1239
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,577
It would make
the guy nervous, wouldn't it?

1240
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,995
Of course.

1241
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,623
<i>If I were Yudai, I would think,</i>

1242
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,750
<i>"Do I need to give her an answer today?"</i>

1243
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,877
He used parachuting
as an escape a few times.

1244
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:21,672
- Don't call it an escape.
- It's like, "Do I have to say it now?"

1245
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,758
I definitely can't wait that long.

1246
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,843
- I think Yudai is amazing.
- Yeah.

1247
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,179
I'd say things like,
"Do you wanna hold hands?"

1248
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,808
I don't think I could stand it.
I would start blabbering.

1249
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:32,725
I know!

1250
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,019
"Look! Isn't that beautiful?"

1251
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,105
- "That looks tasty."
- "I wanna go there."

1252
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:42,944
Tohko mentioned during dinner
that her real name is Riko.

1253
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,863
<i>Does she want him to call her Riko?</i>

1254
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,032
I took it as her
disclosing a secret to him.

1255
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,326
- Maybe.
- She's not asking him to call her Riko?

1256
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,996
That might be part of it,
but she doesn't expect it for now.

1257
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,250
Maybe she wanted to feel closer to him.

1258
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,629
- She would feel closer to him.
- Yeah.

1259
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,881
For me, it was Mimi.

1260
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,842
When she got the gift from Aru,

1261
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:10,096
<i>she complimented him</i>
<i>by calling him a kind person.</i>

1262
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,557
- Then, she rephrased it to "romantic."
- Yeah.

1263
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,226
- I thought that was a great expression.
- I agree.

1264
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,770
The way Mimi uses her words

1265
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,605
is very advanced.

1266
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,523
True.

1267
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:25,236
<i>- Aru revealed everything he reconned.</i>
<i>- Forget about him.</i>

1268
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,863
"We go down from here."

1269
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,698
Don't show her now.

1270
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,742
- But I think it worked for Mimi.
- Yeah.

1271
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,494
- He got his feelings through.
- Yeah.

1272
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,873
- He showed her how much he likes her.
- Yeah.

1273
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,416
Who knows what could happen?

1274
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,670
Mimi seems like the type
to fall for someone who's devoted to her.

1275
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,255
It's like what we were saying.

1276
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,884
Something could happen
while Atsushi is acting complacent.

1277
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,135
There is a possibility.

1278
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:54,640
Mimi might fall for his awkward
but sincere nature.

1279
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,850
Yeah.

1280
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,330
Dear Nanami,

1281
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,374
I want to see you again.

1282
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,753
- Nanami?
- Oh!

1283
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,173
- So it's her?
- That's how it is?

1284
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,174
Dear Nanami,

1285
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,803
Please come to Garibaldi Square
at 5:00 p.m. on Day Seven or Day Eight.

1286
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,806
I want to see you again.

1287
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,293
- Hi, Yudai.
- Oh?

1288
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,337
- Hi.
- Hi.

1289
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,048
I'm sorry about today. I had plans.

1290
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,675
Not at all. It's fine.

1291
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,677
- Aren't you cold?
- I'm okay.

1292
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,929
- It's suddenly chilly.
- Yeah.

1293
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,889
Are you cold? You look lightly dressed.

1294
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,557
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1295
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,018
- Are you sure?
- I'm bundled up.

1296
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:21,936
So…

1297
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,189
I want you to join me tomorrow.

1298
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,526
What? Sure.

1299
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,111
- Will you?
- Yes.

1300
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,281
It's late already.

1301
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,451
- I'm sorry I was late.
- Oh, no.

1302
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:41,205
You must be tired. Rest well.

1303
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,624
I will. Thank you.

1304
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,501
- See you.
- See you.

1305
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,294
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

1306
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,463
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

1307
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,961
