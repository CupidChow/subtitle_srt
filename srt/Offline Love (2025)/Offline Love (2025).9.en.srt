1
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,897
Boo!

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,650
- Morning.
- Hey. Morning.

3
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,818
You're not sleepy?

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,361
Okay?

5
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,405
It's cloudy though.

6
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,282
- Look. The sun's out.
- Whoa!

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,283
It's out already.

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,493
- And there are fewer clouds there.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,912
It's our last morning.

10
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:38,830
Yeah. Huh?

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,582
That we can spend together.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,960
If we can't spend Day Ten together.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
Right.

14
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,838
- Time flies.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,717
- It's not easy to meet every day.
- No.

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,886
We'll go back on that.

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,264
- On that.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,736
Wow.

19
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,654
Rice burgers?

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,115
- What is he going to do today?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,577
Will he wander around the city
and let fate decide for him?

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,913
What will he do about lunch with Maho?

23
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:29,798
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

24
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,007
Okay.

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,717
He got a letter.

26
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,219
Huh? Another letter?

27
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,226
Chicken steak, pork cutlet,
croquette, and shrimp tempura?

28
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,977
DAY NINE, RICE BURGERS

29
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,229
Let's see.

30
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,442
The croquette.

31
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,653
Let's eat.

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:04,541
DAY NINE, 7:00 P.M.
PLEASE COME TO MAISON MARGAUX

33
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,460
<i>- They're gathering.</i>
<i>- What, tonight?</i>

34
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,795
<i>It's tonight.</i>

35
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,013
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

36
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,186
Did you read it?

37
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,771
I did.

38
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,400
DAY NINE, 7:00 P.M.

39
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,444
Wait. Do we have the same time?

40
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,197
- It's the same.
- Is it?

41
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,866
- That's good to know.
- Good.

42
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,159
What are you doing today?

43
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,162
I'm going to look for Nanami.

44
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,497
I see.

45
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,092
Whoa!

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,971
Good morning. Hey, wait!

47
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,390
- You startled me.
- Morning.

48
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,433
Morning.

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,560
That was adorable!

50
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,353
These two are so cute.

51
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,648
- The people of Nice must be all smiles.
- All smiles.

52
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,816
No doubt.

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,067
You came from that way?

54
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,028
- Why?
- I went around.

55
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:15,945
Oh, my.

56
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,989
You're pretty as always.

57
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,038
Huh?

58
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,539
Here.

59
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,340
What are your plans for today, Aru?

60
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,844
If you're going to go search for Nanami,

61
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:44,140
I'd want to meet Maho.

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,311
By the way, you haven't declined
her lunch yet, have you?

63
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,812
I'll go see her later today.

64
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,940
- You'll see her?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,483
I'll tell her directly.

66
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,485
I see. Where will you meet her?

67
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,820
We're meeting at 12:00 p.m.
at Place Masséna.

68
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,406
She wrote that on the letter.

69
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,449
Okay.

70
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,701
I see.

71
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,203
Good to know.

72
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,914
Is he going to ambush Maho somewhere?

73
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,666
Is that what he plans on doing?

74
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,421
SHO, 22, UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND MODEL

75
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,508
- Good morning.
- Morning. What are these?

76
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,969
The olive oil drink with oat milk.

77
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,012
Wow! May I have one?

78
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,931
I have an iced one and a hot one.

79
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,266
- The hot one.
- Hot?

80
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,725
Thanks.

81
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,644
I wanna try the bun.

82
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,771
Bun?

83
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,314
One, please.

84
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,232
To go?

85
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,525
Yes. To go.

86
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,361
And this, please.

87
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,530
This one. Yes, please.

88
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,531
Merci.

89
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,825
- She's all grown up.
- Yes, she is.

90
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,410
I totally agree.

91
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,161
Two cappuccinos.

92
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,413
- Two cappuccinos?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,334
- Merci.
- You're welcome.

94
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,014
MAHO, 30, MODEL

95
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,017
Hi, Yudai.

96
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,103
- Good morning.
- Morning.

97
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,896
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,733
That looks good on you.

99
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,570
- It's not the same one.
- It's different? I see.

100
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,407
- So, there's something I need to tell you.
- It's a biker jacket.

101
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,908
It suits you.

102
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,618
- Um…
- Isn't it cold?

103
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,037
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,247
- It's just right.
- You're joking.

105
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,083
She doesn't wanna hear it,
and he wants to say it.

106
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,336
She doesn't wanna hear it. Oh, man!

107
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,837
- So…
- Yeah?

108
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,300
Today…

109
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,804
I really want to meet someone
and tell her my feelings.

110
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,014
Okay.

111
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
So…

112
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,729
I can't go on a date with you today.

113
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,691
Okay.

114
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,362
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

115
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,031
Okay.

116
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:10,703
Did you take your time
to come here just to tell me that?

117
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,624
I didn't think I should
say this to you through a letter.

118
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,250
I see.

119
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,586
Thank you for coming.

120
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,754
Not at all.

121
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,381
- I'm really sorry.
- It's fine.

122
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,302
I'll go find her.

123
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,220
Okay.

124
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,161
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- It's Aru!</i>

125
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,664
<i>We haven't seen</i>
<i>this encounter system in a while.</i>

126
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>It's happening!</i>

127
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,109
What? Hey!

128
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,068
Look properly!

129
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,820
- What?
- Look!

130
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,155
Look properly, Aru!

131
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,809
She doesn't seem to be here.

132
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,438
What should I do?

133
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,610
He should take his sunglasses off.

134
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,527
That's true.

135
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,446
- He should.
- I agree.

136
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,739
If he wants to find her.

137
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,948
That's right.

138
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,576
Maho wasn't looking
for anybody so it's fine.

139
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,078
He should've made it easier
for her to recognize him.

140
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,206
That is so true.

141
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,166
It's beautiful.

142
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,003
- We kept looking from above yesterday.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,546
Um…

144
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,884
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Okay.

145
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,844
Can we sit and talk?

146
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,137
- Of course.
- Okay.

147
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,435
Where are they?

148
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,855
<i>- It's Yudai.</i>
<i>- He's nearing.</i>

149
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,607
<i>- He's coming.</i>
<i>- They might meet.</i>

150
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,735
- Jump!
- Jump!

151
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,031
- Phew.
- Phew.

152
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,701
So, Yudai asked me

153
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,664
if I would be willing to meet him today.

154
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,751
But I told him
I'm going on a date with you.

155
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,505
I told him that, and he said,

156
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,131
"I will look for you."

157
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,968
"If we meet,

158
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,472
can I have some of your time?"

159
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,692
He's desperately looking for her.

160
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,901
He's desperate.

161
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,656
If we happen to see him somewhere,

162
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,578
I will spend some time
with Yudai and talk with him.

163
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,498
I don't mind that at all.

164
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,833
Okay.

165
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,503
I got to see you today.

166
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,172
I really like you, Nanami.

167
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,469
I've told you all of my feelings.

168
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,224
How you feel when you see Yudai

169
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,228
is all up to you.

170
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:13,070
She might feel more at a loss
if she's told that.

171
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,876
You two spoke
after you got back last night?

172
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,793
Yeah.

173
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,503
That's impressive.

174
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,966
I bet Yudai has a lot on his mind too.

175
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,346
I see.

176
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,812
Hmm?

177
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,731
Oh, no.

178
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,191
- Is he nearing?
- He's close.

179
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,609
Let's eat.

180
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:52,943
Let's go.

181
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,155
- It's great weather today.
- Yeah.

182
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,948
- We could eat outside.
- Yeah.

183
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,496
Could they be at Cours Saleya Market?

184
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,171
- What?
- Really?

185
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,506
Wow.

186
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,716
It's Day Nine.

187
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,636
- This is unexpected.
- It's pretty intense.

188
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,554
It's an unprecedented turn of events.

189
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,014
It's different from before.

190
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,600
It's like a different game started.

191
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>Nanami said it clearly.</i>

192
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,437
<i>From what we saw in Day Eight,</i>

193
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,815
Nanami would say,
"Aren't you meeting Tohko?"

194
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,566
and "I have a date with Kensuke."

195
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,527
She was subtly declining Yudai,

196
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,655
but she gave up and said okay in the end

197
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,199
because Yudai was persistent.

198
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,575
That's the impression I got.

199
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,452
- Yeah.
- But she took it seriously.

200
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,455
She's treating it like a rule,
so if he happens to see her,

201
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,582
she will talk with him.

202
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,126
She shared that with Kensuke.

203
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,586
I'm surprised
that she's going fair and square.

204
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
- Yudai seems serious about it too.
- Yeah.

205
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,966
- That was unexpected.
- Yeah.

206
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,176
<i>He could have lost heart at that point.</i>

207
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,804
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Nanami and Yudai made that promise.</i>

208
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,433
But Yudai could have just stayed
in his room and relaxed.

209
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,309
I mean, I would do that.

210
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,853
Why? You should go out!

211
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,104
You won't look for her?

212
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,691
I would think,
"I don't think I stand a chance."

213
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,734
You'd realize that.

214
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,611
- I would just stay in my room.
- But why? Go out!

215
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,989
They would never put you on this show.

216
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,325
Does Nanami not want to see Yudai?

217
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,660
Does she or does she not?

218
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,495
It's getting too complicated.

219
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,082
She's close with Tohko as well.

220
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,376
She knows all about Tohko's feelings.

221
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,463
But Yudai's feelings
are directed towards her.

222
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,216
- Yudai and Kensuke are close as well.
- They are.

223
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,179
Nanami might not know
what the correct answer is yet.

224
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,638
- That could be it.
- Yeah.

225
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,142
She had never fallen in love with someone.

226
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,270
But she has come to know
the feeling of love towards Kensuke.

227
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,313
Because of that,

228
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,441
she can now understand the affection

229
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,861
that others direct towards her
more clearly.

230
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,154
That's what I think.

231
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,990
So, the fact that Yudai likes Nanami

232
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,077
is just as important to her
as her own feelings for Kensuke.

233
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:12,416
Nanami is too kind
to ignore those feelings.

234
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,252
- That might be part of it.
- True.

235
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,046
- How will it go?
- What will happen?

236
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,756
- This chase game.
- It's exciting.

237
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,033
DAY NINE, 7:00 P.M.
PLEASE COME TO MAISON MARGAUX

238
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,088
Whoa!

239
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,466
Wait.

240
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,426
What are you doing?

241
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,846
Same to you. What are you doing?

242
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,224
- Can I sit here?
- Sure.

243
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,852
- You have two?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:17,398
I happened to run into Yudai this morning.

245
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,941
- Really?
- Yeah.

246
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,734
Oh. Did he say something?

247
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,611
Yeah. Well…

248
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,490
He told me what he was going to tell you.

249
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,284
I heard about it.

250
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,828
I thought, "Oh."

251
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,373
He said he was gonna meet you
at Place Masséna.

252
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,251
I thought I might see you if I went there.

253
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,795
So I bought us coffee

254
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,548
and went to Place Masséna,
but you weren't there.

255
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,216
Wait, really?

256
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
Yeah. So this coffee is for you.

257
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,429
He revealed everything.

258
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,180
He's good at that.

259
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,017
- It's Aru's special technique.
- Like saying he reconned.

260
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,977
Oh. Thanks.

261
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,063
I wanna drink it. Can I?

262
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,775
Yeah, but I was walking around with them,
so they spilled everywhere.

263
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,319
Oh, that's why. I see.

264
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,238
- It got kind of messy. Sorry.
- Okay.

265
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,033
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

266
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,829
- It's cold, huh?
- Yeah, but it's good.

267
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,207
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

268
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,794
It's a bit weird for me
to be asking if you're okay though.

269
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,214
Hmm. Yeah.

270
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,300
Of course you're not okay, right?

271
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,181
- Yeah.
- What were you reading?

272
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,225
Well, I haven't had lunch yet.

273
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,937
I was thinking of grabbing a bite to eat.

274
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,647
I was wondering where I should go.

275
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,273
- You were searching?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,734
- I haven't eaten yet. Let's go together.
- Shall we?

277
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
- Can we?
- Let's go.

278
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,070
Let's go.

279
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,446
You saw the letter, right?

280
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,198
- We have plenty of time.
- Yeah.

281
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,282
Let's go.

282
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,244
They look so good. Let's eat.

283
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,583
She's alone!

284
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,168
She's alone.

285
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,426
But I bought all those clothes.

286
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,013
It's the perfect weather
to go parachuting.

287
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,933
- Wow.
- Wow.

288
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,935
We can look out over the port.

289
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,104
The Port of Nice.

290
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,900
We're in the shade.

291
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,235
Phew.

292
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:37,204
GARIBALDI SQUARE

293
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,123
<i>He's getting closer.</i>

294
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,209
<i>- To the port.</i>
<i>- They might all gather at the port.</i>

295
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
Are they at a restaurant?

296
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,054
Did you cycle along this road with Yudai?

297
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,974
- Yeah. And we went all the way that way.
- That way.

298
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,684
- There?
- And then, that way.

299
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,020
Did you go to the lighthouse?

300
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,396
- Yeah.
- I see.

301
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:11,989
PORT OF NICE

302
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,324
- He's at the port.
- He's at the port.

303
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,659
Oh, no. He's here.

304
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,667
- Should we go to the shop?
- Let's go.

305
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,795
We should go while it's open.

306
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,634
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

307
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,068
Bye-bye, port.

308
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,110
Bye-bye, port.

309
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,779
Will I ever come here again?

310
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,280
That's so sad.

311
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,865
It's the last time on this trip.

312
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,825
Everything we do will be our last time.

313
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,243
- It's so sad.
- It's so sad.

314
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,121
<i>- Whoa!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

315
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,665
<i>- He's here!</i>
<i>- What's going to happen?</i>

316
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,918
- It's really sad.
- Yeah.

317
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,628
So true.

318
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,221
- Wow.
- Yeah.

319
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,223
- They sell hookahs.
- Yeah.

320
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,058
Have you been to a shisha bar?

321
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
- I have.
- You have?

322
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,644
At Shimokitazawa.

323
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,646
Au revoir.

324
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,153
Wow!

325
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,447
- Whoa, he was inside the shop?
- Seriously?

326
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,406
Wow!

327
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,660
- It's still early, but I wanna drink.
- Oh.

328
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,702
That sounds nice.

329
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,330
- Yeah? Shall we?
- Shall we?

330
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,916
- One glass couldn't hurt.
- Maybe just one glass.

331
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,837
I wonder what that gathering
at 7:00 p.m. is.

332
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,382
- Was it at seven o'clock tonight?
- Yeah, at 7:00 p.m.

333
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,467
- Where are we?
- Is it here?

334
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,552
- We're here!
- Here?

335
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,013
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

336
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,015
Oh, my. Wow!

337
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,269
- Do you smell it?
- I can smell the seafood.

338
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,229
<i>- Santé.</i>
- Cheers.

339
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,565
- Haven't seen you since yesterday.
- Yeah.

340
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,732
Since last night.

341
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,904
So, are you okay?

342
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,823
About today.

343
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,074
- Today?
- Yeah.

344
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,243
How are you feeling?

345
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,956
Well, I actually met him yesterday.

346
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,624
For lunch.

347
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,002
But it was like,

348
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,630
I kind of had a feeling.

349
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,132
So, I knew.

350
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,302
- I see.
- Yeah.

351
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,557
- We still have tonight.
- Yeah.

352
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,100
- Tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

353
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,270
Yeah.

354
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,315
- Oh, it's here.
- I'm not looking. Don't look.

355
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,566
I didn't see it yet.

356
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,903
- I didn't see it.
- Wow. Just look.

357
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,988
- Look!
- Wow.

358
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,781
- It's huge.
- Awesome!

359
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,533
Let's dig in.

360
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,580
Wow!

361
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,581
It's delicious.

362
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,791
That's got to be delicious.

363
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,045
Yum!

364
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,172
This is great.

365
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,425
- It's nice that they had lunch together.
- Yeah.

366
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,136
She couldn't have smiled
like this if she were alone.

367
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,181
- Oh. It says, "Japan Soul."
- Wow.

368
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,975
- These are all in Japanese.
- Yeah.

369
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,227
Wow.

370
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,645
Oh!

371
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,522
- What?
- I love her.

372
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,067
Taeko Onuki.
The one I was telling you about.

373
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,693
- You found it?
- I want this!

374
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,070
I want this!

375
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,759
They're not here either.

376
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,720
He wouldn't think
they're at a record shop.

377
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,638
No.

378
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,933
- Yudai must be thinking, "It's Day Nine."
- Yeah.

379
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,145
"Please come
to Maison Margaux at 7:00 p.m."

380
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,481
Should we go back?

381
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,900
- Yeah.
- Let's go to our hotels.

382
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,194
We need to put our stuff away.

383
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,195
You're right.

384
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,317
I'll take the same seat.

385
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,360
- Right.
- I'll go over to the back, then.

386
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,528
Me too.

387
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,363
To the very back.

388
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,407
- The last seat?
- No, the one next to it.

389
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,535
- I'll sit here.
- Here?

390
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,372
- Yudai couldn't find them.
- No.

391
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,709
- He sat far away from Kensuke.
- Yeah.

392
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,879
"Last letter"?

393
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,839
"Last letter"?

394
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,509
So, you went with Nanami, huh?

395
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,805
- Did you tell her your feelings?
- Yeah.

396
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,931
I told her everything.

397
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,558
Really?

398
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,560
So, did you find her?

399
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,686
I didn't.

400
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,855
- Oh, really?
- I didn't get to see her.

401
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:37,814
Seriously?

402
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,151
- But you looked for her, right?
- I did search for her.

403
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,696
I went to notable locations.

404
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,575
Places they might go to on Day Nine.

405
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,243
Right. I see.

406
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,206
But it was too difficult to find them.

407
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:59,419
I don't really want to look
at Kensuke right now.

408
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,587
Well…

409
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,507
Hello!

410
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,468
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

411
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,844
Bonsoir.

412
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,806
I'll go sit at the back.

413
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,517
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

414
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,935
- Hey.
- Where should I sit?

415
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,894
Oh?

416
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,397
You can sit anywhere you like.

417
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,731
Don't fret over it.

418
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,732
I can't help it.

419
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,943
- I'll go there.
- Okay, I'll sit here.

420
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,530
- Hi, Sho. We haven't met since we skied.
- Hi.

421
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,906
- Hi.
- Did you lose weight?

422
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,199
- Phew.
- Did I get a tan?

423
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,952
- Did you lose weight?
- Did I? I gained weight.

424
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,622
Who cares, right?

425
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,500
It looks awesome
when they're all together.

426
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,254
- It's different from last time.
- Totally different.

427
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,464
Can we open this?

428
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,216
Yeah. Everybody's here.

429
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,259
Should we read it?

430
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,176
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

431
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,594
I'm gonna open mine.

432
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,597
There are two papers.

433
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,099
One's blank.

434
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,728
"We hope you are enjoying your trip."

435
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,607
"Tomorrow is the last day
of this ten-day journey."

436
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,692
That's right!

437
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,820
"Tonight is the last dinner gathering."

438
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:10,532
"Rules for Day Ten are as written below."

439
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,702
"Please choose one person
that you want to see on Day Ten."

440
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,456
"Please wait for that person at a place
where you want to see them again."

441
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,626
- "You can wait for them until sunset"?!
- What?

442
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,716
"The blank letter is
for you to share your feelings."

443
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,468
"This is the last letter."

444
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:35,182
"Please write your letter
at the hotel after this dinner gathering."

445
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:41,897
"If you do not wish to meet anyone,
you can retrieve your devices tomorrow."

446
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,737
- It says, "You can wait until sunset."
- Yeah.

447
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,864
Can we tell them where we'll be waiting?

448
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,991
- Yeah. I think so.
- Right?

449
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,454
So, we can designate the location
in the letter, right?

450
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,666
But even if we send this to each other,
what if we wrote different locations?

451
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,503
- Right?
- That's true.

452
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,379
This is difficult.

453
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,549
It'd be crazy if we chose the same place.

454
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,967
Yeah.

455
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,637
I see. We write the location.

456
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,474
- Yeah.
- Wow. This is difficult.

457
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,602
It says,
"If you don't want to meet anybody…"

458
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,980
Let's forget about this for now.

459
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,650
Tonight might be
the last time we get together.

460
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,735
- It's our last dinner gathering.
- Yeah.

461
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:33,949
- So, this was the goal of this trip.
- I see.

462
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,201
Tomorrow is Day Ten.

463
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,120
They choose one person
that they want to meet.

464
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,290
They wait for that person at a place
where they want to see them again.

465
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,919
Their time limit is until sunset.

466
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,339
They will go back
to their hotels after dinner tonight,

467
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,508
write their letters, and send them.

468
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,467
Right.

469
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:57,347
But if they don't wish to meet anyone,
they can retrieve their digital devices

470
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,432
at Maison Margaux
on the morning of Day Ten.

471
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,768
Retrieving their phones
means their trip ends.

472
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,771
- They can do that too.
- That's right.

473
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,773
If they're dying to check their phone,

474
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,401
they can retrieve their devices
without meeting anyone.

475
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,069
- Yeah.
- They can do that, right?

476
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,739
Let's say Person A writes to Person B.

477
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,909
They tell them where they'll be waiting.

478
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,954
But if Person B wrote to Person C,

479
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,248
telling them where they would be waiting,

480
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:28,712
Person A would find out
that Person B didn't write to them.

481
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,049
It becomes obvious
that their feelings aren't mutual.

482
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,969
- Because B didn't send A a letter.
- Right.

483
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,514
Not receiving the last letter
means they don't have feelings for you.

484
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,807
- That's right.
- Yeah.

485
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,436
- But will they wait?
- Will they still wait?

486
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,022
Or, will they give up and go back?

487
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,442
If they received a letter
from someone else, they could go there.

488
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,693
- Yeah.
- I see.

489
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,738
If they both like each other,

490
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,198
and they thought of the same location,

491
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,909
they would be able to meet right away.

492
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:04,205
If not, it's like what happened
at the beginning of this show.

493
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,334
They need to search
for each other around the city.

494
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,879
If they both go to the other location,
they'll miss each other.

495
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:15,091
They can't both continue to wait
for the other person to come either.

496
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,093
- That won't work.
- No.

497
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,304
This is fate too.

498
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,097
It's where you want to meet <i>again</i>.

499
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,515
That's nice too.

500
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,101
- It's nice.
- They've been to that place before.

501
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,646
- It could be the ski resort.
- That's too far.

502
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,731
- Way too far.
- The ski resort?

503
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,275
It's over if they can't meet there.

504
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,527
"Oh, no! She's on the advanced slope!"

505
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,530
"Nanami's on the advanced hill!"

506
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,199
Why would you choose the ski slope?

507
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:43,411
<i>- The dinner gathering seemed awkward.</i>
<i>- That was very awkward.</i>

508
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,373
Aru looked so uncomfortable towards Mimi.

509
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,959
He looked like

510
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,003
<i>he was surprised to see her there.</i>

511
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,255
<i>I mean, of course she would be there.</i>

512
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,760
If he was sheepishly like,
"Hey," I would get it, but…

513
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,221
He was like, "For real?"

514
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:05,475
- He's just so honest.
- He's endearing.

515
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,143
- Yeah.
- I'm growing to love him.

516
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,103
I agree.

517
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,688
Yudai couldn't meet Nanami.

518
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,731
- That's right.
- He almost ran into her.

519
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,859
- That was really close.
- It was so close.

520
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,154
<i>Such things might be happening</i>
<i>to us in our daily lives.</i>

521
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,072
<i>That's right.</i>

522
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,825
- We may have passed each other somewhere.
- Totally.

523
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,576
- That's possible.
- By some chance.

524
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,328
I need to be more careful.

525
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,914
- I need to be more attentive.
- Yeah.

526
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,374
We should look around more.

527
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,459
If there is a Season Two to this show,

528
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,963
let's bring in a soccer player
with a really broad field of vision.

529
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,883
- Let's do that.
- Let's see if he notices everyone.

530
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,427
Or a long-distance runner.

531
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,971
Someone skilled at orienteering.

532
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,181
The captain of the orienteering club.

533
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,267
- They'll be good with maps.
- That's fun.

534
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,186
Wow, this looks delicious!

535
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,272
Oh, my!

536
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,275
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

537
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,443
Cheers!

538
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,195
- Yay!
- Cheers!

539
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

540
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,453
- What's that?
- Caprese and sardine.

541
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,164
- What do you want to eat?
- Get me the same as yours.

542
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,081
Okay.

543
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,752
Do you want this one?

544
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,754
Thank you.

545
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,380
- Use your hand.
- Okay. Thanks.

546
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,548
I use my hand?

547
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,760
- Thanks.
- Do you want some, Aru?

548
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,219
- Thanks.
- Here.

549
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,137
Yum.

550
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,306
- Which one did you eat?
- This one.

551
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,515
- Right.
- Thank you.

552
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,187
This is good.

553
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,481
- I want to eat the octopus.
- This one?

554
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,524
Let's eat.

555
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,567
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

556
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,069
- This is delicious.
- This is good.

557
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,112
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

558
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,031
- Tasty.
- Yes.

559
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,033
MAHO, 30, MODEL

560
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,159
This is good.

561
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,746
Those who aren't doing well
are smiling less than those who are.

562
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,289
Totally.

563
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,875
- We should cut the meat.
- Yeah, we should.

564
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,504
Thanks.

565
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,506
I'll give some to Aru.

566
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,634
I got you some meat. Here.

567
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,345
- Can you hold this?
- Thanks.

568
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,846
What's that?

569
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,431
I'll pass it over to you.

570
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,475
That looks delicious.

571
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,104
I can't even turn my eyes that way.

572
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,149
I can't look that way.

573
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,030
It's the air around them, you know?

574
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,908
He's telling them to bite into it.

575
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,702
I wanna go sit over on the other side.

576
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,955
What did you do today?

577
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,291
I spent the whole day looking for someone.

578
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,461
I see.

579
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,756
- Hmm.
- I won't ask who.

580
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,802
You sound curious.

581
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,053
What did you do today?

582
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,558
I did some binge-eating alone.

583
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,477
- I met Yudai first on this trip.
- Stress eating.

584
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:58,398
It was the perfect weather
for stress eating.

585
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,026
Yet you chose to sit here.

586
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,696
Yeah.

587
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,416
He says he's happy now.

588
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,542
- Yeah.
- Good.

589
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,585
You look different.

590
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,336
So, the past two days,

591
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,464
I was thinking,
"I have no more time left!"

592
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,551
But I was able to use my time
for that person.

593
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,677
That's good.

594
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,221
- Good.
- I'm really glad I joined this trip.

595
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,349
- Did you meet her today?
- Huh?

596
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,185
- Did you meet her today?
- Today? No.

597
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,063
I looked, but I couldn't find her.

598
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,611
I didn't expect it to be easy,
and it sure wasn't.

599
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,115
You want anything?

600
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,575
Should I get something?

601
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,453
- The salmon.
- I'll pass it to you.

602
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,831
Please excuse me.

603
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,182
Dear Yudai,

604
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,810
Thank you for sharing
your honest feelings with me yesterday.

605
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,103
This is a normal letter.

606
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,481
She'll write her last letter separately.

607
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,816
Did you all eat the food at Margaux?

608
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,984
I ate the salad.

609
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,486
- The salad?
- The salad?

610
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,404
- I ate that too.
- The one in the jar?

611
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,198
- I ate that salad.
- Really?

612
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,825
How about the red bean butter toast?

613
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,119
- The toast? That was delicious.
- Did you eat it?

614
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,914
- That was delicious!
- It was super tasty.

615
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,791
That was awesome.

616
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,168
I wish I was the one for you.

617
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,711
I can't give up.

618
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,796
From Riko

619
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,095
I can't cheer you on
because I've fallen in love with you!

620
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,514
I wish I was the one for you.

621
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:59,018
I don't want to leave any regrets
on this once-in-a-lifetime trip.

622
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,479
I want to be with you.

623
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,691
Do you have
any memories of Maison Margaux?

624
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,569
- I ran into two people here today.
- Hi, Tohko.

625
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,029
- Wow.
- You look pretty today.

626
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,114
Thanks.

627
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,660
- Really?
- Yeah. I met two people.

628
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,664
Today turned out to be
the best day thanks to Margaux.

629
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,500
That's wonderful!

630
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,628
Can we talk outside for a little bit?

631
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,213
Sure.

632
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,677
- Now?
- You can eat first.

633
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,431
I was thinking, "Today is the last day."

634
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,600
- I wanted to talk with you.
- Yeah.

635
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,768
Just the two of us.

636
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,645
We only get to see one person tomorrow.

637
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,313
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

638
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,773
But I think

639
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,483
it was really fun overall.

640
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,901
It was, wasn't it?

641
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,404
I don't really…

642
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,158
get it myself either.

643
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,953
But I think I really liked you.

644
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,664
Thanks.

645
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,252
I figured you would go to Nanami.

646
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,881
I wanted to give up.

647
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,507
But

648
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,926
we need to choose who we want to see…

649
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,346
for Day Ten.

650
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,433
And I want to see you, Yudai.

651
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,564
I still want to spend time with you.

652
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,483
I want you to keep me in mind.

653
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,984
Okay.

654
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,113
Please read this after you go back.

655
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,782
- After I go back?
- Yeah.

656
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,118
I will.

657
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,373
I don't know what happened last night.

658
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,168
But you couldn't see her today, right?

659
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,253
That's right.

660
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,757
- I looked, but I couldn't find her.
- Right.

661
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,634
And your feelings?

662
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,888
I couldn't tell her, so I will later on.

663
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,015
I'll tell her my feelings.

664
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,644
I see.

665
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,782
He hasn't told her his feelings yet.

666
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,368
- Things may have been different if he had.
- Right.

667
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:23,871
Another glass?

668
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,001
I'm not overdrinking.

669
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,255
Why? The milk tea was…

670
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,383
- Can I have a minute?
- Sure.

671
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,888
Right.

672
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:51,023
I looked all over the place today,
but I couldn't find you.

673
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,485
I want to share with you now

674
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,030
what I wanted to tell you today.

675
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,077
I like you, Nanami.

676
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,958
I've spent much less time with you

677
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:13,963
than Kensuke has.

678
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,007
But for me,

679
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,303
the day we went cycling together

680
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,805
was so much fun.

681
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,057
I was really nervous and excited.

682
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,935
I think that was

683
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,229
because I like you.

684
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,232
That was why I was excited.

685
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,700
- Can we change seats?
- Of course.

686
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,163
- Are you drinking?
- I'm drunk.

687
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,080
Yeah.

688
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,541
Everyone's talking to him.

689
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,044
Don't you need to talk to him too?

690
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,379
Huh?

691
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,220
- It's your last chance.
- Yeah.

692
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,139
I think it's over.

693
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,683
This is so tough.

694
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,518
Well…

695
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,814
I'm really proud of you.

696
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:21,822
I said something
pretty irresponsible at the vineyard.

697
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,740
Didn't I?

698
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,283
Irresponsible? Oh, yeah.

699
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,871
- Well…
- I was wondering how things were.

700
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,667
I've told him all of my feelings.

701
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:39,006
If it doesn't work out after all this,
then it's probably just not meant to be.

702
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,759
It's impressive you've done this much.

703
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,885
Right?

704
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,429
- On this trip.
- Yeah.

705
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,056
Are you worried?

706
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:53,271
- Well, I mean, it's all up to her.
- Yeah.

707
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,107
But

708
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,568
that cycling trip was really fun.

709
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,738
I'm glad you feel that way.

710
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,741
It was so much fun.

711
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,079
Is it Kensuke?

712
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,088
Wait. Never mind.

713
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,214
I think

714
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,467
I'd rather hold off
on hearing your answer.

715
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,636
- I'll go back.
- Yeah.

716
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,595
See you.

717
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,057
Hey.

718
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,893
- You're not cold?
- No.

719
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,728
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

720
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,198
- You know…
- Yeah?

721
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,534
At the beach today,

722
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,455
you told me about Yudai looking for you.

723
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,501
You said you would go talk with him
if we happened to see him.

724
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,544
I said, "Go ahead. I don't mind."

725
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,089
Right?

726
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,134
I said that,

727
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,221
but I didn't want you to go at all.

728
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,931
I was thinking that way,

729
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,557
but I tried to act cool.

730
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,101
Among all of us,

731
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,814
I'm the one that loves you the most.

732
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,942
Believe me.

733
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,194
Just stick with me.

734
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,240
Yeah.

735
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,714
Have you decided who you'll write to?

736
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,508
- Yeah.
- Okay.

737
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,177
That's good.

738
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,223
No changes?

739
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,686
Hmm.

740
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,980
Have you decided?

741
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,357
I'm still…

742
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,610
I think I'll take time to think about it.

743
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,446
Isn't there a part of you

744
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,240
that wanted to talk with other people?

745
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,033
- No?
- Quite a bit, actually.

746
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,201
Yeah, right?

747
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,581
- Regardless of what's going on now.
- Yeah.

748
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,375
Do you wish you could
redo everything from Day One?

749
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,169
Well, yeah.

750
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,880
If I redid everything from Day One,

751
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,591
things might have turned out
completely differently.

752
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,180
- Go talk with him.
- Huh?

753
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,849
- Don't you need to talk to him?
- No.

754
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,642
No. I'm fine.

755
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,768
- You're fine?
- Yeah.

756
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,649
I wouldn't know

757
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,986
what you're feeling.

758
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,115
I can't read your mind.

759
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,286
Just do what's best for you.

760
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,829
Okay.

761
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,216
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.

762
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,968
He says they're closing.
We need to finish this.

763
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,846
We are closing soon. Thank you very much.

764
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,556
- Thank you.
- Merci.

765
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,641
Merci.

766
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,101
I might not see you anymore, Nanami.

767
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,062
- I don't want that.
- Me neither.

768
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,897
This is so sad.

769
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,982
- I'll miss you all.
- Stop it. This is sad.

770
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,651
Don't say that.

771
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,320
Then, Atsushi.

772
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,696
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

773
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,865
Okay.

774
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,116
Thank you all

775
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,538
for these great encounters
over these nine days.

776
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,123
- I wish we could have talked more.
- Yeah.

777
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,793
Tomorrow, we'll only be able to meet

778
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,545
with the person we want to see.

779
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,965
It's kind of cruel, isn't it?

780
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:35,594
There will be people
we won't be able to see.

781
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,056
- But we made great memories.
- Yeah.

782
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,433
To destiny!

783
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,103
- Yay!
- To destiny!

784
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,479
Thanks for everything.

785
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,147
Till we meet again.

786
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,065
Thank you!

787
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,359
- Thanks.
- See you. Let's all meet up again.

788
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,318
Yeah.

789
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,029
I bet Atsushi went on and on.

790
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,450
- I see. Kensuke did the right thing.
- Well played, Kensuke.

791
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:02,079
- He did the right thing there.
- The speech probably dragged on.

792
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,832
- Atsushi probably said some good stuff.
- I see.

793
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,584
Kensuke was like, "To destiny!"

794
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,879
- Kensuke was very manly.
- Yeah.

795
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,258
He says the right things when he has to.

796
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,426
Exactly.

797
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,596
Comedians are good
at doing that when they have to.

798
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,514
That's exactly right.

799
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,225
He said, "Believe me. Just stick with me."

800
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,271
<i>- "I'm the one that loves you the most."</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

801
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,940
<i>- He made Nanami cry again.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

802
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,735
- It's not like he's possessive either.
- Right.

803
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,322
So I think he's good boyfriend material.

804
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,073
He has no money though.

805
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,201
Kensuke doesn't have money.

806
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,080
It's been completely overlooked
on this trip that Kensuke has no money.

807
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,291
That's his weak point.

808
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,209
I'll lend him money.

809
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,128
I'd lend him money if it's for Nanami.

810
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,130
I don't mind lending him money too.

811
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,466
- You'll lend him money too?
- Wow!

812
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,968
Kensuke now has
a humongous sponsor on him.

813
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,887
Kensuke is suddenly rich!

814
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,350
We really don't know what will happen.

815
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,392
Like with Kanaka.

816
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,519
<i>- She'll think about it.</i>
<i>- That was unexpected.</i>

817
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,563
<i>We were saying here</i>

818
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,400
that Sho and Kanaka were a stable couple.

819
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,904
It was only on Day Eight
that Sho told his feelings to Kanaka.

820
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,407
<i>- And it wasn't very direct.</i>
<i>- We thought he would be manly.</i>

821
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,452
We assumed he would be
direct with his words and say,

822
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,329
"I really like you, Kanaka."

823
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,455
But he was like,

824
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,541
"I kinda like you."

825
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,671
- That was cute.
- He turned into a college student.

826
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,299
She might retrieve her phone and leave.

827
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,425
- Yeah.
- Totally.

828
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,387
- That's true!
- She would just disappear.

829
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,763
- It suits her image.
- Yeah.

830
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,849
She'll leave a message saying,
"That was fun."

831
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,852
A message with a lipstick mark.

832
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,357
And she'll write, "Bye, Sho."

833
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,025
"Bye, Sho."

834
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,988
The concept of fate
is the theme of this journey.

835
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,368
Now, when it comes to the decision
of whether to go back or not,

836
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,830
will they ask themselves
that question again?

837
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,749
- "Is this really fate?"
- True.

838
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,253
<i>Nanami didn't know Kensuke's face,</i>
<i>but his mailbox was in the middle,</i>

839
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,880
<i>so she randomly</i>
<i>tossed her letter into his mailbox.</i>

840
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,549
That's actually amazing.

841
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,925
- Exactly!
- Yes.

842
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,343
And look at them now.

843
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,470
I feel a strong sense of fate.

844
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,848
Sho met Mimi at the beach.

845
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,559
- He talked to her from behind.
- Yeah, he did.

846
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:32,521
<i>- It was an incredibly fate-driven start.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

847
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,940
When they all got together
for the first time,

848
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,443
it just so happened
that Kanaka was next to him.

849
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,402
<i>By chance.</i>

850
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,612
<i>And when they talked, they clicked.</i>

851
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,824
Sho happened to have
the Wish Letter for the next day.

852
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,827
Mimi and Sho
both had Wish Letters for Day Four.

853
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,037
Yeah. They had the same date.

854
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,956
That's why he didn't ask Mimi out.

855
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,917
He announced publicly
that he will ask Kanaka out.

856
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,462
<i>We don't know how</i>
<i>he would've asked Kanaka out</i>

857
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,464
<i>if his Wish Letter wasn't on Day Four.</i>

858
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:03,886
If he didn't have Day Four,
Mimi may have handed him her Wish Letter.

859
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,721
That would have been a different fate.

860
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,266
It was more like,
"If Sho's doing that, I'll do this."

861
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,811
<i>- But that turned out so well.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

862
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,854
<i>Wow.</i>

863
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,274
Tohko did eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

864
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,693
<i>Nanami chose Kensuke.</i>

865
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,780
<i>- Tohko had chosen Atsushi.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

866
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,616
This one didn't click at all.

867
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,788
No one even bothered to mention this.

868
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,290
- They went for dinner.
- They had dinner together.

869
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:37,419
<i>Atsushi was like, "I don't feel</i>
<i>like meeting up with the other three."</i>

870
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,797
But nothing sparked.

871
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,841
We know how innocent Tohko is,
yet she didn't feel a thing.

872
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,301
No, she didn't.

873
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:48,055
If she had, she wouldn't have
fallen in love with Yudai at first sight.

874
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:48,972
True.

875
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,434
Atsushi miraculously
didn't spark anything in Tohko.

876
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,728
<i>Then, she fell for Yudai,</i>

877
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,981
<i>who sat next to her</i>
<i>and was exactly her type.</i>

878
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,859
But for Yudai,

879
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,195
it was the cycling date.

880
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:07,449
<i>His feelings got stronger</i>
<i>on Day Five with his Wish Letter date.</i>

881
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,867
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- It was nice.</i>

882
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,411
Tohko and Yudai
both had Wish Letters for Day Five.

883
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,329
That's right.

884
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,206
What if they had switched letters?

885
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,919
And if Tohko and Yudai
went on the cycling trip together?

886
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,588
He may not have known Nanami so well.

887
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,298
And Maho.

888
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,219
<i>She met Yudai at the church</i>
<i>and felt a sense of fate.</i>

889
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,471
<i>She was drawn to him.</i>

890
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,475
Aru is the same age as her,
but in the end, she liked Yudai.

891
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,352
- That's her story.
- Right.

892
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,603
And Kensuke.

893
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,982
Kensuke had it the best, to be honest.

894
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,235
<i>He ran into Kanaka</i>
<i>and felt a sense of fate.</i>

895
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,736
<i>They went shopping together.</i>

896
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,072
<i>He ended up buying a coat</i>
<i>that Yudai was eyeing.</i>

897
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,574
<i>He did.</i>

898
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,326
- He enjoyed Nice to its fullest.
- Yeah.

899
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,120
And he happened to receive a letter.

900
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,540
<i>That letter came to him from Nanami.</i>

901
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,793
Kensuke didn't really do anything himself.

902
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,961
That's true.

903
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,421
But with Aru,

904
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,590
he fell in love naturally.

905
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,925
It wasn't a fateful love
like on this show.

906
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,886
It's a likely scenario in daily life.

907
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,431
You run into friends
and make a connection with someone.

908
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,975
<i>That was how Aru and Mimi met.</i>

909
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,519
<i>The way that didn't work out</i>

910
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,354
might be because of this trip.

911
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:23,317
Their encounter was less fate-driven.

912
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,736
It had less impact.

913
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,446
Everyone was sensitive to fate too.

914
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,947
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

915
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,116
We still have the last letter.

916
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:36,538
Right. Yudai might think,
"Maybe I should give up on Nanami."

917
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:43,587
He might ask one of the other girls
to spend the last day with him.

918
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,089
- They could choose to leave too.
- Yeah.

919
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,591
Everyone might leave.

920
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,260
- Everyone?
- Everyone.

921
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,178
Why?

922
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,679
"I wanna meet someone,

923
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,433
but I wanna use my smartphone."

924
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,478
- Now that they know.
- They would want their phones.

925
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,855
They thought they had to wait
until the very end.

926
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,941
But now, "Wait, the morning of Day Ten?"

927
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:18,413
I came on this journey
and fell in love with you.

928
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,041
Meeting you was fate.

929
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,460
I'm happy I got to spend time with you.

930
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,587
I want to be with you.

931
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,922
From Riko

932
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:42,938
I will be waiting for you

933
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:48,986
at the white bench.

934
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:07,004
PLEASE CHOOSE ONE PERSON
THAT YOU WANT TO SEE ON DAY TEN

935
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,446
Dear Nanami,

936
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,740
You're the prettiest girl
in the world. I love you.

937
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:38,744
I'll be waiting for you
at the gate that was closed.

938
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,511
Dear Kanaka,

939
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:01,058
I'll be waiting for you
at the place where we painted together.

940
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,958
I hope you feel the same way too.

941
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:27,876
From Mimi

942
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,677
Thank you for a fantastic time
yesterday and today!

943
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,097
I want to know more about you.

944
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,767
I will be waiting
at Place Masséna on Day Ten.

945
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,490
PLEASE CHOOSE ONE PERSON
THAT YOU WANT TO SEE ON DAY TEN

946
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,190
