00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah.

182
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,102
Wow!

183
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,479
Whoa!

184
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,982
- Wow!
- Oh, man!

185
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,899
Oh, my.

186
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,859
Wow.

187
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,611
- Amazing.
- Oh, wow.

188
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,405
This is the best.

189
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,200
Wow. This is really worth the climb.

190
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,243
That's the station.

191
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,287
Huh? Oh, right.

192
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,788
We climbed up from there.

193
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,249
- Monaco is that way.
- That's Monaco?

194
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,625
- There?
- Yeah.

195
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,962
And look. Our Nice.

196
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,463
- Ours.
- It's that way.

197
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,506
Wow!

198
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,260
I want to remember this forever.

199
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,612
Oh my gosh.

200
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,660
- I'm sorry!
- Hey.

201
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,329
She's totally in love with him.

202
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,580
She's smitten.

203
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,664
Hey.

204
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,958
- Did I make you wait?
- Not at all.

205
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,752
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

206
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,714
Do you have somewhere you want to go?

207
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,257
Where should we go?

208
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,718
- Oh, look.
- I've marked a lot of places.

209
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,761
Are you hungry?

210
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,264
- You can be honest.
- I'm hungry.

211
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,932
You are? Okay then.

212
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,561
- Let's go to a café to grab something.
- Okay.

213
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,897
- Then we'll have something sweet after.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,024
- Which café?
- I like that.

215
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,362
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

216
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,279
Dear Aru,

217
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,657
Bonjour!
How about we go for dinner tonight?

218
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,451
I'll be waiting at Place Masséna
at around 7:00 p.m.

219
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,369
From Maho

220
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,542
- He's happy.
- He's like, "Yeah, thanks."

221
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,920
- It's written all over his face.
- He savors it.

222
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,837
So adorable.

223
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,840
- So cute. It looks yummy.
- This looks delicious.

224
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,759
I'd take pictures if I had my phone.

225
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,260
I'll burn it into my memory.

226
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,637
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

227
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,848
"Excuse me"?

228
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,476
- It's not cheese. It's yogurt.
- What?

229
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,936
That must be tasty.

230
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,563
- I wanna have some.
- Wait a second.

231
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,524
Let me eat the bottom part.

232
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,484
I should have ordered that.

233
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,909
- You're funny.
- Try it.

234
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,412
You should dig into it.

235
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,579
Wait, are you okay?

236
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,123
- What did I do?
- Here.

237
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,126
You've stained yourself.

238
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,544
That was quick. Thanks.

239
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,756
I'll try this.

240
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,551
- Too much?
- You're eating too much?

241
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,763
Is it good?

242
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,765
- It's good.
- The yogurt is thick.

243
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,019
It's getting dark.

244
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:09,937
Yeah.

245
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,897
It's started raining.

246
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,572
Umbrella…

247
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,576
Hi.

248
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,454
- Thanks for waiting.
- Oh, no. Here.

249
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,205
Let's use this umbrella.

250
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,584
- It's raining hard.
- Sorry I'm late.

251
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,877
Not at all.

252
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,879
- I made you wait.
- Good to see you.

253
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:35,921
What should we do?

254
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,215
- Let's go indoors.
- Yeah.

255
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:44,346
I want to go to a restaurant
called Tigermilk

256
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,183
and a vintage shop called La Fraperie.

257
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,934
Oh! I'm so sorry.

258
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:49,935
Um, yeah.

259
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,855
Do you want to go anywhere?

260
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,273
No. Let's go to those places.

261
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,775
Tigermilk, then?

262
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,651
- Tigermilk.
- Yeah. Let's go.

263
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,612
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's fine.

264
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,322
Thank you. You're getting wet.

265
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,323
I'm okay.

266
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,783
- It's pouring.
- Which way?

267
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,409
- That way?
- That way.

268
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,744
- Let's go that way.
- Yeah.

269
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,704
- Oh, no.
- Let's go.

270
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,539
Thank you.

271
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,501
- Sorry. It was sunny a minute ago.
- I know.

272
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,961
- These two are adorable.
- They're so cute.

273
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,630
They're so sweet.

274
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,468
Thank you.

275
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,428
Oh, no. I need to thank you.

276
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,346
Thank you.

277
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,015
- For the letter.
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,768
I hadn't met anybody.

279
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,772
I thought I had to do something.

280
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,316
Yours was in the middle.

281
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,859
- That's why?
- So I posted there.

282
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,777
Oh.

283
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,154
I was lucky.

284
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,282
We all gathered last night, right?

285
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,454
- You seemed the most approachable.
- Really?

286
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,874
- That ambience got us nervous, didn't it?
- Yeah.

287
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,502
I knew we should get ourselves talking.

288
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,631
I said I felt comfortable in the silence.

289
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,259
- And you agreed with me.
- Yeah.

290
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,012
- You gave me that letter, right?
- Yeah.

291
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,558
- Of course, I was happy and came today.
- Yeah.

292
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,185
Even without that letter,
I would've asked you.

293
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,103
What?

294
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,813
I would have asked you out.

295
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,816
- What? Oh, really? Thank you.
- Yeah.

296
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,444
I felt the same way yesterday.

297
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,323
That makes me happy. Thanks.

298
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,575
- What a relief.
- Yeah.

299
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,827
He's not afraid to speak his mind.

300
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,328
That's true. He does.

301
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
- About yesterday…
- Yeah?

302
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,793
That was the first time…

303
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,592
I ever asked somebody on a date.

304
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,136
Seriously?

305
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,179
You're okay with me?

306
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,097
Yeah.

307
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,725
I've never said that to anyone.

308
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,809
Does everyone say it?

309
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,812
- I guess we hardly ever say it.
- Right?

310
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,938
I mean,

311
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,526
if we had our phones,
we could just text and ask people out.

312
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,361
For dinner or to a café.

313
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,365
But to ask someone out
on a date in person?

314
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,701
We don't do that.

315
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,370
I was nervous.

316
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,331
I really appreciate it.

317
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,876
Thank you for coming.

318
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,754
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

319
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,631
That's good to know.

320
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,007
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

321
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,925
"Yeah"?

322
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,470
- You're fast.
- Okay.

323
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,015
I can't help it.
This tiny umbrella is shaped like this.

324
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,352
- Like this.
- I think we go this way.

325
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,147
I have a feeling
that we should go this way.

326
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,148
A feeling?

327
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm not even looking at the map.

328
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,736
I can't read maps.

329
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,615
She said it was her first time
asking somebody out on a date.

330
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,574
She did.

331
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,618
That's Tohko's "first-time" tactic.

332
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,328
Did she use it before?

333
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,289
- She said she's never dated anybody.
- Oh, right.

334
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,668
- That might put pressure on some people.
- That's true.

335
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,797
She doesn't necessarily
have to say it's her first time.

336
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,550
- Yudai kind of gives light reactions.
- He does.

337
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,636
- We don't see his true feelings.
- No.

338
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,930
- He gives good responses.
- Yeah.

339
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,139
And Yudai.

340
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,058
Before his date…

341
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,268
<i>- He wrote a letter.</i>
<i>- To Nanami.</i>

342
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,312
<i>- Yes, to Nanami.</i>
<i>- What will happen?</i>

343
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,066
So, Nanami and Kensuke…

344
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,361
Will they come back
and check their mailboxes?

345
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,320
That's true.

346
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,738
Right?

347
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,198
They're on a date.

348
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,325
And Kensuke forgot his umbrella.

349
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,035
- What was that?
- I'm sorry.

350
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,120
<i>But why?</i>

351
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,330
<i>- Plus, he was late.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

352
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,666
- He must have been sleeping.
- He probably was.

353
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,584
I can't think of any other reason.

354
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,586
- Comedians are like that.
- We're impulsive.

355
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,130
"Do you wanna go anywhere?"

356
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,966
"Let's go there.
That way? That way. Let's go."

357
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,092
Comedians are like that.

358
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,052
- But Kensuke told Nanami.
- Yes.

359
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,304
- He would've asked her out.
- Yes.

360
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,141
- He says those things clearly.
- He does.

361
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,019
- He's got talent for a kept man.
- That's true!

362
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,270
That Kensuke.

363
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,312
Also, Kanaka and Sho.

364
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,564
Right. They're good.

365
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,315
- In Provence.
- It's the Wish Letter.

366
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,193
<i>The weather cleared up,</i>
<i>and they climbed to the top.</i>

367
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,155
There's nothing too special,
but they look comfortable.

368
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,323
- Yeah, that's true.
- Comfortable together.

369
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,201
- And Mimi and Atsushi are in Cannes.
- Yes.

370
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,246
<i>- She wanted to share the umbrella.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

371
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,789
She said that to Aru.

372
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,042
Aru.

373
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,877
<i>- The cap and stickers.</i>
<i>- The must-haves.</i>

374
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,919
<i>Mimi loves that.</i>

375
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,713
<i>- </i>She loves local stuff.
- Loves them.

376
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,672
She buys them all.

377
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,966
And today is Day Four.

378
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,261
So the ones
with Wish Letters for Day Five,

379
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,472
meaning Tohko and Yudai,

380
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,934
must hand their letters
or exchange them with somebody today.

381
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,436
- That's the rule.
- Right.

382
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,023
- Exchanging at this time is tough.
- You're right.

383
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,650
The one with this letter
needs to act quickly.

384
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,195
And everybody's out and about.

385
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,122
Oh!

386
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,500
- We're here.
- This, huh?

387
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,419
- Yay!
- Wow.

388
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,420
- Look.
- What?

389
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,963
It's the market.

390
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,173
Oh, this is it.

391
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,633
It's this!

392
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,550
Wow!

393
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,260
This is amazing.

394
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,598
It smells so nice.

395
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,351
- Can I get this paella?
- I wanna eat it too.

396
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,979
- Merci beaucoup.
- Merci beaucoup.

397
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,398
- See you. Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

398
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,399
Have a nice day.

399
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,610
Hey, look. This looks delicious.

400
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,571
- Recommendation?
- Yes, it's very nice.

401
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,866
- I'll take this.
- You want one of these?

402
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,579
Do you want to taste the hummus?

403
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,914
- Yes.
- Yeah?

404
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,335
Can I?

405
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,050
- Oh, that looks tasty.
- Yeah.

406
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,468
That's awesome.

407
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,928
Do you smell that?

408
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,972
- Nice smell.
- Yeah, nice smell.

409
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,976
- Mimi's in a good mood.
- Yeah.

410
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,063
- It's great how she enjoys every moment.
- I totally agree.

411
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,359
I'm hungry.

412
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,443
Yeah, me too.

413
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,320
We've been walking all day today.

414
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,156
But I'm not tired at all.

415
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,448
Please take a seat.

416
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,366
Thanks.

417
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,869
- Wow.
- Yeah.

418
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,786
Look at that.

419
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,123
That's what we climbed.

420
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,959
- We climbed up to that corner.
- Wow.

421
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,170
Have you found anybody?

422
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,798
- Hmm.
- You met everybody last night, right?

423
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,801
- I did want to talk more with you.
- Oh, really?

424
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,053
We sat next to each other, remember?

425
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,431
- We chatted while we ate.
- Yeah.

426
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,517
I wanted to talk with you more.

427
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,145
- So today was a good chance.
- Oh.

428
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,813
I'm glad I asked.

429
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,983
Your manly behavior really impressed me.

430
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:53,901
Really?

431
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,236
I thought it was really cool

432
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,989
that you asked me out
in front of everybody.

433
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:04,036
It's been two years?
No, three years since I had a boyfriend.

434
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,120
Oh, really?

435
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,664
Yeah. During that time,
I went on dates and stuff,

436
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,335
and it almost got serious
with some people too.

437
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:16,298
But it's really hard to find a guy
that could act as manly as you.

438
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,008
Maybe that's true.

439
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,011
- Manly guys, huh?
- They're an endangered species.

440
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,933
He doesn't say, "Well, I can pull it off."

441
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,645
Sho tends to do that, doesn't he?

442
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,980
He doesn't take that next step.

443
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,398
I'll eat first.

444
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,566
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

445
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,654
This is good.

446
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,740
What was your favorite food in Nice?

447
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,116
The truffle risotto.

448
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,701
My number one.

449
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,162
That was insanely delicious.

450
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,413
I want you to try it.

451
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,208
Yeah. But don't you want to
try other places?

452
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,627
Yeah, let's go find other places.

453
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,711
Let's do that.

454
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,588
- You know what?
- Yeah?

455
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,759
There are people going on trips
with the Wish Letter today.

456
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,052
What day was yours?

457
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,929
Mine was eight. Day Eight.

458
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,264
That's late.

459
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,848
- The last one.
- The last one?

460
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,766
Yeah.

461
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,726
- That's nice.
- How about you?

462
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,312
- Mine was Day Six.
- Oh, Day Six!

463
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,732
- So I need to hand it tomorrow.
- Oh, right.

464
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,235
The travel plan that I have

465
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,445
is a difficult one.

466
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,780
Hmm?

467
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
What's it like?

468
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,449
It's, uh…

469
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,034
skiing.

470
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,245
Wow! Really?

471
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,955
That's so nice!

472
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,123
Do you ski?

473
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,541
I've never skied before.

474
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,500
Oh, really?

475
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,712
It's 2,000 meters above sea level.

476
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,715
- It's up on this high mountain.
- Wow.

477
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,091
Can you ski?

478
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,509
I'm from Niigata.

479
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,927
- That's right!
- Yeah.

480
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,470
I grew up in the snow.

481
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,973
Did you go skiing on your field trips?

482
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,225
Yeah. We had ski camps too.

483
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,476
I went skiing every year.

484
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,020
- I see.
- Yeah.

485
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,022
She's from Niigata!

486
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,149
Hikakin is also from Niigata.

487
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,443
He is, but you don't have to mention it.

488
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,404
- Oh, yeah. About today…
- Yeah?

489
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,032
Do you have any plans
after we go to the vintage shop?

490
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:05,949
No.

491
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,993
I want to go near the beach.

492
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,705
Do you know Castle Hill?

493
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,706
What's that?

494
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,916
If you don't mind,

495
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,710
I want to go while the sun is out.

496
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,422
I want a panoramic view
of the sea around Nice.

497
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,590
I wanna see that.

498
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,011
Are you cold?

499
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,387
A little.

500
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,014
You can wear mine.

501
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,308
- It's fine. You'll be cold.
- No. Just take it.

502
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,101
- You'll be cold.
- I'll be fine.

503
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,353
- But…
- Here.

504
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,272
- It might be small.
- Thank you.

505
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,274
Here you go.

506
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,402
Thank you.

507
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,696
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

508
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,531
Thank you. This smells nice.

509
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,493
- Okay.
- Thank you.

510
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,495
- Should we eat?
- Yeah.

511
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,205
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

512
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,208
- How do I eat this? With my hands?
- I'll use my hands.

513
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,459
- It's warm!
- It's warm.

514
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,427
So…

515
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,680
First of all,

516
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,725
I really want to thank you

517
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,103
for asking me out today.

518
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,398
Oh, no. Thank you for coming.

519
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:24,694
- But we had never even spoken before.
- No.

520
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,365
- Did you think, "Why?"
- I wasn't sure you'd be okay with me.

521
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,242
I wanted it to be you.

522
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,079
But you're 20, right?

523
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,415
You're 20.

524
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,208
- Yeah, 20.
- Right?

525
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,460
What do you think of younger girls?

526
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,504
I prefer girls younger than me.

527
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

528
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,299
I'm ten years older than you.

529
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,635
Isn't that too old for you?

530
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,679
- Not at all.
- Seriously?

531
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,807
I like older men. The older, the better.

532
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,434
I see.

533
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,022
ENTREVAUX STATION

534
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,691
Bonjour.

535
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,696
- It's tiny.
- What?!

536
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,782
- It's so cute though.
- It's so different from that other train.

537
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,748
We've come quite far.

538
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,626
- We've come a long way.
- Yeah.

539
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,172
- It's hard to believe we were by the sea.
- Yeah.

540
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,756
I like it this way.

541
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,427
It feels more like a trip.

542
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,097
I had a feeling you would like this view.

543
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,599
- Really?
- Yeah.

544
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:39,269
I love these kinds of trips.

545
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,812
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

546
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,156
We're eating sweet stuff all day.

547
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,742
- I love it.
- Yeah.

548
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,830
There's a lot of people here.

549
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,624
- Myeah. I thought so too.
- "Myeah"?

550
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,087
- <i>Yeah</i>. I thought so too.
- Oh. "Yeah."

551
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,756
You said, "Myeah."

552
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,509
- You wanna sit here?
- Yeah.

553
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,512
Yay. We found a seat.

554
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,308
- There we go.
- Van Gogh.

555
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,476
This is grea-- What?

556
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,645
Gogh, huh?

557
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,772
I'm loving this.

558
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,108
What will you do tomorrow?

559
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,568
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

560
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,070
- About tomorrow…
- Yeah?

561
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,488
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

562
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,741
You know I have
the Wish Letter for Day Five, right?

563
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,826
It's only Day Five.

564
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,995
So I'm thinking of going

565
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,290
with someone I don't know much
or haven't talked to yet.

566
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,834
I got to know you today.

567
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,003
So for tomorrow,

568
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,257
I'm thinking of
handing my letter to Nanami today.

569
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,174
I see.

570
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,760
Did you promise to meet her?

571
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,554
Well…

572
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,392
- I went to Margaux this morning.
- Okay.

573
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,103
- I left her a letter.
- Right.

574
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,772
But I don't know if I'll get to meet her.

575
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,693
So I'm kind of thinking
about what I should do.

576
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,735
I see.

577
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,530
And you? How will you spend Day Five?

578
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,908
I would've asked you out
if we didn't have the same day.

579
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,243
Really?

580
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,330
Maybe this is some kind of fate.

581
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,334
He said, "This is fate."

582
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,712
His responses are interesting. He's quick.

583
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,547
- He's quick-witted.
- Yeah.

584
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,257
- Thank you.
- Merci.

585
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,301
- Merci. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

586
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,679
- It's nice.
- Yeah!

587
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,597
Yes!

588
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,974
- I got this.
- It's nice.

589
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,434
Yeah. That's cute.

590
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,102
- It suits you.
- Let's see.

591
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,895
Huh?

592
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,858
It looks fantastic.

593
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,943
- We can't really see us.
- No, not really.

594
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,404
- Should we go to the beach?
- Yeah. Let's go.

595
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,574
- Let's go while the sun is out.
- Let's go.

596
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,951
- That way?
- Yeah.

597
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,790
Wow.

598
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,334
Do we climb up?

599
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,251
Nice.

600
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,377
A panoramic view.

601
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,546
It's 21 meters high.

602
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,299
- There are 109 steps.
- Okay.

603
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:18,887
Whoa.

604
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,221
Look at that.

605
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,891
- Oh?
- This is amazing.

606
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,101
We're climbing up.

607
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,228
Oh! I see the light.

608
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,857
Wait. Should we see this together?

609
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,443
- Ready? Now!
- Ready? Now!

610
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,321
Wow! Huh? Oh, wow!

611
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,282
What? We have a 360-degree view!

612
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,618
- Wow!
- Wow!

613
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,704
It's a view straight out of a movie.

614
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,917
- This is something we can't see in Nice.
- Yeah.

615
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,543
- A 360-degree view.
- Wow.

616
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,671
This is really spectacular.

617
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,466
- It's like a movie.
- This might be the best place in Cannes.

618
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,553
Nice.

619
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,846
Oh, wow.

620
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,224
This is the best.

621
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,433
I don't wanna go back.

622
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,061
- Me neither.
- It makes you feel that way.

623
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,816
- I've never been on a proper date.
- Right.

624
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,819
- I have so many things I want to do.
- Like what?

625
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,988
- A date like this?
- Today's date is great too.

626
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,701
- Like walking along the beach.
- Yeah.

627
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,246
I've never been to a café with a boy.

628
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,124
So you accomplished that today.

629
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,834
- Yeah.
- What else?

630
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,420
- I like sports.
- Oh! Okay.

631
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,255
I want to play sports together.

632
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,507
I guess it's just everything.

633
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,925
Can I suggest something?

634
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,094
I want to propose something.

635
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,971
- Paragliding.
- Yeah.

636
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,517
We can do that
at the Port of Nice or somewhere.

637
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:48,977
It's around there.

638
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,938
We can't go together on Day Five

639
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,607
because we have the same date.

640
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,236
So it's my turn now.

641
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,365
- How about we go paragliding?
- Yeah.

642
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,325
I'm not sure if it's really a date.

643
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,661
- But how's that?
- I'd love to.

644
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,746
Okay?

645
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,081
- When should we go?
- Yeah, when?

646
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,542
- Day Six?
- Are you okay with that?

647
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,501
Yeah.

648
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,674
So does Yudai
really just want to talk with Nanami?

649
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,302
Yudai seems like the capable type.

650
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,346
- I have the same impression.
- Yeah.

651
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,266
Maybe I'll try exchanging
my letter with someone.

652
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,227
Do you have someone in mind?

653
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,812
Hmm.

654
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,856
Maho?

655
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,693
I saw Maho at Margaux this morning.

656
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,696
Where did she say she was going?

657
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,199
There's a vintage shop around here.

658
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,536
She said the shop was closed
and she couldn't look inside.

659
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,164
- She might be around here.
- Okay.

660
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,250
- Or Old Nice.
- Right.

661
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,460
She might be there.

662
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,838
- We could walk around and look for her.
- Yeah.

663
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,465
I'll do that.

664
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,176
- Wow.
- We're here.

665
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,971
This is just totally unbelievable.

666
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,724
- Isn't this awesome?
- This is different again.

667
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,352
Oh, wow. This is great.

668
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,355
I've only seen a view
like this in picture books.

669
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,439
No kidding.

670
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,358
Just wow.

671
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,820
- Wow.
- This is beautiful.

672
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,241
- The air tastes so good.
- Yeah.

673
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,869
Down there would have been
even more beautiful if it weren't raining.

674
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,705
That's true. What a pity.

675
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,834
- But it's beautiful.
- Yeah.

676
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,170
- This was the plan for this trip.
- Wow!

677
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,005
Where are we now?

678
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
Here.

679
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,718
- Wow.
- Verdon River is our final destination.

680
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,428
Can I see the back side?

681
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,766
"A train journey on the railways
of Provence" sounds so nice.

682
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,309
Yeah.

683
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:58,273
- You wouldn't normally do this.
- You wouldn't.

684
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,774
That's what made it so nice.

685
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,528
Do you want to go eat
truffle risotto tomorrow?

686
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,989
Sure. What time do you wanna go?

687
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,033
- Let's meet at nine at Maison Margaux.
- Okay.

688
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,577
- We could walk around.
- Yeah.

689
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,163
- We'll look at vintage shops.
- Then, we'll eat truffles.

690
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,708
- Let's do that.
- Something like that.

691
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,918
That sounds fun.

692
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,838
- Hmm.
- It's tomorrow.

693
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,173
- Two days in a row.
- They made plans.

694
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,050
Kanaka liked the fact that

695
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,928
Sho handed his Wish Letter
to her in front of everybody.

696
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,598
<i>- She appreciated that.</i>
<i>- She said that was manly.</i>

697
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,765
<i>Sho has a tendency</i>

698
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:37,186
of almost conveying his feelings
if he took one step forward,

699
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,149
but he pulls back at the last moment.

700
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,609
He was like that with Mimi.

701
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,777
Kanaka was very open with him.

702
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,530
- She talked about the people she dated.
- That's right.

703
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:52,744
She even mentioned that some people
she dated recently weren't as manly.

704
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,662
But Sho was like, "Oh, yeah."

705
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,497
He's like, "I'm different."

706
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,208
- But he doesn't exactly say it.
- No.

707
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,253
But he instantly answered,
"Truffle risotto."

708
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,756
He answered that immediately.

709
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,176
- So he's capable of answering promptly.
- I see.

710
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,219
It's not like he's slow-witted.

711
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,721
He's choosing his answers.

712
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,598
Maybe he's observing the situation.

713
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,351
- I kind of get that feeling.
- Yeah, that's true.

714
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,352
Mimi and Atsushi.

715
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,188
When Atsushi asked
if she was okay with inviting him

716
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,023
when they had never spoken,

717
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,108
Mimi said, "I wanted it to be you."

718
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,444
She can become a textbook.

719
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,112
- Of some sort, yeah.
- Seriously.

720
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,697
- Nanami and Kensuke.
- Yeah.

721
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,698
They're sweet.

722
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,784
Yes, they're adorable.

723
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,619
You keep talking to them as we watch.

724
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,913
- I'm like, "You bought a bag?"
- Yeah.

725
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,790
- Kensuke is cute.
- Yeah.

726
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>It's the way she looks at Kensuke.</i>

727
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,086
<i>But it's a bit complicated.</i>

728
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,422
Kensuke and Nanami seem to get along.

729
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,718
And the plan on Kensuke's
Wish Letter on Day Six

730
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,011
was to go skiing.

731
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,806
He told Nanami about it,
and she said, "I can ski."

732
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,850
So they might go together. But!

733
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,103
Yudai wants to meet Nanami.

734
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,522
But Nanami doesn't know that.

735
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,107
She hasn't seen his letter.

736
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,027
Tohko asked Yudai
what he was going to do on that bench.

737
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,905
<i>She would've asked him out</i>
<i>if they didn't have the same day.</i>

738
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,323
<i>When she said that,</i>

739
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,910
Yudai immediately said,
"Maybe this is some kind of fate."

740
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,953
He did.

741
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:21,541
Compared to Aru, Atsushi, and Sho,

742
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,334
Yudai responds spontaneously.

743
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,712
It's not a favorable situation for him.

744
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,339
Tohko told him she wanted to go with him.

745
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,341
But he said it was fate.

746
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,260
It sounds kind of harsh.

747
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,512
- But he says it so lightheartedly.
- Which is it?

748
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,016
He proposed an alternative date
because they can't go on Day Five.

749
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,018
He quickly suggested that.

750
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,354
- He would do well as a salesman.
- Absolutely.

751
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,605
He would be amazing.

752
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,066
Maybe it's because of all the sugar.

753
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,068
- From the sweets?
- The sugar.

754
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,987
Maybe it's the genius type of sugar.

755
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,030
- Yeah.
- Really?

756
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,574
- It's not enough for him.
- Maybe.

757
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,659
He needs to maintain that speed.

758
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,672
It's this vintage shop here.

759
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,798
Is she here?

760
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,718
- Are there any signs of her?
- I don't know.

761
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,972
There are no signs of her.

762
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,892
Oh?

763
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,895
I might find her at Margaux.

764
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,731
Oh, right.

765
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,524
That's a possibility.

766
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,818
Should we go to Margaux?

767
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,781
The sun is starting to set.

768
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,532
Isn't it just nice?

769
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,661
Wow.

770
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,625
I got water on me. It's salty.

771
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,002
- It's salty?
- Yeah.

772
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,173
Oh, you're right. I do feel it.

773
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,344
So it's that one.

774
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,846
I don't know how to get there.

775
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,307
- Aren't those stairs amazing?
- Do we climb that?

776
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,059
- Do we?
- Wow!

777
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,770
Hey, look at that.

778
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,982
Is it closed?

779
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,484
Really?

780
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:12,985
Should we go look?

781
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,493
- Hmm?
- Oh?

782
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,372
- Oh.
- What is this?

783
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,791
I can't read it.

784
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,044
We can't read this.

785
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,254
What's this?

786
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,630
- Right now…
- Until six?

787
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,674
- I see.
- Let's go.

788
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,926
- Too bad.
- Too bad.

789
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,928
- We'll come some other time.
- Yeah.

790
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,232
- Wow!
- Which seat?

791
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,026
- Which one?
- Take this one.

792
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,069
Thank you.

793
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,239
Wow. Oh, gosh.

794
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,365
This is amazing.

795
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:03,995
We get to eat
with the ocean right in front of us?

796
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,418
- Wow.
- This is great.

797
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,836
- Wait.
- Wow.

798
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,713
How is this as a sea-lover?

799
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,089
- The best?
- The best.

800
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,716
Are you cold?

801
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,468
It's cold. A little.

802
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,470
I'm warm, so you can use this.

803
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,265
Thanks. Aren't you cold?

804
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,725
- I'm not cold.
- You're okay?

805
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,645
- I was really looking forward to this.
- Is that so?

806
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,023
Yeah, since I first read it.

807
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,649
- On your Wish Letter?
- Yeah.

808
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,194
- Right.
- I'm glad I came here with you.

809
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,281
This is the best.

810
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,367
What type of girls do you like?

811
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,411
You mean by looks?

812
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,787
Anything.

813
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,082
Appearance-wise, I like cute girls.

814
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,834
- I see.
- Yeah.

815
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,545
And you? You kind of told me earlier.

816
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,672
You prefer older guys, right?

817
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,466
Also…

818
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,428
- I like guys with beards.
- Oh.

819
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,721
Then it's not me.

820
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,349
Well, beards aren't everything.

821
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,684
- Yay!
- It's not you.

822
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,311
- It's not?
- It's Aru.

823
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,146
- It's Aru.
- Oh, Aru.

824
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,023
What makes you feel like,

825
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,734
"Oh, I'm so in love with this person"?

826
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,739
At times like these,
we don't have digital devices, right?

827
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,242
Imagine when night comes.

828
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,662
- After my bath and before I go to bed.
- I see.

829
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,830
I would usually spend that time

830
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,042
on my phone and stuff.

831
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,752
I don't have that time now.

832
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,464
So I look back on the things
that happened that day.

833
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,552
If I miss that person during that time,

834
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:47,515
I'd think I'm probably in love.

835
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,725
I hope you miss me tonight then.

836
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,060
Yeah.

837
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,022
But I have a feeling I will.

838
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,525
To me, you're…

839
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,068
How do I put it?

840
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,739
I like you the best
of all the girls I've met.

841
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,825
Wow.

842
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,703
I kind of get what you're like.

843
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,246
- You do?
- I do.

844
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,832
Kind of. By spending time together.

845
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,126
You like the sea.

846
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,296
I love the sea. It's in my name.

847
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,465
The kanji characters
for Mimi mean "beautiful sea."

848
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,309
Aru is always at Place Masséna.

849
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,601
He's always waiting.

850
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,482
Aru.

851
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,192
- Hey.
- Hi.

852
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,111
Hey there.

853
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,946
- Thanks.
- Did you wait?

854
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,698
- No. I just arrived.
- Oh? Okay.

855
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,491
Where should we go?

856
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,369
I have a place in mind, so let's go there.

857
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,539
- This way. We'll take the tram.
- Okay.

858
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,334
Is this your first time at Place Masséna?

859
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,501
It's not.

860
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,128
- No, right?
- My third time.

861
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,090
- Let's see if anybody's here.
- Yeah.

862
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,761
Please. I hope someone's here.

863
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,679
Will they switch with me though?

864
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,515
Nobody's here.

865
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,975
I guess it's not that easy.

866
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,934
You're right.

867
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,103
What now?

868
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,065
Right.

869
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,400
You need to decide today.

870
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,737
Even if I ask someone
to exchange letters with me now,

871
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,197
it's this late already.

872
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,531
Yeah?

873
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,867
It would just inconvenience them.

874
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,577
I guess you're right.

875
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,372
Maybe I'll ask Kensuke.

876
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,459
- I did want to talk with him more.
- Yeah.

877
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,294
I'll go look for him,

878
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,713
or I'll wait for him at the hotel.

879
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,299
Day Five is the toughest one.

880
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,803
I'm pretty sure

881
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,306
me asking you out on Day Four
made things complicated.

882
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,058
- Everything.
- Is that so?

883
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,520
But I wanted to see you today
if I don't get to see you on Day Five.

884
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,105
Oh, yeah?

885
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,445
"Oh, yeah"?

886
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,281
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

887
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,908
Oh, right.

888
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,493
What?

889
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,912
We need to decide
what time to meet on Day Six.

890
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,914
- Oh, you're right.
- Yeah.

891
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,416
Absolutely.

892
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,209
So, Day Six.

893
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,211
- Do you wanna ride the train?
- Yeah!

894
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,546
Okay.

895
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,923
Number 15 on page seven.

896
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,801
- We'll meet at this station at 12:00 p.m.
- Okay.

897
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,595
How about here?

898
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,764
Oh, thank you.

899
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,560
Okay.

900
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,437
Wow.

901
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,063
Oh, wow.

902
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,775
Wow.

903
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,320
Wow.

904
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,657
I want to live here.

905
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:56,787
Right now, I live in a 70-year-old house.

906
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,248
- I have two housemates.
- Really?

907
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,125
- My rent is 10,000 yen.
- What?!

908
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,336
- All the floorboards are creaky.
- Right.

909
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,923
I'm usually in this small, wooden house,

910
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,676
but everything's wide open now.

911
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,511
It's stunning.

912
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,096
I'm happy to be here

913
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,724
with such a wonderful lady.

914
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,683
Not at all.

915
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

916
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,107
I'm glad I wrote you… that letter.

917
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,526
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

918
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,153
- Thank you.
- It's fine.

919
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,237
Thank you.

920
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,990
- So cute.
- Yeah.

921
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,243
- Aw, Nanami.
- Nanami.

922
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:41,040
Looking at this sea
makes me feel kind of sad.

923
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,958
- It's coming to an end.
- Yeah.

924
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,710
- The sun has set.
- Yeah.

925
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,378
I'd like to…

926
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,839
Let's go on a date again.

927
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,257
Yeah. I'd like to…

928
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,552
ask you out again.

929
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:54,887
Please do.

930
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,972
I want to drink coffee.

931
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,849
- I like coffee.
- Okay.

932
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,767
Me too.

933
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,269
- Yeah.
- I have it every day.

934
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,771
Do you like espresso?

935
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,107
I've always wanted to try espresso.

936
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:12,571
Can I ask you out on a date
for your first-ever espresso?

937
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,822
- Of course.
- Really?

938
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:14,990
- Yeah.
- Oh.

939
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:15,908
Okay.

940
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,785
That's a promise.

941
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,744
Yeah.

942
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,538
I'll write it down.

943
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:25,626
I'll drink my first-ever espresso
with Atsushi.

944
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,544
Okay.

945
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,087
That's Aru's pen!

946
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,213
That pen!

947
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,967
- Don't use Aru's pen!
- That's not your prince.

948
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,427
But then you'll see my whole list.

949
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,887
I won't look.

950
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,098
- You won't look?
- No.

951
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,808
You can look.

952
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,519
I'll excuse myself to the restroom.

953
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,188
- Okay?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

954
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,231
Take your time.

955
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,489
TO-DO LIST

956
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,410
DRINK ESPRESSO
FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH ATSUSHI

957
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,413
Merci beaucoup.

958
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,559
- Sorry for the wait.
- You're back.

959
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,687
- Are you cold?
- I was gazing at the sea.

960
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,648
- I was daydreaming.
- I have something for you.

961
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,566
Hmm?

962
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,776
- Like a present.
- A present?

963
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,154
- It's this. The one I got earlier.
- Oh!

964
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,781
I wrote a message on the back.

965
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,367
- Read it later.
- Later?

966
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,368
Read it later.

967
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,995
- Yay.
- Don't read it yet.

968
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:44,955
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

969
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,999
- Here.
- Thank you.

970
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,085
- I don't wanna go back.
- Me neither.

971
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,505
- I mean, this view is amazing.
- Right?

972
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,591
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

973
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,138
We'll hold hands.

974
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,767
Man, today was the best.

975
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,144
Whee!

976
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,771
I had so much fun.

977
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,106
Your hand is warm.

978
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,068
Is it?

979
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,530
Right.

980
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:22,117
- All right. They held hands.
- I see.

981
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,203
Things might get complicated.

982
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,288
Atsushi kept lending his coat.

983
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,500
<i>He was constantly lending her his coat.</i>

984
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,211
<i>- I want him to buy her clothes.</i>
<i>- He should do that.</i>

985
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:36,298
Mimi asked him his type,
and he said he liked cute girls.

986
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:41,679
I thought Mimi would say something
that hints at Atsushi,

987
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,931
but she said her type is guys with beards.

988
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,934
Atsushi thought Mimi chose him over Aru.

989
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:51,021
- So why?
- Maybe she was trying to get him fired up.

990
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,108
Tohko and Yudai went to look for Maho.

991
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,819
<i>Tohko wanted to exchange</i>
<i>her Wish Letter with Maho.</i>

992
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,737
<i>- They couldn't find her.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

993
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,282
Tohko wanted to see him today
if she won't see him on Day Five.

994
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,450
Yeah.

995
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,829
When she said that,
Yudai seemed to hesitate.

996
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,622
- Yeah.
- Even that Yudai.

997
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,833
Right. He couldn't respond on the spot.

998
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,961
Well, they did have
that conversation already.

999
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,047
They did make plans already.

1000
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,757
Yeah, they did.

1001
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,927
He did settle the discussion once.

1002
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,848
Yudai is kind and is very thoughtful.

1003
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:30,060
He's been helping Tohko
with the things that she wants to do

1004
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,396
and listening to her wishes.

1005
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,313
Yeah.

1006
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,526
- He helped her look for Maho.
- That was very kind of him.

1007
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:41,363
This is something
Yudai needs to report to Kensuke.

1008
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,781
To Kensuke, his bestie.

1009
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:43,949
<i>Nanami and Kensuke.</i>

1010
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,701
<i>The park closed at 6:00 p.m.</i>

1011
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,829
<i>The park was closed,</i>
<i>but they sat on a bench.</i>

1012
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,665
<i>"</i>I'm happy I'm with
such a wonderful lady."

1013
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,417
Kensuke shyly said that.

1014
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:58,297
And Nanami said,
"I'm glad I wrote you that letter."

1015
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,799
She kind of hesitated when she said that.

1016
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,052
I just loved the way she paused.

1017
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,097
I'm glad I wrote you… that letter.

1018
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,892
I absolutely love that.

1019
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,934
They're so sweet.

1020
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,772
It makes me feel like
we're watching a young couple.

1021
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:15,773
Yes, it does.

1022
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,317
- Maho and Aru went for dinner.
- Yes.

1023
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,027
He's Mr. Place Masséna.

1024
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,571
<i>The Wizard of Place Masséna.</i>

1025
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,491
<i>The people of Nice</i>
<i>might give him that name soon.</i>

1026
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,326
"He's here. He's here again."

1027
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,660
"He's at Masséna again."

1028
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,412
That guy's always at Masséna too.

1029
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,289
No, it's someone from the shops nearby.

1030
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,134
It's here.

1031
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,302
- Here?
- Yeah.

1032
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,056
- Hotel Nice.
- That's nice.

1033
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,017
- What? Did you just say "nice"?
- Let's try that again.

1034
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,727
- Hotel Nice.
- Hotel Nice.

1035
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,647
It's beautiful.

1036
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,690
I'll go get him.

1037
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,650
Thanks.

1038
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,335
The streetlights are lit up.

1039
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,212
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

1040
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,214
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

1041
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,799
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

1042
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,133
- How about here?
- Here?

1043
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,718
Looks nice.

1044
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,097
- Let's eat here then.
- Yeah.

1045
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,099
They're having dinner?

1046
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,892
- That'll take time.
- Tohko won't see him.

1047
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:34,893
Oh, no.

1048
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,276
He wasn't there.

1049
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,735
What should we do?

1050
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,697
Then I'll wait for him here.

1051
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,074
It's almost eight. Are you okay?

1052
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,034
I'm fine with the time.

1053
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,036
Let me give you

1054
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,872
my coat.

1055
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,707
- It's fine!
- Take it!

1056
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,458
It'll get cold.

1057
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,294
- It's fine.
- I can't.

1058
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,671
It's all right. Just take it.

1059
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,756
- Okay?
- Thanks.

1060
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,885
It's fine. I better get going.

1061
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,136
Thanks for today.

1062
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,406
- You know what?
- What?

1063
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,533
I'm kind of curious about

1064
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,077
what Japanese food in Nice tastes like.

1065
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,204
I agree.

1066
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,000
I sometimes see ramen places

1067
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,753
and sushi restaurants.

1068
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,005
- Do you like ramen?
- I love ramen.

1069
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,549
We need to go then.

1070
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,593
Let's do that. I really wanted to go.

1071
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:50,928
But when?

1072
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,638
Yeah, when?

1073
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:57,643
DAY FIVE: A SMALL BIKE TRIP

1074
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:11,615
How was yesterday? You met everybody.

1075
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,285
I mean, it was fun. Wasn't it?

1076
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,871
- I don't really remember.
- You're kidding.

1077
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,831
MAHO, 30, MODEL

1078
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,792
You didn't seem that way at all.

1079
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:26,296
- I was nervous and flustered.
- Really?

1080
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,507
You gave me that letter

1081
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,842
right after that dinner.

1082
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,010
Yeah.

1083
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,471
What kind of impression did I give you?

1084
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:39,017
I thought maybe we could talk easily
since we're the same age.

1085
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,269
- You're the easiest to talk to.
- Right?

1086
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,648
Yeah, that was why
I asked you out for dinner.

1087
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:50,028
So it's just Yudai
that you went on a date with?

1088
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:50,988
Yeah.

1089
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,448
We met at a church.

1090
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,826
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.

1091
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,287
I didn't think I'd meet
anybody in a church.

1092
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,000
- Shocking, right?
- Did you feel a sense of fate?

1093
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,128
- Did you?
- Hmm.

1094
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,879
Yeah, that's true.

1095
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:12,092
- I thought, "This must be fate."
- You did?

1096
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,614
What kind of dance do you do?

1097
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,658
What genre is it?

1098
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,953
Well, I sort of do everything.

1099
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,248
From ballet to jazz to hip-hop.

1100
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,001
- I do contemporary dances as well.
- Okay.

1101
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,754
When I do my own workshops, it's hip-hop.

1102
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,964
Wow. When did you start?

1103
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,176
It's been over 20 years.

1104
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,428
- That's long.
- Since I was in elementary school.

1105
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,598
Wow. Dancing, huh?

1106
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,060
I can do traditional Japanese dancing.

1107
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,269
- What?
- Do you know it?

1108
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:09,149
- Like in Kyoto, right?
- Yeah, the slow dance that <i>maiko </i>do.

1109
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,485
But I can't do such intense dances.

1110
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,863
- You live in Paris, right?
- Yeah, in Paris.

1111
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,531
What made you go there?

1112
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:20,035
- I studied nutrition in college.
- Okay.

1113
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,788
- I'm actually a qualified nutritionist.
- You are?

1114
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,499
France is famous for its food.

1115
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,751
So I've always wanted to go to France.

1116
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,378
I also love art and fashion,

1117
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,715
so I thought, "I should go,"
and that's why I'm here.

1118
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,467
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

1119
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:40,472
I think my mindset and way of thinking
when taking those kinds of actions

1120
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,307
are very similar to yours.

1121
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,558
- Really?
- Yeah.

1122
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,269
We said, "Let's go together."

1123
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,730
- But it's a bit awkward.
- It is.

1124
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,483
So if I do find a letter,

1125
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,110
I won't tell you

1126
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,612
what's written there.

1127
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,406
- You won't tell me?
- If I find a letter.

1128
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,908
Oh, right! Yes.

1129
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,201
We'll go in one by one.

1130
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,494
One by one.

1131
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,578
And then…

1132
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,832
- We won't say anything.
- Okay.

1133
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,751
I'll say, "You go first."

1134
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,754
- And we pass each other.
- Right.

1135
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,152
What are you doing, Kensuke?

1136
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,404
Whoa! What?

1137
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,489
- It's you, huh?
- What?

1138
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,742
- What are you doing?
- You were here?

1139
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,286
- Alone?
- I'm here. Alone.

1140
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,872
- I came to check my mailbox.
- Oh, yeah?

1141
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,456
- See you.
- See you.

1142
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,669
- I'll see you.
- See you.

1143
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,506
Why didn't Kensuke notice him?

1144
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,175
He came in this way.

1145
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,052
- What's wrong with his field of vision?
- How could that be?

1146
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,931
This is really cute.

1147
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,357
- Thanks for waiting.
- Oh, okay.

1148
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,609
- Yeah.
- My turn.

1149
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,611
- I'll go inside.
- Yudai was there.

1150
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,404
- Yudai? Oh.
- Yeah.

1151
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,661
Hello.

1152
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,081
- Hello.
- I heard you were here.

1153
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:30,999
Oh, really?

1154
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:31,917
Yeah.

1155
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,252
Well, thank you so much.

1156
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,671
- "Thank you so much"?
- For coming.

1157
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,589
Huh?

1158
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,965
- Oh?
- Oh?

1159
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,176
- Oh.
- Wait a minute.

1160
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,553
Oh? Okay.

1161
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,472
Please take a look.

1162
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,473
Huh? Okay.

1163
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,643
Oh!

1164
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,273
Wait.

1165
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,444
I'll be waiting for you
at 8:00 p.m. today at Maison Margaux.

1166
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,029
I'm so glad you came.

1167
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,906
Oh, wow!

1168
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,200
- I'm so relieved.
- What?

1169
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,371
- Wait. Let me put this inside.
- I'm so relieved.

1170
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,290
I'm so surprised.

1171
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,252
I just saw the letter.

1172
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,921
I'm glad. It was worth the wait.

1173
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,382
Oh, no.

1174
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,387
Wait, I need to give you this.

1175
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,347
Give me a second.

1176
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,309
Let's see…

1177
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,198
- It's for tomorrow.
- Yes.

1178
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,409
- Will you join me?
- Yes.

1179
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:48,827
Thank you.

1180
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,955
- I'm so relieved.
- Me too.

1181
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:54,791
Yeah.

1182
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,168
- I'm glad I came.
- Yeah.

1183
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,045
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

1184
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,548
- Thank you.
- Good night.

1185
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,300
- Good night.
- Good night.

1186
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,477
I'm exhausted.

1187
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,107
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, yeah.

1188
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,484
Are you free at night?

1189
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,361
Actually,

1190
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,655
just now

1191
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,075
I got a ticket.

1192
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,830
I don't know what time it will end.

1193
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,167
What should we do then?

1194
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:43,506
Tomorrow night, if you can make it.

1195
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,551
- Will you come here?
- Okay.

1196
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:48,887
I will.

1197
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,849
- I'll be here all night.
- Okay.

1198
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,101
I don't know what time it'll be.

1199
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:56,978
But I'll come here.

1200
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,522
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

1201
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,732
If you're early…

1202
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,151
Oh, but you would be tired.

1203
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,487
It's okay.
I have confidence in my stamina.

1204
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,865
- If it's really early, let's go for ramen.
- Let's do that.

1205
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,453
- Have fun.
- I will. Thanks.

1206
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,136
Kensuke.

1207
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,638
- Huh?
- I was waiting for you.

1208
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,098
- For me?
- Yeah.

1209
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,265
- Waiting for me?
- Yeah.

1210
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,558
What?

1211
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,768
So, you see…

1212
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,854
- My Wish Letter is for Day Five.
- Okay.

1213
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,564
Will you join me?

1214
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,651
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1215
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,112
- Let's have fun tomorrow.
- Yes, definitely.

1216
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,155
- You waited in this cold?
- It's nothing.

1217
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,034
I totally thought
you would hand yours to Yudai.

1218
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,370
Yudai also had Day Five.

1219
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,163
- Really?
- I can't give it to him.

1220
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,375
But I want to get to know you better too.

1221
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,168
Thank you. Of course.

1222
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,795
I'll be there.

1223
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,922
Oh, one more thing.

1224
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,549
This is Yudai's.

1225
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
- Oh?
- Can you give it back to him?

1226
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,093
Sure.

1227
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:23,731
SHO, 22, UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND MODEL

1228
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:36,077
Dear Mimi,

1229
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,169
- It's Mimi!
- It's Mimi!

1230
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,547
- Oh, man.
- So it's Mimi after all?

1231
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,133
He's crazy about her.

1232
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,635
So it's Mimi!

1233
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,431
Is he going to wrap up his date
with Kanaka early to meet Mimi?

1234
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,893
We don't know. What will he write?

1235
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,936
They were the first to meet.

1236
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,063
<i>Maybe the sense of fate is really strong.</i>

1237
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,690
<i>- Just like Maho said.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

1238
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:09,611
With this system, the memory
of first meeting somebody by chance

1239
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,113
becomes stronger
the more you talk to other people.

1240
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,781
- Maybe.
- That might be true.

1241
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,992
- Like meeting at the beach or the church.
- Yeah.

1242
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,995
Nanami also sent her letter to Kensuke

1243
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,080
because his mailbox was in the middle.

1244
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,459
And when she met him,
she was glad she had given him the letter.

1245
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,504
- The first encounter really is important.
- True.

1246
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,339
- That was unprecedented.
- Yeah?

1247
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,548
<i>Kensuke missed Yudai.</i>

1248
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,343
<i>Unbelievable. How?</i>

1249
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,803
He came in facing this way.

1250
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,515
- A predator's field of view.
- How could it be?

1251
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:42,352
- He zeroes in on his prey.
- It's the opposite of zebras.

1252
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,563
- It's like this. Just straight ahead.
- It's amazing.

1253
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,690
Did they both wait about two hours?

1254
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,734
- Yeah, they waited.
- They did.

1255
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,945
- The hotel entrance is a hot spot.
- Yeah.

1256
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,490
- A hot spot.
- It's the best place to wait for people.

1257
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,908
<i>It's better than Margaux.</i>

1258
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,285
<i>It's open 24 hours,</i>
<i>and they're more likely to meet.</i>

1259
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,246
You know what?

1260
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,164
If I were with them,

1261
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,834
I'd want to join Kensuke, Yudai,
Tohko, and Nanami.

1262
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,212
I want to hang out with the five of us.

1263
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,129
Don't do that.

1264
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,173
Don't interrupt them.

1265
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:16,928
I want to shuffle the pairs
with some random reason.

1266
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,889
But I wonder how things will turn out.

1267
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,774
- Hey.
- Whoa.

1268
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,692
Hi.

1269
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,569
- Hey.
- Hey.

1270
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,779
Take a seat.

1271
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,447
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

1272
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,366
- It's cold.
- It's cold?

1273
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,284
How was it?

1274
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,371
- Well, it was super fun.
- You enjoyed it?

1275
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,706
Yeah, I bet.

1276
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,874
So, how's it going?

1277
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,376
- How's it going?
- Yeah.

1278
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,004
Well, to be honest,

1279
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,922
it was really good.

1280
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,135
But I mean, it would be, right?

1281
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,847
Man, this is troublesome.

1282
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:06,227
- It was when I first met her.
- Yeah.

1283
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,188
She told me the ages
of the people she had dated.

1284
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,025
I knew she liked older guys.

1285
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:16,487
So naturally,
I didn't want you to go for her.

1286
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,615
- Right?
- Yeah.

1287
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,784
I'll say this because it's you, Aru.

1288
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,747
She likes older men.

1289
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,041
And men with beards.

1290
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,417
She said that.

1291
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,130
I don't have a beard.

1292
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,716
I'll share that information with you.

1293
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,385
I don't think there's any need
for me to hide that.

1294
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,556
So that's that.

1295
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,770
- Atsushi is a fair man.
- Yeah. He's an athlete.

1296
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,771
Good sportsmanship.

1297
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,731
And Aru seems so happy again.

1298
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:12,085
MIMI, 20, PART-TIME WORKER

1299
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,002
Dear Mimi,

1300
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,464
Thank you for a wonderful trip today.
It was the best day.

1301
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:19,676
I want to get to know you better
in the next six days.

1302
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,010
Let's go drink espresso.

1303
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,095
From Atsushi

1304
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,023
Dear Mimi,

1305
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:40,238
I'll be waiting for you at 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow (Day Five) at Maison Margaux.

1306
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,323
Let's go for dinner!

1307
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,491
From Sho

1308
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,675
