1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,558
NICE-VILLE STATION

2
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,435
Are you pumped up?

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,895
Well, yeah.

4
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,689
I'm nervous though.

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,693
Are you nervous? She asked you out.

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,904
- I'm nervous too.
- Oh, really?

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,115
It's my first time to get asked out.

8
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,033
I see.

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,743
Let's make today count.

10
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,244
Any plans for tomorrow?

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,914
I actually sent a letter yesterday.

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,958
I don't know how it will turn out.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,460
So you're gonna go check

14
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,380
after your Wish Letter date today?

15
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,631
Right.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,300
That's nerve-racking.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,970
Should we get something to drink first?

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:54,971
Should we?

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,432
Or we could just walk past them.

20
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,851
- Should we walk past them?
- Casually.

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,896
- What if we went that way?
- Let's go.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,857
- Hey!
- Why would you do that?

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,609
- No way.
- Really?

24
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,861
- Where's my date?
- We're over here.

25
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,404
You're going that way?

26
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,867
Mimi always goofs around.

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,870
She acts silly with directions
like, "I'll go this way."

28
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,455
Like, "I'll go straight."

29
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,707
- Our meeting time was the same.
- Morning.

30
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,876
- Exactly the same.
- What a surprise.

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,753
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,754
Morning.

33
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,089
- The sun's bright.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,548
Hey, um…

35
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,968
- Maho wants to go get coffee.
- Coffee?

36
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,261
Yeah. She said so.

37
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,930
I want coffee too.

38
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,306
Let's go then.

39
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,142
- Are you sleepy?
- No. Not at all.

40
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,311
- I couldn't sleep a wink.
- Really?

41
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,524
We had an early morning today,

42
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,235
so I thought you skipped breakfast.

43
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,695
- I got us food.
- Is that what that was?

44
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,908
You had that in your hands,
so I was thinking about when I should ask.

45
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,076
Really?

46
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,786
Breakfast?

47
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,831
Yeah, I got us breakfast.

48
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,457
- Let's eat on the train.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,460
HOTEL BRICE GARDEN

50
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,795
- Come in.
- Thanks.

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,421
- There's a terrace!
- Yeah.

52
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,716
How elegant.

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,009
I'm having breakfast.

54
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,553
This is so elegant.

55
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,388
- I'm glad to see you.
- Me too.

56
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,682
- I missed you.
- Same here.

57
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,146
- I really wanted to see you.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,819
- Huh?
- Why?

59
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,445
I don't know why.

60
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,322
- What?
- They're crying.

61
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,323
What happened?

62
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,200
- Are they overwhelmed?
- Both of them.

63
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,202
So, the person you're interested in

64
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,954
is the same as before?

65
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,664
- Yeah.
- Okay.

66
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:48,751
I think I have feelings for Kensuke.

67
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,211
Are your emotions stirring?

68
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,923
That's wonderful! I'm happy for you.

69
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,050
I think

70
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,890
that even if Yudai's feelings
move towards you,

71
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,393
that's a wonderful thing.

72
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,146
On the night of Day Four,

73
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,567
he passed me his Wish Letter.

74
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,821
I went cycling with him the next day.

75
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,741
I enjoyed spending time with him.

76
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,326
He's like a friend.

77
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,329
I asked him if we could hold hands.

78
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,790
And?

79
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,626
You can kind of tell, you know?

80
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,045
From his reaction.

81
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,424
I have a feeling he won't fall for me.

82
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,094
We only have a few days left.

83
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,097
I really wish the best for you.

84
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,098
I mean it.

85
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,099
Thanks.

86
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,559
Me too.

87
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,895
You might fall in love with someone.

88
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,858
- You okay?
- Yeah.

89
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,321
I mean…

90
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,699
He's on my mind.

91
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,412
And…

92
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,044
I find myself thinking about him.

93
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,171
I don't know

94
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,883
if what I'm feeling right now is love.

95
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,386
I don't know yet.

96
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,387
But…

97
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,139
I want to see him.

98
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,140
That's lovely.

99
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,103
Yeah.

100
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,284
Wow, this looks delicious.

101
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,244
I've heard about this.

102
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's eat.

103
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,044
Wait.

104
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,921
You can see it here.

105
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,676
I knew it!

106
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,762
I knew it.

107
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,808
Let's eat.

108
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,770
Man.

109
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,025
Let's eat.

110
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,449
This will be on her mind the whole day.

111
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,367
It definitely will be.

112
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:36,878
I'll tell you
about the itinerary for today's trip.

113
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,715
I'm not sure if you've noticed.

114
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,677
- We're going to make a perfume.
- What?!

115
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,971
See? Perfumes.

116
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,183
I love perfumes and scents.

117
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,976
Oh, good!

118
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,853
- Grasse is famous for perfumes?
- Yeah.

119
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,939
- I can smell it the most now.
- You're right.

120
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,483
Yeah, I can smell it too.

121
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,945
- We make our own perfumes?
- Yeah.

122
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,616
- Where do we start?
- Here. Just take a look at this.

123
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,077
These are the details. "Grasse."

124
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,791
"Flowers used in Chanel's iconic perfume,
No. 5, are harvested in this town."

125
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,834
Really? I use No. 5.

126
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,711
Seriously?

127
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,880
- Wow! Is that true?
- Look.

128
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,548
Here. See?

129
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,844
"World-renowned brands like Christian Dior
also own their own flower fields,

130
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,014
making this town famous
as the 'town of perfume.'"

131
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,309
Incredible, huh?

132
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,686
- I love perfumes.
- This is the itinerary.

133
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,107
I wonder what they're doing.

134
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,694
Wait, no.
You're making yourself sad. Stop it.

135
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,780
No. I don't like this.

136
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,615
No!

137
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,621
So cute. She's fretting by herself.

138
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,915
- She should have a chat with Aru now.
- True.

139
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,835
I'll prepare for Day Nine.

140
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,755
Yes. I'll give him a present

141
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,842
and tell him my feelings.

142
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,638
I'll do my best for that.

143
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,474
This is amazing.

144
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,351
- It's astonishing.
- Yeah.

145
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,480
- Over there.
- Just look at that!

146
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,899
We don't have that kind of stuff.

147
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,527
I love these stairs.
I'm in love with everything!

148
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,448
CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE-DAME DU PUY

149
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,244
This is amazing.

150
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,871
Yeah.

151
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,332
This is really amazing.

152
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,381
- They first met at a church.
- Yeah.

153
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,466
Jeez, Maho.

154
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,092
Maho is doing great!

155
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,052
We've never watched Maho for this long.

156
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,890
MENTON: 30 MINUTES ON TRAIN FROM NICE

157
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,851
THE WARMEST CITY IN FRANCE,
KNOWN AS THE CITY OF LEMONS

158
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,145
I like this town's atmosphere.

159
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,772
It's different from Nice.

160
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,318
I still don't get Menton.

161
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,531
The town over on that side
looks beautiful.

162
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,449
Yeah.

163
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,700
Are you okay?

164
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,160
You know,

165
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,372
I was pretty drunk
when I met you yesterday.

166
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,290
Yeah.

167
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,711
I think I talked a lot
even though I said I was nervous.

168
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,004
Are you nervous now?

169
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,672
Is that what this is?

170
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,092
MARKET OF THE HALLES OF MENTON

171
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,846
Wow.

172
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,723
Are these breads?

173
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,310
They have lots of meat.

174
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,479
Look at these tomatoes.

175
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,482
I wanna eat those.
I think it says "escargot."

176
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,776
- Let's eat escargot.
- Wow.

177
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,445
We'll get some bread, and we're set.

178
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,613
Okay.

179
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,031
- Merci.
- Merci.

180
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,159
- Goodbye. Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day. Goodbye.

181
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,496
Wait. These bags are so cute.

182
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,958
It would be cool
if I carried a baguette in this.

183
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,752
Merci beaucoup. Have a nice day.

184
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,128
- Merci.
- Merci beaucoup.

185
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,006
- It sticks out nicely.
- Wow. It does.

186
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,883
Have a nice day.

187
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,969
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

188
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,388
I'm looking for

189
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,558
body cream or hand cream.

190
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,809
Yes, sure.

191
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,644
I'd like you to try our bestseller.

192
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,063
We are a French brand from Marseilles.

193
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,733
- It's orange blossom.
- Orange?

194
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,068
Orange. Yes.

195
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,155
I'll take this one.

196
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,076
- Do you have a present box?
- Yes, sure.

197
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,954
- It's a present?
- Yes, present.

198
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,789
Maybe your girlfriend?

199
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,083
Girlfriend. Yes.

200
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,168
Yay.

201
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,922
- Let's eat!
- Let's eat.

202
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:55,595
So today, I got to meet you again
while sober this time.

203
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,179
At the station,

204
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,765
I got so nervous that I was telling Yudai,

205
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,811
"Oh gosh, I'm really nervous right now."

206
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,479
I thought you were a bit down.

207
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,107
- I thought you were unwell.
- I'm great.

208
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,651
- I'm really happy to see you.
- Yeah.

209
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,613
Your mood doesn't change much, does it?

210
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,448
Huh?

211
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,782
Your mood.

212
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,369
When I'm happy, I'm all like, "Whee!"

213
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,412
I'm not like that.

214
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,872
- No, right?
- No.

215
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,373
Do I talk too much?

216
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,336
I thought you were the one that was down.

217
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,713
- What? I'm all good.
- This morning.

218
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,381
I'm super good.

219
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
- Really?
- Yeah.

220
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,967
As you can see.

221
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,595
The Mimi I know so far

222
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,473
would excitedly go, "Good morning!"

223
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,724
That's not it.

224
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,559
The thing is,

225
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,394
Maho said she wanted to get coffee.

226
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,983
She said she wanted to
give Yudai coffee when she met him.

227
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,863
- That's what it was?
- So we thought we'd go buy coffee first.

228
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,323
- I didn't get that.
- Yeah.

229
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:01,035
But then, our eyes met.
So I thought, "What should I do now?"

230
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:05,122
That's why we came over.
It would be strange to go the other way.

231
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,541
- I see.
- Yeah.

232
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,171
I thought you weren't making
eye contact with me.

233
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,006
That's not it.

234
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,466
That's what this was about?

235
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,260
I see. It's nothing like that.

236
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,596
- It wasn't like that.
- Okay.

237
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,514
Yeah.

238
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,227
Aru didn't get the joke.

239
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,561
No, he didn't.

240
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,604
Whoa.

241
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,272
Really?

242
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,609
Hey there.

243
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,195
- Morning.
- Morning. Did you wait?

244
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,363
- No.
- You're early.

245
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,656
I waited for you today.

246
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,741
It's here, right?

247
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,701
- Here.
- Wow.

248
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,285
We have the terrace seat.

249
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,330
I wanna ask you something.

250
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,833
- I've been calling you "Kanaka-<i>san</i>."
- Yeah.

251
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,418
But can I call you Kanaka?

252
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,378
I want you to call me that way.

253
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,130
- You do?
- Yeah.

254
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:59,135
- Adding "<i>san</i>" to your name felt awkward.
- I was thinking about when to bring it up.

255
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,177
Oh, really?

256
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,888
I definitely want you to call me that way.

257
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,356
- It's Day Seven. How are things going?
- It's Day Seven.

258
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,899
Hmm.

259
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,279
I'm sure you've had dates
with other girls too.

260
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,032
Have you narrowed down your choices?

261
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,411
Well, yeah. It's Day Seven after all.

262
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,454
Yeah.

263
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,706
I guess I've narrowed my choices down.

264
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,964
Huh?

265
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,054
Dear Nanami,

266
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,975
Please come to Garibaldi Square
at 5:00 p.m. on Day Seven or Day Eight.

267
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,477
I want to see you again.

268
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,394
From Yudai

269
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,062
Wow.

270
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,063
Whoa.

271
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,107
- What will she think?
- Yeah.

272
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,621
To be honest,

273
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:13,667
I've never gone on a date

274
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,837
with someone younger than me.

275
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

276
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
I was thinking about

277
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:25,596
how I should go about
dating a younger guy.

278
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,014
- Really?
- Yeah.

279
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,142
Last time, on the day we first met,

280
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,686
it was when we had dinner.

281
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,563
I thought you smelled nice.

282
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,859
So, I thought maybe you liked perfume.

283
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,071
And I had fun with you.

284
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,115
That's why I gave you my Wish Letter.

285
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,242
Thank you.

286
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,701
That was a great deduction.

287
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,495
- Great deduction?
- Yeah.

288
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,457
What kind of girls
have you dated until now?

289
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,378
Like, were they older or younger?

290
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,129
I've never dated anyone younger.

291
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,173
So, it's always been older women?

292
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,636
- I feel more relaxed around older women.
- Really?

293
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,179
I used to play sports.

294
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm used to the strict age hierarchy.

295
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,851
You are?

296
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,229
Yeah. I played soccer for about 12 years.

297
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,898
You played soccer, huh?

298
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,985
I played tennis for over ten years.

299
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,403
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

300
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,071
Why did you start tennis?

301
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,073
My older sister played tennis.

302
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,742
So I started taking lessons too.

303
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,037
And my younger sister
started taking lessons as well.

304
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,622
- You have two sisters?
- Yeah.

305
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,960
I played tennis a lot until high school.

306
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,796
- Me too. Up until high school.
- Really?

307
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,923
I played soccer a lot.

308
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,217
I was a soccer kid.

309
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,260
Really?

310
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,220
That's so interesting.

311
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,099
Dear Yudai,

312
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,101
I don't know what time I'll be…

313
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,818
I don't know what time
I'll be free on Day Eight.

314
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,487
"I'd like you to wait for me at Margaux."

315
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,291
It's Day Seven.

316
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,626
Day Seven has started.

317
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,294
- Yes, it has.
- Yeah.

318
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,880
<i>Two dates are ongoing today.</i>

319
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,050
Aru thought Mimi's obvious joke was real.

320
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:26,967
He fell for it.

321
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,387
When Mimi said, "We'll go that way,"
Yudai was like, "Hey!"

322
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,973
- Aru took it seriously.
- He thought she was down.

323
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,727
- And Tohko and Nanami had a chat.
- Yeah. They were crying.

324
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,145
- They were crying.
- Yeah.

325
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,940
<i>I thought it was cute,</i>
<i>but I wonder how she felt.</i>

326
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,026
Nanami still doesn't know what love is.

327
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,444
She organized her thoughts.

328
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:49,448
You need to put it into words
to get your feelings across, right?

329
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,658
You say it with words.

330
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,827
She cried as she said,
"I have feelings for Kensuke."

331
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,165
- Maybe her emotional cup just overflowed.
- I agree.

332
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,836
When she expressed her feelings
with her own voice,

333
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,715
maybe the words suddenly
spun back at her, and that startled her.

334
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,550
I think that could happen.

335
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,802
I get it.

336
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,472
I once started crying
as I was telling a ghost story.

337
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,390
What the hell?

338
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,767
Why would you do that?

339
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,103
- My emotional cup overflowed.
- What?

340
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,062
Filled with fear.

341
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,480
- Fear filled it up?
- Yeah.

342
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,190
You need to empty it first.

343
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,609
Maho and Yudai are getting along.

344
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>It's nice that their hobbies</i>
<i>and sensibilities match.</i>

345
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,534
I never said this, but I like Maho.

346
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,286
I'm sorry. I really like her.

347
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,413
She's your fave?

348
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,081
- You like Maho?
- I do!

349
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,833
Her Kansai dialect is nice.

350
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,336
I actually like everything about her.

351
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,672
- Her expressions are nice too.
- I like them.

352
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,090
Should I head to Nice now?

353
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,259
She's probably not there anymore.

354
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,677
I'll look for her on a bike.

355
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,030
- Don't…
- Good morning.

356
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:11,947
Don't run.

357
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,991
- Thanks.
- Morning.

358
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,243
- Morning.
- Morning.

359
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,121
- Time for ramen.
- Yes! I couldn't wait.

360
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,789
- It's in Japanese.
- Wow.

361
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,332
I haven't seen it in a while.

362
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,834
Spicy miso ramen.

363
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,461
Two of that.

364
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,378
- Two.
- Two.

365
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,173
One large pork ramen.

366
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,174
- This one.
- Duck?

367
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,592
- Duck.
- Spicy miso duck ramen?

368
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,969
One regular spicy miso duck ramen.

369
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,679
- And gyoza.
- Gyoza?

370
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,638
Gyoza.

371
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,223
- That's it?
- Yes.

372
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,601
- We don't have our phones.
- Right.

373
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,853
So I didn't know if you would come.

374
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,979
It's scary.

375
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,398
- I'm still scared.
- You're still scared?

376
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,733
I was afraid too.

377
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,443
- About if I'd be here?
- Yeah.

378
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,320
Let's eat.

379
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,946
Wow.

380
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,453
Wow. This is so Japan.

381
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,082
This is delicious.

382
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,211
- This would taste delicious in Japan too.
- It's really tasty.

383
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,631
- Do you watch comedy?
- Yeah.

384
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,715
- You do?
- Yeah.

385
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,841
The radio too.

386
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,927
- You listen to the radio?
- Yeah.

387
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,845
- Hosted by comedians? Really?
- Yeah.

388
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,141
- Please come watch when we're in Japan.
- I will!

389
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,810
I was thinking the same.

390
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,105
Is your schedule packed when you get back?

391
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,483
- I don't know. I can't check right now.
- Oh, right.

392
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,361
We only know each other
in this environment.

393
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,031
Yeah. I think that's kind of nice too.

394
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,660
Yeah. We don’t know
each other's job titles or anything.

395
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,287
- We can only judge based on the person.
- Yeah.

396
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:46,667
You would've looked them up
and found out what they like.

397
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,336
- You'd feel like you know that person.
- Yeah.

398
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,589
- You don't know until you talk to them.
- Right.

399
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,507
Yeah.

400
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,760
You have no idea
what kind of sketches I do.

401
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,512
- Right?
- I have no idea.

402
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,223
- You'd never guess what I usually do.
- Really?

403
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,059
- But I do catch glimpses of it sometimes.
- You do?

404
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,318
Wow! I wanna eat lemons.

405
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,820
You probably will.

406
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,238
Really?

407
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,365
Well, we're at a lemon farm.

408
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,200
What do you think we're here for?

409
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,743
Lemon pies and lemon juice!

410
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,162
Bonjour!

411
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,666
She's the best.
"Lemon pies and lemon juice. Bonjour!"

412
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,543
She's so cheerful.

413
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,753
Welcome to Maison Gannac.

414
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,630
- Thank you!
- Hello.

415
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,798
- Hello.
- Hello.

416
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,467
- Perfect.
- Welcome to Maison Gannac.

417
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,137
Merci.

418
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,014
I am Adrien Gannac.

419
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,224
In the family, I am the son.

420
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,560
- Papa? Are you here?
- Papa.

421
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,896
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

422
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,522
My father, Laurent Gannac.

423
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,066
I was in Japan five years ago.

424
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,359
In Osaka.

425
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,986
- Osaka?
- Yes.

426
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,988
Hankyu French Trade Fair.

427
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,574
And I sold the products.

428
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,576
I learned a sentence in Japanese.

429
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,078
"I am a lemon farmer."

430
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,373
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

431
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,795
Very good.

432
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,713
Okay?

433
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,842
Yay!

434
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,968
Very nice one.

435
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,520
You taste like that.
With the skin and the pulp.

436
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,773
- All of it.
- Wow!

437
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,608
All? Wow!

438
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,653
Merci.

439
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,533
Okay.

440
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,335
Yum.

441
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,854
- He's tired!
- What?

442
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,523
- What happened?
- No!

443
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,150
- What a waste of a Wish Letter.
- He's wasting it.

444
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,069
- Enjoy yourself more!
- What's wrong?

445
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,445
Mimi's not there.

446
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,780
He's not even with Mimi.

447
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,163
- We're here! The main event of the day!
- This is it.

448
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,790
- Main!
- Event!

449
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,501
- It's perfume.
- I'm so excited.

450
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,086
I wonder what this is.

451
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,464
- What is it?
- Is it a filter?

452
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,216
To filter flowers and stuff.

453
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,552
Hurry. Let's go.

454
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,345
- Yeah, let's hurry.
- Let's go in.

455
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,310
Oh, wow.

456
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,146
I am stoked.

457
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,606
Wow.

458
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,067
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

459
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,194
Welcome to the Galimard workshop.

460
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,615
You are sitting in front of
furniture that we call an "organ."

461
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,034
Just like a musician.

462
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,245
And on your organ,
you have all your notes.

463
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,998
So, this is what we call a "note."

464
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,708
- This is a top note.
- Top note.

465
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,376
And this is a heart note.

466
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,962
- This is a base note.
- Base note.

467
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:23,342
The top note of your perfume
is the part that you will smell first.

468
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,137
It's really the first impression
when you spray a perfume on your skin.

469
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:32,017
Among your top notes,
you can choose between the citrus fruits.

470
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,518
After half an hour,

471
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,563
this part will slowly evaporate.

472
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,231
It will go up in the air.

473
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:42,486
And then you will smell later better
the heart of the perfume that is here.

474
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,863
So those are your heart notes.

475
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:49,201
You have roses, jasmine, violet, gardenia…

476
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,577
Many different notes.

477
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,039
This part is what we call
the base of the perfume.

478
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,625
This is very intense and very heavy.

479
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,878
It's where you have
mostly the woody ingredients.

480
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,755
Sandalwood and cedarwood.

481
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,717
And we are going to find first
all of your base notes.

482
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,387
- We are going to use four.
- Four.

483
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,015
Those four base notes
will give us half of the perfume.

484
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,143
Once we have smelled
the perfume with the paper strip,

485
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,563
we can continue with the second part
with the heart, and then the top.

486
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,689
- Okay?
- Okay.

487
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,441
I'm definitely going there one day.

488
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,610
- I wanna go too.
- This is great.

489
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,698
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

490
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,367
Is this it?

491
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,244
It's here.

492
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,161
Wow.

493
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,333
- She said she wanted to buy a present.
- Yeah.

494
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,085
- For Yudai.
- Yes.

495
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,253
Wow.

496
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,713
Bonjour.

497
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,301
These are lovely.

498
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,471
What should I give to a boy?

499
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,890
What should I do?

500
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,934
So cute.

501
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,519
I'll get this one.

502
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:58,979
Gift.

503
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,814
Okay. As a gift. This one?

504
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,731
- Yes.
- Okay.

505
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,735
- So, this is wool. Okay?
- Okay.

506
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,362
- With the pom-pom.
- Pom-pom.

507
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,364
- Pom-pom. Okay?
- Merci.

508
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,033
We were based in Nice.

509
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,704
So it might be nice to make
a perfume based on the ocean.

510
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,955
- That's true.
- Right?

511
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,958
- This looks so fun.
- What a beautiful thing to say.

512
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,043
I want to smell the chocolate one.

513
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,921
- I was thinking the same thing.
- It's chocolate.

514
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,424
So sweet!

515
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,552
This is so much fun.

516
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,596
Hello.

517
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,681
- Hello.
- Is everything okay?

518
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,725
Yes. You speak Japanese?

519
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,893
What do you do here?

520
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,062
I work as a perfumer here.

521
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,272
- What?
- What?

522
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,733
- Then…
- That is so special.

523
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,359
We should get him to make one.

524
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,986
- That's true.
- Oh, no.

525
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,405
Your mood and emotions of the day

526
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,658
influence the scent directly.

527
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,161
How did he become a perfumer?

528
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,122
That is so cool. A perfumer.

529
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,249
I think this is number two.

530
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,462
How's this one?

531
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,172
So sweet!

532
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,883
I think I like this.

533
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,594
- This is nice.
- This cocktail is nice too.

534
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,763
It's a nice cocktail.

535
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,352
- Wait.
- I really can't decide.

536
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,231
I think I got everything.

537
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,191
Okay? Yes.

538
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,901
- Ready? Go.
- Ready? Go.

539
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,950
- It's the ocean.
- This is great.

540
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,869
It's the ocean. It's refreshing.

541
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,288
Here.

542
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,419
- I like this.
- The one and only.

543
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:50,006
- My own perfume!
- We made our own perfumes!

544
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,883
Yay!

545
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,556
What name would you give it?

546
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,101
I want to get the Japanese name
translated into French.

547
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,978
- Yes. We can do that.
- That's nice.

548
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,772
We will print the name on the label.

549
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,148
- Like that?
- Yes.

550
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,196
You all right?

551
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,992
Hey! Are you doing all right?

552
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,869
- What was that?
- You don't look all right.

553
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,955
- What's wrong?
- Well…

554
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,957
What's up?

555
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,086
- Did you have fun yesterday?
- Yesterday?

556
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,088
- I did.
- It was fun, right?

557
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,424
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

558
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,594
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

559
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,554
You know yourself the best.

560
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,723
It's just…

561
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,311
Since this morning,

562
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,648
I feel like our eyes aren't meeting.

563
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,525
Is it just me?

564
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,027
- Yeah.
- Is it?

565
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,445
What's wrong?

566
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,404
Is that all?

567
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,323
No, right?

568
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,118
- I don't know.
- There must be something going on.

569
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,161
You look depressed.

570
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,122
When we were picking lemons,

571
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,666
I felt like I was doing it alone.

572
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,004
Well, I guess it's just…

573
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,925
I feel like our eyes aren't meeting,
or you're looking down.

574
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,261
- I'm not.
- You're not?

575
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,681
Okay.

576
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,934
You're not.

577
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,230
Was that on your mind the whole time?

578
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,273
Yeah.

579
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,902
I said, "Let's make it the best day."

580
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,198
- I am having fun.
- But even after I said all that…

581
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:44,537
I'm like, "What do I do if the date
keeps continuing with this vibe?"

582
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,625
- I'm kind of feeling lost.
- Okay.

583
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,878
- Sorry. I'm the one that asked you out.
- It's okay.

584
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,922
I thought you were worried about

585
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,091
what happened this morning with Maho.

586
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:00,595
I thought maybe
I made you feel down with that.

587
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,100
I didn't mean to make you feel that way,
but I thought I might have upset you.

588
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,434
Yeah.

589
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,437
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

590
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,523
It's not you.

591
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,778
Why am I overthinking so much?

592
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,240
It's because you like me.

593
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,908
That's why.

594
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,536
Did I say too much?

595
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,873
Well, I did ask you out
because I have feelings for you.

596
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,291
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

597
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,296
No. I got it.

598
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,842
It's not that our eyes aren't meeting.
You're just avoiding me.

599
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,844
It's you. Is it not like that?

600
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:46,057
I'm looking at you.
But you keep facing down when you talk.

601
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,518
It's not like that when you look at me.

602
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,149
I see. I'm sorry.

603
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,316
Are you having fun?

604
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,776
I want to have fun.

605
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,611
Let's enjoy ourselves!

606
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,364
That's what dates are for.

607
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,285
Do you want to have a date with me?

608
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,371
- I do.
- Let's have fun then.

609
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:14,377
Do you also want to have a date with me?

610
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,545
- I do.
- Okay.

611
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,132
- Then…
- Let's enjoy ourselves. We're in Menton.

612
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,886
Let's do that.

613
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,265
Wow!

614
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,018
I'm scared!

615
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,646
Wait! This is scary!

616
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,982
- This is awesome!
- Wow!

617
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,650
We're so high up!

618
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,486
This is amazing!

619
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,738
- Try looking down!
- I can't!

620
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,201
- I can't look down.
- This is so much fun!

621
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,119
- Wow.
- This is awesome!

622
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,872
This looks super fun!

623
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,916
- Yeah.
- This must be fun.

624
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,083
It looks scary too.

625
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,294
Thank you for waiting.

626
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,380
It's here!

627
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,219
Here. <i>L'amereuse.</i>

628
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,887
- Yes. That's mine.
- Wow.

629
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,597
- Here.
- It's beautiful.

630
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,935
- Nice. The gold one was a good choice.
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

631
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,102
Wow.

632
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,646
<i>Solstice d'été.</i>

633
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,022
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

634
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,482
- Here.
- This looks nice.

635
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:22,278
There's a number for the formula here.

636
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:26,074
We use that number
to keep track of your formulas here.

637
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:30,370
If you like the scent,
you can order it again.

638
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,205
- We'll ship it to Japan.
- Wonderful.

639
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,332
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

640
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,709
- Wow!
- Wow!

641
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,711
What does it say here?

642
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,755
- <i>Été? </i>Summer?
- Here? Yeah.

643
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,424
It has a sweet scent
and it's refreshing too.

644
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:48,680
I wanted to make it into a perfume
that's perfect for the arrival of summer.

645
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,391
- So, this is "summer."
- Right. Summer.

646
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,477
And this is a word
that's used when summer arrives.

647
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,937
- I see.
- Yeah.

648
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,981
<i>"Solstice d'été."</i>

649
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,860
This one means "The Sea of Love."

650
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,700
It sprays out a lot.

651
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,285
Do I need to press it hard?

652
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,786
- It'll spray a lot.
- Really?

653
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,121
- Wow.
- That's difficult.

654
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,622
It smells great!

655
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,002
- Oh!
- Nice, right?

656
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,420
- That's love.
- How's yours?

657
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,755
It smells fresh.

658
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,841
So fresh!

659
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,597
Man, this was way too nice.

660
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,640
So many types of dates.

661
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,602
- I like the perfume date.
- A variety of dates.

662
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,606
<i>This one seemed the most spot-on</i>
<i>out of all the Wish Letters.</i>

663
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,691
It matched with their interests perfectly.

664
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:46,529
I really like the vibe between the two.
They were like, "The sea of love."

665
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,866
- Yeah. They were laughing so happily.
- So happily, right?

666
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,369
<i>Aru said he felt like Mimi</i>
<i>wasn't making eye contact with him.</i>

667
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,580
Did he want her to say,
"It's not like that"?

668
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,206
- Oh!
- I think so.

669
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,625
Like he wants attention?

670
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,126
He did seem that way.

671
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,085
I see.

672
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,130
Mimi handled that situation perfectly.

673
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,507
- Mimi was admirable.
- I agree.

674
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,343
She said, "It's because you like me."

675
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,304
But Aru didn't react, so she was like,
"Did I say too much?"

676
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,139
She's great with the details.

677
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,684
Mimi looks like
she would be self-centered.

678
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,812
But she’s considerate to everyone,

679
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,565
and she's good at conversing.

680
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,151
- Even with girls.
- That's right.

681
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,986
<i>Kensuke and Nanami ate ramen.</i>

682
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,905
<i>Right! They said it tasted good.</i>

683
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,114
<i>Good for them.</i>

684
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,617
- They looked cute.
- They did.

685
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,411
It was after Nanami admitted
she had feelings for Kensuke.

686
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,329
Yes.

687
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,706
<i>- Even her sprint felt different.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

688
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,625
Kensuke needs to notice.

689
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,418
- That look in her eyes.
- Right.

690
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,295
- Did you notice, Kensuke?
- Did he?

691
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,423
- He asked her to his performance.
- That was really something!

692
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,717
You've got guts to be able to say that.

693
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,262
Comedians usually wouldn't want them
to see their performances.

694
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,182
And it's not like Kensuke is, you know,

695
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,768
appearing on television a lot,

696
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,646
or has performed on big stages yet.

697
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,191
- So it's amazing that he said that.
- That's so cute.

698
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,569
I actually checked out
a sketch that Kensuke did.

699
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,697
You checked out Kensuke's sketch comedy?

700
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,366
The joke was that
a male idol had his fly open

701
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,326
and his private parts got exposed.

702
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,869
What the hell, Kensuke?

703
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,914
Don't invite Nanami!

704
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,594
- Merci.
- Merci.

705
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,471
Yay.

706
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,515
- Wow. Look.
- Wow!

707
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,144
- Wow! This is amazing.
- So cool.

708
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,270
Up we go.

709
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,148
Look here. We still have a long way to go.

710
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,191
This way, please.

711
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,028
Here. Take a look.

712
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,779
- Wow!
- A beautiful ocean!

713
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,574
Try not to let your jaws drop
from how amazing it is, okay?

714
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,367
I admire her for trying so hard.

715
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,327
She's going all out to cheer him up.

716
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,664
Rock, paper, scissors.

717
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,708
Rock, paper, scissors.

718
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,711
Six steps for paper.

719
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,131
- Rock, paper…
- Rock, paper, scissors.

720
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,674
Rock, paper, scissors.

721
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,343
Six steps for paper.

722
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,846
Rock, paper, scissors.

723
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,806
Three steps for rock.

724
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

725
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,728
- Seriously?
- I win!

726
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,979
I didn't climb one step.

727
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,314
Winner!

728
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,776
I've never seen a shutout in that game.

729
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,861
My first time seeing a shutout.

730
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,280
She did a twirl after her victory.

731
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:39,202
HOTEL NICE RIVIERA

732
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,180
- He should show this side more.
- Yeah.

733
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,933
- Why doesn't he show this to the girls?
- He looks really cool.

734
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,392
He's on a different mode.

735
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,312
He wants to experience
a romance he wouldn't get in Japan.

736
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,480
- Yeah.
- True.

737
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,733
Menton products!

738
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,486
I definitely want this one.

739
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,947
Yeah. That is so you.

740
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,450
- This one is Menton. They have Èze too.
- Yeah.

741
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,618
This is Nice.

742
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,702
What are these?

743
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,830
They look like names.

744
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,540
- The letter M?
- M?

745
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,084
M?

746
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,627
They don't have an M.

747
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,129
I don't think they have it.

748
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,924
- A notepad of Menton.
- Wow.

749
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,384
That's cute.

750
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,553
Five fifty, please.

751
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,762
Card okay?

752
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,974
Um, can I have it?

753
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,143
- M?
- Yes.

754
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,811
Thank you. Merci.

755
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,523
- This looks like a scene from a movie.
- The openness, right?

756
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,945
Try walking as though
you're shooting a film.

757
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,282
Like that?

758
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,161
Follow me!

759
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,330
- She's always up for anything.
- Yeah.

760
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,665
I like her more and more.

761
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,083
She's the best.

762
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,211
- That was great.
- I made a great purchase!

763
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,713
They looked great on you.

764
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,590
When should I wear them?

765
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,050
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

766
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,969
- We only have a few days.
- Yeah.

767
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:20,887
What time is it?

768
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,264
- Oh.
- It's this late already.

769
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,266
I'll go now.

770
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,438
I'm meeting up with Tohko and Nanami.

771
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,315
I wanna go somewhere too.

772
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,358
Which way is it? I'm heading this way.

773
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,276
This way?

774
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,445
- I'm going this way.
- That way?

775
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,405
Okay. See you.

776
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,615
- This was fun.
- Thanks.

777
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,784
- The name was…
- Wait.

778
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,620
Watch out.

779
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,622
The name was…

780
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,208
It was…

781
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,131
- "Ma Laverie Shop Assalit Jean Médecin."
- The one with the really long name, right?

782
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,591
- Yeah.
- It's this one.

783
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,802
- It's this one!
- We're here.

784
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,473
I can finally wash my clothes.

785
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,350
- It smells like a laundromat.
- Yeah.

786
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,809
Did you bring lots to wash?

787
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,104
Um, this much.

788
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,814
Okay.

789
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,900
He shouldn't ask that.

790
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,194
- He shouldn't ask such a thing.
- That idiot.

791
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,570
So funny.

792
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,614
Don't ask that. She might have underwear.

793
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,157
He's so endearing.

794
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,285
- The laundromat's nice.
- Yeah.

795
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,080
There's this shop called Evrlst.

796
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,833
They sell records.
I really want to go there.

797
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,627
That sounds nice.

798
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,004
We really don't have as much time

799
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,298
as I thought.

800
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,175
- That's right.
- Yeah.

801
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,218
We have today.

802
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,428
And yours is tomorrow, right?

803
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,430
- Your Wish Letter?
- Yeah.

804
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,182
- Then tomorrow's gone.
- Yeah.

805
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,433
The day after tomorrow.

806
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,603
- That's Day Nine.
- Day Nine.

807
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,147
- Then, it's Day Ten.
- We don't know about Day Ten.

808
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,441
I'm at a total loss.

809
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,694
Let's go while we can.

810
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,820
Yeah.

811
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,906
Kensuke speaks without thinking.

812
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,575
He doesn't think
she wants to give it to him.

813
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,702
No, he doesn't.

814
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,580
- Making perfume was so much fun.
- It was great.

815
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,208
We'll wear it in Japan.

816
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,086
And when people ask us,
"What scent is this?"

817
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,463
- We can say, "I made it."
- Awesome!

818
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,299
"It's called 'Arrival of Summer.'"

819
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,842
That's awesome!

820
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,723
Oh, wow.

821
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,933
This is stunning.

822
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:34,103
- So, here…
- Yeah?

823
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,356
There might be fields of flowers
for Chanel and Christian Dior.

824
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,191
- For their perfumes.
- Wow.

825
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,652
What should we do after this?

826
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,738
- After this?
- Yeah.

827
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,656
After this…

828
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,700
Well,

829
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,703
I actually have plans, sort of.

830
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,331
I need to go somewhere.

831
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,248
Okay.

832
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,584
After we go back,

833
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,628
I intend to go there.

834
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,671
But then,

835
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,341
I sent the letter one-sidedly.

836
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,677
- I don't know if she's seen the letter.
- I see.

837
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,972
But I was the one that sent the letter.

838
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,850
- I think I should go.
- I see.

839
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,855
Do you have to?

840
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,361
Yeah. Well…

841
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,283
It's someone I really want to see.

842
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,204
I made this decision yesterday,

843
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,374
so I think I should go.

844
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,167
Okay.

845
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,880
I don't know if she'll come though.

846
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,637
Um…

847
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:52,932
Here.

848
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,394
This is…

849
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,728
Here.

850
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,814
Èze.

851
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,649
Thank you so much!

852
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,029
Hey!

853
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,323
- Èze?
- Yeah.

854
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,699
- Really?
- Yeah.

855
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,159
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

856
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,620
Thank you so much!

857
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,288
- You can sit.
- Sorry.

858
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,833
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

859
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,543
- Yay.
- Yeah.

860
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,753
I'm relieved.

861
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,630
I'm so happy.

862
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,298
I gave it to you.

863
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,593
- Do you know Èze?
- No. I don't know.

864
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,719
But it's like,

865
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,596
I'd like to go there once.

866
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,889
I see.

867
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,891
We'll go to a restaurant there.

868
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,311
You need to dress up a little.

869
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,438
There's a dress code?

870
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,523
Then… I see.

871
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,067
I get to be with you tomorrow too.

872
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,114
What's with that face?

873
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,449
I'm happy.

874
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,415
I don't wanna go back yet.

875
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,006
I want to talk more.

876
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,053
You can't?

877
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,057
I gave it a lot of thought.

878
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,271
And made my decision.

879
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,691
So, after this…

880
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,987
I can't spend time with you.

881
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,616
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

882
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,454
I see.

883
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,667
Do you have plans tomorrow?

884
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,586
I'm free

885
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,588
until four o'clock.

886
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,131
After that,

887
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,008
I'm not so sure yet.

888
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,927
Oh, okay.

889
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,679
I'm free until four o'clock.

890
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,890
Right.

891
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,391
Okay.

892
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,185
How about lunch?

893
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,145
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

894
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,898
Okay. Where should we meet?

895
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,567
There's this place I want to go to.

896
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,612
This one.

897
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,073
- It's around this area.
- Okay.

898
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,993
So how about we meet here
at around 12:00 p.m.?

899
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,828
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

900
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,122
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

901
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,254
Did you hesitate in choosing your date?

902
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,382
I didn't hesitate.

903
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,967
- You didn't?
- No.

904
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,975
I'm glad to hear that.

905
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,356
- Is it stuck?
- No.

906
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,274
All good?

907
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:49,900
Okay.

908
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,444
- Don't look so much.
- Sorry.

909
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,988
- Just a second.
- Sorry.

910
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,531
Don't look so much.

911
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,074
Don't do that.

912
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,660
- Why did he look?
- Yeah, why?

913
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,995
So cute.

914
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,414
Dear Yudai,
I look forward to parachuting on Day Nine.

915
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,670
Hmm.

916
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,757
Thank you for yesterday.

917
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,427
I look forward to parachuting on Day Nine.

918
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,220
I got a lemon soap at a perfumery.

919
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,979
It fell in!

920
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:35,279
Oh, no. It fell in.

921
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,197
It fell inside!

922
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,742
Oh, well.

923
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,660
It's fine.

924
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,455
It's a gift.

925
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,374
- She's so cute when she's by herself.
- Cute.

926
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,336
She's never given gifts to a boy.

927
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,338
Wow, this is amazing.

928
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,214
Is that Italy over there?

929
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,550
- Where does Italy start?
- It's hard to tell.

930
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,720
Would we know when we enter Italy?
Like, "This is Italy."

931
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,305
We might be in Italy already.

932
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,348
What? Already?

933
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,933
- But wait.
- Where does it start?

934
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,352
What? I don't know.

935
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,270
This looks like a gate.

936
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,482
- Here?
- Maybe it's here.

937
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,566
It's a gate.

938
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,944
Wait, look.

939
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,530
- Is it this?
- I don't know. Isn't it over there?

940
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,616
Here? Maybe it's here.

941
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,038
It's like we've crossed
the border multiple times.

942
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,917
- Wow, it's here!
- What?

943
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,835
- Look.
- Where? Oh!

944
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,129
Are you in France?

945
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,923
- Yeah.
- Then I'm in Italy.

946
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,341
- Okay.
- Okay?

947
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:38,801
Here.

948
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,930
Yay! We found it!

949
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,349
I'm in Italy.

950
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,353
Yay!

951
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,606
Mimi's the best.

952
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,400
- Mimi's fantastic.
- Yeah.

953
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,317
Thank you, Mimi.

954
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:59,780
I never imagined I would see
a shutout game of rock, paper, scissors.

955
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,156
That never happens.

956
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,703
After she beat Aru,
she improvised a little twirl on the spot.

957
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,912
<i>- Amazing.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

958
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,872
<i>- She's amazing.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

959
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,916
Nanami and Kensuke look good together.

960
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,127
- So cute.
- They both look happy.

961
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,922
It was endearing how he got so excited
after receiving the Wish Letter.

962
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,925
<i>It was funny seeing him</i>
<i>think he wouldn't receive it.</i>

963
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:20,884
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

964
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,262
He was like, "Tomorrow's gone."

965
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,888
She's gonna give you the letter.

966
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,891
She's gonna spend time with you.

967
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,102
- So adorable.
- I wanna dote on him.

968
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,311
Oh, Kensuke.

969
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,147
I'll use all my money on him.

970
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,942
- You shouldn't.
- I'll use my entire fortune.

971
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,987
- Kensuke will jump for joy.
- He's so adorable.

972
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,157
But it was Maho and Yudai that hit me.

973
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,033
- Yeah.
- Right?

974
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,078
<i>I'm at my highest now.</i>

975
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,037
"Do you have to?"

976
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,622
"I don't wanna go back yet."

977
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,999
"I want to talk more."

978
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:52,916
"You can't?"

979
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,502
- These four phrases.
- Yeah.

980
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,837
I loved it.

981
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,882
It's just that you like Maho.

982
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,885
- It's because you like Maho.
- I loved it.

983
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,430
The tone of her voice was really nice.

984
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,057
It wasn't like she was being clingy.

985
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,436
Yudai is very diligent.

986
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,439
<i>He said Day Seven or Day Eight.</i>

987
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,901
<i>But he was asked out with the Wish Letter</i>
<i>after he sent that letter.</i>

988
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,446
His date is over
because they finished making the perfume,

989
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,740
but he could have given up
on seeing Nanami today.

990
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,492
- Right?
- Yeah.

991
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,369
And Maho asked him out
with the Wish Letter.

992
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,997
Shouldn't he stay with her
for the whole day?

993
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,376
- Huh?
- I thought Wish Letters were binding.

994
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,419
Hey, old man.

995
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,338
- Calm down.
- He can't turn her down.

996
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,798
It's not like that.

997
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,926
He can't do that.
Maho doesn't want to go back yet.

998
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,511
You're a geezer causing a ruckus.

999
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,179
He can't do that!

1000
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,434
Nanami must have seen on the map
that Yudai is away today.

1001
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,311
<i>- That's why she chose Day Eight.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

1002
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,230
<i>She's not sure what time she'll be back.</i>

1003
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,773
<i>After her Wish Letter date.</i>

1004
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,484
- Maho.
- Maho?

1005
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,695
- She asked Yudai to lunch on Day Eight.
- Yes, lunch.

1006
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,739
- She shifted gears.
- Yeah.

1007
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:10,035
Yudai is leaving because he had plans.
It's not anything about Maho.

1008
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,871
- Aru should learn from her.
- He needs to shift gears.

1009
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,999
- He needs to learn from Maho's mentality.
- Totally.

1010
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,599
Did you have fun?

1011
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
I did.

1012
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,477
Good.

1013
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,564
Thank you for coming.

1014
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,608
You don't sound like you had fun.

1015
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,985
What? That's not true.

1016
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,570
- It's not?
- No.

1017
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,574
But compared to the first day we met,

1018
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,741
you were like this,

1019
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,536
but now you're more like this.

1020
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,998
I had lots of fun.

1021
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,416
- Lots of fun?
- Yeah.

1022
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,751
- Good.
- Thank you so much for coming.

1023
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,795
I appreciate you asking me out.

1024
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,005
Merci!

1025
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,967
- Oh, the ocean is beautiful.
- Huh?

1026
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,677
Oh, yeah.

1027
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,971
Where did I put it?

1028
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,932
What?

1029
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,184
The M from that shop.

1030
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,228
Wait, what?

1031
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,855
When did you get this?

1032
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,193
You really are full of surprises.

1033
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,326
How is it?

1034
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,661
- It looks good on you.
- Thank you!

1035
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,877
Dear Mimi,

1036
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,880
I want to spend time
with you on Day Eight.

1037
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,841
Tomorrow will be
the best day of this trip.

1038
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,302
Let's make great memories.

1039
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,262
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

1040
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,513
Okay.

1041
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:03,523
DAY EIGHT, 8:30 A.M.
AT NICE CÔTE D'AZUR AIRPORT

1042
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,526
I was the one that asked you out today.

1043
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,863
But what did you think of the date so far?

1044
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,658
I was worried about
if you were having fun.

1045
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,330
I'm sorry.

1046
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,003
So, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1047
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,425
Why are you looking away?

1048
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,927
What's wrong?

1049
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,805
What is it?

1050
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,723
Hey. What is it?

1051
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,101
What's going on? Come on.

1052
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,311
What? Are you crying?

1053
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,481
Are they good tears? Happy tears?

1054
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:45,983
What's up?

1055
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:50,028
What is it? Wait, really. What's going on?

1056
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,248
What's wrong?

1057
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,625
What is it?

1058
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,462
I'm okay.

1059
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,881
You don't look okay.

1060
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,389
Well, at least during this trip,

1061
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,685
I fell for the first girl I met

1062
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,688
and went on two dates with her.

1063
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,399
I gave her the Wish Letter
and came here today.

1064
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,653
But I couldn’t make her happy
and ended up making her worried.

1065
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,156
- How do I put it?
- That's not true.

1066
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,073
Yeah.

1067
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,159
Just forget it.

1068
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,371
You're okay with that?
You're just gonna forget it?

1069
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:46,710
I want to take you back to your hotel
and see you off until the end.

1070
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,673
But I don't feel anything from your end.

1071
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,009
Feel what?

1072
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,970
Affection or feelings.

1073
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,013
I see.

1074
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,558
So, I guess I don't need to
force myself to do all that.

1075
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,601
Why?

1076
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,729
- Why would you think that far?
- Of course I would.

1077
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,147
Hey.

1078
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,151
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like…

1079
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,571
It's totally fine.
And it feels wrong to have you apologize.

1080
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,448
It's okay.

1081
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,034
So, why don't we

1082
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,453
go back to Nice?

1083
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,748
Okay.

1084
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,583
I'm not "okay" at all.

1085
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:27,918
Why?

1086
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,468
I don't know.

1087
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,638
- I don't get it myself either.
- Why don't you know?

1088
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,643
- You would know…
- This is the loudest I've been this trip.

1089
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,979
I really don't get it.

1090
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,066
What is this?

1091
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,944
I really had fun

1092
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,114
coming here with you.

1093
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,075
But there were moments

1094
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,993
when I was thinking,

1095
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:07,791
"I wonder if he's having fun."

1096
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,085
I wasn't exactly worried,

1097
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,922
but I was wondering about that.

1098
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,590
- Maybe.
- Okay.

1099
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,635
After you wondered about it,
what would you do then?

1100
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,428
- What would I do?
- Yeah.

1101
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,181
You wonder that,
but you just go about on your own

1102
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,851
and let it slide?

1103
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,186
And just watch?

1104
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,440
- But that's not for me to think about.
- Because you're the guest?

1105
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,692
Right?

1106
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,194
I just figured
that's what you're thinking.

1107
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:40,365
We talked a bit during the date,
and you said, "I'll have fun!"

1108
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,700
Yeah.

1109
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:42,951
So…

1110
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:48,039
I thought you were thinking about
how to enjoy yourself.

1111
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,833
To be honest,

1112
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:55,463
it's hard to 1,000% enjoy myself
alone in a one-sided love.

1113
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,843
Especially on a special trip like this.

1114
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:04,264
I'm not the kind of person
who can make that happen.

1115
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,599
Yeah.

1116
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,103
This is probably the real me.

1117
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,563
Yeah.

1118
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,856
That's not true.

1119
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:19,029
If you decide to enjoy
the moment at your maximum,

1120
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,281
you might be able to
let your date have fun too.

1121
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,161
For me, I feel that
if I'm not enjoying myself,

1122
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:29,581
the other person won't enjoy it either.

1123
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:34,294
So, I try to keep myself in a good mood.

1124
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,046
That's how I think.

1125
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,471
Please don't be so hard on yourself.

1126
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,185
I had fun.

1127
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,854
I was just wondering how you felt.

1128
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,023
It's not that I didn't enjoy myself.

1129
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,317
I really had fun.

1130
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:01,321
I was just wondering if you had fun too.

1131
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,409
You don't have to think so hard about it!

1132
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,084
Let's go back to Nice.

1133
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,585
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1134
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,005
Nice is cold too.

1135
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:23,969
- Yeah, Nice is cold.
- It's freezing.

1136
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,554
My hotel is this way.

1137
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,639
Okay.

1138
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,433
- See you.
- Yes, thank you. See you.

1139
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,354
Tomorrow at 12:00 p.m.

1140
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,941
I'll see you near the intersection
at train station number 15.

1141
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,026
Then let's do the French <i>bisou</i>.

1142
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,780
- See you.
- See you.

1143
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,657
- Good night.
- Good night.

1144
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,540
Maho is stylish.

1145
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,458
That was very stylish of Maho.

1146
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,418
So cool.

1147
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,298
Trickle, trickle.

1148
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,593
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1149
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,931
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

1150
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,100
This tastes so good!

1151
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,186
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

1152
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,479
You were with him today?

1153
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,816
Yeah. We went parasailing together.

1154
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,320
I'm going to go parachuting on Day Nine.

1155
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,571
What? Really?

1156
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,156
With whom?

1157
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,407
With Yudai.

1158
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,783
Stop it.

1159
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,547
To the right…

1160
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,688
Dear Yudai,

1161
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,732
I look forward to parachuting on Day Nine.

1162
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,733
From Riko

1163
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,318
I got you lemon soap.

1164
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,948
What was it like
when you met him on Day Five?

1165
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,949
I mean, Day Six.

1166
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,785
I asked him if we could hold hands.

1167
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,912
That's so cute!

1168
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,789
Do you hold hands with Sho?

1169
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,915
No.

1170
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:17,999
Why not?

1171
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,087
I think I'm still too shy to do that.

1172
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,047
- I see.
- How about you, Nanami?

1173
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,509
How are things with you and Kensuke?

1174
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:31,054
It's hard to open up and be honest.

1175
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,347
- You?
- Yeah.

1176
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,516
He asked me

1177
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:38,561
if I hesitated in choosing
who to give my Wish Letter to.

1178
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,479
And?

1179
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,940
I didn't hesitate at all.

1180
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:46,194
I wanted to act sweet and let him know

1181
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,989
that I've had feelings for him all along.

1182
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,158
But I was like, "I didn't hesitate."

1183
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,285
Oh, I get what you mean.

1184
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,620
And,

1185
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,872
maybe it's just me,

1186
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,793
but I felt like
an awkward silence filled the air.

1187
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,255
Maybe you can just tell him all that.

1188
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,341
That you're not good at being honest.

1189
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,218
Yeah.

1190
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,138
Wouldn't giving him
the Wish Letter convey a message?

1191
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,431
Oh, yeah.

1192
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:15,849
That's true.

1193
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,777
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

1194
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:31,948
Dear Yudai,

1195
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,701
I don't know what time
I'll be free on Day Eight.

1196
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,703
I'd like you to wait for me at Margaux.

1197
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,746
But don't push yourself!
Rest when you can!

1198
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,664
From Nanami

1199
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,270
Huh? Why?

1200
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,689
Why?

1201
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,441
You startled me.

1202
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,695
Your cough gave you away.

1203
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,239
- What? You knew it was me?
- Yeah.

1204
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,828
Why are you here?

1205
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,539
- What's that?
- For you.

1206
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,042
Oh! Thank you.

1207
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,129
- Open it later.
- Okay.

1208
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,429
I didn't think you'd be here.

1209
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,432
Wait, no. That's not it.

1210
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,727
Why are you crying?

1211
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,908
You didn't think I'd be here?

1212
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,536
I didn't mean… Wait.

1213
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,871
That's not it.

1214
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,459
Hold on.

1215
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,254
It's okay.

1216
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,799
She's crying so hard.

1217
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,302
I think she really had a hard time.

1218
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,429
It was pretty bad.

1219
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,681
Pretty bad?

1220
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:23,309
It feels like my feelings

1221
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,478
aren't getting through at all.

1222
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,690
No matter what I say,
she brushes it off with,

1223
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,858
"It's fine! You're overthinking it!"

1224
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,236
And like, "Let's be happy!"

1225
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,488
She treats it lightly.

1226
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,324
That really got to me.

1227
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,993
I mean,

1228
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:45,415
I had pretty much decided
to stick with one girl until the end.

1229
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:49,168
But I don't want to waste
the rest of my days here.

1230
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,170
Do you have anybody else in mind?

1231
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,589
- No.
- No?

1232
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,299
No. But…

1233
00:59:55,633 --> 01:00:00,763
- I have no chance with Mimi anymore.
- It was that bad?

1234
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,890
- Yeah.
- Really?

1235
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,393
I mean, I came all the way to France.

1236
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,604
I don't know

1237
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,440
how to spend the rest of my time.

1238
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,066
- I see.
- Yeah.

1239
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:16,696
This is definitely an incident.

1240
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,573
Yes. An incident indeed.

1241
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,199
There's a criminal element.

1242
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,784
There's no criminal element.

1243
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,078
There's absolutely no criminal element.

1244
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,373
Aru is too serious.

1245
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,667
He said it from the start.

1246
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,294
- Just one person.
- "Die for you."

1247
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,421
- "Die for you."
- He can die for that person.

1248
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,548
He wants to meet that kind of person.

1249
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,885
For Aru, Mimi is fun to be with.

1250
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:43,598
But knowing he's not her only option
gave him some major inner turmoil.

1251
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:47,602
She was kind to Sho too.
She's kind to everyone.

1252
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,519
Aru knows that.

1253
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,688
He liked her knowing that fact.

1254
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,398
But the more she encouraged him,

1255
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:56,778
the more he might have wondered

1256
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,447
if she was saying
the same thing to everyone.

1257
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,199
He felt he wasn't her number one.

1258
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,743
After all that mental exhaustion,

1259
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,620
<i>she saw Atsushi smiling at her.</i>

1260
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:09,332
<i>- Of course she would hug him.</i>
<i>- She would definitely hug him and cry.</i>

1261
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,250
What if you were in Mimi's shoes, Kyoko?

1262
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,253
I'm not good at being affectionate,

1263
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,547
but that would definitely make me happy.

1264
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:20,510
- I don't mean to spoil the mood.
- Yes?

1265
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,721
- What is it?
- I don't mean to rain on your parade.

1266
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,306
Isn't Atsushi being unfair?

1267
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,016
It wasn't unfair.

1268
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,018
What was unfair about that?

1269
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,103
It's like,

1270
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,313
the hare ended up winning just like that.

1271
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,441
Right. You looked forward to
the other ending.

1272
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,737
We were worried about how it would be
if things went well with Aru.

1273
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,657
It just so happened to not work out.

1274
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,659
- We couldn't do anything.
- Just listen.

1275
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,120
Let's say Mimi
had enjoyed her date with Aru,

1276
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,831
but she couldn't stop
thinking about Atsushi,

1277
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,875
so she ended up saying,
"I'll head back first."

1278
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,836
And Atsushi was waiting for her then.

1279
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,046
- I'd say, "Well done, Atsushi!"
- He deserved it.

1280
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,925
But while Aru and Mimi's date went south,
he was just swimming.

1281
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,927
Why would you care?

1282
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,262
He swam and waited.

1283
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,265
He was like, "How are things going?
Everything okay?"

1284
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:10,476
Everything went well.
We all knew he would give her the letter.

1285
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,980
He had the Wish Letter
for Day Eight in the first place.

1286
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,650
It wasn't like he strategically got
the letter by switching with somebody.

1287
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,569
- He just had it.
- Yeah.

1288
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,530
He was lucky.
Of course he would go to the hotel.

1289
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,615
He needed to deliver the letter by hand.

1290
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,619
That happened to coincide perfectly
with Mimi's situation.

1291
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:29,537
That's right.

1292
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:34,917
When Mimi cried, I bet Atsushi thought,
"She wanted to see me that badly."

1293
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,544
- I see.
- But remember?

1294
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,588
He believes in fate more than anybody.

1295
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,132
- You're right!
- It was that power.

1296
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:44,510
This was the result
of Atsushi believing in fate.

1297
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,553
Maybe you're right.

1298
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:51,225
Atsushi is the one who's moving
most genuinely according to fate.

1299
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,019
- Yeah.
- That's why things work out.

1300
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,353
- This is fate too.
- Right.

1301
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,815
That's probably why
Atsushi doesn't overthink

1302
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,109
the gaps between himself and reality.

1303
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,153
- He looks straight forward.
- He follows fate.

1304
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:06,824
So he doesn't get upset
about not being able to meet her,

1305
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,577
or wonder what it means
that she’s with Aru right now.

1306
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,955
Some try to carve their path
with the power of reality,

1307
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,373
like Nanami, Tohko, and Aru.

1308
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,376
That's why they sometimes
get knocked down in the process.

1309
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,419
You're right.

1310
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,880
Aru wasn't supposed to do a recon.

1311
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:24,675
- Scouting places was the wrong move.
- Recon is the opposite of fate.

1312
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,678
That's true. You're absolutely right.

1313
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,973
- It's almost the same as googling things.
- Right.

1314
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,183
- I see.
- You're right.

1315
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,019
Aru made a handmade smartphone.

1316
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:35,978
I don't get that.

1317
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,022
That was an awful metaphor.

1318
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,191
- He made a handmade smartphone.
- Handmade?

1319
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:43,694
They can't use smartphones.
It's no time to be making one.

1320
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,404
What's with that metaphor?

1321
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,574
- It's not okay.
- They need to follow their instincts.

1322
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,620
I passed my letter
to Kensuke for Day Five.

1323
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,582
He said he was going to
hand his letter to Nanami.

1324
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,044
He had already decided back then.

1325
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,379
- Really?
- Yeah.

1326
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,715
- He said he'll hand his to me?
- Yeah.

1327
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,051
He's a fun person to be with.

1328
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:07,969
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

1329
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:10,429
It's not the same feeling
I have for Yudai,

1330
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,976
but I told him I wasn't sure
what it meant to like someone as a person.

1331
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,018
He said, "Thank you."

1332
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,105
"But I will pass
my Wish Letter to Nanami."

1333
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,649
- What?
- He said that then and there.

1334
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:25,361
He must really like you.

1335
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,281
- Your date tomorrow…
- I'll have fun!

1336
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,658
Just enjoy your date tomorrow to the max.

1337
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,829
Is this…

1338
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,497
What is it?

1339
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,124
It's nothing.

1340
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,543
Well…

1341
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,341
Huh?

1342
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,138
I think maybe I like him.

1343
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,764
Am I in love?

1344
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,308
You are.

1345
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,435
I think you are.

1346
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:01,314
Am I in love? I don't know.

1347
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,525
Do you like him as a romantic partner?

1348
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,235
Or as a person?

1349
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,613
It's difficult to differentiate the two.

1350
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,781
That's probably why you're confused.

1351
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,784
It's the same for me with Sho.

1352
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,788
I haven't asked about her feelings.

1353
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,458
- You haven't?
- No. I haven't asked yet.

1354
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,585
I'm not sure how she thinks about me.

1355
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:26,213
I'm gonna tell her I like her tomorrow.

1356
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,173
Really?

1357
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,384
- Seriously?
- I'm gonna tell her I like her tomorrow.

1358
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,886
Not Day Ten, but tomorrow?

1359
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,804
I plan to tell her tomorrow.

1360
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:37,141
He's so cool! He's decided already.

1361
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,185
Did Sho star in <i>IWGP?</i>

1362
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,354
- Yeah.
- He's like King.

1363
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,356
What happens if one confesses their love?

1364
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,816
There are no rules regarding that.
It could be…

1365
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,069
They could start going out?

1366
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:51,697
We only have the no smartphones rule
and the Wish Letter rules.

1367
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,615
Wow!

1368
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,743
It's amazing
how quickly things are moving.

1369
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,911
So true!

1370
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:00,122
- Isn't it pretty amazing?
- It definitely is.

1371
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:01,999
Here.

1372
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,295
- For me?
- Tomorrow…

1373
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,425
I think you're the only one for me,
so I'm giving this to you.

1374
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,802
Thank you.

1375
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:13,886
I hoped for this.

1376
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,348
- I hoped for this the most.
- Good.

1377
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,183
Can I have it?

1378
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,351
It's for you.

1379
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,811
It'll be more fun than today.

1380
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:22,812
Okay.

1381
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,524
Is there something I should know?
How should I dress?

1382
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,693
- Bring your swimwear.
- Swimwear?

1383
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,236
- Swimwear.
- What?

1384
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,571
- My swimwear?
- Your swimwear.

1385
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,323
- Bring it with you.
- Okay.

1386
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,033
Did you think I'd be here?

1387
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,410
- Huh?
- No?

1388
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,870
I thought you would come,

1389
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,456
but I didn't expect you to be here now.

1390
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,959
I was surprised.

1391
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:50,297
You were here when my head
was a bit overwhelmed.

1392
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,802
- I felt relieved and tears poured out.
- That's good.

1393
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,514
- Do I look ugly?
- You look pretty.

1394
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,395
- Rest well today.
- Okay.

1395
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:05,312
Here.

1396
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,653
What did she say?

1397
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,740
Did she say anything
about having feelings for someone?

1398
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:16,657
No.

1399
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,034
If not,

1400
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,410
isn't that frustrating?

1401
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,456
- Isn't it frustrating losing to Atsushi?
- Losing?

1402
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,751
- It's not about winning or losing.
- He's taking her.

1403
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,630
Let's take a look.

1404
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:36,719
"Dear Mimi,

1405
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:39,513
I want to spend Day Eight with you."

1406
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,890
I can't stop smiling.

1407
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,601
"You must be tired today. Rest well!"

1408
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,562
"Let's have fun tomorrow! From Atsushi."

1409
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,272
I'll definitely have fun.

1410
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:51,942
It smells nice.

1411
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,864
