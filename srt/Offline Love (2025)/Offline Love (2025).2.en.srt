Let's eat.

15
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,782
They have pens there.

00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,450
I'll take one.

17
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,826
They have papers too.

Hey, look.

- Mimi!
- Mimi.

21
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,751
Will we meet them all?

I'm sorry. I was so surprised.

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,703
You had the same guidebook.

33
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,622
Nice to meet you. I'm Kanaka.

00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,165

Yes. Kanaka?

00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,835
Can I come over to that side?

37
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,461
Yes, of course.

38
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,255
- I'm still shocked.
- Me too.

39
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,466
- So, I wanted to go buy spices.
- I see.

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,262
Maybe around here, but it looks far.

41
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,431
- Are the girls in the same hotel?
- I guess so.

42
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,850
Maybe some of them.

43
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,768

00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,614
I also do choreography

00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,160
I've had the honor of performing
at the Paralympic closing ceremony,

48
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,954
choreographing for the NBA halftime show,

49
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,541
and appearing as a performer myself.

50
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,917
Wow.

<i>There’s a phrase I like.</i>

"Die for you."

55
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,851
It means you can
give up your life for that person.

Sorry?

66
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,196

Wait, do you see those blue chairs?

74
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,515
Is this my coffee?

75
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,725
Are coffees in France this small?

76
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,354
Merci.

77
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,147
Oh, wow.

Merci beaucoup.

79
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,444
I can't eat this all on my own.

80
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,116
I wonder if my prince will pass by.

81
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,871
- It's like she's on a stakeout.
- A stakeout.

82
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,125
Where is Balata?

83
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,128
Oh, here it is.

88
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,971
Sure. Will you eat it here?

This looks delicious.

97
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,505
- Is he okay?
- Did it taste like home or what?

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,935
Turn the dial once to the right.

99
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,605
What?

100
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,442
Huh?

109
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,512
Okay.

110
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,515
For that one, we also have

111
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,141
Three different colors?

112
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,184
Okay.

113
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,435
He intends to swim.

114
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,854
Well, it is his selling point.

"On Day Four at 1:00 p.m."

122
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,455
- She replied to Atsushi.
- And then…

123
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,415
She replied, "Let's have coffee."

124
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,168
- But she also wants to meet Kensuke.
- I see.

125
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,544
On Day Four.

126
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,172
- She's using time effectively.
- Now this is real.

127
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,237
Hey.

128
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,492
- Good morning.

129
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,494

130
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,038
- Just now.
- Really? That's good.

131
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,081
Let's go, then.

132
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,251
- You're so stylish.
- Really? Stylish? Oh, wait!

133
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,795
- Is that the Nice sweatshirt?
- I'm wearing it.

134
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,548
That's great. I want one too.

135
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,594
I thought a French lady was waving at me.

136
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,763
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

137
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,889

<i>- They're nearing Tohko.</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

139
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,477
<i>- Don't miss her.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

140
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,188
All the stalls are closed.

141
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,733
- The market…
- Should we have come in the morning?

142
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,444
- Maybe?
- Maybe we had to come in the morning.

143
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,071
We should've come earlier.

144
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,865
- I haven't enjoyed Old Nice enough.
- Wait, look.

145
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,742
- We're here.
- "Mamma Mia"!

146
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,662
- I'm starving.
- Yeah, me too.

147
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,581
I'm so hungry. Wait, where's the entrance?

148
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,334
She saw them just now.

149
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,919
- Really?
- They walked by.

150
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,171
- I hope they have seats.
- Let's go in.

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,424
Wait a minute. Seriously?

152
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,595
What?!

153
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,015
- What?
- What?!

154
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,144
Hello.

155
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,604
- Hello.
- Hello.

156
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,147
That's a huge plate.

157
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,941
Is this an extra-large plate?

158
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,401
Oh, wow!

159
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,903
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

160
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
I'm Sho.

161
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,532
- Oh! You're Sho.
- Yeah.

00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,036
- I'm Tohko.
- Tohko.

164
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,746
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,248
Did you two meet yesterday?

- Yeah.
- We met yesterday.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,126
Wow.

168
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,461
Wait. Where should we sit?

169
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,756
- Can we join you?
- Let's sit here. How about this seat?

170
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,758
I didn't expect anybody to be here.

171
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,094
Yeah. I felt so awkward.

172
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,471
- Why?
- It's not awkward.

173
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,849
I felt like I witnessed a date.

174
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,060
I'm so jealous.

175
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,854
What did you do yesterday?

176
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,064
Yesterday, I was at the beach…

177
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,190
The beach?

178
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,234
- You were at the beach?
- I was. You too?

179
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,986
- Us too.
- We were at the beach.

180
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,072
- We met at the beach.
- At the beach?

181
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,408
Yeah. Around sunset.

182
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,576
That's not fair.

183
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,495
- "Not fair"?
- I didn't meet any boys.

184
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,206
- But I'm glad I met one of the girls too.
- Me too.

185
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,710
I would've been at a loss
if I didn't meet anybody today either.

186
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,671
- That would be tough.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,257
I've been talking to myself.

188
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,471
I keep looking to see if anyone's there.

189
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,847
That's why I chose this spot.

190
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,391
- So you get a good view?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,935
- Wait, I'm starving.
- We wanna eat.

192
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,438
- We're so hungry.
- Go ahead. Order something.

193
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,774
And I want to get this to go.

194
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,691
- Oh?
- Why?

195
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,110
- I can't eat it all.
- You can't?

196
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,820
I wouldn't mind eating this.

197
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,240
- What? Will you?
- I wouldn't mind eating what's left.

198
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,909
- That would be great!
- Yeah.

199
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,119
- I wanna eat it.
- Thank you.

200
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,246
Where are you going after this?

201
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,415
Have you decided already?

202
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,086
KYOKO KOIZUMI

203
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,921
- She's like, "Where's mine?"
- Yeah.

204
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,507
They were looking
for a place to eat together.

205
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,009
That's why they entered that restaurant.

206
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,469
It was by coincidence,

207
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,931
but saying he's fine
with the leftover extra-large pasta

208
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,391
wasn't the best idea.

209
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,767
No, not really.

210
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,311
- Aru has joined us.
- He's amazing.

211
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,481
<i>- He's a dancer.</i>
<i>- He seems to be successful.</i>

212
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,941
He hasn't dated many girls.

213
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,818
- "Die for you."
- "Die for you."

214
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,570
Maybe that's why
he hasn't been in many relationships.

215
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,989
It's scary being told that.

216
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,035
- Not many people can accept that.
- Right?

217
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,706
But if he meets someone like that,
he would love them for life.

218
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,999
- He's in Nice to look for that.
- Yes.

219
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,961
- But we still don't know why he was late.
- No.

220
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,338
Kanaka is so wonderful.

221
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,632
She gives off a reliable vibe.

222
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,761
Yeah. I wish I could take
my sunglasses off like this.

223
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,304
<i>That's so true.</i>

224
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,640
<i>I've never held my glasses</i>
<i>with two fingers.</i>

225
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,184
- She went like this.
- That was so cool.

226
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,311
- She's not like a 25-year-old.
- Yeah.

227
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,604
- I agree.
- Her actions.

228
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,690
- She seems more mature.
- Yeah.

229
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,900
- I wanna call her "Big Sis."
- She's bold.

230
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,901
Big Sister Kanaka.

231
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,070
- You can do it, Kensuke.
- Hang in there.

232
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,030
- That's true.
- Keep it up.

233
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,450
He's kind of overwhelmed by Kanaka.

234
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:27,037
If she's the type to take the lead,
then she might get along with Kensuke.

235
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,207
<i>So, Atsushi has been invited</i>
<i>by Tohko to meet up…</i>

236
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,625
<i>- At 4:00 p.m.</i>
<i>- At 4:00 p.m.</i>

237
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,004
<i>They'll meet today</i>
<i>at 4:00 p.m. at Place Masséna.</i>

238
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,758
<i>He has left Nanami a letter</i>
<i>asking her out for coffee tomorrow.</i>

239
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,676
<i>- And that has been accepted.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

240
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,305
<i>- But he hasn't read her letter.</i>
<i>- No. He hasn't read her reply yet.</i>

241
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,223
<i>- And Nanami…</i>
<i>- It's for the day after.</i>

242
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,642
<i>She asked Kensuke out to Place Masséna</i>

243
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,146
<i>in the afternoon of Day Four.</i>

244
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,940
<i>- They're having some good exchanges.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

245
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,195
Wow. They're physical letters,
so there's a time lag.

246
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,698
Writing a letter doesn't guarantee
the recipient has read it.

247
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,074
- Right?
- Of course.

248
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,701
We've got the ball rolling.

249
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,619
Yes.

250
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:22,968
Wow.

251
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,054
Wow! What's this one here?

252
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,807
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

253
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,266
Oh, there's salt.

254
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,476
Is this salt?

255
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,685
- Yes.
- Wow!

256
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,145
Salt for cooking.

257
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,939
Do you like truffle salt?

258
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:35,981
Oh, wow!

259
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,109
- It's good with rice too.
<i>- Oh là là!</i>

260
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,362
- Let's take a look inside.
- Let's go.

261
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,405
This place is so much fun.

262
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,282
What's this? Hamburger?

263
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,367
Hamburger?

264
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,202
You add this as a spice.

265
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,787
Wow!

266
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,413
- Oro…
- It's Oro Nobile.

267
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,082
- <i>Balsamico</i>.
- "Oro Nobile."

268
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,794
Okay.

269
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,087
Yeah.

270
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,466
Oh, wow.

271
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,387
- Oh!
- Wow.

272
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,888
This is sick.

273
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,181
It's sick?

274
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,099
Huh?

275
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,725
- It's delicious.
- Oh.

276
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,643
Wait.

277
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,187
I don't know.
I tasted it for the first time.

278
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,107
So, do you have any recommendations

279
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,277
for olive oil and salt
for peperoncino spaghetti?

280
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
This one.

281
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,989
Made with olives from Nice,
it's a typical salt of Nice.

282
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,616
Oh, this is olive salt made with olives

283
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,493
from Nice.

284
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,120
Yum!

285
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,705
Do you like olives?

286
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,622
Whoa!

287
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,416
- This one, please.
- Yeah, sure.

288
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,333
For me.

289
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:49,096
MAHO, 30, MODEL

290
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,695
So, "Central Vintage Shop."

291
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,530
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

292
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,824
"A boutique filled with vintage clothing,

293
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,577
such as coats and jackets…"

294
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,579
Oh, this must be it.

295
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,585
Wow, this is awesome.

296
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,170
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

297
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,297
- May I try this one?
- Yes, of course.

298
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,634
- Yes.
- Yes.

299
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,385
This is cool.

300
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,179
Yes! This is cool.

301
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,309
Wow.

302
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,519
How do I say, "I'll be back"?

303
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,021
Um.

304
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,901
I'm going to the next shop,
but I'll be back.

305
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,277
- Okay.
- Okay?

306
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,613
No problem. It's my pleasure.

307
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,407
- Merci beaucoup.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.

308
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,576
So, what kind of guys do you like?

309
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,579
Someone that's taller than me.

310
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,749
- How tall are you?
- I'm 162 centimeters.

311
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,794
- I'm not tall, so it's over for me.
- That's not true.

312
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,837
I like people who are taller than me.

313
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,050
- I've only fallen in love twice.
- Okay.

314
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,928
I've never been in a relationship.

315
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,846
- What?!
- Really?

316
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,100
So I don't really know what my type is.

317
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,267
I see.

318
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,896
What makes you feel like "I'm in love"?

319
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,899
When I enjoy spending time
with that person.

320
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,990
Isn't it more when you least expect it?

321
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,242
I'd be constantly in love.

322
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,998
When I'm with someone I like,
I'm always like, "I love him!"

323
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,500
I get what you mean.
So it's love at first sight?

324
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,793
- Yeah.
- Wow.

325
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,878
- Wow.
- Love at first sight.

326
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,381
It's like a thunderbolt.

327
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,966
It hits me, and…

328
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,431
- Huh?
- What?

329
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,433
The nuance, right?

330
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,642
- The spark.
- It sparks.

331
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,185
Yes. That's right.

332
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,731
- What's the time?
- I see.

333
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,524
We need to watch out for the time.

334
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,402
Four, right? It takes
some time to get to that plaza.

335
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,528
You're right.

336
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,488
Do you think Atsushi will come?

337
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,240
We haven't met him yet.

338
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,367
I hope he found your letter.

339
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,368
- Exactly.
- Right?

340
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,078
- My letter.
- That's crucial.

341
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,621
I want to go on a date.

342
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,166
Yeah. I'm curious about Atsushi as well.

343
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,626
- Me too.
- I wanna meet him.

344
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,337
Then why don't we meet up afterwards?

345
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,922
- Oh!
- Ah!

346
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,050
Should we meet at the letter lounge?

347
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,301
- Yeah.
- Okay.

348
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,636
- What time?
- Six at the letter lounge.

349
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,554
Okay.

350
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,599
But choose whichever you'd find more fun.

351
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,392
- Okay?
- Thanks.

352
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,062
First, you need to be able to meet him.

353
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,521
Yeah, exactly.

354
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,691
I might go meet you guys on my own.

355
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,486
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

356
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,613
Will I not meet anybody again today?

357
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,416
This looks good. I'll take one.

358
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,046
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

359
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,426
- Oh.
- What?

360
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,638
- Hello.
- Hi.

361
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,224
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, wow.

362
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,142
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

363
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,352
I'm Nanami.

364
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,521
- I'm Atsushi.
- You're Atsushi!

365
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,231
- Good to see you.
- Same here.

366
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,192
I replied to your letter earlier.

367
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,860
- I put it in your mailbox.
- Oh!

368
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,612
- Was that so?
- Yeah.

369
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,324
- I hadn't met any of the girls yet.
- I see.

370
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,994
That's why I decided
to write you a letter last night.

371
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,496
But I met you here.

372
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,872
I'm surprised.

373
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,626
- I hadn't met anybody yet either.
- Oh, really?

374
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,378
- Please, take a seat.
- Right.

375
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,630
- I'm having a salad.
- May I join you?

376
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,048
Of course.

377
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,216
Do you want to eat?

378
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,051
No, I'll get something to drink.

379
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,719
Have you eaten already?

380
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,223
- Not yet? I see.
- I haven't eaten yet.

381
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,350
- I had a slow start this morning.
- Okay.

382
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,144
- Same here.
- Yeah.

383
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,022
I'm suddenly feeling nervous.

384
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,275
- Same here.
- I'm nervous.

385
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,110
I don't know what to ask you first.

386
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,570
I know what you mean.

387
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,323
I was at a wine restaurant last night.

388
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,994
I was drinking outside,
hoping I would find somebody.

389
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,829
But I started feeling lonely

390
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,624
because I didn't manage to meet anybody.

391
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,877
I had dinner alone too.

392
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,545
I see.

393
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,549
- Isn't it really hard to meet someone?
- It's really tough.

394
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,260
Yeah. I mean, Nice is pretty big.

395
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,553
It's a big city.

396
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,348
- I invited you for tomorrow.
- Yeah.

397
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,601
But we met at this moment.

398
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,853
- That's true.
- It's kind of like…

399
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,606
- What should we do?
- Yeah, right?

400
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,108
- I was feeling that.
- Right.

401
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,862
But I'll see you tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

402
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,655
- Eleven o'clock.
- Yes, please.

403
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,116
- Oh, of course! Thank you.
- Thanks.

404
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,159
Not at all.

405
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,578
- Yeah.
- Yes.

406
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,955
Do you like coffee?

407
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,123
I love coffee.

408
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,042
- That's good.
- Yeah.

409
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,002
Yeah.

410
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,840
This is really making me nervous.

411
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:23,180
- Atsushi seems unexpectedly shy.
- Yes.

412
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,974
Okay, so this is Dubouchage.

413
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,018
So I came this way.

414
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,312
Oh, it's this one.

415
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,772
You got it?

416
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,773
Do I go straight?

417
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,733
You're going to Jean Medecin Avenue?

418
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,152
This is Boulevard Dubouchage.

419
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,321
Go straight all the way.

420
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,156
This is the Champs-Élysées of Nice.

421
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,952
I'd like to go around here.

422
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,787
In that case…

423
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,704
Straight?

424
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,499
You'd walk straight for Jean Medecin.

425
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,335
But for here, you should go this way.

426
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,962
This way?

427
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,506
Okay. Merci.

428
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,928
SAINTE RITA CHURCH

429
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,724
Sainte Rita Church. This is it.

430
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,268
OLD NICE

431
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,311
<i>Oh! Maho is getting closer.</i>

432
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,729
<i>At the church?</i>

433
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,831
Wow.

434
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,895
Will they notice each other?

435
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:58,960
Excuse me.

436
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:02,923
Your guidebook.

437
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,800
Really?

438
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,890
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

439
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,604
- I'm leaving.
- Let's go.

440
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,201
Wow.

441
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,661
Wow.

442
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,414
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

443
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,082
I'm Yudai Shimamura.

444
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,458
- Yu…
- Yudai.

445
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,501
- Yudai.
- Yes.

446
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,419
I'm Maho.

447
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,711
- Maho?
- Yes.

448
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,131
Were you planning on going anywhere?

449
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,592
Not really. How about you?

450
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,721
I was at a vintage shop earlier.

451
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,265
Oh! Where was it?

452
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,851
The secondhand clothing store was…

453
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,436
Is it nearby?

454
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,478
From here?

455
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,939
- Where is it?
- It's this one.

456
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,235
"Central Vintage Shop."
It was in Old Nice.

457
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,319
Really?

458
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,989
I contemplated getting a coat there.

459
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,282
- Okay.
- Yeah.

460
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,617
The thing is, I was looking for clothes

461
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,829
that I could wear when meeting
a woman I haven't met yet,

462
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,957
or something suitable for a date.

463
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,750
Right. I see.

464
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,378
So could you maybe pick one out for me?

465
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,337
Oh!

466
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,965
- I'd like you to choose for me.
- Okay, sure.

467
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,133
OLD NICE

468
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,426
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh?</i>

469
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,094
<i>It's Central Vintage Shop.</i>

470
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,847
Is this the right way?

471
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,307
- Over there!
- There?

472
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,516
- The green one.
- I see.

473
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,434
Oh!

474
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,978
I like this alley.

475
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,980
- Are those Italian flags?
- Yeah.

476
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,275
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

477
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,320
I knew I would be poor
if I became a comedian.

478
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,197
So I bought tons of clothes in college.

479
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,617
- You intended on becoming one since then?
- Yeah.

480
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,659
Wow.

481
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,704
I joined an agency
when I was still in college.

482
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,663
Oh, I see.

483
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,876
- So I haven't bought any since then.
- You mean clothes?

484
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,127
- Yeah.
- Wow.

485
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,463
I think you would look good in leather.

486
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,798
This is a military jacket.

487
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,175
- Military jacket?
- Yes.

488
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,510
- Military jacket.
- Yeah.

489
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,761
This is very old.

490
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,097
- Old?
- Oh, wow.

491
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,182
How much is it?

492
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,350
This is 120 euros.

493
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,518
- That's cheap.
- Cheap.

494
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,102
This really suits you.

495
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,229
- This one?
- Yeah.

496
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,189
Wow!

497
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,775
Yeah.

498
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,319
- Didn't Yudai try that one?
- Did he?

499
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,613
- Seriously?
- Oh?

500
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,365
- I want to buy this.
- Oh!

501
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,741
He will take it.

502
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,953
Do you like that one? This is very cool.

503
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,788
- Very cool?
- Yes.

504
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,753
ARU, 30, DANCER AND CHOREOGRAPHER

505
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,880
<i>Aru's suddenly here.</i>

506
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,006
<i>- Aru.</i>
<i>- He's nearing.</i>

507
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,341
<i>- The sudden Aru.</i>
<i>- Aru.</i>

508
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,511
I really wanna meet Atsushi too.

509
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,764
You two girls met.

510
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,058
- But I haven't.
- You haven't met a boy?

511
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,518
No, I haven't.

512
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,103
I want to meet them.

513
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,729
- Behind you!
- Aru!

514
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,690
- Aru!
- It's Aru!

515
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,067
- I'll see you.
- See you later.

516
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,652
So, at 6:00 p.m.?

517
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,362
- At the letter lounge.
- Okay.

518
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,949
- I really hope you'll meet Atsushi.
- Yeah.

519
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,576
- Right.
- Yeah.

520
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,744
- Take care.
- See you.

521
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,789
- I hope you can meet him.
- Thanks.

522
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,250
- I hope you can meet him.
- I wanna meet him too.

523
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,210
- Best of luck!
- See you.

524
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,384
What?!

525
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,683
Wait a minute.

526
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,062
Wow.

527
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:49,941
Wait.

528
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,444
- She met someone!
- What?!

529
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,321
What?!

530
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,531
- What's your name?
- I'm Aru.

531
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,533
- Aru! Hello.
- What's your name?

532
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,160
- I'm Tohko.
- Tohko.

533
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,536
Hello.

534
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,829
Did you arrive yesterday?

535
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,372
- Yeah.
- I thought so.

536
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,709
- I think everybody else arrived earlier.
- Yeah.

537
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,296
My flight actually got canceled.

538
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,089
- So I arrived last night.
- I see.

539
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,843
- Today is like my first day.
- Oh!

540
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,803
Two more members are inside.

541
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,804
Seriously?

542
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,477
They met!

543
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,562
- Wow.
- For real?

544
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,356
Are you going in?

545
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,815
I was just leaving.

546
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,609
- Oh, really?
- What do you wanna do?

547
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,487
- Um…
- Do you wanna say hello?

548
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,404
Yeah.

549
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,324
- That was surprising.
- Hello.

550
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,493
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

551
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,078
Please introduce yourself.

552
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:43,995
I'm Aru.

553
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,163
- Aru?
- Yeah.

554
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,289
Hi. I'm Sho.

555
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,207
- Sho.
- Yes.

556
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,708
- I'm Mimi.
- Mimi.

557
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,293
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

558
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,461
Wow!

559
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,088
- I'm back.
- You're back.

560
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,964
Have you met anybody?

561
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:55,965
No.

562
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,175
I only just started.

563
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,093
- Yeah.
- What?!

564
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,012
- Really?
- Yeah, my flight got canceled.

565
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,016
It got called off,
so I spent a day in London.

566
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,810
- What?
- Wow.

567
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,895
- I see.
- So today is like my first day.

568
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,563
- I see.
- Yeah.

569
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,524
Oh! And one more thing.

570
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,483
There's more?

571
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,736
My suitcase didn't arrive at the airport.

572
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,821
What?

573
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,616
And they still don't know where it went.

574
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,034
- What?
- How can that be?

575
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,369
I bought this here.

576
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,995
- Really?
- That's how it is?

577
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,706
- You went through a lot.
- Yeah.

578
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,916
- One thing after another.
- Yeah.

579
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,378
I don't have my watch,
so I don't even know the time.

580
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,381
- It's okay if you're with someone.
- Yeah.

581
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,340
Be with somebody.

582
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,843
What do you do?

583
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,303
- My main job is dancing.
- Wow.

584
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,805
- Yeah.
- Wow.

585
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,391
I work outside of Japan
for about half of the year.

586
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,769
And in Japan,
I work as a personal trainer.

587
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,687
Wow.

588
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,646
Yeah.

589
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:57,193
So it turns out
Aru was late for a simple reason.

590
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,071
- A flight cancellation.
- It was canceled.

591
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,656
<i>He doesn't have his watch.</i>

592
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,782
<i>And when he arrived,</i>

593
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,451
his smartphone was taken too.

594
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:05,952
That's terrible.

595
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,829
- It's the worst.
- Poor Aru.

596
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,165
"You don't have a watch?
Just be with somebody."

597
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,332
Ah, yes.

598
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,043
<i>Mimi uses such thoughtful phrases.</i>

599
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,964
- Her word choice is wonderful.
- Definitely.

600
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,632
She certainly does.

601
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,468
- So, Kanaka and Kensuke.
- Yes.

602
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,053
- They tried all sorts of spices.
- Yes.

603
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,013
Kensuke tried

604
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,265
<i>balsamic vinegar</i>
<i>for the first time in his life.</i>

605
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,725
"I don't know."

606
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,643
"Oh!"

607
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,896
But he was able to admit that.

608
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,063
Yes, true.

609
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,107
- A good quality for comedians too.
- Yes.

610
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,693
- And Yudai was alone.
- Yes. But finally.

611
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,321
<i>It was really nice</i>
<i>to see the two meet at a church.</i>

612
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,324
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>
<i>- They had to keep their voices down.</i>

613
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,785
- It really feels like fate.
- She passed by him.

614
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,538
Then, she came back and did a double take.

615
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,541
<i>- They were at the edge of the screen.</i>
<i>- Barely in the frame.</i>

616
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,294
Kyoko, have you ever been
in a fateful love?

617
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,796
What kind of question is that?

618
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,507
We didn't have
cell phones and stuff back then.

619
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,510
So it's not like a fateful encounter.

620
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,429
But let's say I had a boyfriend.

621
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,516
And I went home after I finished work.

622
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,560
I would want to talk to him
over the phone at least,

623
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,897
but I wouldn't have
the nerves to call him myself.

624
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,817
I would definitely
want to pick up if he calls.

625
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,278
So even when I was in the shower,

626
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,990
I would be anxious
that he might be calling at that moment.

627
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,118
And when the shower water hit the pipe,

628
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,621
it made a high-pitched "ding" sound.

629
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,665
I'd be like, "Is the phone ringing?!"

630
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,876
I'd open the door each time
and check if the phone was ringing.

631
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,546
- That's how it was.
- How cute.

632
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,048
- A cute couple.
- That's just cute.

633
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,148
We're here.

634
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,775
Oh, wow!

635
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,570
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

636
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,656
Which one do you think would suit me?

637
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,409
- Can I choose one with my taste?
- Yes, please.

638
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,410
Anything but navy.

639
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,578
- Not navy.
- Right.

640
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,705
Can Kensuke really choose a scarf?

641
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,874
- Good luck.
- Has he ever seen one before?

642
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:22,922
This one.

643
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,550
Oh, okay.

644
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,093
This is nice.

645
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,804
Can I look at the others?

646
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,725
Oh.

647
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,101
Of course.

648
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,732
But this one was my second choice.

649
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,691
- Really?
- Yeah.

650
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,151
My first choice was this.

651
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,907
Then… that one.

652
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,199
That one, then.

653
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,493
But since you chose this for me…

654
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,037
Why did you choose this one?

655
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,414
I thought it would match your red hair.

656
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,500
- Oh, right. My hair's red.
- Yes.

657
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,837
Which color do you like?

658
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,839
This one or this one?

659
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,840
I prefer the purple.

660
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,758
This one?

661
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,677
- She says this one.
- Oh!

662
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,679
Yeah!

663
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,516
I'm sorry for dragging you
to this thrift store.

664
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,977
- Not at all. Hear me out.
- Yeah?

665
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,939
I actually wanted to go to a vintage shop.

666
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,859
A different shop, not one in Old Nice.

667
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,985
- Oh! Really?
- Yes.

668
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,279
- Not here in Old Nice.
- Okay.

669
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,282
I went to another shop.

670
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
- But it was closed.
- What?

671
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,496
- Was it a holiday?
- No, not a holiday.

672
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,414
The shop itself was open.

673
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,876
- The shop owner just closed it.
- For personal reasons?

674
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,921
Yeah, for personal reasons.

675
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,340
I couldn't go to that shop,
so this is perfect.

676
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,634
- That's good to know.
- I was surprised.

677
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,971
It's raining, so the scarf is perfect.

678
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,473
- That's great. You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

679
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,558
What do you wanna do now?

680
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,268
- Hmm.
- Well…

681
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,397
Is there anything you wanna do?

682
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,525
There might be a chance
to meet other people.

683
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,112
- So I'll just wander around.
- Yeah, right?

684
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,572
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Yeah.

685
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,616
- Take care. Don't catch a cold.
- Yeah.

686
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,285
- Thank you. Sorry I dragged you around.
- Not at all.

687
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,997
- I'll go this way.
- Okay. I'll go that way.

688
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,248
- Bye, see you!
- Bye.

689
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,249
Thank you!

690
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,710
That was nice!

691
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,837
- Yes!
- It was heartwarming.

692
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,754
Yes.

693
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,007
- It doesn't feel sad.
- I know what you mean.

694
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,217
- It's not a "no" for either.
- Right.

695
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,929
Can we make it?

696
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,765
- It's pouring.
- But the shop's right there.

697
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,225
Oh, it is?

698
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,811
Just about 20 seconds more.

699
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,563
Really? It's that close?

700
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,565
- Should we give it a go?
- Should we?

701
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,775
It's raining pretty bad.

702
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,113
- It's getting heavier.
- Yes, it's pretty heavy.

703
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,199
Should we wait for a bit?

704
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,535
Yeah, let's wait a little longer.

705
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,580
- That's a beautiful scene.
- Yeah.

706
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,082
- They're taking shelter from the rain.
- They are.

707
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,667
Do you speak French?

708
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,626
A little bit.

709
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,628
I'm studying it now.

710
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,505
- Oh, you are?
- Yeah.

711
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,341
- You came from Tokyo, right?
- Yes.

712
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,676
Are you jet-lagged?

713
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,678
No, not really.

714
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,096
- Oh, really?
- Are you?

715
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,806
Actually,

716
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,058
I came from Paris.

717
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,852
- Oh! Paris?
- I live in Paris.

718
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,271
- What?!
- Yeah.

719
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,941
- Wow.
- So I came to Nice from Paris.

720
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,526
How long have you been studying?

721
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,863
I've only lived in Paris for six months,

722
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,490
so my French isn't great.

723
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,201
I can't speak fluently at all.

724
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,036
But I can kind of understand.

725
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,872
It won't stop raining.

726
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,208
- Should we…
- Maybe we should run.

727
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,210
- Let's make a dash for it.
- It's close, right?

728
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,169
Yes, right there.

729
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,463
- Then let's go.
- Ready? Go.

730
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,091
- Oh, but wait.
- It's not too bad?

731
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,552
- The roof's covering us a bit.
- Oh, yeah. I see.

732
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:10,858
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

733
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,287
I wonder if he's coming.

734
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,922
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

735
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,549
- Hello. Are you okay?
- Hello.

736
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,092
I'm sorry. I'm okay.

737
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,635
- Thank you.
- Hello.

738
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,637
- My name is Atsushi.
- I'm Tohko.

739
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,180
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

740
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,348
Thank you for coming.

741
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,100
Not at all. But I was surprised.

742
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,726
- You came to meet me.
- Yes.

743
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,770
Are you hungry?

744
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,230
- Yeah.
- Hungry?

745
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:53,901
- Should we go eat something?
- Let's go.

746
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,278
I was checking that too.

747
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,156
- Did you have anything in mind?
- The one you have marked.

748
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,073
- This one?
- Yes.

749
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,533
Okay. This one, then.

750
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,701
It's close, right?

751
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,120
This one is that way.

752
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,122
- It's near Margaux.
- Okay!

753
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,957
- Let's go, then.
- Yeah.

754
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,875
Let's go.

755
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,502
- You can use this.
- Oh.

756
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,004
- I'll hold it, then.
- Yay.

757
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:13,963
- Thanks.
- Sure.

758
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,048
Which way?

759
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,092
We'll go that way, then that way.

760
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,385
Where did you come from?

761
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,179
- Oh, from that side.
- Okay.

762
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,139
Where did you go today?

763
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,640
Today?

764
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,767
Um…

765
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,229
I was in Old Nice.

766
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,064
Really? I was there too.

767
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,691
- The whole time.
- Yeah.

768
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,319
But I didn't meet anybody.

769
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,904
- So I was like…
- And yesterday?

770
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,239
Yesterday, I was
at the "I Love Nice" sign.

771
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,074
Did you meet anybody?

772
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,075
I met a guy.

773
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,785
I see.

774
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,455
Which one did you like?

775
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,706
- The one I liked…
- Yeah.

776
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,709
- It was a sharp, stylish type of coat.
- Okay.

777
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,294
- Which one was it?
- It's not here.

778
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,505
Take your time.

779
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,465
Got a question?

780
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,507
Uh…

781
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,304
How do I explain
that coat from earlier? Um…

782
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,014
Uh…

783
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,391
The long coat?

784
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,643
- Yes, yes!
- Blue?

785
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,019
Yes. The blue, long coat.

786
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,937
It's sold.

787
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,064
- Whoa, what?!
- Really?

788
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,316
Really?

789
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,695
It's true. I'm very sorry.

790
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,989
Seriously?

791
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,327
- It's gone.
- I'm pretty shocked.

792
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,206
Oh, wow. In this short period of time?

793
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,334
What would he think
of Kensuke wearing that coat?

794
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,378
"Hey, that's mine!"

795
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,255
He's excitedly walking in the rain.

796
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,342
Red suits you. You look great in red.

797
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,470
Wow, this is so cute.

798
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:50,017
I felt bad that I dragged you
along to this shop.

799
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,978
- Not at all.
- But you seem so happy.

800
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,313
I really wanted to go
to a vintage shop today.

801
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,148
So I'm really happy.

802
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,484
- I wanna see over there too.
- Yes, go ahead.

803
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,284
This is vinegar, right?

804
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,119
Yes, exactly. Vinegar with mango.

805
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,288
Great, right?

806
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,205
Great.

807
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,167
- Wow.
- We also have different olive oils here.

808
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,586
They're really produced in Nice.

809
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,050
Okay.

810
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,473
Do you dance while based overseas?

811
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,059
- Yeah.
- As a backup dancer?

812
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,396
I do backup dancing overseas,

813
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,898
but I also hold my own workshops.

814
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,650
- I see.
- Yeah.

815
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,860
Like last year,

816
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,571
I traveled to around ten countries.

817
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,697
Wow.

818
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,282
I danced for six years.

819
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,075
Really? For real?

820
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,162
- You say that now?
- Wait. Oh, wow.

821
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,372
- How about now?
- Just in middle and high school.

822
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,623
- I see.
- Oh, okay.

823
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,750
Yeah.

824
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,210
- Nice.
- We went to the world championship once.

825
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,628
- Really?
- World championship?

826
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,671
That's impressive.

827
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,589
Wow.

828
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,300
Not at all.
It was when I was in middle school.

829
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,053
Then maybe I've seen you somewhere.

830
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,431
Do you know where you wanna go?

831
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,766
It's gonna rain tomorrow.

832
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,559
- It's gonna rain?
- Yeah.

833
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,852
I like it when it rains.

834
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,521
- You get to share an umbrella.
- That's true.

835
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,024
Then you get to stand close to each other.

836
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,025
That's nice.

837
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,070
When was the last time
I shared an umbrella?

838
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,905
Maybe back in high school.

839
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,075
If they have an umbrella,
I'd come empty-handed.

840
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,493
That's nice.

841
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,120
I wanna share an umbrella
with someone on this trip.

842
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,498
I'll share one with you.

843
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,958
What? You'll share one with me? Already?

844
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,090
- You don't look 30.
- Right?

845
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,634
Do you speak French?

846
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,052
I don't speak French.

847
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:48,969
What?

848
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,682
I only studied French after I got here.

849
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,975
That's amazing.

850
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,727
I just kind of…

851
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,021
- You spoke in French to people.
- Yeah.

852
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,523
- I see.
- That way.

853
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,193
- This way?
- Yeah, I think so.

854
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,277
Wow.

855
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,363
You studied French.

856
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,032
- How did you--
- I can speak English.

857
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,453
- Because I lived abroad.
- You did?

858
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,788
- Yeah.
- Wow.

859
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,747
I lived there.

860
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,208
- Where?
- In Greece.

861
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,835
Until last year.

862
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,002
Wow!

863
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,679
Thank you for today.

864
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,473
Please make some great pasta with this!

865
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,391
From Kanaka

866
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,690
This is kinda big.

867
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,112
You can use the mailbox that way?

868
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,697
I see!

869
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,365
She's so mature.

870
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,075
- She is.
- That's true. Wow.

871
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,410
She's so kind.

872
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,621
I see. I was only thinking
about putting the letter inside.

873
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,874
That was a good idea.

874
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,835
You can hang things
outside the mailbox as well.

875
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,546
Unless one of them decides to steal it.

876
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,340
"Hey, I found olive oil! Score!"

877
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,425
Who would do that?

878
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,510
Kanaka is a wonderful lady.

879
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,388
- And they decided to separate around noon.
- Yes!

880
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,099
I really liked that.

881
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,269
- <i>It was very humanlike.</i>
<i>- I see.</i>

882
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,104
<i>"We might encounter other people."</i>

883
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,816
"Yeah, I was thinking that too. See you!"

884
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,193
- It's nice.
- Yes.

885
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,196
- They both seem independent.
- Right, exactly!

886
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,157
In the end, after meeting other people,

887
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,659
they might get back together fatefully.

888
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,205
- They seem like they could do that.
- Yes.

889
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,707
For about 10 or 15 minutes,

890
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,336
<i>Atsushi was late for his date with Tohko.</i>

891
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,713
She looked pretty worried.

892
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,756
- True.
- Yeah.

893
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,927
These young people
probably haven't experienced that.

894
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,723
She can't check in on him,
so even though it was only ten minutes,

895
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,934
it might have felt like an hour.

896
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,893
I agree.

897
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:04,772
<i>- One couple shared an umbrella.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

898
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,108
- Another couple promised to share one.
- Yes, Mimi did.

899
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,652
<i>And right in front of Sho.</i>

900
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,861
<i>Aru said, "I want to."</i>

901
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,989
She eyed Sho and then said,
"I'll share one with you."

902
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,367
<i>- Mimi looked at Sho?</i>
<i>- She definitely did.</i>

903
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,160
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- She glanced at him.</i>

904
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,662
What? Really?

905
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,956
- She checked. It's either one.
- What do you mean?

906
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,751
She checked to see
if Sho was fine with her doing that.

907
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,211
Isn't it too early for that?

908
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,589
- Already? They only met yesterday.
- "Are you okay with this?"

909
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,549
Doesn't matter.

910
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,593
- Wow, Mimi.
- It's one of the two.

911
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,222
Either that, or her feelings
might be leaning from Sho to Aru.

912
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,598
- That's possible.
- Yes.

913
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,808
What's gonna happen?

914
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,411
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah?

915
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,498
- Earlier today, I met some other members.
- Okay.

916
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,751
I met three of them,
so the four of us had lunch.

917
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,670
- Okay.
- Not lunch. We were chatting.

918
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,880
They all said they wanted to meet you.

919
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,301
So I suggested
that I'll come to meet you first,

920
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,885
and we could all meet up later.

921
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,053
Oh, I see.

922
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,473
We talked about meeting at Margaux.

923
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,977
- I see.
- But I'd like to leave that up to you.

924
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,812
- I thought I'd let you know.
- Okay.

925
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,815
And in that case,
maybe we should keep it light.

926
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,692
- That's what you mean.
- Yeah.

927
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,990
- Nah, I don't think I'll go.
- No?

928
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,619
- I mean, you asked me out first.
- Oh.

929
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,203
So I want it…

930
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,749
to be the two of us.

931
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,419
- So let's eat.
- Okay.

932
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,255
Let's eat.

933
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,761
- How about a toast?
- Yes, shall we?

934
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,221
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

935
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,434
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

936
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,853
MAHO, 30, MODEL

937
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,980
- Oh, this is tasty.
- This wine is smooth.

938
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,567
- They cooked the pumpkin like this.
- I see.

939
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,735
Bon appétit.

940
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,654
- Oh! Bon appétit.
- They say that.

941
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,198
- Is that like, "Let's eat"?
- Kind of.

942
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,618
- You say it before your meal?
- Yes, they say that.

943
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,911
Bon appétit.

944
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,373
- So, uh…
- Yeah?

945
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,792
What's your love life like?

946
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,961
What kind of girls do you like?

947
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,715
- There's a type of face I like.
- Yeah?

948
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,095
- Otters.
- What?

949
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,555
- I know.
- Otters?

950
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,015
I know why you're laughing.

951
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,643
How about you?
What kind of guys are you into?

952
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,396
- I like people that are mature.
- Okay.

953
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,316
And I like tall people.

954
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,610
How tall are you? You're pretty tall.

955
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,531
- I'm about 170 centimeters.
- I see.

956
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,742
So, you prefer guys that are tall?

957
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,746
Yeah. That's something
I take into consideration.

958
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,542
So, what has your love life been like?

959
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,502
Everything looks delicious.

960
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,920
- Yeah.
- They look amazing.

961
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,589
- The wine looks tasty too.
- Yes.

962
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,342
I lived outside of Japan.

963
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,844
For how long?

964
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,722
- I traveled back and forth.
- Back and forth?

965
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,349
- I was part of Japan's national team.
- Oh?

966
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,810
So before the Olympics,

967
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,270
I had training camps

968
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,315
that lasted 200 to 300 days a year.

969
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,067
- I see.
- Yeah.

970
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,864
- So I couldn't properly date anybody.
- Right.

971
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,491
Do you think you'll find somebody here?

972
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,412
I think so. Wait, I'm not sure.

973
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,706
- But we have no digital devices.
- Right.

974
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,916
- And we're not in Japan.
- True.

975
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,336
So if we were to meet
someone here in Europe,

976
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,549
that would feel like something special.

977
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,509
And what type of girl do you like?

978
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:06,930
Well, I prefer cute girls

979
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,390
over the beautiful ones.

980
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,267
Which one am I? Cute or beautiful?

981
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,479
Don't say neither. If you had to choose.

982
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,898
- I think you're the cute type.
- Really?

983
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,232
I think so.

984
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,402
- She's so cheerful.
- Isn't she cute?

985
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,616
- Not here.
- They're not here yet.

986
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,620
- Huh?
- What's that?

987
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,537
A present?

988
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,623
- That's romantic.
- Wow.

989
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,041
Go on, take it!

990
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,169
They're not a gang of robbers.

991
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,130
Some have gone that far?

992
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,174
What? A present?

993
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,551
- Surprising, right?
- We haven't even met them.

994
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,969
They're in love already.

995
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,054
They met on Day One.

996
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,556
- And giving presents already.
- They're in love.

997
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,476
I'm getting anxious.
Some people have gotten this far.

998
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,269
- I get it.
- You see that, right?

999
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,189
I have a feeling they might not come.

1000
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,649
- To meet us?
- Yeah.

1001
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,652
Then those two must be getting along too.

1002
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,820
- Getting along?
- Yeah.

1003
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,737
Seriously?

1004
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,239
They must be waiting for us.

1005
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,407
- I do want to meet them.
- Yeah.

1006
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,119
- But I'd prefer not to go there.
- Okay.

1007
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,788
Not today.

1008
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,914
Okay.

1009
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,707
We're having pizza together.

1010
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,086
I think I'm good here. I'm happy here.

1011
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,420
That's good to know.

1012
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,298
I'm glad I came.

1013
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,513
- I'm glad I wrote you that letter.
- Thanks.

1014
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,306
So, you know…

1015
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,393
- We couldn't go to that place earlier.
- Right.

1016
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,562
Does that bother you?

1017
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,313
Not at all.

1018
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,651
- But we wanted to go to the same place.
- Yeah.

1019
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:47,489
So it's too bad we couldn't go there.

1020
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,909
- It was a popular restaurant.
- Yeah.

1021
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,161
- Let's go some other time.
- Yeah.

1022
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,582
But if you value fate

1023
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,418
in things like meetings and encounters,

1024
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,964
then we could go
the next time we meet or something.

1025
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,884
- You mean like if we run into each other?
- Yeah.

1026
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,428
Do you believe in fate?

1027
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,014
Yeah, I do. How about you?

1028
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:15,726
I do as well.
That secondhand clothing was fate too.

1029
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,898
Oh, the clothing? You mean the coat?

1030
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,192
That too, but I didn't think
you liked that stuff.

1031
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,819
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

1032
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,571
- I'm glad you like vintage.
- Yeah.

1033
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,656
I could totally tell you like it.

1034
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,618
You like it way more than I do.

1035
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,037
- Oh, wow.
- Merci.

1036
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,246
Oh my God.

1037
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,166
- It looks delicious.
- "Oh my God"?

1038
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,668
- I love sweet stuff.
- How many meals is that?

1039
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,427
Wow.

1040
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,931
Treat me to something sweet next time.

1041
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:54,848
Oh.

1042
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,433
- Let's do that.
- But…

1043
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,727
No buts. We'll meet again.

1044
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,562
Can we have the bill, please?

1045
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,272
- Everything good?
- Yes.

1046
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,273
Thank you so much.

1047
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,733
- Thank you so much.
- Merci.

1048
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,527
Merci.

1049
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,281
- I kind of like the tipping system.
- Really?

1050
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,240
Like this?

1051
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,369
What did you put there?

1052
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,788
Wait. Huh? Isn't this it?

1053
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,373
Oh, yeah. That looks good.

1054
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,874
That's two euros.

1055
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,876
Two euros and…

1056
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,294
- Five euros.
- Five euros?

1057
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,379
I think that's good.

1058
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,923
We need to press this.

1059
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,967
No, that's not…

1060
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,344
- See?
- That wasn't it!

1061
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,930
- It worked.
- That wasn't because of the button.

1062
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,181
- No, it wasn't.
- It was!

1063
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,808
But the timing was perfect.

1064
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,352
- Then I'll go this way.
- Okay.

1065
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,770
- Thanks.
- See you.

1066
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,938
See you.

1067
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,189
- Good night.
- Yeah.

1068
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,524
- Good night.
- Thanks.

1069
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:46,858
See you.

1070
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,207
Are they still there?

1071
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:13,802
Oh.

1072
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,234
Wow.

1073
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,701
Oh, wow!

1074
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,710
What?!

1075
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:47,836
We'll be at La Langouste.

1076
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,589
I'm so sorry, everyone.

1077
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,716
Join us if you can. We'll be waiting!

1078
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,472
I don't know what to do tomorrow.

1079
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,391
You said you wanted to eat waffles.

1080
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,893
You wanna go?

1081
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,561
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1082
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,438
That sounds nice. You should go.

1083
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:10,275
Do you want to eat waffles?
Or do you want to spend time with me?

1084
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,736
Hey, Mimi!

1085
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,571
- Mimi?
- Mimi!

1086
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,782
- She's so aggressive.
- Wow!

1087
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,492
This smells nice.

1088
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,536
- Huh?
- Now?

1089
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:23,747
Oh, man.

1090
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,169
Should I maybe excuse myself
to the restroom?

1091
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,713
- I think I'll go.
- Go ahead.

1092
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,508
I'll go fix my makeup.

1093
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,221
Man, this is so embarrassing.

1094
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,389
I'll be back.

1095
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,352
- I was wondering when I should say this.
- Yeah.

1096
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,271
- I kind of felt that.
- Really?

1097
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,816
It really looked like you took the plunge.

1098
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:54,277
But does that mean
you're interested in her?

1099
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,405
- Well, yeah. More or less.
- More or less?

1100
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,701
She said she wanted to eat waffles
on the first day at the beach.

1101
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,454
And we couldn't eat any today.

1102
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,499
So I thought why not tomorrow
if she's free, you know?

1103
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,085
- That's it?
- It's nothing passionate.

1104
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:14,256
- It doesn't have to be passionate.
- I don't have feelings for her yet.

1105
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,175
- So you're interested?
- Yeah, I am.

1106
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,510
Wow.

1107
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,012
- This is embarrassing. Let's stop.
- That's nice.

1108
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,474
- We should talk about this stuff.
- I really don't know yet.

1109
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,477
I really get nervous about these things.

1110
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,233
- Maybe I'll use the restroom too.
- I'm back.

1111
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,902
I'm going.

1117
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,090
Excuse me.

1118
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,762
I'm Nanami.

1119
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,431
- I'm Kanaka.
- Kanaka!

1120
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,974
Did you just come back?

1121
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,810
No, I came back a little while ago.

1122
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,564
- I waited here, hoping to meet somebody.
- Really?

1123
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:13,815
- Yes.
- And I came?

1124
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,026
- Yes.
- Wow! I'm so lucky.

1125
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,569
I'm so happy.

1126
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,238
He asked you on a date.

1127
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,657
- On a date?
- Yeah.

1128
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,409
You don't think it's a date?

1129
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,286
A date? Oh yeah, it's a date.

1130
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,582
Yeah. I was going to ask
if you'd like to go somewhere tomorrow.

1131
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,625
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1132
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,418
But the timing was…

1133
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,254
- Let's go, then.
- Sho said it first.

1134
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,715
- The three of us?
- Wait, no, that's weird.

1135
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,300
Maybe adjust the time…

1136
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:44,179
- You know, with everybody…
- No, it's all right.

1137
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,931
Of course.

1138
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,976
- We're still on Day Two.
- Right. We have plenty of time.

1139
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,061
- Right?
- Yeah.

1140
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,314
Right?

1141
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,815
That might sound strange.

1142
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,150
It's difficult.

1143
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,319
We have plenty of time.

1144
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,782
Whoa, that felt so real.

1145
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,116
Just now, right?

1146
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,410
Thank you.

1147
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,163
- Oui?
- Oui.

1148
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,081
Oui?

1149
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,375
- Hey.
- Oh, it stopped raining.

1150
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,169
We didn't decide what time
we should meet tomorrow.

1151
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,545
- Right. What time?
- Right?

1152
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,631
- How about 11:00 a.m.?
- Eleven?

1153
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:20,799
Does that work?

1154
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,509
- Okay?
- Okay. Eleven then.

1155
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,677
Let's meet at eleven.

1156
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,803
Okay.

1157
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,930
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. at Maison…

1158
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,724
- Maison Margaux?
- Yeah. Let's do that.

1161
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,698
Oh. Hey.

1162
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,574
Wait.

1163
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,205
Oh.

1164
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,000
Wait.

1165
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,086
- Hello.
- Hello.

1166
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,713
Oh. Huh?

1167
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,464
Um…

1168
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,925
He's wearing the coat Yudai wanted.

1169
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,802
This isn't good!

1170
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,304
Um.

1171
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,849
Oh! Is that what this is?

1172
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:14,894
What are you doing out in this cold?

1173
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,271
I was having dinner.

1174
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,400
- Wait, really? By yourself?
- By myself.

1175
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,193
- I'm Yudai.
- Yudai!

1176
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,196
- Yes.
- I'm Kensuke Omodaka.

1177
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,281
Oh!

1178
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,409
- Did you go anywhere today?
- I went on a walk.

1179
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,119
It started raining,

1180
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,704
so I came back.

1181
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,581
I fell asleep.

1182
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,541
And here you are.

1183
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,544
I didn't meet anybody yesterday,

1184
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,962
but I had dinner just now.

1185
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,505
Who did you go with?

1186
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,509
- I went with someone named Maho.
- Oh!

1187
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,512
We met at a church.

1188
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,141
And we went to some vintage shops.

1189
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,893
Vintage shops in the city?

1190
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,729
- Yeah, in Old Nice.
- I did too.

1191
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,273
- Oh, really?
- I got this there.

1192
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,524
- Wait a minute.
- Huh?

1193
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,026
- Did you buy that today?
- Yeah.

1194
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,111
I wanted to buy this!

1195
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,738
- Seriously?
- Whoa!

1196
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,074
I bought this on the spot.

1197
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,076
That's what I should've done!

1198
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,411
I should've bought it on the spot.

1199
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,498
I mean, I thought this was really cool.

1200
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,957
Oh, you think so?

1201
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,419
- This is so funny!
- What was that?

1202
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,963
- Wow.
- This is getting interesting.

1203
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:28,009
- So there's this type of fate as well.
- What a strange fate.

1204
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,011
- The fate of the coat.
- How strange.

1205
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:34,516
- The same could happen with women.
- Oh!

1206
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,394
- That's true.
- That sounds like a novel.

1207
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,729
- It's well-written.
- A metaphorical expression.

1208
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,940
"I bought it on the spot."

1209
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,527
This line could be used for this show

1210
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,279
as the main part, you know?

1211
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,908
- It was kind of a symbolic scene.
- I see. That's true.

1212
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,576
He got it first.

1213
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:58,331
And Kensuke broke
the greatest taboo of taking a nap.

1214
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,208
He’s so foolish.

1215
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,128
- I'm so sorry.
- Give me a break.

1216
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,463
I apologize on behalf of all comedians.

1217
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,715
Seriously. Come on.

1218
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,261
- He parted in such a nice way.
- Don't take a nap.

1219
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,762
<i>- With Kanaka.</i>
<i>- Exactly.</i>

1220
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,431
<i>Kanaka used her time wisely.</i>

1221
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,308
<i>- She even got him olive oil.</i>
<i>- For Kensuke.</i>

1222
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,228
Why did he go back, see the rain,

1223
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,438
and go to sleep?

1224
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:26,860
We had someone who expressed
their interest for the first time.

1225
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,403
- Explicitly.
- Yes.

1226
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,320
- Sho.
- Sho.

1227
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,990
"Do you want to eat waffles
or spend time with me?"

1228
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,700
She said this behind that thing.

1229
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,370
She said it while hiding
behind that paper napkin thing.

1230
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,998
<i>- "Do you want to go with me, or…"</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1231
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,583
<i>That was amazing.</i>

1232
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,084
Then, she excused herself.

1233
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,419
"Should I excuse myself?"

1234
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,337
What kind of strategy is that?

1235
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:50,049
Did she want Aru and Sho to talk about it?

1236
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,218
Maybe she thought he would encourage him.

1237
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,804
- Aru?
- That Aru would encourage Sho.

1238
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,307
She had her hair up when she came back.

1239
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,350
<i>- She looked cute.</i>
<i>- That's cute.</i>

1240
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,560
<i>- Oh, my.</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>

1241
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,771
- She's amazing.
- I really want to thank her.

1242
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,567
How about that feeling
of tension when Sho returned?

1243
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,695
She was talking about adjusting the time.

1244
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,489
But the second he came back,

1245
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,699
she just changed the subject.

1246
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:17,118
- As if it was nothing.
- That was amazing!

1247
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,246
That sometimes happens,
regardless of guys and girls.

1248
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,999
- So, Mimi didn't plan anything with Aru.
- No.

1249
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:27,212
She's meeting Sho at eleven there.

1250
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,506
So she can go earlier
and write him a letter.

1251
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,049
- I see!
- And put it in.

1252
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:35,011
Aru needs to believe she would do that
and come to look for the letter.

1253
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,555
- That's a pretty big hurdle.
- Yeah.

1254
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,392
And Mimi would have to finish
her date with Sho at a certain time.

1255
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,310
Right.

1256
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:46,022
Mimi has so many missions
to clear tomorrow.

1257
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,483
<i>Tohko seems interested in Atsushi as well.</i>

1258
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,817
<i>She's like, "Which am I?"</i>

1259
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:54,364
Would you feel anything
when you're asked about your type?

1260
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,908
I just think it's a hassle
being asked that.

1261
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:00,036
What is your answer to that question?

1262
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,163
In <i>Star Wars</i>, I would choose Chewbacca.

1263
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,123
He's hairy.

1264
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,125
Wait, but aren't you…

1265
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,587
I'm kind of like Chewbacca.

1266
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,673
I like people with high self-esteem.

1267
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,049
Now, let us continue.

1268
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,635
- Huh?
- We're not interested.

1269
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:27,188
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

1270
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:31,401
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

1271
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,953
Hello. My name is Nanami Asahi.

1272
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,956
This was a surprise!
I would love to have coffee with you.

1273
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,041
See you at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday.
