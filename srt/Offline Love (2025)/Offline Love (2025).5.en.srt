"About 20 kilometers from Nice,

the small and quaint village
of Saint-Jeannet is famous for its wine."

71
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,670
Read it till the end.

81
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,320

He was at his limit.

90
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,704
He hasn't stayed dry for so long.

91
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,332
Morning.

92
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,419
- Hey. Good morning.
- Sorry I made you wait.

93
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,964

94
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,677
- I came in flashy clothes.
- Nice. It's warm today.

95
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,761
It's warm.

96
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,513
Where do you wanna go first?

97
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,307
We'll go to Old Nice first.

98
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,644
We can check out some vintage shops.

99
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,187
Then, lunch?

100
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,064
Then, we'll have lunch.

101
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,400
Do you wanna go
to that place you mentioned?

102
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,943
The truffle risotto? Yeah.

103
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,113
Then we'll go there. And after that…

104
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,656
Yeah. Huh?

105
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,533
I want you to take a look at this.

106
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,410
Wait.

107
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,539
Can you tell by the drawing?

108
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,167
Oh, wow!

109
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,961
Yes. It's a snow mountain.

110
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,880
Snowboarding on a snow mountain?

111
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,797
Yeah.

112
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,549
There's this shopping mall.

113
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:46,095
- It's called CAP3000, near the airport.
- Okay.

114
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,265
I want to buy some accessories there.

115
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,019
- Things we would need for tomorrow.
- Okay.

116
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,855
We could go to vintage shops
around here first.

117
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,816
Then, we could have lunch

118
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,611
and head over to that area.

119
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,696
I wanted to suggest that.

120
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,073
So I gave you that first.

121
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,241
Thank you so much. I'm really happy.

122
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,161
Yeah. Let's go tomorrow.

123
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,789
I haven't told you something yet.

124
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,165
I'm gonna be honest.

125
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,335
- I had plans tonight.
- Okay.

126
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,505
- You can prioritize your commitments.
- Nah.

127
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,590
I want to spend time with you today.

128
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,759
- So…
- Really?

129
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,677
Can I go write a letter on my own?

130
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,513
Sure, of course.

131
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,807
I'm sorry for the trouble.

132
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,142
Not at all. I want to be with you.

133
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,228
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Okay.

134
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,397
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

135
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,692
- But he wrote that letter to Mimi.
- Yeah.

136
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,610
That's right.

137
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,945
He's like, "Never mind!"

138
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,657
He's writing another letter
saying, "Forget it!"

139
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,450
- He can't retrieve his letter.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,869
What if Mimi reads
the second letter first?

141
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,382
Dear Mimi,

142
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:11,097
I know I was the one
that asked you out for dinner.

143
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,308
I'm sorry.

Whoa.

157
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,024
You're the type of guy
that walks on the roadway side.

158
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,028
What's your opinion on that?

159
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,529
- What?
- Guys that do this.

160
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,156

In a good way.

165
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,708
- I've never seen this.
- Wow.

166
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,834
Wow!

167
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,461
I thought it was a field.

168
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,754
- It's a field.
- It is?

169
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,088
Sorry.

170
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,006

00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,487
I am Georges's wife.

185
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,571
Yeah. Wife?

186
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,491
I am Georges's wife,
and Georges is the winemaker.

187
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,742
- Oh.
- Winemaker.

188
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,870
I'm a specialist
of making wine with the sun.

189
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,959
It's famous because he puts his wine
in the sun. It's so special.

190
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,254
We are under a very old olive tree.

191
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,421
Very old?

192
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,299
It is estimated to be 2,000 years old.

193
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,094
- It is 2,000 years old.
- What?!

194
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,889
This is a place
with a long history in my family.

195
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,560
It's a family business
that has continued for generations.

196
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,646
Oh! That's how he does it. Wow.

197
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,022
- White wine.
- White wine?

198
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,024
Wow!

199
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,902
- Straight out of the barrel.
- Yeah.

200
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,821
- Wow.
- Wow.

201
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,824
- Good.
- Yeah.

202
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,285
I smell the wood.

203
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,204
Wow. It's like grape juice.

204
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,289
I'll try this.

205
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,216
- It's the scent of the white flower.
- White flower.

206
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,259
I see.

207
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:57,054
You can also faintly detect
the aroma of apricot and honey.

208
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,180
Nice?

209
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,890
It's good.

210
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,225
- It's good.
- It's good.

211
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,311
- Did I say it right?
- You did.

212
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,895
Whoa.

213
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,064
Oh, wow!

214
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,275
This is great.

215
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,818
It's so blue.

216
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,907
It's so vast.

217
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,409
Oh, wow.

218
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,790
Wow.

219
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,002
Can you see the lighthouse
at the tip of the cape?

220
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,255
- Oh!
- That's the objective for today.

221
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,590
Woo-hoo!

222
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,300
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

223
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,386
Dear Yudai,

224
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,559
Bonjour! Thank you for the other day.
It was so much fun!

225
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:49,482
I hope we can go somewhere together again.

226
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,197
MAHO, 30, MODEL

227
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,952
Maho seems to value fate.

228
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,372
- They met at the church.
- Yeah.

229
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,665
Oh, wow.

230
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,375
Wow.

231
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,296
Looks good.

232
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,006
DAY FIVE: SANDWICHES

233
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,638
Okay. Let's eat.

234
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,775
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

235
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,860
- Mimi's here.
- It's Mimi.

236
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,404
That was so Mimi.

237
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,280
She poked her head in.

238
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,826
MIMI, 20, PART-TIME WORKER

239
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,832
- Please read them in order.
- Oh, no.

240
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,458
Which one did she open first?

241
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,422
Dear Mimi,

242
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,591
I'll be waiting for you at 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow (Day Five) at Maison Margaux.

243
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,509
From Sho

244
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,514
Dear Mimi,

245
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,268
The trip is short, so there's someone else
I'd like to spend time with.

246
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,686
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,603
From Sho

248
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,275
- Oh!
- Does it look good on me?

249
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,402
- Did you wear that today?
- Did I?

250
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,653
Did I bring it with me?

251
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,488
It's like, "In the meantime…"

252
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,450
This is no time for thrifting.

253
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,201
That looks really good on you.

254
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,662
It looks super good.

255
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,539
No doubt. It suits him.

256
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,249
- Looks good.
- He looks good in it.

257
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,005
Dear Mimi,

258
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,591
I want to hand you something on Day Six.

259
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:43,179
I'll be waiting for you at 4:00 p.m.
at the restaurant where we first met.

260
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,096
From Aru

261
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,351
Day Six.

262
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,818
Bonjour.

263
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,531
This looks delicious.

264
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,164
Yum.

265
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,291
I'm ordering this tomorrow.

266
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
Oh, hey!

267
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,669
- It's a recon!
- A recon?

268
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,629
It's a recon.

269
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,755
Aru is scouting places.

270
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
He's so diligent.

271
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,567
We will cook a typical tart from here.

272
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,944
Are you ready?

273
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,195
- Yeah.
- Yes.

274
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,530
- Good.
- Yeah.

275
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,323
So.

276
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,492
We will make a tart.

277
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,493
- Tart?
- Tart.

278
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,745
The name is pissaladière.

279
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,913
Pissaladière.

280
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,834
It's a tart with a lot of onions.

281
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,796
It is a typical tart around here.

282
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,299
From Nice.

283
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,009
Do you cook at home?

284
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,302
A little.

285
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,179
A little bit? Okay.

286
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,472
So, let's go.

287
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,933
Let's go. Yeah!

288
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,519
Okay.

289
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,856
Perfect.

290
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,024
Quickly.

291
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,111
- Quickly!
- Very hungry!

292
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,029
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,824
When you're done cutting the onions,

294
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,077
I will cook them with this olive oil.

295
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,579
- Yeah.
- It's from here.

296
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,997
- Yeah.
- Of course.

297
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,708
Let's do this!

298
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,544
We need to cut them.

299
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,088
We have…

300
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,715
We have seven more.

301
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,341
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

302
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,136
That's a lot of onions.

303
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,971
- Yes.
- Wow.

304
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,142
Please put in four anchovies.

305
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,393
Four anchovies. Yeah.

306
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,522
You can hold it like this.
Put in some herbs.

307
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,899
- Oh! Herb?
- Yeah.

308
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,192
- It's called thyme.
- Thyme?

309
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,236
An herb from Provence. Do you smell it?

310
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,238
- It smells really nice.
- Yeah.

311
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,034
- It smells nice.
- It's from Mount Baou.

312
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,702
- Wow.
- Wow.

313
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,078
It's full of onions.

314
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,373
- Full of onions.
- Yeah.

315
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:18,959
Smells nice.

316
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,169
Yeah.

317
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,296
Wow, it looks beautiful.

318
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,131
- A beautiful tart.
- Yes!

319
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,634
- Pissaladière.
- Pissaladière.

320
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,471
We need to cook this for 14 minutes.

321
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,889
- Fourteen minutes?
- Yes.

322
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,059
- We held hands at the end.
- Oh!

323
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,977
Seriously?

324
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,731
You've gone that far? Seriously?

325
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,317
Isn't that like… You know?

326
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,944
He likes you.

327
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,112
But when we held hands,

328
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,699
it was really cold,
so I was like, "I'm cold."

329
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,953
Here. Pretend you're cold like this.

330
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,038
- Like this?
- Yeah, and he did this.

331
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,624
- For real?
- And his hands were warm.

332
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,294
So I was like, "They're warm,"
and we were like this.

333
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,714
- And we went, "La, la, la."
- You must have had so much fun.

334
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,257
- It was really fun.
- Wow.

335
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,301
I'm the one swooning.

336
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,929
Just by hearing your story.

337
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,139
It was like a sketch.

338
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,683
Mimi must be fun to talk with.

339
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,310
- Yeah.
- They're both good at talking.

340
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,855
- It was a lot more fun than I expected.
- That's so nice.

341
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,066
I didn't think it would turn out this way.

342
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,860
Really? But that's nice.

343
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,238
Did you promise to meet him again?

344
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,490
That's the thing.

345
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,992
Can I show you something?

346
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,411
What is it? What now?

347
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,123
He gave me this letter.

348
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,499
- The postcard?
- Yeah.

349
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,043
- But we didn't exactly make plans.
- Huh?

350
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,045
- We didn't say when.
- Okay.

351
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,798
He was like, "I'll ask you out again."

352
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,384
Then, I read it back at the hotel.

353
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,637
- We bought two postcards.
- That's pretty.

354
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,097
- I chose this one.
- So cute.

355
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,933
- Cute, right?
- It says Cannes. I love this.

356
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,518
When I looked at it…

357
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,062
What?!

358
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,357
It just says, "Day Six, 1:00 p.m."

359
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,986
- I don't even know where.
- That's true. Where should you go?

360
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,195
What does he mean?

361
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,533
- I don't get why he wrote it here.
- You're right. It's mysterious.

362
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,952
He gave a hint and went swimming.

363
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,123
That would make anyone curious.

364
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,666
So let's see.

365
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,170
Aru still seems to have feelings for Mimi.

366
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,214
- Right?
- Yeah. It seems so.

367
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,633
<i>He has asked her out on a date.</i>

368
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,469
<i>And today, he's scouting out</i>

369
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,678
that restaurant.

370
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,096
- How cute.
- So endearing.

371
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,848
<i>- He's adorable.</i>
<i>- So cute.</i>

372
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,266
<i>- A nice man.</i>
<i>- Scouting places.</i>

373
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,728
He said, "This is good!
I'm ordering this tomorrow."

374
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,854
That's amazing.

375
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,230
- Amazing, right?
- Yeah.

376
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,607
He'll eat the same thing.

377
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,693
You would want to eat
something different tomorrow.

378
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,488
- If you just want to enjoy yourself.
- Yeah.

379
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,281
It's nice that he's scouting it out.

380
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:58,452
- I would be surprised if I found out.
- Yeah.

381
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,788
Will Aru tell her though?

382
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,705
I don't think so.

383
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,124
- It's cooler to keep quiet.
- Definitely.

384
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,170
But I have a feeling Aru would say it.

385
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,381
Mimi has plans with Aru.

386
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,427
- So it's tomorrow?
- But it said, "Day Six."

387
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,763
<i>- On Atsushi's postcard.</i>
<i>- What did Aru say?</i>

388
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,890
- At the restaurant at 4:00 p.m.
- Oh!

389
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,892
- That's tight.
- It's pretty close.

390
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,644
She needs to move quickly.

391
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,815
<i>Kanaka handed her Wish Letter to Sho.</i>

392
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,358
- She did it smoothly.
- Yeah.

393
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,735
They chatted for a while,
and she was like, "Here."

394
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,320
She's so cool.

395
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,073
Her actions are so smooth.

396
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,200
Today is Day Five.

397
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,912
Kanaka passed her Wish Letter
for Day Six to Sho.

398
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,747
Kensuke has his Wish Letter too.

399
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,501
He needs to hand his to somebody.

400
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,463
He might pass it to Tohko.

401
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,798
- Or…
- Oh, yeah.

402
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,385
- To Nanami.
- But Tohko's going parachuting on Day Six.

403
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,470
So will Yudai go parachuting alone?

404
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,638
That won't happen.

405
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,806
He's not like Aru.

406
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,767
Don't call people Aru when they act alone.

407
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,826
- We get the seat on the terrace.
- Wow.

408
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,910
This feels so nice.

409
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,828
It does.

410
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,454
It's a good day to eat outside.

411
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,623
- I sat inside last time.
- Really?

412
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,541
- Yeah.
- Nice.

413
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,043
- I'm hungry.
- I had truffle risotto here.

414
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,670
- And it was delicious?
- Yeah.

415
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,297
Is the plate big?

416
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,382
It was pretty big.

417
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,259
But I devoured it in seconds.

418
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,679
- Aru was eating a huge plate.
- I see.

419
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,140
Why did you ask me out today?

420
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,600
- What?
- The Wish Letter.

421
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,351
Even if I've never snowboarded,

422
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,313
I thought I would have fun with you.

423
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,148
I need to entertain you then.

424
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,692
- You're pressuring me.
- But I had fun in Provence.

425
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,943
Really?

426
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,737
Yay.

427
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,031
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

428
00:19:59,114 --> 00:19:59,948
Merci.

429
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,283
Wow.

430
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,411
- What do you think?
- This looks really delicious.

431
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,585
It's delicious.

432
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,213
I'm glad I was able to bring you here.

433
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,255
This is good.

434
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:21,136
Atsushi went on a date
with Mimi yesterday with the Wish Letter.

435
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,057
Atsushi and Aru
were talking in front of the lobby.

436
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,769
I think they're both interested in Mimi.

437
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,312
That was what I thought.

438
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,647
- Right?
- Yeah.

439
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,858
- Mimi's pretty impressive then, huh?
- Why?

440
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,277
The oldest two are falling
for the youngest girl.

441
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,612
That's true.

442
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,948
Maybe she did a lot of research.

443
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:46,161
Books like, <i>How to Win Over Guys.</i>

444
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:51,166
BE WILLING TO SPARE MONEY AND TIME
FOR THE PERSON YOU DATE

445
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,880
"Be willing to spare money and time
for the person you date"?

446
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,007
Wow, Mimi.

447
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,468
She's like, "I see."

448
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,513
You said something on Day Four.

449
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,808
- You want to go to the beach, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

450
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,103
Apparently, we can go
to the observatory today.

451
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,771
- An observatory?
- Yeah.

452
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,898
After we go to CAP3000,

453
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,609
we'll see the sunset at the observatory.

454
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,736
I wanna do that with you.

455
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,946
Yay.

456
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,296
<i>- Atsushi's coming.</i>
<i>- He's drenched.</i>

457
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,506
<i>- Right!</i>
<i>- He's dried himself already.</i>

458
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,510
MAHO, 30, MODEL

459
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,514
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

460
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:55,772
Oh!

461
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,608
- What? Really?
- Hey.

462
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,526
Wow.

463
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,694
Seriously?

464
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,738
Wow, really?

465
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,781
- The laundry.
- For real?

466
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,784
Oh, wow. You startled me.

467
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:12,331
- It's about time that I do my laundry.
- You want to wash your clothes?

468
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,790
What a coincidence.

469
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,335
It's a bit embarrassing.

470
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,128
He might have lots of swimwear.

471
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,214
- Like, "How often did you swim?"
- More than once.

472
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,842
You haven't met anybody
at a laundry place?

473
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,720
- No, this is my first time.
- I see.

474
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,350
- Good.
- It's closed.

475
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,520
Hey, I wanna ask you something.

476
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,522
You went yesterday, right?

477
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,274
I wanna hear about that.

478
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,401
How was it?

479
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,071
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Oh, really?

480
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,657
- So you guys got along well.
- Yeah, maybe.

481
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,829
If you ask me, I'd say we had good vibes.

482
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,830
I see.

483
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,582
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

484
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,376
But then,

485
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,544
it was raining the whole time.

486
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,171
- Mimi.
- She's here.

487
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,214
This is scary!

488
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,717
Yeah, the sun's finally out, right?

489
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,553
- What?!
- What? Seriously?

490
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,847
- What are you doing?
- Hold on!

491
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,518
- What?
- Wow. Huh?

492
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,979
- I was at the beach.
- Yeah.

493
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,233
Oh, my. Welcome.

494
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,403
- You were here?
- Welcome.

495
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,571
Really?

496
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,532
- Wow.
- I'm so surprised.

497
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,076
- I'm so surprised.
- Me too.

498
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,455
I was heading to this restaurant nearby.

499
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,207
Really?

500
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,503
I was looking for it, and then
it was like, "I know these people."

501
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,965
This was such a surprise.

502
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,217
We were talking about yesterday.

503
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,593
- Really?
- Yeah.

504
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,053
What were you saying?

505
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,098
That it was really fun.

506
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,850
- Huh?
- It was really fun.

507
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,059
It was really fun?

508
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,602
I said that, right?

509
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,105
- You did.
- You said that?

510
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,233
- Did you really?
- I did.

511
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,027
- You didn't come to wash clothes, right?
- No.

512
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,196
That wasn't my plan at all.

513
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,532
You're gonna go eat, right? Is it open?

514
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,950
- I don't know.
- No?

515
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,535
Have you eaten?

516
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,454
Not yet.

517
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,414
- I haven't eaten yet.
- No.

518
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,124
Let's eat together.

519
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,750
Sounds good.

520
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,670
Is it your first time on this side?

521
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,172
It's my first time.

522
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,132
The atmosphere is so different.

523
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,140
Okay.

524
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,559
So, for lunch,
I recommend this restaurant.

525
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,810
Thank you.

526
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,270
- See you.
- See you.

527
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,607
- See you.
- Next time, I'll see you after lunch.

528
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,443
We're by the sea!

529
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,445
- Look!
- Wow.

530
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,031
Let's check the menu.

531
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,616
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

532
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,242
NANAMI, 25, ACTOR

533
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,161
I can't read it.

534
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,123
- Oh, no.
- We can't read it.

535
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,959
Can I order a beer?

536
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:08,131
- Kent said beer is fine.
- Really?

537
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,134
Drinking beer in the afternoon.

538
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:14,971
Here.

539
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,390
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

540
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,444
- Yum.
- This is nice.

541
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,656
You're from Shizuoka, right?

542
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,782
Yeah. Shizuoka.

543
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,492
When did you move to Tokyo?

544
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,246
It was when I entered university.

545
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,249
So I was around 18 or 19.

546
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,250
I see.

547
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,335
You're from Niigata, right?

548
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,045
Yeah. I'm from Niigata.

549
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,839
What made you move to Tokyo?

550
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,134
Yeah. My mom's been divorced twice.

551
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,886
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

552
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,972
- Oh, no. It's totally fine.
- That shocked me.

553
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,475
She got divorced
when I was in high school.

554
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,395
I had something I wanted to do in Tokyo.

555
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:08,567
My younger sister and brother
also wanted to move to Tokyo,

556
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,736
so we thought,
"Why don't we all move to Tokyo?"

557
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,196
And we did.

558
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,031
We're kind of similar.

559
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:20,662
I lived with my mother
because my parents are divorced.

560
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,665
I grew up with my mother.

561
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,625
I didn't want to leave her alone.

562
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,503
So I was thinking of staying in Shizuoka.

563
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,590
But she told me to go to Tokyo.

564
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,467
She wanted you to do what you loved.

565
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,972
I'm really grateful that she said that.

566
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,432
I agree.

567
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,809
Oh, wow.

568
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,852
- Oh!
- Whoa!

569
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,104
This looks delicious!

570
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,939
- Yeah!
- Thank you!

571
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,233
- Yeah. Bravo!
- Yeah!

572
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,486
- Wow!
- Bravo. Wow! Cheese!

573
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,446
This looks good!

574
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,281
- This is a salad.
- Salad?

575
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,034
- Made with fresh produce from here.
- Fresh?

576
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,036
- That looks so good.
- Looks delicious.

577
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,996
That looks amazing.

578
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,498
KENSUKE, 24, COMEDIAN

579
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,001
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

580
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,419
Who wants one?

581
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,718
Beautiful.

582
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,553
Long life.

583
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,890
- Long life.
- Long life!

584
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,433
Yeah!

585
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,063
- They said, "Long life."
- Yeah.

586
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,565
- To wish for a long life.
- So stylish.

587
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,733
Thanks for the food.

588
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,826
It's perfect.

589
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,495
- Perfect!
- Perfect!

590
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,623
- This is…
- Delicious, right?

591
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,501
<i>- C'est bon, c'est bon.</i>
<i>- C'est bon. </i>It's very <i>c'est bon</i>.

592
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,963
Maybe it's time for us to go
because we need to work.

593
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,173
- Yeah.
- Okay?

594
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,800
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Thank you.

595
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:01,137
- You can make it for your family.
- Yes!

596
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,222
In Japan.

597
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,348
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

598
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,017
- Bye-bye. Merci beaucoup.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

599
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,602
- Merci beaucoup.
- Merci beaucoup!

600
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,688
- Au revoir.
- Bye-bye.

601
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,441
You're different from my first impression.
I'm having so much fun.

602
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,567
- Me?
- Yeah.

603
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:18,405
I found out today
that you're very kind, and a gentleman.

604
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,198
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

605
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:28,248
I've never been in a relationship,
so I dream about a lot of things.

606
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

607
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,043
- From reading manga?
- Yeah.

608
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,839
- Yeah.
- No wonder you like tall guys.

609
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,966
- It's always like that.
- Yeah.

610
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,843
I love handsome tall guys too.

611
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,386
I love Yudai.

612
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,096
- You love Yudai?
- Yeah.

613
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,597
Do you have someone in mind?

614
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,976
- I'll be honest with you.
- Okay.

615
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,311
I wanted to pass my letter to Yudai.

616
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,397
But I couldn't.

617
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,776
I think of myself as the intuitive type.

618
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,280
When we met at Margaux,
we sat next to each other and chatted.

619
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,824
Yudai's funny,

620
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,160
and I found him attractive.

621
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,995
He's fun to be with.

622
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,205
But we had the same Wish Letter date.

623
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,709
Another person I hadn't spoken to was you.

624
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,463
I wanted to talk more with you,
so I asked you out.

625
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,839
And today,

626
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,966
I'm having so much fun.

627
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:20,884
Thank you.

628
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,180
I'm having so much fun.
You're so funny and I can't stop laughing.

629
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,015
I find you charming too.

630
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,017
Thanks.

631
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,728
It's really difficult, isn't it?

632
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,106
There's no other way to put it.

633
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,027
Thank you for being so honest with me.

634
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,321
- I'm very outspoken.
- Yeah.

635
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,238
Yup.

636
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,241
I'll be honest with you too.

637
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:52,248
- I spend a lot of time with Kensuke.
- Kensuke? Yeah.

638
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,751
As guys,

639
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,504
we might become love rivals.

640
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,589
- Romantic rivals.
- Right.

641
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,925
But I kind of care about Kensuke.

642
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,927
So you mean

643
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,805
you don't want to become
rivals with Kensuke?

644
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,265
Yeah. He's my closest friend here.

645
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,350
That's true.

646
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,810
So,

647
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,687
what has your love life been like?

648
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,441
The reason why
I decided to join this trip…

649
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,613
was because
I've never truly loved someone.

650
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,157
I love my friends and family.

651
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,325
Like back in school,

652
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:31,204
my friends were like,
"I like him," and stuff.

653
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,914
I heard these stories,

654
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,167
but I never felt that way myself,
so I was worried.

655
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,337
I want to know what it's like

656
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,966
to fall in love with somebody.

657
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,427
That was why I joined this trip.

658
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,806
I think not having digital devices
affects us a lot.

659
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,474
For me,

660
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,560
I really like the love people would have

661
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,397
before the era of digital devices.

662
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,733
- You know those boards at train stations?
- Yeah.

663
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,944
They left messages there.

664
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,321
- I want to experience that kind of love.
- Yeah.

665
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,990
That's why I'm here.

666
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,950
- I see.
- It's really hard.

667
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,495
Yeah. But because it's so hard,

668
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,040
it makes our emotions stir.

669
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,500
- I agree.
- Yeah.

670
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,294
So today,

671
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,256
in this great weather,
with such wonderful views,

672
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,134
we were going, "Wow!" together.

673
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,343
Yeah.

674
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,262
- It was really fun.
- Yeah?

675
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,890
Thank you.

676
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:33,975
Thank you.

677
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:38,438
But today, after I go back,

678
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,191
I'm going to pass
my Wish Letter to Nanami.

679
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,359
Okay.

680
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,528
- After this.
- Yeah.

681
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,282
- I thought I'd let you know.
- Okay.

682
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,329
I'll be very honest with you.

683
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,247
- Okay?
- Yeah.

684
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,542
I'll be seeing Yudai tomorrow.

685
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,211
You really say everything.

686
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,213
You tell me everything.

687
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,299
You don't have to, you know?

688
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,178
Yudai passed his letter to Nanami too.

689
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:15,308
I don't think he's that interested in me.

690
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,728
So I can imagine myself getting hurt.

691
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,314
But it was inevitable, right?

692
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:25,818
He might have wanted to pass it to you,
but you guys had the same dates.

693
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,196
I don't know. He could have exchanged it.

694
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,113
That's true.

695
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,785
I don't wanna say this,
but I did meet Yudai before then.

696
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,622
- So we could have exchanged letters.
- Yeah.

697
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,831
So, yeah.

698
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,210
I'm just scared.

699
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,754
I'm scared of having feelings.

700
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,091
You should go for it
if you've made up your mind.

701
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,968
- I'll do my best.
- Yeah.

702
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,470
I came here only to find love.

703
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,973
That's so cool.

704
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,934
I'm serious.

705
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,186
- You have to go for it then.
- Yeah.

706
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,689
It's like Aru's "Die for you."

707
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,274
- Yeah.
- Our next big quote.

708
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,901
"I came here only to find love."

709
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,989
It seems like these four
could end up in any kind of way.

710
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,574
- Yudai cared about Kensuke too.
- Yeah.

711
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,994
- He doesn't want to become rivals.
- Yeah.

712
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,080
Yudai is kind, so he might back down.

713
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:19,998
True.

714
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,793
It was amazing
that Mimi appeared at the laundry place.

715
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,837
She doesn't show her whole body.

716
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,214
<i>- She has this policy of not doing that.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

717
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,050
- With Maho too.
- It was just her head.

718
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,343
<i>She poked her head in.</i>

719
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,303
<i>She uses everything as props.</i>

720
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,473
- The washing machine.
- She was leaning on it.

721
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,391
<i>Nice.</i>

722
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,435
<i>- She makes good use of everything.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

723
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,311
But she was reading that book.

724
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,397
<i>Does she use that to study?</i>

725
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,857
<i>But have you noticed</i>

726
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,902
how much she takes notes in her notebook?

727
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,447
She might actually be
very neat and organized.

728
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,574
- She probably is.
- Right?

729
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,743
Mimi asked both of them.

730
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,078
- She invited both of them to lunch.
- Yes.

731
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,874
<i>She talked about Atsushi</i>
<i>to Maho in the morning.</i>

732
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,711
- Maybe Maho could get things going.
- She's aware of the situation.

733
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:11,174
It's like how your friends
take on that role sometimes, you know?

734
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:14,427
- I often take on Maho's role.
- You do?

735
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,345
Why would you take on that role?

736
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,767
I'm often asked to join
when my friend goes to have dinner

737
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,643
with his love interest.

738
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,396
Do you make efforts
to make good conversation?

739
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,691
I turn myself
into the biggest idiot I can be.

740
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,695
So, how'd you guys meet?

741
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,573
- He's running the show.
- I see.

742
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,785
I just go to the restroom,
not to be considerate or anything.

743
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,954
- I just act as I desire.
- Like an idiot.

744
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:47,085
That way, I guess
it would make the other guy

745
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,129
seem more conscientious and gentlemanlike.

746
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,255
- Good job.
- Wow.

747
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,757
I act happy and innocent.

748
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,300
I act like Luffy from <i>One Piece.</i>

749
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,177
I'm like, "Yeah!"

750
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,223
I'm often in those situations
without being aware of anything.

751
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,602
I'd be like, "What? Hey! Huh?"

752
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,480
- What?
- Wait, you guys are together?

753
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,481
Oh my God!

754
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,913
How are things with you two?

755
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,833
Do you have anybody you're interested in?

756
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,671
I don't think I've met
as many people as everyone else.

757
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,840
- I see.
- Not one-on-one.

758
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:39,178
So I haven't really
gotten to know everybody.

759
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,889
But are there guys
you'd like to meet alone?

760
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,349
Well, yeah.

761
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,852
- Someone you want to get to know better?
- Yeah.

762
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,186
That's the gist of it.

763
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,105
Are you going to write letters?

764
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,400
I'm not so sure.

765
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,943
You can always write to me.

766
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,903
He's asking you.

767
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,904
To you?

768
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:04,120
I haven't spoken with Kanaka.

769
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,997
What? Really?

770
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,165
Yeah.

771
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,543
I haven't talked with her,

772
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,587
so I was hoping I'd run into her today.

773
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,923
- You didn't write her a letter?
- No.

774
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,717
You didn't? I see.

775
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,054
I don't really want
to meet people by writing letters.

776
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:22,972
Right.

777
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,850
I want to meet them by coincidence.

778
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,934
Yeah.

779
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,688
So, Maho, you still have
your Wish Letter, right?

780
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,939
Yeah, I do.

781
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,692
You need to hand it
to someone tomorrow, right?

782
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,861
- Um, yeah.
- Oh!

783
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,197
I need to do that tomorrow.

784
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,866
Have you decided who you want to invite?

785
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,453
- Who should I invite?
- Oh, wow.

786
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,791
So, what are you guys going to do now?

787
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,960
I'll just wander around.

788
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,962
Just walk around the city?

789
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,381
- Huh?
- What was that?

790
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,218
She's wondering why
Atsushi is talking so much with Maho.

791
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:05,306
- I need to go back to put my laundry away.
- Oh, right.

792
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,642
Right.

793
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,479
Maybe I'll do that too.

794
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,231
What should I do?

795
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,278
I'll leave the tip.
Five euros should be enough.

796
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,447
That was delicious.

797
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,741
- That was good.
- It was.

798
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,743
- Are you going that way?
- Me?

799
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,995
Yeah, I'm going this way.

800
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,706
- I'm going this way.
- That way?

801
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,625
- Mimi?
- Should I go straight, then?

802
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,629
- Mimi always jokes around.
- She's funny.

803
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,131
- You're going straight?
- What should I do?

804
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,218
- I'll go that way too.
- That way? Okay.

805
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,930
- Bye-bye. I'll go this way.
- See you.

806
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,349
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

807
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,517
What are you up to?

808
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,018
You're going this way?

809
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,645
I don't have anything planned.

810
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,355
If you have time,

811
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,065
we could go somewhere.

812
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,276
A café?

813
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,737
We promised to get espressos.

814
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,700
- Wait, I wanted to ask you something.
- We'll do that later.

815
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,993
- Later?
- Yeah.

816
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,454
- We'll talk while we're having espresso.
- Okay.

817
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,207
- There are stairs.
- Wow.

818
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,712
It's suddenly so different from Old Nice.

819
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,629
Yeah.

820
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,677
The buildings
are completely different too.

821
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,971
This is nice too.

822
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,890
Wow, look at that.

823
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,560
It's the sea.

824
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,397
This is really nice too.

825
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,316
- You see it between the buildings.
- Yeah.

826
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,610
They sell souvenirs and other goods.

827
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,404
Oh, it's here.

828
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,447
Here?

829
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,574
Wow.

830
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,912
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

831
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,166
- These are beautiful.
- So cute.

832
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,881
Do you want to try?

833
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,882
Thank you.

834
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,802
Got it.

835
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,186
Here.

836
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,937
Excuse me.

837
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,024
Oh, but this is the back.

838
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,526
It should be like this.

839
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,197
This is really pretty.

840
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,782
It's like the sun.

841
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,701
Maybe the sun is the motif.

842
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,578
- Yeah.
- It's like this town.

843
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,081
It's pretty.

844
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,749
Thank you.

845
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,087
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

846
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,129
That's really nice!

847
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,298
- It is. The design.
- Yeah, it is!

848
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,926
France is famous for soaps too.

849
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,260
Yeah, that's right.

850
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,972
Can I get two of these as souvenirs?

851
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,599
- Really?
- Yeah.

852
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,476
Thank you very much.

853
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,188
Au revoir. Merci.

854
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:03,192
I think I'll get that ring too.

855
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,693
- Sure.
- You can wait outside.

856
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,570
- Can you hold these?
- Okay.

857
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,664
- Merci beaucoup.
- Thank you. Merci beaucoup.

858
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,625
- Hello.
- Hello.

859
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,127
What are you getting?

860
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,878
- A souvenir.
- Souvenir?

861
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,755
Maybe I'll get one.

862
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,803
- Nice. Another olive oil?
- Yeah, it's olive oil again.

863
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,389
- You can only get this one here.
- Yeah.

864
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,683
- Wine too.
- Yeah.

865
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,984
This place is much more city-like.

866
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,444
- Yeah.
- Right?

867
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,113
- They've got The North Face.
- Yeah.

868
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,657
I wanna take a look here.

869
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,076
- I wanna do some shopping.
- Yeah.

870
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,121
I wanna see you in fluffy clothes.

871
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,206
This one's cute too.

872
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,750
- This or this?
- Yeah.

873
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,752
- This one.
- That one then.

874
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,255
It looks good.

875
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,173
Thanks.

876
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,674
How do I look?

877
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,178
- You look beautiful.
- Looks good.

878
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,804
It suits you. You look good.

879
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,890
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

880
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,767
What was that?
She looked beautiful in that?

881
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,769
They're funny but in a stylish way.

882
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,687
Yeah.

883
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,736
It's so sunny.

884
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,321
The sun's in my eyes.

885
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:31,906
It's so bright.

886
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,074
It's so bright. Let's sit.

887
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,701
There we go.

888
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,746
It was like this yesterday as well.

889
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,080
Yeah, it was.

890
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,458
Here. Cheers.

891
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,884
- It's good.
- It's good?

892
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,093
- It is.
- Really?

893
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,011
Yeah.

894
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,554
That's good to know.

895
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,641
Yeah.

896
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,435
- You can drink it without sugar?
- Yeah.

897
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,395
So, about yesterday…

898
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,982
- Was it confusing?
- Yeah! But wait. Here.

899
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,025
Yeah.

900
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,528
- So it's tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.?
- Yeah.

901
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,279
But where?

902
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,698
- I'm not telling you.
- What?

903
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,617
Are you planning something?

904
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,411
It's just…

905
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,081
There's this place I wanna go to.

906
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:25,459
So I need to break that code?

907
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,585
Huh? No.

908
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,753
Let's meet somewhere.

909
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,213
Oh, we'll meet somewhere?

910
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,259
I have the meeting place
and the destination in mind.

911
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:36,845
- I thought I had to guess.
- That's too much.

912
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,516
But I would've had to do that
if we didn't meet today.

913
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,603
But we met, so it's probably meant to be.

914
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,897
- That's fate too.
- Yeah.

915
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,775
We were meant to meet today too.

916
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,571
- Atsushi really wants to go with fate.
- He loves fate.

917
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,740
So if you're free tomorrow,

918
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,867
I wanna take you somewhere.

919
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,911
I'll decide on the destination.

920
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,580
- Oh.
- Oh.

921
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,081
Hey.

922
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:09,795
Could it be
a little earlier than 1:00 p.m.?

923
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,338
Hmm.

924
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,923
It needs to be at one o'clock?

925
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,633
I would prefer that.

926
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,760
But one o'clock?

927
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:21,056
- I actually have plans at 4:00 p.m.
- Okay.

928
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,809
We'll only have a few hours together.

929
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,019
I see.

930
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,647
Yeah. What should I do?

931
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,026
Let me think.

932
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,825
Whoa.

933
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,452
Wow.

934
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,371
Whoa.

935
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,751
CASTLE HILL

936
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,003
This is amazing.

937
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,219
I won't look too much.
I'll save it for tomorrow.

938
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,096
So endearing.

939
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,724
- A recon.
- Everywhere Aru goes is a recon.

940
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,517
- Wait. I got it.
- Okay.

941
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,519
I can move the time.

942
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,021
- Really?
- Yeah.

943
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,857
- I want you to move it then.
- To what time?

944
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,654
Maybe five or six?
I would prefer it to be later.

945
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,197
Then I'll move it to 6:00 p.m.

946
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,657
- Really?
- Yeah.

947
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,075
Wow. Thanks.

948
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,993
I'll move it to 6:00 p.m.

949
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,956
Make a right turn at the kebab place.

950
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,251
Then, go left, walk straight,
and go to the mountain. Okay.

951
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,128
Not the mountain. The castle.

952
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,297
The kebab place is here.

953
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,301
We'll meet here.

954
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,637
We start here.

955
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,226
Okay.

956
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,938
- Yikes.
- I feel sorry for him.

957
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,817
- Yeah. I feel sorry for him too.
- I hope Aru notices.

958
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,986
Four o'clock is kind of an awkward time.

959
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:03,283
Which means he has a plan
that absolutely has to start at 4:00 p.m.

960
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,743
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

961
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,996
Probably to see some nice views,
and then have dinner.

962
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,123
Yes, probably.

963
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,459
- But it might be closed at 6:00 p.m.
- Yeah.

964
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,460
Remember?

965
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,337
<i>It was closed at 6:00 p.m. for Kensuke.</i>

966
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,673
<i>On Day Four with Nanami.</i>

967
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,258
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Aru won't make it then.</i>

968
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,678
My impression of Atsushi changed
after what we just watched.

969
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,221
I used to think

970
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,349
<i>he was the oldest of the group,</i>
<i>but not so used to girls.</i>

971
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,519
I thought he wasn't really
the aggressive type.

972
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,396
Now I get the feeling

973
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:36,900
that he agrees strongly
with the theme of fate.

974
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,320
It's like he's at a different level
from the other members.

975
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,531
- He doesn't even want to write letters.
- Right.

976
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,075
Letters were common
when we had no digital devices.

977
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,660
Yeah.

978
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,579
But he draws things toward him.

979
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,749
- Like how Mimi happened to walk by.
- Right.

980
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:58,505
Atsushi probably wants Mimi
to enter the fate he believes in

981
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,508
by asking him out to meals and stuff.

982
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,970
Nanami and Yudai
went to buy souvenirs on their date.

983
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,723
<i>It's the way Nanami looks at Yudai.</i>

984
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,142
She looks like she's in love.

985
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,645
- They look good together.
- Yeah.

986
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,439
If they get together,

987
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,818
Tohko and Kensuke have nowhere to go.

988
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:26,658
Considering that Nanami
still hasn't truly fallen in love,

989
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,120
she might not be able to differentiate
comfort from actual love.

990
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,663
She might question that.

991
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,290
- I see.
- That's true.

992
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,710
If it's like her past experiences,
she might not see it as love.

993
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,797
She's still trying to understand.

994
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,133
She's here to define what love is.

995
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,427
Yudai may seem charming to her.

996
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,722
But with Kensuke, she can be herself.

997
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,267
She might not know which is love to her.

998
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,393
I see.

999
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,993
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1000
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,245
Wow!

1001
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,830
It's beautiful.

1002
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,456
This is Nice.

1003
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,750
This might be even better at sunset.

1004
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,211
It would definitely be magnificent.

1005
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,590
Let's go to the observatory
and come back at sunset.

1006
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,259
Yeah. We can't miss the sunset.

1007
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,636
Have you ever been to an observatory?

1008
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,555
No, this is my first time.

1009
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,890
Wow, it's pink.

1010
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,475
Oh, wow.

1011
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,393
Whoa.

1012
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,649
Wow. This is amazing.

1013
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,318
Wow.

1014
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,076
The seagulls mewing is nice too.

1015
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,160
Yeah.

1016
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,997
Wow.

1017
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,209
This is so nice.

1018
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,461
Oh, wow. This is amazing.

1019
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,839
Wow.

1020
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,390
Oh, yeah.

1021
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,893
- Huh?
- Here.

1022
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,062
- What?
- For you.

1023
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,856
What is it?

1024
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,109
As a thank-you gift for today.

1025
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,236
- Can I take a look?
- Please.

1026
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,240
Oh, wait. I'm so happy!

1027
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,533
Please accept it.

1028
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,452
Thank you so much for today.

1029
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,786
Thank you.

1030
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,956
- I'm really happy.
- It's nothing.

1031
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,416
I'll treasure it.

1032
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,002
- Can you put it on me?
- Sure.

1033
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,295
Thank you.

1034
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,172
Sorry.

1035
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,882
Just one second.

1036
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,268
Here. How is it?

1037
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,229
Thank you.

1038
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,315
- The green looks good on you.
- Thank you.

1039
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,567
Thank you for coming all this way today.

1040
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,902
Not at all.

1041
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,781
Oh, no. This was so nice.

1042
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,076
I had such a wonderful time.

1043
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:18,538
- So nice.
- This is really nice with the sunset.

1044
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,250
It's like Nanami
is savoring the happiness.

1045
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,585
She's enchanted.

1046
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,587
- She is.
- She's enchanted.

1047
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:31,259
Dear Yudai,

1048
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,392
Do you have plans tomorrow (Day Six)?

1049
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:43,146
I want to go eat something sweet.
Will you join me?

1050
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:49,778
I'll be in front of
Sainte Rita Church at 12:00 p.m.

1051
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,324
He's parachuting at 12:00 p.m.

1052
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,535
- Yeah, Maho.
- Maho!

1053
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,329
- He's parachuting with Tohko.
- Their schedules don't align.

1054
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,634
- Will this do?
- Yeah.

1055
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,928
- It's okay.
- Why?

1056
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,432
Here. Just lift your head.

1057
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,311
Okay. Take this.

1058
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,315
Yeah. Thanks.

1059
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,028
- Have you caught a cold?
- No, I'm fine.

1060
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,988
- You were coughing.
- Huh? I'm good.

1061
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,783
You can warm me up if I get cold.

1062
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,118
Yeah.

1063
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,954
- Wow!
- That was a good one!

1064
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,914
Everything she says is so smooth.

1065
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,833
What are we doing tomorrow?

1066
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,960
Huh? You want me to tell you?

1067
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,795
Yeah. I wanna know.

1068
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,589
What are we doing?

1069
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,510
I wanna go to that place.

1070
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,929
- Parc Phoenix.
- What's that?

1071
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,390
Wait. The botanical garden? Zoo?

1072
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,600
- Yeah.
- Oh!

1073
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,019
- I wanna go there.
- Yeah.

1074
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,646
Will four hours be enough?

1075
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,858
How long do you intend to stay there?

1076
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,819
You have plans,
so we'll be there until 4:00 p.m.

1077
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,362
We have two hours.

1078
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,158
Or around 4:30 p.m.
You'll be back for your 6:00 p.m. date.

1079
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,411
- You need to adjust your plans, right?
- Yeah, I will.

1080
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,248
You need to do that soon.
How are you going to tell them?

1081
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,625
You're gonna write a letter?

1082
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,667
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1083
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,296
Oh, wow.

1084
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:33,840
Whoa.

1085
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,844
- It's so bright.
- Can it get any more beautiful than this?

1086
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:43,058
I can't believe
I'm seeing such a beautiful view.

1087
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,352
I mean, it's just…

1088
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,481
This is amazing.
Thank you for bringing me here.

1089
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,983
This is the best.

1090
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:56,196
I wasn't thinking about
if you'd like observatories or not.

1091
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,533
I just wanted to be here with you.

1092
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,450
Thank you.

1093
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,745
But we're always looking at nice views.

1094
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,580
Shouldn't we go enjoy Nice more?

1095
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,124
Yeah, you're right.

1096
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,085
I haven't even walked along the beach.

1097
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,379
I want to drink wine by the sea.

1098
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,965
In that case,
I have a few places I wanna try.

1099
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,300
Me too. Let's go together.

1100
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,820
He came back from his date with Tohko.

1101
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,573
- To meet Nanami?
- Right.

1102
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,576
But Nanami was enchanted.

1103
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,911
- She was enchanted.
- Oh, no!

1104
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,205
But she did promise him.

1105
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,333
She'll come, right?
She was enchanted though.

1106
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,226
Aren't you gonna ask me anything?

1107
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,396
- Oh, like your plans?
- Yeah.

1108
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,356
- Tomorrow?
- Stuff like that.

1109
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,819
- Well, uh…
- I'm surprised you didn't ask me.

1110
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,573
Of course I wanna ask.

1111
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,490
Oh?

1112
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,701
I do wanna ask.

1113
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,952
I'm curious,

1114
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,829
but you know…

1115
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,417
If you don't say anything, that's that.

1116
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,254
If you don't voluntarily tell me
what your plans are for tomorrow…

1117
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,589
- I see.
- Yeah.

1118
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:38,924
Okay.

1119
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,634
Can I ask you

1120
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,094
what your plans are?

1121
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,512
Do you wanna know?

1122
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,724
- Do you wanna know?
- Yes, I wanna know.

1123
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,143
It was like…

1124
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,354
I got a letter from Aru today,

1125
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,190
and he said let's meet up tomorrow.

1126
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:59,694
Do you see
that waterfall-like thing there?

1127
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,113
It's over there.

1128
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,450
- Oh, yeah.
- That one.

1129
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:09,204
Sho, Aru, and I call that place "Jumanji."

1130
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,499
- We were saying, "Let's go there."
- Oh, okay.

1131
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,708
That's all.

1132
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,418
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1133
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:35,730
Kensuke, you're allowed
to drink and eat more stuff here.

1134
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,983
- It's his habit.
- A newbie comedian.

1135
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,110
That's what comedians do at McDonald's.

1136
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,031
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1137
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:45,991
Wow!

1138
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,201
You startled me.

1139
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,369
Mimi.

1140
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,829
- Wow!
- Oh?

1141
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,539
What are you doing here?

1142
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,624
I'm waiting for someone.

1143
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,126
- Waiting for somebody?
- Yeah.

1144
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,627
I see.

1145
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,255
Who are you…

1146
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,298
Go ahead.

1147
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,258
- I'll be right back.
- Go ahead.

1148
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,307
Dear Aru,

1149
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,274
Thank you for asking me out!

1150
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:23,236
I have plans tomorrow on Day Six.

1151
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:30,327
I'll go to the restaurant
where we first met at around 6:00 p.m.

1152
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,044
So, who are you waiting for? Can I ask?

1153
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,879
- Well…
- You can't tell me?

1154
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,299
Is your date tomorrow?

1155
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,092
- Yeah.
- Oh. I see.

1156
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,428
Hmm, I wonder who it could be.

1157
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,888
So it's like, um…

1158
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,516
You know, before she arrives…

1159
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,268
You want me to leave?

1160
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,231
- I'm curious to know who it is.
- I mean, seriously. Please.

1161
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,442
You asked her to come here?

1162
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:06,321
- I told her I would be here.
- I see.

1163
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,406
I don't know if she'll come though.

1164
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,783
I'll get going then.

1165
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,744
Oh, no. It's okay.

1166
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,871
- Do you want some water?
- I'm good.

1167
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,290
I'm just curious to know who it is.

1168
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,001
- Take care on your way back.
- I will.

1169
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,544
Good luck then.

1170
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,172
Take care.

1171
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,256
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1172
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,966
- Good luck!
- Yeah.

1173
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,344
Au revoir.

1174
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,678
- Au revoir.
- Merci.

1175
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,473
- Okay.
- Thank you so much for today.

1176
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,767
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

1177
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,684
Thank you.

1178
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,563
- I had fun.
- I had fun too.

1179
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,900
- I'll go back while looking at the sea.
- Okay.

1180
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,069
- Rest well.
- You too.

1181
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,571
- See you around.
- Yeah. See you.

1182
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,198
- Good night.
- Thanks.

1183
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,999
- She's running!
- She started running!

1184
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,251
She's running!

1185
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,544
- What?
- Why?

1186
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,065
Nanami.

1187
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,780
- Oh, good.
- Oh, good.

1188
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,699
- You're here.
- Did you…

1189
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,242
Did you run here?

1190
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,160
Yeah.

1191
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,954
Please take a seat.

1192
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,831
- Okay.
- Take a seat.

1193
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:27,879
It's that feeling you get
when you can't get in touch, you know?

1194
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,715
- This was a really good scene.
- Yeah.

1195
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,760
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

1196
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:34,677
Thank you.

1197
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,095
Are you out of breath?

1198
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,096
Not at all.

1199
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,224
- Me? No.
- Okay.

1200
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,684
- Thanks.
- Thank you for the water.

1201
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,854
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, I did.

1202
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,361
Did you run that much?

1203
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,321
Not at all.

1204
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,323
- I'm sorry.
- It's totally fine.

1205
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,162
- I'll drink some water first.
- Yeah.

1206
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:05,083
And here's this, of course.

1207
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,753
I'm sorry it's crumpled up.

1208
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:09,671
It's fine.

1209
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:16,553
If you don't mind,
please spend the day with me tomorrow.

1210
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,304
Thank you so much.

1211
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,098
I'm really happy.

1212
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,683
I'm relieved.

1213
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,768
I passed it to you.

1214
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,521
COME WITH ME
AND I'LL MAKE IT YOUR BEST DAY EVER.

1215
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,605
I'm excited.

1216
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,983
- This is for you.
- What is it?

1217
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,318
- Huh?
- It's wine.

1218
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,820
- Wine?
- Yeah.

1219
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:34,946
- For me?
- Yeah.

1220
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,240
- Thank you.
- And olive oil.

1221
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,242
Oh, then here.

1222
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,286
I bought this for myself, but…

1223
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,204
Oh, no!

1224
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,081
You should keep it then!

1225
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,041
I can't take it.

1226
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,835
I bought two.

1227
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,295
- You bought two?
- Yeah.

1228
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,130
- You don't want it?
- You can have it.

1229
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,048
- Are you sure?
- You gave me these.

1230
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,300
But that's…

1231
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,928
Isn't that a souvenir for a friend?

1232
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,389
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1233
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,724
- Really?
- Yeah.

1234
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,559
What is it? Thank you.

1235
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,144
I think it's soap.

1236
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:09,314
Yeah. It smells really nice.

1237
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,899
Wow. I'll use it.

1238
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:12,900
- Yeah.
- Tonight.

1239
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,861
- Please do.
- Thanks.

1240
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,531
Wow! What's she gonna do?

1241
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:23,494
Wow. I really don't know
what Nanami is feeling.

1242
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,621
Which is it?

1243
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,457
So her date with Yudai went really well.

1244
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:31,461
He had secretly bought her that necklace.

1245
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,712
<i>He put it on for her.</i>

1246
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,423
<i>Up until there,</i>

1247
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:40,428
it really seemed like her feelings
were directed towards Yudai.

1248
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,930
But she rushed to meet Kensuke.

1249
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,390
Was it because she felt sorry?

1250
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:48,019
<i>- She felt bad for making him wait.</i>
<i>- Yes, of course.</i>

1251
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,979
But maybe she was excited to see him.

1252
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,189
How about Yudai?

1253
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,441
When he parted with Nanami,

1254
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:56,944
he said he'll go back
while looking at the sea.

1255
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:01,199
Was it because he doesn't want
to become Kensuke's love rival,

1256
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,159
so he showed some consideration?

1257
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,452
- Thoughts?
- That's true.

1258
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:11,125
Yudai would probably know
the date for Kensuke's Wish Letter,

1259
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,544
and that Kensuke would pass his to Nanami.

1260
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,172
- He would know that.
- I see.

1261
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:20,051
It kind of seemed like Yudai made it
easier for Nanami to go meet Kensuke.

1262
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,512
Have you ever loved
the same guy as your friend?

1263
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,056
It was when I was really young.

1264
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,265
When I was a teenager.

1265
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:31,604
A good friend of mine
came over to my place.

1266
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,982
She kept telling me
that she had a crush on someone.

1267
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,986
I was listening to her, and she was saying
it was someone she shouldn't like.

1268
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,072
We kept talking about that.

1269
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:44,659
She left the room
for a while to use the restroom.

1270
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,828
That was when it hit me.

1271
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:50,456
I realized her crush was my boyfriend.

1272
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,125
- What?!
- I just knew it.

1273
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,628
When she came back,
I asked her and she was like, "Yeah."

1274
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,507
I was like, "I got it.
But you should go home for today."

1275
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,093
- "But"?
- "But"?

1276
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,845
"You should go home."

1277
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:07,473
Talking between the two of us
won't get us anywhere.

1278
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,393
- I said, "Take care," and sent her home.
- You sent her home.

1279
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,395
- Wow.
- Wow.

1280
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,565
My boyfriend called me later.

1281
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,442
I asked him, "What's going on?"

1282
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,153
- He was the one that called you?
- Yeah.

1283
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:24,449
They'd apparently talked together already.

1284
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,367
- Oh, I see.
- I asked, "What's going on?"

1285
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,536
He was like, "I'm sorry. I like her."

1286
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,456
So I said, "I thought so. Bye. Thanks!"

1287
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,332
And you hung up? Wow!

1288
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,168
- So easily?
- Wow.

1289
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,004
I think I was like Nanami.

1290
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:42,175
- I don't think I truly knew what love was.
- I see.

1291
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,677
- So you weren't that attached to him.
- Maybe not.

1292
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,137
You just accepted it.

1293
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,639
- Such a quick turn of events.
- Wow.

1294
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:53,186
I'm freezing.

1295
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,778
- Yudai came to Margaux too.
- Yeah.

1296
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,697
Maybe he went to the sea on purpose.

1297
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,615
True.

1298
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:08,701
Oh?

1299
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:11,788
Two letters.

1300
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,255
Bonjour! Thank you for the other day.
It was so much fun!

1301
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,466
I hope we can go somewhere together again.

1302
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,383
From Maho

1303
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,386
It's from Maho.

1304
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,977
Do you have plans tomorrow (Day Six)?

1305
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,563
I want to go eat something sweet.
Will you join me?

1306
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,233
I'll be in front of
Sainte Rita Church at 12:00 p.m.

1307
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,150
From Maho

1308
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,920
What should I do?

1309
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,597
He could turn down Tohko.

1310
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,890
That's true.

1311
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:33,995
HOTEL NICE RIVIERA

1312
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,137
It's so cold.

1313
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,103
Yudai.

1314
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,731
Yudai? Yudai!

1315
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,065
Wait.

1316
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,984
Your balcony's huge.

1317
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,694
Huh? Is it?

1318
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,113
The besties are like Romeo and Juliet.

1319
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,072
True.

1320
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,033
Do you have two rooms?

1321
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,201
- No way.
- I only have this.

1322
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,787
- I bet your room is bigger.
- It's not fair.

1323
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:18,623
It's not unfair.

1324
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,959
So, are you tired today?

1325
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,587
- I had fun.
- You had fun?

1326
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,880
Wait.

1327
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,257
Can I come over? I wanna hear your story.

1328
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,301
Now?

1329
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,428
Here's a gift while I scout you out.

1330
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,680
For you. You like this, right?

1331
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,432
Potato chips.

1332
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,225
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

1333
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,938
You know what?
My room is definitely bigger.

1334
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,481
I thought so.

1335
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,817
No doubt. Your place is double my space.

1336
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,152
What the hell?

1337
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,820
So anyway, I'm here

1338
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,697
to study my competition.

1339
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,159
- Huh?
- That's what I'm here for.

1340
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,495
- To study your competition?
- Yeah.

1341
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,538
We're always together,
and we're the same age.

1342
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,794
I have a feeling
we might fall for the same person.

1343
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,087
- Just a feeling.
- Yeah.

1344
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,839
Do you want some tea?

1345
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,008
- I want some tea.
- You'll get me tea?

1346
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,760
- I want tea.
- You can make tea?

1347
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,136
Let's drink something warm.

1348
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,180
So, how's it going?

1349
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:19,517
I don't mean like a ranking or anything.

1350
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,645
But who are you pointed towards?

1351
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,230
Well,

1352
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,025
that would be Nanami.

1353
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,485
Just her?

1354
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,153
Well…

1355
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,865
Yeah. I'll see her again.

1356
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,368
- Tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1357
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,125
I see.

1358
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,628
And you? Have you decided on someone?

1359
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,803
- I'm still choosing.
- Oh.

1360
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,558
- I see.
- Between three.

1361
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,435
Oh!

1362
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,353
Is that so?

1363
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,984
That's amazing.

1364
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,445
I'm constantly thinking.

1365
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,613
Back in my room,

1366
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,950
I'm just constantly thinking.

1367
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,962
