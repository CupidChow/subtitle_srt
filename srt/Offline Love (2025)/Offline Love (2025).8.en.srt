- Thanks for waiting.

4
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,279
You okay?

5
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,698
I dropped my bag.

6
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:32,615
Sorry.

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,325
Did you sleep well?

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,161
You know what?

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,620
I was excited for today.

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,205
So I slept very well.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,124
You slept well? That's good to know.

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,126
I couldn't sleep at all.

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,503

00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,397
- Are you sleepy?
- No.

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,774
My bangs aren't set.

20
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,401
- Do you have your passport?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,319
Today,

22
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,154
we are riding a helicopter.

23
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,031
What?!

24
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,825
- We'll ride a helicopter.
- A helicopter?!

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,118
You're joking.

26
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,120
Can I take a look?

27
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,956
- Can I see it?
- I don't have it with me.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,625
Wait, what? Why not?

29
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,251
I forgot it.

30
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,378
- You left it?
- I think I left it behind.

31
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,255
- I don't have it with me.
- Okay.

32
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,468
- Oh, the schedule for the day.
- They're talking about the itinerary.

33
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,262
So, you don't remember
what we'll be doing?

34
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,430
- I remember.
- You do?

35
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,349
A course meal…

36
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,020
in a place known as

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,897
the best hideaway in the world.

38
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,944
It said something like,
"Celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio,

39
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,487
and many others..."

40
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,988
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

41
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,281
Wow.

42
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,867
This isn't Nice, is it?

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,744
Is that Nice? That's awesome.

44
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,247
Oh! Look.

45
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,581
- Huh?
- Is that it?

46
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,874
- That one?
- That one?

47
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,043
Is it that high up?

00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,796
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, wow!

49
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,683
- Hold on.
- Hi. Welcome.

50
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,600
Okay.

51
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,018
Thank you.

52
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,650
Where is it?

53
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,610
Behind you. Yeah.

54
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,279
- Behind?
- Don't look yet.

55
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,698
- You can go this side.
- Yeah. Okay.

56
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,700
- Where?
- Look down.

57
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,618
- Do I look down?
- Look down.

58
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,621
They're holding hands the whole time.

59
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,957
They're looking for
an excuse to hold hands.

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,542
- Can I look?
- Yeah.

61
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,919
Wow!

62
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,382
- It's okay?
- Okay!

63
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,009
- Okay!
- Let's go.

64
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,891
Holding hands again?

65
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,476
They can fly back to Japan.

66
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,937
- We're taking off.
- What?

67
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,938
- We're going up.
- Oh!

68
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,444
- Wow!
- This is amazing!

69
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,904
Awesome.

70
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,053
Look at the city.

71
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,096
We're tilting so much.

72
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,391
Wow. This is beautiful.

73
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,227
I was there yesterday.

74
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,436
- Yesterday?
- Menton.

75
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,604
Oh, really?

76
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,440
- Monaco must be on that side then.
- Maybe.

77
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,318
Wow. This is amazing.

78
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,992
Thank you.

Is this French toast?

82
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,336
Dear Riko,

83
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,466
I want to talk to you in person.

00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,145
I will be at the white bench
where we ate gelato.

86
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,614
What is he going to tell her?

87
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,158
- What could it be?
- Right?

88
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,075
Huh?

89
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,580
French toast, doughnuts,
pancakes, yogurt, and granola.

90
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,002
Definitely yogurt.

91
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:36,919
HONEY

92
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,594
I'm sure this is tasty.

93
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,888
Let's eat.

94
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,648
Yum.

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,408
- Amazing.
- We're in Èze!

98
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,160
This is Èze.

99
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,080
- This is Èze. It's on a cliff.
- It's on a cliff.

100
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,791
ÈZE: 30 MINUTES BY BUS FROM NICE

103
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,090

104
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,174
Wow.

105
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,217
This is nice.

106
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,135
This looks so cool.

107
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,888
- Wow.
- This is awesome!

108
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,272
- There are restaurants here.
- Yeah.

109
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,483
I wonder if all the rooms here

110
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,902
are shops and stuff.

111
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:48,116
What are these leaves? This is amazing.

112
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,535
Where do they grow from?

113
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:55,164
- There's something down here.
- Down here?

114
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,208
This is like a maze.

115
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,543
This scenery…

116
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,379
- I've only seen this in anime.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,215
Which way is it?

118
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,675
Which way?

119
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,847
It says, "exotic."

120
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,848
EXOTIC GARDEN

121
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,558
- This way?
- Let's go.

122
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,645
- What?
- Oh, wow!

123
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,272
This is awesome.

124
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,690
For real?

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,486
Wow.

126
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,788
Whoa. But we can't take pictures.

127
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,415
- No.
- Who cares, right?

128
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,625
- I don't care anymore.
- Me neither.

129
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,420
- I don't need my iPhone anymore.
- I don't need it.

130
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,424
She might quit cold turkey.

131
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,843
Nanami might ditch her smartphone.

132
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,185
You startled me!

133
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,061
- Hello.
- Bonjour!

134
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,646
Bonjour!

135
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,316
- You look amazing.
- Really?

136
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,027
Cute. This scarf is nice.

137
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,279
So, this is how you use a scarf.

138
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,739
- But no.
- Huh?

139
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,365
I chose the wrong earrings.

140
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,159
I messed up.

141
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,454
- You messed up?
- Yeah. It's not right.

142
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,622
Where should we…

143
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,540
Should we go to a café? Or…

144
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,501
So, today…

145
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,545
- We're going to a café.
- A café?

146
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,755
That was cute.

147
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,382
That was so cute.

148
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,137
- Shall we eat?
- Yes.

149
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,805
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

150
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,433
MAHO, 30, MODEL

151
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,643
So sweet!

152
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,148
That reminds me of yesterday.

153
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,651
Why do you like that phrase so much?

154
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,986
You're adorable when you say it.

155
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,372
Where?

156
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,498
Right here.

157
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,457
Here?

158
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:02,959
Or here?

159
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,961
You got it.

160
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,922
Salmon cream gets on your face.

161
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,344
I'm so scared.

162
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,182
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

163
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,992
I'm so happy!
I received a letter for the first time!

164
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,372
- Oh!
- Oh!

165
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,290
You startled me!

166
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,419
The way he walks in is scary.

167
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,380
Why did he head straight
to the map showing who is where?

168
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,715
He'll walk into the wall.

169
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,550
- You startled me!
- Long time no see!

170
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,759
It's been a while.

171
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,345
- Hi.
- Hi.

172
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,223
MEET ME AT 7:00 P.M. ON DAY EIGHT.

173
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,310
Oh, man!

174
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,856
I'm happy, but I'm scared.

175
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,108
I guessed
his name's kanji characters right.

176
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,986
Sorry, I'm talking to myself.

177
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,321
She was talking to herself.

178
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,574
You got a letter from someone?

179
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,908
Whoa.

180
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,201
What are you here for?

181
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,495
I came to see who went where.

182
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,164
Mimi went, huh?

183
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,500
- Well, I expected she would go.
- I see.

184
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,252
Why do you say that?

185
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,379
You asked her out yesterday.

186
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,256
Right. You would know.

187
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,674
I saw on the board.

188
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,551
Yeah.

189
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,930
This is difficult.

190
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,099
Whoa!

191
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,853
CASTLE HILL

192
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,146
We're here.

193
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,690
This is the top.

194
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,650
Wow.

195
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,568
I wanted to come here with you.

196
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,861
Wow!

197
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,489
Someone's swimming there.

198
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,907
- That's Atsushi.
- Atsushi?

199
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,824
Probably.

200
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,034
- From Monaco?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,454
<i>So, we are now heading to</i>

202
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,997
<i>Monaco-Ville.</i>

203
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,956
<i>Monaco-Ville?</i>

204
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,919
<i>It's the most famous district in Monaco.</i>

205
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,836
<i>Wow.</i>

206
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,962
"Have lunch at…"

207
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,381
- Can I see?
- Don't look.

208
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,010
"Have lunch at a burger joint
popular among local youth and students."

209
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,261
That's gotta be tasty.

210
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,140
It says, "The burgers, which can be
customized to your liking, are exquisite."

211
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,642
- Huh?
- Oh.

212
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,811
We need to climb up.

213
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,146
Wow. It's so sunny.

214
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,026
- They look like soldiers.
- Yeah.

215
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,779
They're probably guarding the palace.

216
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,740
- I think the king lives here.
- The king lives here?

217
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,621
- Where were you yesterday? Over there?
- Yeah.

218
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,123
I went to Italy.

219
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,124
- Really?
- Yeah.

220
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
That sounds so nice.

221
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,210
Did you have fun yesterday?

222
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,963
Yesterday? Yeah.

223
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,966
- You had fun?
- Yeah.

224
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,050
That's good to know.

225
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,010
I had fun.

226
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,431
I didn't know
what time you'd be back last night.

227
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,224
Yeah. You surprised me.

228
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,476
I didn't expect to see you.

229
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,769
- Really?
- Yeah.

230
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,731
We're here.

231
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,315
Hmm?

232
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,110
Bonjour.

233
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,242
Michelin!

234
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,452
Bonjour.

235
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,703
Bonjour.

236
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,423
- Wow!
- Thank you.

237
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,382
- Wow.
- Wow.

238
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,925
- Please.
- Yeah?

239
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,843
Huh?

240
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,095
- Wow.
- Oh, wow!

241
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,144
Thank you.

242
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,896
Thank you.

243
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,024
Wow. This is beautiful.

244
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,485
They have so much privacy.

245
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,408
To this beautiful scenery.

246
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,910
Cheers.

247
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,919
It's good.

248
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,170
It's fruity.

249
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,048
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

250
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,426
I never found green peas so tasty.

251
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,719
- Really?
- Yeah.

252
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,845
Wow.

253
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,931
- These are green peas, huh?
- Yeah.

254
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,020
- Did you enjoy the last eight days?
- I did. Very much.

255
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,689
But I enjoy myself the most…

256
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,109
when I'm with you.

257
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,406
Thank you.

258
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,200
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Yeah.

259
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,910
Same here, of course.

260
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,331
That's why I want to spend time with you.

261
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,251
Thanks.

262
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,421
Are you going on a date after this?

263
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,757
At what time?

264
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,385
- At 7:00 p.m.
- At 7:00 p.m.?

265
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,389
- If you have time, do you wanna talk?
- Sure.

266
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,433
- Let's chat over tea.
- Yeah.

267
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,436
I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow.

268
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,898
But I'm thinking negatively
that he might cancel our plans.

269
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,149
I see.

270
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,944
I'm so scared.

271
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,529
I see what you mean.

272
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,115
Hey. Don't say, "I see what you mean."

273
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,619
But he didn't say
what he wanted to talk about, right?

274
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,454
Is he going to turn me down?

275
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,417
You don't have to think that far yet.

276
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,545
He probably wants to see Nanami.

277
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,257
We don't know if it's Nanami yet.

278
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,174
Right.

279
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,719
- Wait. Oh, no.
- Huh?

280
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,636
I saw it.

281
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,306
Wow.

282
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,184
- Oh, this looks delicious.
- Merci.

283
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,936
Let's eat.

284
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,445
So sweet.

285
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,449
I'm so happy I get to eat something sweet.

286
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,366
Me too.

287
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,201
Where do you wanna go now?

288
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,371
Do you have anywhere in mind?

289
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,956
Oh! How about that shop?

290
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,625
Did you go there in the end?

291
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,754
That shop you couldn't go to
because the owner closed it that day?

292
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,631
Was it a vintage shop?

293
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,007
Should we go there?

294
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,342
- I wanna go.
- Let's go.

295
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,551
Yay!

296
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,719
- Let's go.
- Yay!

297
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,554
She seems so happy.

298
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,389
She's so happy.

299
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,893
Do guys become hostile

300
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:41,315
if they have a crush on the same person?

301
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,816
I don't think so.

302
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,734
I see.

303
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:48,322
It's a different story
if a friend stole your girlfriend.

304
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,323
I see.

305
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,702
Isn't it about who tried harder?

306
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,163
Right. I see.

307
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,666
What type of girls do you like?

308
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:04,213
Well, in the end, I like pretty girls.

309
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,798
Really?

310
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,133
- You're always pretty.
- What?

311
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,094
- Me?
- Yeah.

312
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,720
Pretty?

313
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,472
- You always seem to have fun.
- Yeah.

314
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,100
Your face is definitely shaped
by your inner self.

315
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,562
And you're always smiling.

316
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,106
Thank you.

317
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:29,196
I can definitely tell
you've always been considerate of others,

318
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,574
and that you've worked incredibly hard.

319
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,745
To be smiling like this all the time…

320
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,582
and coming to such a far place…

321
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,002
It's amazing.

322
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,839
I got to see that part of you,
and I find you very pretty.

323
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,382
That's how I feel.

324
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,185
Oh, no. Hold on.

325
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,396
I'm happy to hear that.

326
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,692
- Sorry about this.
- No problem.

327
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,195
Sorry.

328
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,116
I'm overemotional.

329
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,161
- You're emotional?
- Yeah, I cry easily.

330
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,495
I mean, it's beautiful.

331
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,955
That's true.

332
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,081
The food is good.

333
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,792
Absolutely.

334
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,800
- She's bursting with emotion.
- Yeah.

335
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,928
But it's probably
just like what Kensuke said.

336
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,638
She must have worked hard.

337
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,807
She came to Tokyo with her mother,

338
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,018
who has been through two divorces.

339
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,854
She had to be strong.

340
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,733
Kensuke understood that,
and her emotions broke down.

341
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,069
He complimented her directly.

342
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,530
- It's her third time crying like this.
- Yes.

343
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,534
- I think maybe she's facing herself too.
- I agree.

344
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,121
I don't think we need to
talk about Mimi and Atsushi anymore.

345
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,750
<i>I bet they're holding hands</i>
<i>even when they're not on-screen.</i>

346
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,959
<i>Yeah. Right?</i>

347
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:11,173
When Atsushi asked her if she enjoyed
Menton with Aru yesterday, Mimi was like,

348
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,883
"I had fun…"

349
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,678
<i>There's no way she had fun</i>
<i>with that expression.</i>

350
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,889
<i>If you think about what happened,</i>

351
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,267
it was shocking enough
that you'd want to tell others about it.

352
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,521
But it's amazing
that Mimi doesn't say anything about it.

353
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,438
And Maho.

354
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,399
- She was cute.
- She can't hold it in.

355
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,068
- She's crazy about Yudai.
- Yes.

356
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,362
She ran towards him
to a very close distance.

357
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,655
<i>She was really close.</i>

358
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,532
<i>She wasn't happy with her earrings.</i>

359
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,242
She was like, "This isn't it."

360
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,494
She was fidgeting suddenly.

361
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,663
<i>Yudai wrote to Tohko.</i>

362
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,332
<i>He will wait for her</i>
<i>at 7:00 p.m. at the white bench.</i>

363
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,667
<i>That's lovely.</i>

364
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,835
Want to use that line?

365
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:52,548
I do. I want to meet up
in such a place, like under a big tree.

366
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,841
Not like Hachiko.

367
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,719
Back in college,
when I met up with people at Shibuya,

368
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,347
I thought meeting
at Hachiko lacked elegance.

369
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,099
So I would change the spot a bit.

370
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,393
It's no longer there,
but for my meeting spot,

371
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,854
I always used the Under Armour shop.

372
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,774
I like it when people ask,
"Where are you?"

373
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:16,029
I love it when a girl who's bad
with directions desperately looks for me.

374
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,576
They'd be like, "Are you outside
or underground? I exited the wrong gate."

375
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,910
I love it.

376
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,080
- I absolutely love it.
- You love that, huh?

377
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,760
We'll have lunch here today.

378
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,554
And I brought canvases.

379
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,722
Okay.

380
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,433
So, we'll paint pictures?

381
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,476
We can paint pictures.

382
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,103
What should I draw?

383
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,898
You can just paint colors too.

384
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,692
What are you drawing?

385
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,319
I'm not showing you yet.

386
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,988
You're not showing me?

387
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,907
I'm not showing you yet.

388
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,033
This is super fun.

389
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,451
- It's fun, right?
- Yeah.

390
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,746
I want you to spend time with me tonight.

391
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,372
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

392
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,249
I reserved us a restaurant.

393
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:14,421
I got a little flustered,
so I don't know what color to use now.

394
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,965
I need to dress up then.

395
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,135
Yes. I think I'm done.

396
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,929
It's a great painting.

397
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,680
- Looks good.
- A great painting.

398
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,849
Our artwork.

399
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,481
What were you up to?

400
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,024
- What were you up to?
- Me?

401
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,567
I wanna know.

402
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,694
Well,

403
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,863
I know you asked Mimi out yesterday,

404
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,115
but I don't know about anything else.

405
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,659
Anything else, huh?

406
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,786
- How about here?
- It's painful.

407
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,663
- Let's go in here.
- Okay.

408
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,624
- Bonjour. Hello.
- Bonjour.

409
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,793
To be honest, my date yesterday

410
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,169
didn't go well.

411
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
- I see.
- Yeah.

412
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,091
For me, I was going all in for Mimi.

413
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,511
- I haven't talked with the other girls.
- Right.

414
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,265
It's not like I want to go
for someone else right now.

415
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,644
If I had to choose someone,
it would still be Mimi.

416
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,106
Couldn't you ask her out again?
How about tonight?

417
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,197
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

418
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,582
MIMI, 20, PART-TIME WORKER

419
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
Yum.

420
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,629
I wonder how many hamburgers
I've eaten on this trip.

421
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,631
This one's the best.

422
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,216
The best, huh?

423
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,218
This is delicious.

424
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,222
Don't you have any more plans with Aru?

425
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,307
I don't.

426
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,517
- You don't?
- No.

427
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,394
I don't. And…

428
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,397
Yeah.

429
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,190
What is it?

430
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,484
I'm not going to Margaux anymore.

431
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,737
- Huh?
- I'm not going.

432
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,238
- You're not?
- No.

433
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,490
Can I ask you out tomorrow then?

434
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,950
All day.

435
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,452
- All day?
- The whole day.

436
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,411
Sure.

437
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,455
The beach, first thing in the morning.

438
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,373
- To see the sunrise?
- Do you want to?

439
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,416
Yeah.

440
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,084
She's not going to receive letters.

441
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,669
- Wow.
- Wow.

442
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,129
That's some tactic.

443
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,469
- Can I try this?
- You should. We're finally here.

444
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,428
Here.

445
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,721
Thank you.

446
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,185
Oh, this looks great on you.

447
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,937
The size is perfect!

448
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,814
- This suits you!
- Whoa!

449
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,608
- This?
- How is it?

450
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,818
Hold on. Excuse me.

451
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,154
I'll turn the hook away.

452
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,990
This looks cute on you.

453
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,742
Oh, wow!

454
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,786
<i>- Oh là là.</i>
<i>- "Oh là là"!</i>

455
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,455
<i>- Oh là là.</i>
<i>- Oh là là.</i>

456
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,748
It suits you very well.

457
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,625
Isn't this perfect?

458
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,211
I'm going shopping today.

459
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,421
I want to buy clothes for tomorrow.

460
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,340
- And for Day Ten.
- Yeah.

461
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,552
- I want to buy pretty outfits.
- That sounds great.

462
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:13,433
We had the same meeting time yesterday.
Yudai, me, Maho, and Mimi.

463
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,729
- We all met at Nice-Ville for our dates.
- Right.

464
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,899
- Yudai is into fashion.
- That's right.

465
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,902
He likes stylish people.

466
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:29,825
I was like, "Maho's and your fashion
go really well together."

467
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,702
Then Yudai was like, "I think so too."

468
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,331
He said he liked that aspect.

469
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:41,878
You might want to keep that in mind
when you go shopping for clothes.

470
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,716
Aru said Yudai looked good with Maho
before giving Tohko his advice.

471
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,345
- Exactly.
- I get what Aru wants to say, but…

472
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,973
What are your plans after this?

473
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,933
It's about time.

474
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,146
I think I'll head to

475
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,731
my meeting place.

476
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,108
- Okay.
- Yeah.

477
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,153
I see…

478
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,197
Okay. Yeah.

479
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,117
I need to go somewhere too.

480
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,619
- Really?
- Yeah.

481
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,789
If it's in the direction of the hotel,

482
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,915
we could walk together.

483
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,459
Yeah, sure.

484
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,759
Let's go this way.

485
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,052
Wow!

486
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,263
This is awesome!

487
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,183
- Wow.
- Oh, my.

488
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,312
Look here.

489
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,315
The hairpin curve.

490
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,984
Wow. This is amazing.

491
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,988
- Wow!
- Wow!

492
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,740
You can see this here.

493
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,118
This is a racetrack
for the Monaco Grand Prix.

494
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,706
This looks fun.

495
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,970
- We'll get a massage here.
- Really?

496
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,640
Wow! I'm so surprised.

497
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,935
- Amazing, huh?
- Yeah.

498
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,520
This is so nice.

499
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,647
She must be really tired.

500
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,023
From the past week.

501
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,566
True.

502
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,974
What color should I use?

503
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,316
To whom?

504
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,734
- To whom?
- To whom?

505
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,237
Wow.

506
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,449
Wait a minute.

507
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,451
This is so cute.

508
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,870
- Wow.
- Look at that.

509
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,788
Oh, my.

510
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,873
- I've only seen this in movies.
- Yeah.

511
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,668
If you want, you can put your robe here.

512
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,877
- Yes.
- Yes.

513
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,963
You can go in the bath.

514
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,549
Merci.

515
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,721
Yay.

516
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,558
- Can I dive in?
- No!

517
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,768
Don't slip.

518
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,228
Be careful not to slip.

519
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,984
- It's hot!
- Huh?

520
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,485
- It's hot?
- It's hot!

521
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,487
- Wow.
- It's warm.

522
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,367
It's really warm.

523
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,124
I'm gonna fall asleep here.

524
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,251
Can I go to sleep?

525
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,838
- Did something come out?
- Yeah.

526
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,715
Oh, no.

527
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,555
I want to thank you for the other day.

528
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:27,103
I will be waiting for you at 7:00 p.m.
today (Day Eight) in front of Margaux.

529
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,534
Hey, now.

530
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,036
I can't hold that many.

531
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,831
Your arm looks big enough.

532
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,709
Wow.

533
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,922
- Let's go.
- Our next spot is our last stop.

534
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,847
We might not be able to meet tomorrow.

535
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,683
- Why not?
- We never know.

536
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,226
We never know what could happen.

537
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,395
That's scary.

538
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,939
I believe we'll see each other
tomorrow morning.

539
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,691
- At 6:00 a.m.
- At 6:00 a.m.

540
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,650
At the beach.

541
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,738
I bet you won't wake up.

542
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,615
- I will.
- How about 6:30 a.m.?

543
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,201
- I'll wake up and come out in ten seconds.
- Really?

544
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,286
- Promise?
- Okay.

545
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,917
- At 6:00 a.m.
- At 6:00 a.m. Promise.

546
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,632
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

547
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,385
She's cool.

548
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,097
Cool, beautiful.

549
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,601
- I'd like very, very beautiful flowers.
- Yeah.

550
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,311
You need a big bouquet?

551
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,564
- Hmm, yeah.
- For present?

552
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,524
- For present.
- Okay.

553
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,841
Dear Maho,

554
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,843
I want to thank you for the other day.

555
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,597
I will be waiting for you at 7:00 p.m.
today (Day Eight) in front of Margaux.

556
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,474
Don't worry if you have other plans!

557
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,391
From Aru

558
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,650
Something he would like. Hmm.

559
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,944
This is pretty.

560
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,865
I choose this one.

561
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,122
This one.

562
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,171
Dear Yudai,

563
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,720
Thank you for today. I had fun!

564
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,141
If you are free tomorrow (Day Nine),
will you go for lunch with me?

565
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:15,605
I will be waiting for you
at 12:00 p.m. at Place Masséna.

566
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,586
Aru sent a letter to Maho in the end.

567
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,173
It might have turned out differently
if it was before Maho's date with Yudai.

568
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,008
- Exactly.
- It's the timing.

569
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,051
Ever since then,

570
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,386
<i>she's been crazy about him.</i>

571
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,137
<i>- She's crazy about him.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

572
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,641
Mimi's tactic of not going
to Margaux is amazing, isn't it?

573
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:56,604
If she receives a letter from Aru,

574
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,942
she has no choice but to decline.

575
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,070
- She doesn't want to run into him either.
- No, she doesn't.

576
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,907
Mimi doesn't talk to people
about the things that bothered her.

577
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:12,036
She’s the type of person
who solves things on her own.

578
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,415
So, right now,
the way she's coping with her situation

579
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,792
is by not going to Margaux
or reading letters.

580
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,754
If Atsushi is willing to meet with her,
then there’s no need to go.

581
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,549
It's like she's declared
that she’s chosen Atsushi.

582
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,758
- I see.
- Yeah.

583
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,178
That's some strategy.
She'd rule the world in a different time.

584
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,222
- That's true.
- Right?

585
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,600
<i>Kanaka and Sho painting pictures was nice.</i>

586
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,935
<i>They were painting. It looked fun.</i>

587
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,646
And Sho went to buy flowers.

588
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,274
<i>He's usually very cool,</i>
<i>but at the florist's,</i>

589
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,567
he was like a cute child.

590
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,568
You're right.

591
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,238
"Cool, beautiful.
Very, very beautiful flower."

592
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,743
Will they start going out on Day Eight?

593
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,661
What will he say to her?

594
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,538
Will he just say that he likes her,

595
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,916
or will he ask her to go out with him?

596
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,920
That's true.
That aspect of the show is vague.

597
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,172
They could start going out on Day Eight

598
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,176
and be a couple on Days Nine and Ten.

599
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,845
- They'd go, "We're in a relationship!"
- Yeah.

600
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,972
They might send letters to everyone.

601
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,849
- Like, "We're going out."
- Yeah.

602
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,935
No one needs that announcement.

603
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,938
Tohko went to buy clothes.

604
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,773
<i>Aru kind of stirred her up.</i>

605
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,483
<i>What Aru wanted to say</i>

606
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,818
was that Yudai likes fashion.

607
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,780
He wanted to tell her
to keep that in mind.

608
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,616
But he mentioned
that Maho and Yudai's fashion matched.

609
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,534
When Tohko heard that, she was like…

610
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:39,123
<i>Even the act of buying clothes</i>
<i>on her own to meet someone</i>

611
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,002
feels like growth for Tohko, doesn’t it?

612
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:47,298
It's things like this
that help you gradually become an adult.

613
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,342
Tohko was open about herself.

614
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,930
By saying that she's never been
in a relationship and stuff,

615
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,265
she was making things easier for herself.

616
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,228
She was making Yudai match her
since this was her first experience.

617
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,815
But now, she’s stretching herself
and trying to match up to him.

618
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,400
To get him to like her.

619
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,860
Tohko learned to stretch herself in Nice.

620
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,197
- How nice.
- She'll come back a new Tohko.

621
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,699
Come back? Where?

622
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,076
She'll be different
when she's back in Japan.

623
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,078
I'd love to say, "You're so different!"

624
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,122
"Are you really Tohko?"

625
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,749
She won't look different.

626
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,306
We've climbed up high.

627
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,685
- We climbed another mountain.
- Yeah.

628
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,688
- We've climbed so many mountains.
- We're above the clouds.

629
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,441
- Whoa.
- Wow.

630
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,071
- Wow.
- Wow!

631
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,364
This is amazing!

632
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,074
- They run so cute.
- They're running.

633
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,118
- The two are adorable.
- Yeah.

634
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,786
Wow.

635
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,621
Whoa.

636
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,667
This is stunning.

637
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,586
- That's Èze, right?
- Yeah.

638
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,254
We've come so high up.

639
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,102
You know, up until now,

640
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,355
I've been saying

641
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,691
that you're really pretty.

642
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:35,281
But I never told you
why I think you're so great.

643
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,533
I never explained that.

644
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,369
- So, can I say everything?
- Yeah.

645
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,830
Well, this will be a bit long.

646
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,458
But I'll say it all.

647
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:55,968
KANAKA, 25, BRAND PRODUCER

648
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,886
Hey.

649
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,930
You look beautiful.

650
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,723
SHO, 22, UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND MODEL

651
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,518
- Here.
- Wow! What is this?

652
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,479
I bought flowers for you.

653
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,980
It's huge!

654
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,650
I've never received flowers
when it’s not my birthday.

655
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,443
I just wanted to give it to you.

656
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,154
Thank you. I'm so happy.

657
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,739
- So cool!
- So cool!

658
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,824
What's with these two?

659
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,200
What is with these two?

660
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,662
It's pretty heavy,
so you can leave it at the hotel.

661
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,788
- Really?
- Yeah.

662
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,125
- I'll quickly go put it in my room.
- Sure.

663
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,376
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

664
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,258
Kept you a-waiting.

665
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,468
I made you wait. Sorry.

666
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,179
"Kept you a-waiting."

667
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,767
- He's so different.
- "Kept you a-waiting. I made you wait."

668
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,894
Oh! Did you get a new coat?

669
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,521
- Right?
- Maybe?

670
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,022
- What?
- Maybe I brought this.

671
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,190
- Oh?
- Yeah.

672
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,525
- Let's go.
- Looks warm.

673
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,484
- This way?
- Yeah.

674
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,610
You picked a place?

675
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,528
- Yeah.
- Oh?

676
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,071
- Of course.
- Wow.

677
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:58,990
Are you cold?

678
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,117
Here.

679
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,369
Which way is it?

680
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:04,912
Like this?

681
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,038
MIMI, 20, PART-TIME WORKER

682
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,874
ATSUSHI, 30,
FORMER NATIONAL WATER POLO MEMBER

683
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,043
- It looks good on you.
- It smells nice.

684
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,133
- Is it warmer this way?
- Yeah. It's warm.

685
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,261
- He put something on her again.
- He gives her every cloth.

686
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,096
He's doing it again today.

687
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,764
Atsushi, the cloth-giver.

688
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,267
It's going to end soon.

689
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,561
It's over so fast.

690
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,607
It's Day Nine tomorrow. Time flies.

691
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,070
- What is it?
- What?

692
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,823
- How is it going?
- What?

693
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,284
Have you decided

694
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:47,538
who you want to meet on the last day?

695
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:02,220
YUDAI, 24, MODEL AND ACTOR

696
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,725
- The white bench.
- It's Yudai.

697
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,352
What will he tell her?

698
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,729
It was on Day Three.

699
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,732
- You sent me a letter.
- Yeah.

700
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,526
I thought you just randomly
put it in my mailbox.

701
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,862
- But I was genuinely happy.
- Right.

702
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,490
I was wondering
what kind of person you were.

703
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,200
And I met you that same night.

704
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,078
Yudai and I were there first.

705
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,747
And then Tohko and you came in.

706
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,877
I was thinking, "I hope she's Nanami,"
before you introduced yourself.

707
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,381
And then I was like, "Oh, she <i>is </i>Nanami!"

708
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,550
"I get to see her tomorrow. I'm excited."

709
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,052
The next day,

710
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,597
I saw you waiting at Place Masséna.

711
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,308
I thought, "She's so pretty!"

712
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,269
Thank you.

713
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,522
It was raining, but you were there.

714
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,774
I wasn't sure if you'd really come.

715
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,652
So, I thought, "She's here!"

716
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,238
We went to have lunch together.

717
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,866
- It was the best meal I'd had until then.
- Yes, it was.

718
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,451
- That lunch.
- Yeah.

719
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,369
And I thought,

720
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,539
"It's because
I'm eating this with Nanami."

721
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,542
We went to look at bags after that.

722
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,003
You picked one out for me.

723
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,173
It was exactly the one
I’d wanted for so long.

724
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:26,178
I've been carrying it with me ever since.

725
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,805
It's like a good luck charm.

726
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,765
Then, we went to the beach.

727
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,811
And you were just shining.

728
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,438
Right.

729
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:39,692
The light from the sunset
was shining on you.

730
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:43,738
I thought, "She's so beautiful."

731
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:49,076
At that moment, I thought,
"I want to be with her till the last day."

732
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,582
You got the Wish Letter
from Yudai that day.

733
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,586
I was devastated
and couldn't get any words out.

734
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,588
But I also received a Wish Letter.

735
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,423
I went to the vineyard.

736
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,258
It was beautiful.

737
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,220
I kept thinking things like,
"Nanami won't see this scenery,"

738
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,807
and, "She won't eat this local dish."

739
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,684
I had fun with Tohko.

740
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,771
But I still thought,
"I wish I could show Nanami."

741
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,316
I was waiting for you
at Margaux that night.

742
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,361
I was all like, "Oh, man…"

743
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,446
But you came.

744
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,448
I was like, "Yes!"

745
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,367
We went skiing.

746
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,620
I thought, "I'll stay by Nanami's side."

747
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,873
I wanted you to help me.

748
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,919
I had so much fun today too.

749
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,422
Since the day we met,

750
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:48,594
I’ve only been thinking
about you during this whole trip.

751
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,139
You're always smiling,

752
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,769
and you're always kind to others.

753
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,112
Someone like that
probably isn't kind to themselves.

754
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,701
I saw that part… of you too.

755
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:18,040
I love you very much

756
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,669
as a person and as a woman.

757
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,928
Thank you.

758
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,855
- I hope I can meet you again in Japan.
- Yeah.

759
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,442
Yes.

760
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,864
You're pretty at each and every second.

761
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,699
Thank you.

762
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,076
It's a bit embarrassing.

763
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,662
The whole time.

764
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,501
So, that was my trip in Nice.

765
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,799
This old woman here almost cried.

766
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,051
- Did you?
- But this was really nice.

767
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:15,389
He said, "Someone who's kind to others
probably isn't kind to themselves."

768
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,933
- That was wonderful.
- A lovely expression.

769
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,186
I imagine it was like that for Nanami.

770
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,105
- She acted strong.
- That's right.

771
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,316
He told her he wanted to see her in Japan.

772
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,569
He's the first one
to say something like this.

773
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,740
She must be happy that he talked about
when they go back to Japan.

774
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,283
Like it doesn't end here.

775
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,451
You're right.

776
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,537
Isn't it nice when humans fall in love?

777
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,457
What are you, a monster?

778
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,084
I love romance between human beings.

779
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,670
I love it.

780
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,467
This looks delicious.

781
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,636
Wow.

782
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,387
Merci.

783
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,308
- Wow!
- This looks amazing.

784
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,768
Let's eat.

785
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,527
- This is delicious.
- Yeah.

786
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,696
So, up until Day Eight,

787
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,573
what was the most memorable for you?

788
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,160
What immediately comes to mind
is the trip to Provence.

789
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,288
That's when I thought,
"I can have fun anywhere with Sho."

790
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,168
The more places we go together,
the more I’m attracted to you.

791
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,336
- Really?
- Yeah.

792
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,088
I'm happy we're together today too.

793
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,422
Yeah.

794
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,093
This way, please.

795
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,594
I love the mood.

796
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,388
- Cute, huh?
- It's nice.

797
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,722
It's cute.

798
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,893
Thank you.

799
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,895
Good evening.

800
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,730
Two people.

801
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,607
White looks good on you.

802
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,151
- Really? Thanks.
- Yeah. White looks good on you.

803
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,528
It suits you.

804
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,446
- What a coincidence.
- This, right?

805
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,948
Yeah, really.

806
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:00,327
- I'm kind of into scarfs right now.
- Seriously?

807
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,913
What is it?

808
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,957
- What?
- What a miracle.

809
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:10,129
I was looking for some clothes just now.

810
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,464
I thought this would look good on you.

811
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,675
And I got this scarf.

812
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,635
What? For me?

813
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,429
Wow! Really?

814
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,139
- For you.
- Thank you.

815
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,183
- The bag is kind of big.
- No problem.

816
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,643
- Can I really take this?
- Yeah.

817
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,894
Thank you!

818
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,607
- He's good at giving presents.
- Aru likes giving presents.

819
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,859
He's actually good at these things.

820
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:38,032
Have you decided
who you want to meet on the last day?

821
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,952
- Well, yeah, kind of.
- Really?

822
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,788
I mean, I'm not going to Margaux anymore.

823
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,624
- You're not, right?
- Yeah.

824
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,339
- I like you, Akkun.
- Yeah.

825
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,845
Thanks. Me too.

826
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:04,391
I smile a lot when I'm with you.

827
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,309
Yeah.

828
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,646
I feel cheerful around you.

829
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,688
Yay.

830
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,113
But I never imagined…

831
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,367
How do I say this?

832
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,704
I never imagined I would feel so excited.

833
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,206
- Really?
- Yeah.

834
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:32,670
I find myself becoming
more and more attracted to you.

835
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,173
I hope this continues forever.

836
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:38,550
Yeah.

837
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,225
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

838
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,143
- Oh!
- Oh!

839
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,937
He kissed her on the forehead!

840
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,355
Is that against the rules?

841
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,524
- Well, is it?
- What rules?

842
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,441
Don't make a fuss.

843
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,527
Shut up, you kiss regulator.

844
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,445
Well, then.

845
00:44:59,071 --> 00:44:59,905
Let's go back.

846
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,240
- Let's go back.
- Yeah.

847
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,242
- Look that way.
- Nice is that way.

848
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,410
Huh? That way?

849
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,121
Not this way. This is Italy.

850
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,956
That's Nice.

851
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,457
- Do you wanna go see Nice?
- Huh?

852
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,043
- Do you wanna go see Nice?
- I wanna go see Nice.

853
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,089
I don't wanna go back.

854
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,092
Look there…

855
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,510
Hey!

856
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,849
Let's go already.

857
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,936
So, what are your feelings now?

858
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,355
Is there anything going on?

859
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:37,651
I think he enjoyed spending time with me.

860
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,613
But I have a feeling

861
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:46,410
Yudai has feelings for someone else.

862
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,579
- Why?
- I don't know.

863
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,123
Time is limited.

864
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,876
You should definitely ask him
how he feels.

865
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,627
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

866
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,505
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

867
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:10,642
TOHKO, 24, ACTOR

868
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,352
You did a lot of shopping.

869
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,148
I bought clothes
for tomorrow and the day after.

870
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,151
May I?

871
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,528
- Sure.
- Excuse me.

872
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,783
Thank you for the letter.

873
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,367
Thank you.

874
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,875
- It was on Day Six.
- Yeah?

875
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:40,756
You told me
that you wanted me to find the one.

876
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,510
Those words

877
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,055
really resonated with me.

878
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,558
I was holding back until then.

879
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,687
But hearing that

880
00:46:55,771 --> 00:47:00,609
made me feel like
it's okay to love freely.

881
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,819
It really gave me

882
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,029
the push that I needed.

883
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,906
That's good.

884
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,246
Is it Nanami?

885
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,668
Yeah.

886
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:28,011
I never really felt
my emotions stirring until now.

887
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,597
But for the first time…

888
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,936
I thought, "I'm feeling nervous."

889
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,731
"I'm excited to go skiing with him."

890
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,526
"I can't wait for today."

891
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,404
I imagined myself on the bus with you.

892
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,574
And I couldn't fall asleep.

893
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,373
I think the reason I feel that way

894
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,709
is because it's you, Kensuke.

895
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,294
I'm really grateful for that.

896
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,428
Can I hold your hand?

897
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,894
- Like this?
- Like this.

898
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,568
Is there anything you want to do tomorrow?

899
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,654
- I wanna go to the record shop.
- Okay.

900
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,699
- Ten o'clock?
- Ten o'clock.

901
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,909
Where should we meet?

902
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,036
- At Place Masséna.
- Of course.

903
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,498
On Day Nine…

904
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,375
You want to see her.

905
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,877
I really…

906
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,296
Yeah.

907
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,591
I really want to see her.

908
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,556
I know this is very selfish of me.

909
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,475
It's not.

910
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,062
We promised to go parachuting.

911
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,484
Can I cancel it?

912
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,443
Yeah.

913
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,199
I'm really grateful for you, Riko.

914
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,283
It's like…

915
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,915
I didn't have many people around me
who would say the things you said to me.

916
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,709
I met a really nice person.

917
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,169
Yeah.

918
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:25,963
Thank you.

919
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:32,844
Thank you… for meeting me.

920
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,608
I wanted to…

921
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,278
tell you that today.

922
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,030
Yeah. Thank you.

923
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,662
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

924
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,999
- I'm the one that's being selfish.
- No, you're not.

925
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,670
I wanted to be
a strong woman until the end.

926
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,046
I'm sorry.

927
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,009
I'm going to

928
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,428
see her after this.

929
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,099
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

930
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,894
Thank you.

931
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,481
- See you.
- Yeah.

932
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,775
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

933
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,573
I really loved him.

934
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,250
This is painful.

935
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,295
She had a feeling
it might turn out this way.

936
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,630
She said that.

937
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,007
But a part of her still had hope.

938
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,968
That's why she dressed up
and shared her feelings to others.

939
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,805
But it hurts
when she's told directly like this.

940
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:43,183
At the end,
she boldly asked, "Is it Nanami?"

941
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,103
- That was great.
- That was amazing.

942
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,188
Tohko is definitely growing.

943
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,898
This is Tohko's story of growth.

944
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,942
- Her growth story.
- A story?

945
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:58,115
She said she wanted to be
a strong woman until the end.

946
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,407
That was really cool.

947
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,701
- That was cool.
- She also said, "Good luck."

948
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:06,248
And after he left, she mumbled to herself
that she really loved him.

949
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,874
I almost cried too.

950
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,169
<i>A kiss on the forehead.</i>

951
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,463
<i>There was a kiss on the forehead.</i>

952
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,174
- She called him Akkun.
- "I like you, Akkun."

953
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:20,053
The way she said,
"I like you, Akkun," was nice.

954
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,972
- It was like a movie.
- In a low voice.

955
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,223
It was really nice.

956
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,892
She was all like,
"Yay," and "Let's have fun!"

957
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,103
But she quietly said, "I like you, Akkun."

958
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:32,482
So, for Mimi,
I think it was after the Aru Shock.

959
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,025
- "Aru Shock"?
- You know?

960
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,777
That sounds like the Pokémon Shock.

961
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:41,116
Everything fell apart once
because of the Aru Shock.

962
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,326
<i>When Atsushi was waiting for her,</i>

963
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,578
<i>it changed everything.</i>

964
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,122
Her tactics and calculations
all broke down.

965
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,748
- That's true.
- In a way.

966
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:53,628
I think Mimi also had
a sort of breakthrough during this trip.

967
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,005
- At that moment.
- Yeah.

968
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,216
And of course,
the same goes for Nanami and Kensuke.

969
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,304
<i>I liked how she said</i>
<i>she had never felt her emotions stirring.</i>

970
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,390
And then Kensuke asked,
"Can I hold your hand?"

971
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,017
That was really stylish.

972
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,061
- That was pretty impressive.
- I agree.

973
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,273
- Did you approve of that?
- That was impressive.

974
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,524
Kensuke was good.

975
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,111
I think he let Nanami hold his hand
without getting embarrassed.

976
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,279
It was old-school.

977
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,114
- Old-school?
- Like in the Showa era.

978
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,866
It was manly.

979
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,492
Like, "May I hold your hand?"

980
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,746
- "May I?"
- You sound old-fashioned.

981
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,789
You're like a Showa movie star.

982
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,626
You know what? This show is great.

983
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,462
I really like it.

984
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,673
I know I'm the one
hosting this show, but still.

985
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,092
I mean, things would
turn out this way in real life.

986
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,594
- It's obvious, right?
- Yeah.

987
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,764
There would normally be an event
like confessing on Day Ten.

988
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,766
- But not on this show.
- That's right.

989
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,602
That's why people
start confessing on Day Eight.

990
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,479
They kind of start dating

991
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,439
and talk about when they return to Japan.

992
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,357
- Right.
- Yeah.

993
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,108
- That's true.
- It's nice.

994
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,653
- Will Yudai meet Nanami after this?
- Right.

995
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,155
<i>- She asked him to wait at Margaux.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

996
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,368
<i>- Knowing Nanami, she would probably go.</i>
<i>- What will she do there?</i>

997
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,663
Yudai might get rejected on the spot.

998
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,832
- But he canceled his plans with Tohko.
- Exactly.

999
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,043
He canceled the parachuting date.

1000
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,836
It's tough on the parachuting shop too.

1001
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,674
- Is Tohko going to go parachuting alone?
- She won't.

1002
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,342
You never know.

1003
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,844
She might fly with all her clothes.

1004
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,638
She won't use them to fly.

1005
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,143
Seriously, waiting at Margaux
without a phone is tough.

1006
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,060
I agree.

1007
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,414
He was drinking red wine.

1008
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,376
He had red wine.

1009
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,547
We keep updating
our number one memory of Nice.

1010
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,382
- Yeah.
- Our top memory of Nice.

1011
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,884
I really enjoyed today.

1012
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,094
It was wonderful.

1013
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,180
Okay.

1014
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,017
You wanna talk a bit more?

1015
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,062
We've been together since Day Three.

1016
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,647
I never shared my feelings with you.

1017
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,067
- Oh.
- "Oh"?

1018
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,573
I like you.

1019
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:15,622
It's embarrassing
when you say it out loud.

1020
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,084
- I wanted to tell you properly.
- Thank you.

1021
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,753
How about you?

1022
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,339
I don't really wanna ask.

1023
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:28,843
I want to take until Day Ten
to carefully organize my words

1024
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,138
and share them with you.

1025
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,599
- Wow.
- Oh?

1026
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,017
She's taking her time.

1027
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,103
- I see.
- Hmm.

1028
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,124
- Hi.
- Hi.

1029
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,917
Sorry I'm late.

1030
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,461
- No problem at all.
- I'm sorry.

1031
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,046
Phew.

1032
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,508
- Thank you.
- Oh, no.

1033
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,343
If you don't mind,

1034
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,264
if you have time tomorrow, on Day Nine,

1035
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,183
I want you to go on a date with me.

1036
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,315
Can I go get something to drink?

1037
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,985
- Of course!
- Sorry about that.

1038
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,661
She's going to
the record shop in the morning.

1039
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,414
- But how much will she say?
- Yeah.

1040
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,754
- Oh! Thank you.
- It's okay.

1041
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,428
Um,

1042
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,264
I heard you're going out

1043
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,642
with Tohko tomorrow.

1044
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,060
I…

1045
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,563
I canceled that.

1046
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,482
What?

1047
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,152
I really want to go

1048
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,615
on a date with you one last time.

1049
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,201
And I want to

1050
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:23,625
tell you my honest feelings.

1051
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,129
Hmm.

1052
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,425
I have plans

1053
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,804
to go on a date with Kensuke tomorrow.

1054
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,310
Can I see you just for a little bit?

1055
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,065
Can I have some time to think?

1056
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,483
Yes. No problem.

1057
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,235
Of course.

1058
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,320
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

1059
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,662
What should I do?

1060
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,177
I wanted to see him tomorrow.

1061
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,930
Yeah, let it all out tonight.

1062
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,848
Let's cry.

1063
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,851
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, tomorrow.

1064
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,728
- We'll see.
- Are you excited?

1065
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,355
- Anxious?
- Nervous.

1066
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,606
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

1067
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,191
- In a good way?
- In a good way.

1068
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,818
- That's nice.
- Right?

1069
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,653
It was worth coming on this trip.

1070
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,071
- Right?
- Yeah.

1071
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,241
Just now,

1072
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:42,620
a lady gave me a flower during dinner.

1073
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,289
I'll give it to you.

1074
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,040
- Really?
- Yeah.

1075
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,585
- Are you sure?
- Good luck tomorrow.

1076
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,587
- Thank you.
- Rest well.

1077
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,673
- Thanks.
- Good night.

1078
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,757
Take care.

1079
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,385
He does so well when he's drunk.

1080
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,805
He's useless until he has some alcohol.

1081
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,516
- He's best when drunk.
- It's like drunken boxing.

1082
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,104
- I want to see her on the last day.
- Right.

1083
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:12,025
- They might not choose us.
- Yeah.

1084
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,401
Yudai too.

1085
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,069
- Was it yesterday?
- Yeah.

1086
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,946
He handed his Wish Letter

1087
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,823
to Nanami.

1088
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,866
But yesterday,

1089
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,452
he went to Grasse.

1090
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,496
- Right. Maho asked him out.
- Yeah.

1091
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,083
I think Yudai is really torn as well.

1092
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,726
I promised Kensuke

1093
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:52,190
that we will go on a date tomorrow.

1094
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,652
I want to go on that date.

1095
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,950
In that case, if I happen to

1096
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,537
see you in the city,

1097
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:11,000
would it be possible
to have a little bit of time to talk?

1098
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,670
Is that okay?

1099
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:15,421
Yes.

1100
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,050
Okay. Thank you.

1101
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,386
Sorry I took so long.

1102
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,139
- No, I apologize. You must be tired.
- That's okay.

1103
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,933
If he meets her in the city?

1104
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,477
- Is he going to test his fate?
- I see.

1105
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,188
- Good night.
- Good night.

1106
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,362
Dear Yudai,

1107
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,281
Thank you for today. I had fun!

1108
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:27,702
If you are free tomorrow (Day Nine),
will you go for lunch with me?

1109
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:31,372
I will be waiting for you
at 12:00 p.m. at Place Masséna.

1110
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,457
From Maho

1111
