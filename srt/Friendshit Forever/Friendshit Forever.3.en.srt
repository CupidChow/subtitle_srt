1
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:10,481
Thanks.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,642
Still thinking about Wawwa?

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,886
Not really.

4
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:25,520
I just can’t believe
that Wawwa could be like that.

5
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:32,231
Sometimes we think we know someone well,
but turns out we barely know them at all.

6
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:35,803
Hey.

7
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,706
Am I just giving you too much trouble?

8
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,795
With the scholarship, and your family stuff,

9
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,251
you’ve already got enough stress.

10
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,958
I don’t mind, especially when it’s about you.

11
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:49,765
I’d worry for you anytime.

12
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:51,822
What are you saying?

13
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,022
I’m not joking.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,566
If it’s about you,

15
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:58,325
nothing else matters.

16
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:10,684
I know this probably isn’t the right time
to say something like this, but still

17
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:13,850
I don’t want to wait anymore.

18
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:32,772
Tulip, will you be my girlfriend?

19
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:36,977
I promise, I’ll take care of you the best I can.

20
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,129
HEY, PICK UP! IT’S URGENT!

21
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,336
Namo!

22
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,668
Wawwa?

23
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:53,638
Have you seen Tulip?

24
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:55,717
No, why? What’s wrong?

25
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,476
Tulip has to know this. She’s in danger!

26
00:01:58,476 --> 00:01:59,157
What’s going on?

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,000
I asked one of Baikhaw’s old school friends
about why she got canceled at her school.

28
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:23,189
Back then,

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,948
Everyone suspected Baikhaw did it.

30
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:28,382
But there wasn’t enough proof, 
so she got away.

31
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:32,602
And the incident with that senior 
wasn’t that simple..

32
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:35,040
That senior had a boyfriend.

33
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:38,550
And rumor has it 
that Baikhaw stole him from her.

34
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:43,729
Mhm.

35
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,622
Let’s give it a try.

36
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,321
Please take care of me.

37
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:51,223
I’d be glad to.

38
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,660
We have to tell Tulip now!

39
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:57,986
Okay, I’ll help look for her too.

40
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:58,553
Yeah.

41
00:02:58,968 --> 00:02:59,731
Please help me.

42
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:20,634
Finally...

43
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:28,278
Shit! Hello? Namo?

44
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:30,436
(Tulip’s not picking up. 
Where are you, Wawwa?)

45
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,350
I’m in the bathroom—had to pee.

46
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,284
I’m leaving now.

47
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,960
(Hello? Wawwa? Still there?)

48
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:40,835
Namo! Help! I’m stuck inside the bathroom!

49
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,160
(Okay, I’m coming right now!)

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,849
Hello? Don’t hang up yet. Hey!

51
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,778
Shit!

52
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,226
Why hang up now?!

53
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:25,743
Stop!

54
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:29,853
Somebody help!

55
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,545
Help me!

56
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:04,548
GOING TO BED NOW. SWEET DREAMS.

57
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,196
SWEET DREAMS, MY GIRL.

58
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:16,987
Baikhaw.

59
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,702
I’m dating Tulip now.

60
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,987
I did everything you told me to.

61
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:30,595
I’ll carry it for you.

62
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,355
That’s alcohol.

63
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,496
This is mine but…

64
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,974
I only had water in it, not alcohol.

65
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,167
It shouldn’t be that bad.

66
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,878
Probably just redness.

67
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,218
Now it’s time you gave me my reward.

68
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:01,549
What happened?

69
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:05,509
Wawwa just discovered something about Baikhaw.

70
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,299
You're living with someone who's… highly dangerous.

71
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,230
Make her fall for you completely.

72
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:18,528
Then, leave her.

73
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,568
I love you guys so much.

74
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,361
Love you all.
