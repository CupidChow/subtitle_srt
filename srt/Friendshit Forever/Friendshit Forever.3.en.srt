4
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:14,025
He called and explained.

5
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:17,160
Hey, if you’re not okay with it, I can drop out.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,931
No, no, don’t.

7
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,311
I shouldn’t have listened to anyone else.

8
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:20,866
Who told you?

9
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:28,034
Wawwa, are you okay?

10
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:30,971
I don’t know. It was dark. I couldn’t see anything.

11
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:32,773
Can you remember anything?

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,041
I splashed chemical fluid on their inner leg.

13
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,467
How bad was the burn?

14
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:39,363
It shouldn’t be that bad. Probably just redness.

15
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:40,760
Calm down.

16
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,032
Shit!

17
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:47,640
Whoa!

18
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:55,212
Hey, what happened to you?

19
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:57,312
I spilled some chemicals at home.

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,256
Sorry.

21
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:05,345
But when I fought back,

22
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:08,202
I splashed chemical fluid on their inner leg.

23
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:09,706
The inner leg?

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,714
What chemical was it?

25
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:18,053
Liquid chlorine. I didn’t screw the cap on tight.

26
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:21,140
and when I put it down, it spilled.

27
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,545
It’s on me for placing it wrong. It’s fine.

28
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:25,796
I’ll go shower first.

29
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:26,296
Yeah.

30
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:27,008
Be right back.

31
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:42,759
Can’t sleep?

32
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,675
Mm.

33
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,403
Baikhaw.

34
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:54,743
What are you doing?

35
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,298
So you found out, huh?

36
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:09,075
Don’t, Baikhaw.

37
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:14,075
Ow! Baikhaw, let me go.

38
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,805
Let go of me!

39
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:00,337
You’re awake?

40
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:02,727
Eat.

41
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,264
You made it yourself?

42
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,480
Yeah, I did.

43
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,724
How’s your leg wound?

44
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,038
It’s okay.

45
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,403
Want some tea?

46
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:45,396
I’m good.

47
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,098
Baikhaw,

48
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,020
you’re sure, right?

49
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:55,653
The wound on your leg 
was really from chlorine.

50
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,653
Of course, I’m sure.

51
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,740
I spilled it myself. I’d know.

52
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:13,157
Why?

53
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,520
You suspect me of something?

54
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:28,155
Can I take a look?

55
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,010
It’s just…

56
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,561
Wawwa told me

57
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:39,846
the person who attacked her in the dark room

58
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,457
got splashed with chemicals,

59
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,249
probably in the same spot as yours.

60
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:50,901
So you think I did it?

61
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,830
I don’t know.

62
00:08:57,062 --> 00:08:58,172
That’s why I’m asking.

63
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:02,033
You really suspect me?

64
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,341
Will you show me or not?

65
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,428
I’m asking you for real.

66
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:11,918
I…

67
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,399
Why would I hurt Wawwa?

68
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:17,985
I don’t know.

69
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:20,486
So you don’t know, 
and you’re accusing me anyway?

70
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:22,386
If you insist you didn’t do it,

71
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,042
then just let me see.

72
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:26,320
That’s all you want, right?

73
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,119
Yeah.

74
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,698
And that wound you mentioned,

75
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,190
how bad was the burn?

76
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,031
It shouldn’t be that bad.

77
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:43,769
Probably just redness.

78
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:50,762
Happy now?

79
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:54,057
I’m sorry.

80
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:57,332
Hey, if you still don’t believe me, 
I can show you this.

81
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:00,228
Here.

82
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:02,878
What is it?

83
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:06,044
The stuff I spilled on my leg.

84
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:07,606
I had to take it to the doctor.

85
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,781
You still don’t believe me?

86
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:15,240
What are you doing?

87
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:16,996
I’ll pour it to show you.

88
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:17,954
What are you doing?

89
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,106
- I’m going to pour it on my leg to show you.
- You’re going to pour it on yourself?

90
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,872
Will you believe me then?

91
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:25,914
I believe you.

92
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:27,806
I believe you.

93
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:35,278
I’m sorry.

94
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,172
I’m starting to wonder 
what you really think of me.

95
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,863
What kind of person do you think I am?

96
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:53,114
I’m with you every day.

97
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,105
How could you think I’d do that to Wawwa?

98
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,600
I don’t know, I really don’t. I’m sorry.

99
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,332
I’m sorry. I just don’t know.

100
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,534
You damn well know 
I’ve dealt with this my whole life.

101
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:21,079
Everyone believes what other people say.

102
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,229
No one ever asks me if it was me.
And I sure as hell didn’t do anything.

103
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:25,298
I know.

104
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:31,755
Honestly, I thought you might be different.

105
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:41,612
Hey…

106
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,872
But I guess I was wrong.

107
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,117
Don’t say that.

108
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,535
I said I’m sorry. I really don’t know.

109
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,425
I don’t know.

110
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:55,644
I don’t know why I doubted you like that.

111
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:56,593
I’m sorry.

112
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,732
I’m sorry, okay?

113
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:03,408
Truly sorry.

114
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:09,656
Forget it.

115
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:11,976
I’m used to it.

116
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,211
Hey!

117
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,806
I’M SORRY, BAIKHAW
FOR MISUNDERSTANDING YOU.

118
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,104
Tao.

119
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,062
You scared me! What are you doing?

120
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,815
What’s up?

121
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,665
You’ve been sitting there 
with a blank face for a while.

122
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,643
Baikhaw and I had a fight.

123
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,863
Since this morning, 
she still hasn’t replied to my text.

124
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,240
Whoa. Was it that bad?

125
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,444
Yeah.

126
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:51,555
It’s my fault.

127
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:55,949
Hmm. Then I’d say keep apologizing.

128
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:57,947
Baikhaw should understand.

129
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,684
When it comes to you, 
she’s soft-hearted anyway.

130
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,387
Why do you think that?

131
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:04,939
Well…

132
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,805
Baikhaw loves you truly.

133
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:08,509
She doesn’t really get close to many people.

134
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:09,640
I mean,

135
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,110
she really cares about you.

136
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:20,548
Tulip.

137
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:21,447
Sit with me?

138
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:22,089
No, thanks.

139
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,810
Why are you avoiding me?

140
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:26,987
I’ve got class. I need to go.

141
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,566
Why didn’t you reply to my text?

142
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,205
I called you—

143
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,053
If I didn’t reply, isn’t it obvious 
that I don’t want to talk?

144
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,168
I already apologized.

145
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:37,486
Why can’t you understand?

146
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,133
I understand.

147
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,426
But I don’t forgive you.

148
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:46,600
Think you’re all that?

149
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,512
Hey, what the hell?

150
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,846
Mind your own damn business.

151
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:50,919
Jerk, she’s my friend.

152
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,712
Tulip, you know what?

153
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:55,592
Your friend…

154
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,144
she’s so slutty.

155
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:58,501
Hey, what are you saying?

156
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:01,952
She’s no better than me.

157
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:03,444
Baikhaw…

158
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,400
she’s a liar.

159
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,151
You piece of shit!

160
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:07,497
A liar?

161
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:08,453
What’s your problem?

162
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:10,685
With a mouth like yours, 
you don’t need food.

163
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:11,620
Try my fist!

164
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,101
Hey!

165
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,422
Get up!

166
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,256
Tao!

167
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:19,927
Calm down!

168
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,240
- That’s enough, Tao.
- Let me go! Let go!

169
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,152
Easy, man.

170
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,330
Sorry.

171
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,827
Because of me, you were dragged 
into Q's insane rant.

172
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,231
He’s rabid.

173
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:32,981
He bites anyone in sight.

174
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,268
About this morning…

175
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,309
I’m sorry, too.

176
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:43,696
I shouldn’t have thought that of you.

177
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,094
Just taking care of your mom 
must be exhausting.

178
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,347
And you still have to deal with me.

179
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,156
Forget it.

180
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,165
Don’t worry. I’m chill.

181
00:14:58,228 --> 00:14:59,763
But when you snapped at Q,

182
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,034
I thought you were so cool.

183
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,044
What’s with you?

184
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:09,949
Can I sign up to be your FC?

185
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:11,794
Can I be your stan?

186
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,355
Ew, no! That’s scary.

187
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:15,228
Oh, come on.

188
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:15,921
You’re just…

189
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,144
way too grossed out by me, aren’t you?

190
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,348
You’re kinda weird.

191
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:21,553
Tao,

192
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,156
you okay?

193
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,352
Mm.

194
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,216
The teacher called me in about the fight.

195
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,003
It affects my scholarship.

196
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:30,330
I could even lose it.

197
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,548
Whoa!

198
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,075
That serious?

199
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:34,502
Yeah.

200
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:38,413
But he said he’ll try to sort it out,
and let me know how it goes.

201
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,184
How are you two now?

202
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,104
Don’t worry about us. We're fine.

203
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:45,514
Worry about yourself.

204
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:47,548
If you lose the scholarship, 
what will your family say?

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,115
I’m stressed as it is.

206
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:52,984
Something going on at home?

207
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,808
It’s not a money problem at home.

208
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:02,016
But being a scholarship student
is a matter of pride for my family.

209
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,770
That’s a lot of pressure.

210
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:09,720
Can I ask you something?

211
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:11,105
Hmm?

212
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:15,109
Why does Baikhaw know about your family?

213
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:21,693
I mean…
I know you were at the same school,

214
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:24,764
but I didn’t think you two were that close.

215
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:28,301
Even I don’t know about your family.

216
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:29,518
What’s this?

217
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,341
Are you sulking?

218
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,299
Do you… like me or something?

219
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,555
No.

220
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:37,577
I’m just asking.

221
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,969
About my family,
most of my old classmates know.

222
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:46,777
I’ve always been on scholarship,
and I’d complain about it to friends.

223
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,572
Baikhaw must’ve heard it.

224
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:05,743
Hello, Wawwa.

225
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:11,896
Hold on. Pause it.

226
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:14,655
Ugh.

227
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:17,425
It’s all dark. I can’t see anything.

228
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,030
Hey, do you have another angle?

229
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,544
No, that’s all we’ve got.

230
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,657
Could you try checking for more, just in case?

231
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,991
The other cameras are broken.

232
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,948
Only a few were recording.

233
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:33,523
Look, my friend was assaulted.

234
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:34,875
Could you please help us out?

235
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:35,933
Hey, kid.

236
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,812
Be honest. Are you drunk?

237
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:38,713
Huh?

238
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:40,326
What?

239
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,468
Drunk students who come in and act weird
always use this excuse.

240
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:45,163
Ugh.

241
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,726
Okay, I admit I was hungover that day,

242
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,732
but I wasn’t actually drunk.

243
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:53,386
Hungover’s basically the same as drunk.

244
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:54,819
Hey, why would you say that?

245
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:58,038
If I’d known I had to watch some drunk’s clip, 
I wouldn’t have.

246
00:17:58,038 --> 00:17:58,998
It’s a waste of my time.

247
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:00,290
Wow.

248
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:05,152
Alright then,
please just save the clip for us.

249
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,090
Unbelievable.

250
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,211
Our campus guards are assholes.

251
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:16,875
Let’s stop watching.

252
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,998
It doesn't matter.
Nobody believes me anyway.

253
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,024
I believe you.

254
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,479
You’d have to be so wasted to be that out of it.

255
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,432
It doesn’t add up.

256
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:27,126
I wasn’t drunk.

257
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,073
Just a little hungover.

258
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,048
Okay, and

259
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,729
that chemical you splashed on the attacker,

260
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:40,000
you’re sure it wouldn’t cause a second 
or third-degree burn?

261
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:41,618
Yeah.

262
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,011
I’m sure.

263
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:45,596
It should just be a minor burn.

264
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:47,186
Why are you asking?

265
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,674
Well, if the attacker’s got a wound,

266
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,859
I think it’ll be easier to find them.

267
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,242
Do you remember anything else, Wawwa?

268
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:01,263
When I was fighting the attacker,

269
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,951
I think I grabbed a necklace,

270
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:06,769
or something like that.

271
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,460
Ugh! I still can’t recall.

272
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:11,115
I was terrified.

273
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,780
All I could think of was running for my life.

274
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:14,331
It’s okay. Take your time.

275
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:15,720
Tulip.

276
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:16,860
Wanna head home?

277
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,525
Mm.

278
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,457
See you. Keep me posted.

279
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,397
Bye.

280
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:23,892
What should we eat today?

281
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:25,255
Let go of me!

282
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:30,868
Baikhaw!

283
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:31,517
What the hell?

284
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:32,453
Why did you attack me?

285
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:33,242
Do what to you?

286
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:36,621
A star pendant
just like the attacker’s. I remember now.

287
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:39,001
Answer me!

288
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,540
Why did you do that to me?

289
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:49,319
Don’t you notice
every time something happens, her mom’s sick.

290
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:51,570
You should take me 
to visit your mom sometime.
