Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,109
Make sure she falls for you,

5
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:18,498
then you dump her.

6
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:20,241
If you do it,

7
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,306
I… will be yours forever.

8
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,209
I love you guys so much.

9
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,020
I always believed that

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,155
if you’re real with someone,
they’ll be real with you.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,141
I’m really glad
that I have you and Baikhaw with me now.

12
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:38,970
Baikhaw…

13
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,397
I don’t want to hurt Tulip anymore.

14
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:50,022
The more time I spend with her,

15
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:52,813
the more I feel bad for her.

16
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,421
It’s okay if you don’t want to do it anymore.

17
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,055
Just forget it.

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,224
You want her to have nothing left.

19
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,482
No friends, no family.

20
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:08,401
Why?

21
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:10,264
I have my own reason.

22
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:12,682
What reason…

23
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,545
You seem awfully concerned for her.

24
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:24,153
Do you like her?

25
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:27,010
No.

26
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:29,080
You’re my one and only.

27
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:32,968
Prove it.

28
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:38,529
Prove it that I really am your one and only.

29
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,039
Get things done with Tulip.

30
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,403
I promise…

31
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,353
We’ll be together.

32
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,665
Okay.

33
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:35,335
I’ll do whatever you say.

34
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:21,548
You okay?

35
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:27,448
My dad came to see me yesterday.

36
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,135
Oh?

37
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,378
He said he had been trying to call me,

38
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,663
but couldn’t get through.

39
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:39,319
You sure he wasn’t just making excuses?

40
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,775
No, it’s…

41
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:43,432
His number was blocked.

42
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,916
It was?

43
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:51,453
When did I even block his number?

44
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,390
I don’t get it.

45
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,035
I thought he didn’t want to see me,

46
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,472
and didn’t want to talk to me anymore.

47
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,875
But it was actually because
he couldn’t get in touch with me

48
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,316
because I blocked his number?

49
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,505
You’re always with me.

50
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,752
Do you remember seeing me block him?

51
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:21,974
How’d I know that?

52
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:23,926
Maybe you did it when you were drunk?

53
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,478
When I was drunk?

54
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:29,122
Yeah.

55
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:32,262
When you were wasted that day,

56
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:34,684
you mentioned your dad.

57
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:37,256
I mentioned my dad?

58
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:37,956
Yeah.

59
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,231
I don’t remember that.

60
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:46,832
You also said

61
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:49,933
You…

62
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,725
You’d be happy having just
me and Tao to trust.

63
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,433
I do remember that.

64
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:05,233
But I really can’t recall talking about my father.

65
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,373
I saw you on your phone.

66
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:12,325
Maybe you unknowingly
blocked his number then?

67
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:14,876
Well, drunk people, you know?

68
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,225
I guess.

69
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,180
Don’t overthink it.

70
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:29,259
Think of all the things he did.

71
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,104
He betrayed you.

72
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,546
He doesn’t seem one bit sorry
for what he did, does he?

73
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,830
When he gets angry at you,

74
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:42,068
he’s just trying to blame you for everything.

75
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,692
He wants you to feel guilty.

76
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:49,081
I know for a fact that it’s because of him
that you don’t want to talk to him.

77
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:55,863
I’m not in the wrong here, am I?

78
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,222
Of course you’re not.

79
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:01,409
You didn’t do anything wrong at all.

80
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,427
Why do I feel so awful?

81
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:06,099
No. He should be the one feeling awful.

82
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,855
Oh, come here.

83
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:19,350
Thank you.

84
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,723
Mmm.

85
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:37,345
Let’s sit here.

86
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:38,997
Okay.

87
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:40,140
Thanks.

88
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:42,000
I’ll be right back.

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,720
Okay.

90
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,637
You and Baikhaw are inseparable these days.

91
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,543
Haven’t we always been like that?

92
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:05,507
She takes good care of me.

93
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,176
She’s like my boyfriend, really.

94
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,141
You’re right.

95
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:14,303
Oh, have you talked to Wawwa?

96
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:17,432
I don’t think there’s anything else to talk about.

97
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,259
But…

98
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:27,937
Don’t you think
what Wawwa said could be true?

99
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:30,839
Namo.

100
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,698
If you truly think of me as a friend,
can you stop mentioning Wawwa?

101
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:36,698
I’m sick of hearing it.

102
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:43,626
I’m sorry.

103
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:49,502
Sorry.

104
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,509
I’m not in a good mood.

105
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,145
I just had a fight with my dad.

106
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:56,075
What happened?

107
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,810
My dad got mad at me because
I blocked his number.

108
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,781
But I don’t even remember blocking it.

109
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,592
I still haven’t talked things out with him.

110
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:14,189
Don’t you wonder it could be
someone else who did it?

111
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,100
Sorry.

112
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,391
The line was so long.

113
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:23,287
Thanks.

114
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,300
What’s going on?

115
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:30,256
Nothing.

116
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:32,902
Okay.

117
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:35,652
Bye.

118
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:36,389
Umm.

119
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:55,544
Oh, don’t stress over it.

120
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,898
Maybe you blocked him when you were drunk.

121
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,369
You want this?

122
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:03,972
I’m just stumped, is all.

123
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:06,450
How come I don’t remember any of that.

124
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:08,616
I’d be stumped if you did.

125
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:09,720
You were wasted.

126
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,200
You’re right.

127
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:15,903
I’m sure your dad will come around.

128
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:17,097
Don’t overthink it.

129
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:18,926
Let’s watch something.

130
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,210
What should we watch?

131
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,336
But I know I’m lucky because…

132
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:30,887
I have you, Sun.

133
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:34,516
You make me smile more than those four can.

134
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,840
Get things done with Tulip.

135
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:43,030
We’ll be together.

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,816
I’m sorry.

137
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,530
Why did you apologize just now?

138
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,449
I was just…

139
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:17,725
Never mind.

140
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:19,623
Let’s go back and watch something.

141
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:22,753
Tao.

142
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,837
You know you can talk to me.

143
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,195
I don’t want you to feel like you’re all alone.

144
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:43,436
I know I have a lot going on right now,

145
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:46,533
but I do want to be a good girlfriend.

146
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,820
We don’t need to hurry.

147
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:06,886
Let’s take our time.

148
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,663
I want to stay with you like this for a long time.

149
00:13:58,554 --> 00:13:59,440
What you cooking?

150
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:00,317
Smells good.

151
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,161
Fried rice.

152
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,558
You hung out with Tao today, right?

153
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:07,286
How was it?

154
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,576
We haven’t done it.

155
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:10,785
- Oh?
- No need to tiptoe around it.

156
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,550
Were you playing hard to get again?

157
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:16,987
No, I didn’t this time.

158
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,368
But Tao seemed kind of stressed.

159
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:21,505
It just seemed like he didn’t want to do it.

160
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:24,920
Why?

161
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:27,144
I don’t know.

162
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:28,238
Maybe he’s got something on his mind.

163
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,556
He’ll tell me when he’s ready, I think.

164
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:34,963
That looks good.

165
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:36,261
I’m gonna go to the toilet for a minute.

166
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,276
Hey, Namo. What’s up?

167
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:04,136
Where is Tulip?

168
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:06,252
She went to the bathroom.

169
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,313
You can leave your message with me.

170
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:09,325
I’ll pass it on to her.

171
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:14,469
Can you tell her to call me when she’s back?

172
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:16,409
Of course.

173
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:29,206
Did someone call?

174
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:30,444
No.

175
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:32,432
I was just sending those photos
we took yesterday to my phone.

176
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,509
I want to keep them.

177
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:57,582
I can’t just sleep with Tulip.

178
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,844
Just screw her like you screw me.

179
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:00,836
- It’s not the same.
- What the hell?

180
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:01,824
I don’t want to do it.
