1
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:09,384
Where’s Khemika?

2
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:12,880
Is something wrong, professor?

3
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:15,737
I couldn’t reach her.

4
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:21,233
Thipayamas, someone said 
you did a classmate’s lab for money.

5
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:22,161
Is that true?

6
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,574
No, that’s not true.

7
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:26,482
What about Khemika’s lab?

8
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,427
Did you do it for her?

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,203
No, I didn’t.

10
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:36,509
Once we're able to reach Khemika,

11
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,224
I’ll have her answer a few questions

12
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:42,211
to see if you’re lying.

13
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:44,733
And if I catch you lying,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,476
you both will lose all your marks.

15
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,105
Come on, pick up.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,745
Namo, where’s Tulip?

17
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:00,767
Inside.

18
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:02,771
Why aren’t you going in?

19
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,105
I…

20
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,233
What is it, Kongphop?

21
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:10,378
Hello, professor.

22
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,131
I was the one who did Khemika’s lab.

23
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:19,454
Her mom’s sick,

24
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,912
so she had to take her to the hospital.

25
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:23,437
I felt bad, so I volunteered to do it for her.

26
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:24,866
Sorry, professor.

27
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:27,859
You’re sure about that, Kongphop?

28
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,630
I’m sure.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,257
I’m a scholarship student.

30
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:33,282
If I hadn’t done it,

31
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,603
I wouldn’t lie and risk losing my scholarship.

32
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:46,301
Why’d you tell the professor that?

33
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,937
Hey, don’t worry.

34
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,043
You should just go rest.

35
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,040
How can I not worry?

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,011
You lost points 
even though you did nothing wrong.

37
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,402
Honestly, I thought I’d lose more.

38
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:03,723
At least the professor understood.

39
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:09,669
Don’t worry. I’ll make it up by midterms.

40
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,283
It's me you're talking to.

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,192
You didn’t have to go that far.

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,666
For you.

43
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:20,725
nothing’s too far.

44
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,309
Whatever I can do for you,

45
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,732
I’ll do it without hesitation.

46
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,444
The reason I did it

47
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:38,441
is because I don’t want to see you so stressed.

48
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:09,826
Hello, Wawwa?

49
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:12,825
Huh?

50
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:16,279
Wawwa?

51
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:17,956
Tulip.

52
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,526
Wawwa, are you okay?

53
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:25,586
Are you hurt? Who did this to you?

54
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,835
I don’t know. It was dark.

55
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:28,903
I couldn’t see anything.

56
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:33,970
Calm down. I’ll take you to the police.

57
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:37,810
Can you remember anything?

58
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,610
I can’t remember anything.

59
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,494
But when I fought back,

60
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,650
I splashed chemical fluid on his inner leg.

61
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:56,477
His inner leg?

62
00:03:57,965 --> 00:03:59,536
Yeah. Probably burned.

63
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:06,128
How bad was the burn you mentioned?

64
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:11,760
It wasn’t too bad. I just threw it randomly.

65
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:16,034
But I think it left red marks.

66
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:19,349
Just red marks?

67
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,006
Yeah, maybe a few blisters.

68
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,727
It’s okay. Calm down.

69
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:29,246
It was so scary.

70
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:38,548
You’re back.

71
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,601
I was so worried. I couldn’t reach you.

72
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:43,127
Yeah, my phone died.

73
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,813
Where were you?

74
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,751
Are you my friend or my mom?

75
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:52,302
I’m just worried.

76
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,783
I went to the hospital with my mom.

77
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,382
She had an appointment.

78
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,016
I left early before traffic got bad.

79
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:05,644
Mhm.

80
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,203
You just got back?

81
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,022
Yeah, I took Wawwa to the police station.

82
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,684
Oh?

83
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,067
Why?

84
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,046
She was assaulted at school.

85
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:33,658
What? Is she okay?

86
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,230
She’s hurt pretty bad.

87
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,373
Yeah, but she's mostly traumatized.

88
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:47,179
We’ll check the CCTV tomorrow.

89
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:48,292
Mhm…

90
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:51,880
that’s terrifying.

91
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,595
Go shower first.

92
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:55,975
I’ll tell you everything after.

93
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:57,420
Mhm.

94
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:07,259
Shit!

95
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,538
Let me help.

96
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:11,679
Ouch!

97
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:17,675
What happened to you?

98
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,591
I spilled some chemicals at home.

99
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,636
What happened to you?

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,777
I spilled some chemicals at home.

101
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,353
You better watch your back.

102
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:50,429
Your current bff is a snake.

103
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:53,506
I don’t want to wait anymore.

104
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:55,889
Tulip, will you go out with me?

105
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:58,844
Have you seen Tulip? She's in danger!

106
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:00,509
I'll help you look for her.

107
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,192
You know about it already, don't you?
