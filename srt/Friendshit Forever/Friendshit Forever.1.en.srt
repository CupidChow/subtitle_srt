1
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:14,014
I didn’t take it.

2
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,019
You can keep lying all you want.

3
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:18,899
I’m not buying it.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,795
I just want my damn money back.

5
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:22,073
I said I don’t know!

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:24,950
Fine. I’ll make you talk.

7
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:25,975
Here.

8
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,286
You gonna talk now?

9
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:34,750
You gonna talk?!

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,520
How do you like boiling water?

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,155
What are you doing?!

12
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:41,616
Oh—

13
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:44,989
Uh— hey, look—

14
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:47,942
I think there’s been 
some kind of misunderstanding.

15
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:51,209
See, money went missing from my shop.

16
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,170
I was just questioning my staff about it.

17
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,264
Maybe the method got a little out of hand.

18
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:56,920
From the way you yelled just now,

19
00:00:57,303 --> 00:00:58,353
I’d say “a little” is an understatement.

20
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:00,689
And you’re about to assault her on top of that.

21
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:01,889
I was just threatening her.

22
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,315
Come on, let’s go.

23
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,030
We’re going to the police.

24
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:07,813
Wait, wait, wait!

25
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,815
Okay, fine. I’ll give you money.

26
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,095
How much do you want to delete the clip?

27
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:16,320
Don’t you dare give in to him.

28
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,395
Guys like him belong behind bars.

29
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,755
Okay, okay, okay—listen!

30
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,207
Forget about the missing money. I’ll drop it.

31
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,025
I’ll even give you extra cash, okay?

32
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:27,331
Just delete the clip. Please.

33
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:27,903
Please.

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,109
Please.

35
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:31,876
Bow at my feet.

36
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:35,105
What?

37
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:36,158
Bow at my feet!

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,843
I’ll tell my friend to delete the clip right away.

39
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:36,850
Honestly, if I had to keep working there,

40
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,234
I could.

41
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,247
I’ve been treated like crap 
my whole life anyway.

42
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,949
Being looked down on, insulted. I’m used to it.

43
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,830
Then why not find another job?

44
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,937
One that’s better than that.

45
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,402
Jobs aren’t easy to find these days.

46
00:02:57,797 --> 00:02:59,908
Your life’s kinda heartbreaking, you know that?

47
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,055
I thought I had it bad

48
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:04,752
but hearing yours…

49
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,005
I gotta hand it to you.

50
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,736
It's normal.

51
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,652
We all have our share of shit to deal with.

52
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,536
But thank you for today. Really.

53
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:22,619
No one’s ever stood up for me like that before.

54
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:27,934
Well, no one’s ever slapped me 
across the face before either.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,174
Shit, sorry about that.

56
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:31,878
It’s fine. I’m not mad.

57
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,143
When I’m with you,

58
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,388
it feels like we’re sisters or something.

59
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,466
Sisters, huh?

60
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:55,810
How about this?

61
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,084
Why don’t you move with me?

62
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,210
Stay here.

63
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,453
What? No way.

64
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,518
Why not?

65
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,960
It’s fine.

66
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,201
This is my place.

67
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:09,784
Are you out of your mind?

68
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,663
Come on, I’m serious.

69
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,391
This way you won’t have to work 
that awful job anymore.

70
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:15,216
And…

71
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:16,630
you can help me study.

72
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:17,726
Win-win!

73
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:18,641
Hold on.

74
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,110
Are you befriending me for benefits right now?

75
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,141
Well, you in or not?

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,679
Why are you playing hard to get?

77
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,644
This apartment is big anyway. Just stay here.

78
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:37,398
Perfect! Then I won’t be lonely.

79
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,091
(Tulip, I'm sorry, sweetheart.)

80
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:43,708
(Tulip.)

81
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:45,336
(Tulip.)

82
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:07,880
I DON’T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE. 
STAY OUT OF MY LIFE, 
OR I’LL EXPOSE EVERYTHING YOU’VE DONE.

83
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,233
This is my friend Baikhaw.

84
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,339
You just met Baikhaw. How can you know you can trust her?

85
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:36,288
I don’t really know how trustworthy Wawwa is.

86
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:40,296
Honestly, I feel like she’s not a very good friend.
