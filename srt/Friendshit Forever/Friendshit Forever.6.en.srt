Are you okay?

5
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:17,163
I’m so scared he’d die.

6
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:18,862
You’re so scary right now.

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:21,295
You lied to Tulip and everyone as if nothing happened.

8
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:25,284
I’m scared that the more I get to know you, understand you,
it would only mean that I’m an asshole just like you.

9
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:28,326
It’s like they totally cut me off.

10
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,878
I honestly have no one left.

11
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:33,203
Will you wait for me here? I’ll be back.

12
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,103
Baikhaw and Tao…

13
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:00,434
They are more than just friends.

14
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:14,078
Listen to me.

15
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,425
I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

16
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,097
Whatever you’re about to say

17
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:20,032
is all lies.

18
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,753
Just shut your mouth.

19
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:23,567
No, please! Let me explain.

20
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:24,744
What is there to explain?

21
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:26,973
How could you two do this to me?

22
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:28,564
You’re my friend.

23
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:29,817
And you’re my boyfriend.

24
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:32,879
The two of you

25
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,433
are absolutely cold-blooded.

26
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,598
No, I didn’t mean for you 
to see something this messed up.

27
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,893
Yeah, of course you didn’t mean to.

28
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:39,723
Please let me explain.

29
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:41,291
You don’t need to explain anything.

30
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,753
You never meant any of it anyway.

31
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:43,931
How could you mean it?

32
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,500
If you did, how would you keep lying to me?

33
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,143
How else would you keep the lie going?

34
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,451
I’m sorry.

35
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,437
I’m sorry. Let me explain, please.

36
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:58,481
I swear I have my reasons.

37
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,224
What sick reasons could you possibly have?

38
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,941
Except wanting to keep me 
looking like an idiot.

39
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,140
You guys are just…

40
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,291
so damn good at this.

41
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:15,644
You made sure I had no one left.

42
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:18,521
In the end, all I had was you two,

43
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,180
and you stabbed me in the back.

44
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,991
How could you do this?

45
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,235
Did I ever do anything to you?

46
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,855
Did I ever hurt you? Answer me!

47
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,638
You never did anything to me.

48
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,703
You never did anything to any of us.

49
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:31,648
Really.

50
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:32,911
Then why the hell did you do this?

51
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:36,648
No, I’m sorry. I really do love you.

52
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,290
I actually want to protect you.

53
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,103
Protect me?

54
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:39,778
I really love you.

55
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,074
What the hell are you talking about?

56
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,419
You’re the only real friend I’ve ever had.

57
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:48,309
I’m sorry.

58
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:50,697
Tulip.

59
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:51,868
Please listen to me.

60
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:52,804
Listen to what?

61
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:53,602
No, no!

62
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:55,389
Your words don’t mean shit to me anymore.

63
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:58,608
Please! Let me explain!

64
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:04,919
I don’t have anyone left.

65
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:07,682
I just have you.

66
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,831
From now on, whatever happens, just tell me.

67
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:11,836
I love you guys so much.

68
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,573
I love all of you.

69
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:26,185
I’m not going to stoop as low as you.

70
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:33,579
Tulip!

71
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,127
Tulip, wait for me!

72
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:35,825
Tulip!

73
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,166
Tulip.

74
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:54,841
Tulip, wait.

75
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:55,641
Let go.

76
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:56,985
Tulip.

77
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:58,233
I’m sorry.

78
00:04:59,261 --> 00:04:59,878
But…

79
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,464
what I feel for you…

80
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:03,656
it’s real.

81
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:09,915
You think saying all this now
is going to make me believe you?

82
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,456
How many things have you lied to me about?

83
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:14,731
I know…

84
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,156
whatever I say now 
will just sound like excuses.

85
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,770
But the feelings I have for you

86
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:23,779
have grown more and more.

87
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,780
I really do love you, Tulip.

88
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:32,856
I want to protect you.

89
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:33,944
I want to take care of you.

90
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:35,229
I want to be by your side.

91
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:49,913
I don’t want to lose you.

92
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:56,217
I’m sorry.

93
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:00,842
Can you give me another chance?

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,523
Please give me a chance.

95
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,595
Just now you said

96
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,326
that you love me,

97
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,415
that you don’t want to lose me, right?

98
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,434
I really don’t.

99
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:44,183
Good.

100
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,272
Then you’ll understand

101
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:55,669
what it feels like to lose someone you love.

102
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,135
How painful it is.

103
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:24,401
Every time you look at me,

104
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:29,483
I want you to feel sadness,

105
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:33,879
regret,

106
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:37,881
and longing for what you lost.

107
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,073
Because from now on,

108
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:45,307
you will never get me back.

109
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,455
I’m really sorry

110
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,873
for not trusting you from the start.

111
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,425
I’m sorry for everything.

112
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:47,826
Baikhaw did a number on you.

113
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,316
I don’t blame you.

114
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:54,510
But I really don’t understand.

115
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:57,409
Why would she do something like that to me?

116
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,414
She’s just a shitty person.

117
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:00,739
For real.

118
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,800
Don’t waste your time trying to figure her out.

119
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:04,531
You’ll never understand her.

120
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,041
You’re not like her.

121
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,137
So now…

122
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:16,832
what are you going to do next?

123
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:30,359
Everything’s ruined.

124
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,869
Tulip is never going to forgive me.

125
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,462
And what did you do to get caught?

126
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,192
Oh, so now you’re blaming everyone 
but yourself.

127
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,285
You’re the one who made everything 
blow up like this.

128
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,689
You’re the idiot who didn’t follow 
what I told you.

129
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,419
You just had to go and fall for her.

130
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,679
And that’s why everything’s a mess now.

131
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,351
Baikhaw!

132
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:48,926
What?

133
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:52,293
Someone like you deserves to end up alone.

134
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:55,891
If you walk away from me…

135
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,481
if I blab about what happened with Namo,

136
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:02,563
you’re done for.

137
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,082
Take these out.

138
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,972
If not, I’ll have someone throw everything out.

139
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,523
Let me talk to Tulip.

140
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:26,060
No!

141
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:30,197
I told you. Tulip can't go on with her life without me.

142
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:30,989
You’re the one

143
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,690
who’s hurt Tulip the most.

144
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,726
No, it's you!

145
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:36,878
You believe your husband 
over your own child.

146
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:37,728
When she needed you most, 
where were you?

147
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:38,427
And what business is that of yours?

148
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:39,276
Where were you?

149
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:41,390
- You can’t go inside. 
- I’m going in.

150
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:44,363
What the hell are you doing here?

151
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,370
Please just listen. 
Let me explain one more time.

152
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,522
What’s left for me to listen to?

153
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:51,009
After everything that’s happened,
you still think I’m not stupid enough?

154
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,644
No, I’ve never thought you were stupid.

155
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:54,000
Then have you ever seen me as a friend?

156
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:03,962
Think about it carefully.

157
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:08,770
If you don’t have me…

158
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,321
everyone around you is trash, you know that.

159
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:13,903
Around me,

160
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:15,933
you’re the worst of all.

161
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:33,914
Fine. I wanna see

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,325
how long you can keep this up.

163
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,780
Because without me…

164
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:45,559
if you don’t have me…

165
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,727
you’ll end up with no one either.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,273
You’ll have absolutely no one.

167
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,047
I’m sorry, Mom.

168
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:26,478
I didn’t trust you from the beginning.

169
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:31,610
It’s alright, sweetheart.

170
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,056
She’s just one bad person in your life.

171
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,124
From now on,

172
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:43,383
you need to trust what Dad and I tell you.

173
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:47,500
Your father and I 
have seen more of the world.

174
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,626
We can tell who’s good and who’s not.

175
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,057
It’s good, actually.

176
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,203
We can go back to being a family like before.

177
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,612
And there’s something else I want to tell you.

178
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:16,693
That time,

179
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,932
the person who brought me 
the clip of you and Tao

180
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:23,769
was Baikhaw.

181
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:34,676
Hey, look!

182
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,450
What?!

183
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,202
Whoa, what clip is that?

184
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,264
Who's that?

185
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,569
Dude, record it, record it!

186
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,227
Wow, no shame at all.

187
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,156
Hey!

188
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:48,939
Who played this video?

189
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:50,851
I don’t know, professor.

190
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,832
It just started playing by itself.

191
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:53,898
Brazen.

192
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,332
How could they?

193
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:58,159
Like they have no shame at all.

194
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:02,536
Their poor parents.

195
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:08,109
She looks exactly like the girl in the clip.

196
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:09,916
She does.

197
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,572
I think it’s her.

198
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:16,443
Doing those positions and everything.

199
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:18,997
Does she have any shame?

200
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:41,881
Crisp and clear, 4K quality.

201
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:01,502
Tulip, can you forgive me?

202
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,116
I watched your clip today.

203
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,387
I was so turned on.

204
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,278
Wanna try?

205
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:06,815
Can I?
