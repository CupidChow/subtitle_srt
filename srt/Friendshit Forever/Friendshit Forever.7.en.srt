4

How could she? No shame at all?

5
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:18,095
Crisp and clear, 4K quality.

6
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:22,559
I watched your clip today. I was so turned on.

7
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:23,642
Wanna try?

8
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:25,685
I’d never sleep with trash like you, you piece of shit.

9
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:28,606
I wouldn’t want a bitch like you either.

10
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:29,907
This is what you want, right?

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,678
Tulip will come back to me at the cost of your life.

12
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:47,797
Hey, there was another stabbing at the bar.

13
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:49,559
Another stabbing?

14
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:51,166
That makes two bodies tonight, Lieutenant.

15
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:54,257
The owner says he checked the footage.

16
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,401
The perpetrator is a woman.

17
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,063
Then let’s go check the CCTV.

18
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,040
Let’s go.

19
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,764
Same tea as before,

20
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:14,832
so you can sleep.

21
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,974
I’M THE OWNER OF THE CAR 
WITH THE DASHCAM.

22
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,044
I’VE SENT YOU THE CLIP.

23
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,360
Hey, Tulip. Hello?

24
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,555
Namo got hit by a car…

25
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:09,496
Was that you, Tao?

26
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:14,020
How did you find out?

27
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:16,445
What the hell is wrong with you?

28
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:18,068
Tulip, calm down first.

29
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:20,369
I know I messed up. You can be mad at me.

30
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,090
But right now, I need you to trust me.

31
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:25,617
What else do you expect me to believe?

32
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:29,966
Tulip, I think Baikhaw hurt Wawwa.

33
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:35,070
I don’t know why either.

34
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,140
But right now, you’re in danger.

35
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,340
Please get out of there now.

36
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,992
Then tell me 
why Baikhaw would do that.

37
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:50,685
I don’t know either,

38
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:54,159
but Baikhaw told me to date you 
and then dump you.

39
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:58,386
And about Namo getting hit…

40
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:03,477
Baikhaw tried to stop him
from telling you about me and Baikhaw.

41
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:12,132
At first, I thought she just held some grudge
 against you.

42
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,647
But now I don’t think that’s it.

43
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:18,525
I think Baikhaw is possessive of you.

44
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,243
Tulip? Hello? Tulip?

45
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:33,288
Hey,

46
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:37,202
can you reach your friend Baikhaw?

47
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:39,622
I can’t either. Is something wrong?

48
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,116
There was a fatal stabbing at the bar.

49
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,177
Can you come check the footage with us?

50
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:43,816
Sure.

51
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:44,515
Let’s go.

52
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,252
Awake?

53
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,393
What are you doing?

54
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,591
I was gonna ask you to come to my place.

55
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:44,924
I don’t want you staying here alone.

56
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,884
And my mom’s not doing well right now.

57
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:53,799
Can you come with me?

58
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,856
Yeah, sure.

59
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,613
Let me pack first.

60
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:06,424
Mm.

61
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:21,586
Do you know this person?

62
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,406
Shit! That’s Q.

63
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:25,138
You know him?

64
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,677
Not really. He’s a senior from my university.

65
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:30,793
This is CCTV footage from the bar.

66
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:38,644
Baikhaw?

67
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,650
She really is your friend, right?

68
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,141
Hang on a second.

69
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,451
I told you, my girlfriend isn’t picking up.

70
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,331
Please just let me in.

71
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:49,404
Hey, I said you can’t.

72
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,198
Without a keycard, 
a resident has to come down to get you.

73
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,693
I told you, I called her, and she didn't answer.

74
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:55,842
Why don’t you calm down?

75
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,584
Let her cool off, then talk things out.

76
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,008
I’m not fighting with her.

77
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:01,446
I need to go up there now!

78
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,032
- Hey! You’re not listening!
- Let go.

79
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:03,873
Is something wrong?

80
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:05,196
Sir, please.

81
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,299
My girlfriend is in room 805.

82
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:09,715
If I don’t get up there right now, she might die.

83
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:10,632
Please let me go up.

84
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,710
Oh, that room?

85
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,427
You mean Tulip, right?

86
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,958
Yes. Do you know her?

87
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:17,998
I just saw her leave a moment ago.

88
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:19,644
She left with Baikhaw, her roommate.

89
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:20,735
Do you know where they went?

90
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:21,909
No, I don’t.

91
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:40,341
Come on in.

92
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:41,906
Mm.

93
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:04,483
Do you really need to shut everything this tight?

94
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:05,557
Yeah. I’ll be right back.

95
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,263
What are you doing?

96
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:09,647
Who are you talking to?
