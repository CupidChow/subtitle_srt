Tulip.

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:14,546
Tao

6
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:16,241
Tulip, look out!

7
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:20,556
Unit 24 received a report of someone falling down the overpass stairs.

8
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:23,209
When we checked the scene, we found no injured person.

9
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,202
You’re not alone anymore.

10
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:27,056
Let’s get through this together.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,860
Baikhaw…you don’t know her, right?

12
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,668
What about Baikhaw’s mother?

13
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:33,337
No!

14
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:37,213
MEDICAL RECORD

15
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,664
I missed you so much, little sister.

16
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,875
Wow, it smells so good.

17
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,217
Here you go! Oops!

18
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,193
Easy.

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,384
I’m gonna taste it now.

20
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:51,884
Go on.

21
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:56,877
Is it salty?

22
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,745
Mm, no. It’s good.

23
00:00:58,745 --> 00:00:59,731
Really? You like strong flavors, don’t you?

24
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:02,025
But it’s spicy.

25
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,595
I love sodium, okay.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,200
Baikhaw.

27
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:44,098
The Chairman approached me 
about the director position.

28
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:48,371
You’re sure everything about Baikhaw 
has been taken care of, right?

29
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:51,443
Of course.

30
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:53,972
Good.

31
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,692
No more missteps.

32
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:12,901
Hey!

33
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:14,139
Our daughter!

34
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:22,586
No one can take you away from me anymore.

35
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:42,103
Your condition can be treated.

36
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:43,214
Let my mom—

37
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:45,028
Your mom is the reason I'm this way.

38
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:46,770
What did my mom do to you?

39
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,339
You idiot!

40
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:52,279
She still hasn’t told you, has she?

41
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,802
What did my mom do to you?

42
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:57,904
Your parents…

43
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,165
killed my father!

44
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,478
What did you just say?

45
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,684
How could you say something like that?

46
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:09,193
You’re a mother yourself.

47
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:11,236
You should understand how my wife and I feel.

48
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:12,261
Hello?

49
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,454
Hello?!

50
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,350
Damn it!

51
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,610
Why did you do this to my family?

52
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,862
How could you do this?

53
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,815
Dad!

54
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:35,553
Dad!

55
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:37,640
Dad!

56
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:42,581
Dad, what’s wrong?

57
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,422
Dad!

58
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,461
CASE DISMISSED

59
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,049
Dad!

60
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:51,936
Hello.

61
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,039
Help me, please.

62
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:55,741
Someone has broken into my house.

63
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,365
What the hell is wrong with you, Baikhaw?

64
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,510
Then go ask your parents.

65
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,962
Ask them what they did to my family.

66
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,385
They’ve been lying to you all along.

67
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,827
You’re the one who lied to me.

68
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:18,414
You destroyed everyone.

69
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,198
And now you’re still messing with my head.

70
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:21,475
I don’t believe anything you say anymore.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,775
You don’t believe me?

72
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:26,282
Or you just can’t accept 
how f*cked up your parents really are?

73
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:28,451
Huh?!

74
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:48,832
Officer, she’s in the bathroom.

75
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:49,500
Excuse me.

76
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:03,839
Lieutenant.

77
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:30,554
We’ve searched everywhere.

78
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,114
But we still haven’t found Baikhaw.

79
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:35,434
We’ll assign officers to increase security.

80
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:37,395
If you’ll excuse us.

81
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:38,450
Thank you.

82
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:54,233
They said they’ll tighten security, sweetheart.

83
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:55,409
Okay?

84
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:08,648
Thank you.

85
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,831
Would you like to stay at the main house for now?

86
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,268
It’s okay.

87
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,736
If the police keep checking in like this,

88
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:20,771
it should be fine.

89
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,442
But I’m not at ease.

90
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:26,354
Right now,

91
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,423
they still haven’t caught her.

92
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:32,945
Mom.

93
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,223
I’m asking you, really.

94
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,056
You knew about Baikhaw’s family, 
didn’t you?

95
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:48,967
I already know
that Baikhaw’s mom was Dad’s former patient.

96
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:53,297
Please stop lying to me.

97
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:59,732
Baikhaw’s mother had a miscarriage

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,651
and blamed your father for it.

99
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:05,716
Danai, you shit doctor!

100
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,909
Where are you?

101
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:08,029
What’s going on here?

102
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:09,759
Argh!

103
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:11,120
Get over here.

104
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,644
What did you do to my wife?

105
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:13,344
Huh?!

106
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,220
My wife miscarried because of you!

107
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,216
What did you do?!

108
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,159
Let go!

109
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,250
But the truth is,

110
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,906
there had already been domestic violence 
in that family.

111
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,707
There were many witnesses all along.

112
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,091
What kind of wife are you?

113
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,891
Your husband hasn’t even eaten, 
and instead of caring… Damn it!

114
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,818
He tried to sue your father,

115
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:40,078
but the court dismissed the case
due to insufficient evidence.

116
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:47,234
That incident
severely damaged his reputation.

117
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:53,648
After that,
he took his own life.

118
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,286
Baikhaw must have been furious 
at your father and me,

119
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,650
which is why she took it out on you.

120
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:08,897
Then why didn’t you tell me from the beginning?

121
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,103
Tulip…

122
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:14,194
I’m so sorry, sweetheart,

123
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,508
for making you go through all of this.

124
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:30,532
Tulip.

125
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:34,889
I heard that
Baikhaw broke into your house. Is that true?

126
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,868
That’s so scary.

127
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,421
What did she say to you?

128
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:41,398
Tell us. We are curious.

129
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,930
Are you actually worried, or just being nosy?

130
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:47,888
Of course, we’re worried.

131
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,618
What you went through was serious.

132
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,303
Then if you really care,
can you not ask me right now?

133
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,743
I’m not ready to talk about it.

134
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:56,262
Hey.

135
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,297
Without us,
you’d have no friends at all.

136
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:02,897
Friends like you
are better off not existing.

137
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:04,344
Come on, Tulip.

138
00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:05,546
What?

139
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,218
What is this?

140
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:11,533
I told you to stay away.

141
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:12,841
I can’t stay out of it, Tulip.

142
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,107
I know about Baikhaw.

143
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:16,033
And I’m worried about you.

144
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:20,641
And when Baikhaw was manipulating me,
weren’t you worried then?

145
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,907
Tulip, you already know
how guilty I feel about all of this.

146
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:25,614
I’ve already lost my scholarship.

147
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,376
I’ve taken full responsibility for Namo’s case.

148
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,927
I’ve really tried to make up for everything.

149
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,497
How much is ever going to be enough, Tao?

150
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,613
You caused Wawwa and Q to die.

151
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:42,411
Feeling guilty for life still wouldn’t be enough.

152
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,359
There’s nothing I can do to change that.

153
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,248
But right now, I can still protect you.

154
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:55,389
Please, Tulip.

155
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,420
I really want to make amends for what I've done.

156
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,151
So you actually believed what he said?

157
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,456
Tao knows Baikhaw better than anyone.

158
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:16,613
Maybe

159
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,821
he knows something we don’t.

160
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:21,770
And what do you want to know from him?

161
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:26,126
I don’t think I can breathe again

162
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:29,361
until I figure out where Baikhaw is 
or what she’s planning next.

163
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,353
Honestly, I don’t know that either.

164
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:35,826
That’s why we need to figure it out together.

165
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:38,724
Am I supposed to keep looking 
over my shoulder forever?

166
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:40,555
So…

167
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:42,614
have the police gone to Baikhaw’s house yet?

168
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:46,012
They did, but they didn’t find anything.

169
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:49,426
They only found Taew and Baikhaw’s mom.

170
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:54,386
Taew said that
Baikhaw hasn’t sent money for months.

171
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,007
She’s only helping out of pity.

172
00:11:58,521 --> 00:11:59,858
Where the hell is she?

173
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:05,006
As for where she is,
I do wonder about that.

174
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,356
But what I’m more suspicious about

175
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:10,650
is my mom.

176
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:14,525
I don't think she has told me everything.

177
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:17,274
What do you mean, Tulip?

178
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,821
Even though Baikhaw lied to me 
about a lot of things,

179
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,782
there’s one thing I believe.

180
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,692
My mom
would do anything to protect my dad.

181
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:31,073
I think

182
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,808
she’s definitely hiding something from me.

183
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:38,047
Otherwise, Baikhaw’s family 
wouldn’t have ended up like this.

184
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:46,295
Sometimes I’m scared that
what Baikhaw said might actually be true.

185
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,224
If we can’t get answers from Tulip’s parents,

186
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,893
then why don’t we find out ourselves?

187
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:08,039
Why are the police here?

188
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,980
Baikhaw’s friend said
she came to pick up some books.

189
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:12,406
She's not a friend.

190
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:13,291
My child.

191
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,481
Ma’am, please calm down.

192
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,117
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
