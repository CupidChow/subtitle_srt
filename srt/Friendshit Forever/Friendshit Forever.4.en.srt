4
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:15,494
You didn’t trust me, so you followed me?

5
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:18,899
Then what did I just see? Your mom looks totally fine.

6
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:21,885
Mom, Mom, enough!

7
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,698
Mom, the baby is gone.

8
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:27,196
I’m sorry I didn’t trust you.

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,695
Have you seen Tulip? She’s in danger!

10
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,333
I’ll help look for her too.

11
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:38,400
I’m dating Tulip now. I did everything you told me to.

12
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,845
Now it’s time you gave me my reward.

13
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:46,921
TWO MONTHS AGO

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,845
Khaw.

15
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:48,345
Mm?

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,110
I think I’m in love with you.

17
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:53,125
Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:55,861
That’s it? That’s all you’ve got?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,909
What?

20
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:04,280
Thank you.

21
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:09,770
How long do I have to wait?

22
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,683
Ugh, wait for what?

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,141
For the day I actually get to be with you.

24
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,718
Do you know why I wanted to study here?

25
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,754
No.

26
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:02,008
You said it had to be this place.

27
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,209
So I followed you. That’s it.

28
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,162
There’s someone here I wanted to find.

29
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,381
And I knew they'd definitely study here.

30
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:11,638
Don’t tell me you already liked someone.

31
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:12,800
And you followed them here.

32
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:14,024
Then what am I to you?

33
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,080
No.

34
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:17,673
She’s a girl.

35
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,822
A girl?

36
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:22,322
Yeah.

37
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:27,858
And it’s the complete opposite of “like.”

38
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:34,908
What’s that supposed to mean?

39
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:42,286
Do you really love me?

40
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:50,762
Can you do me a favor?

41
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:54,305
Like what?

42
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:55,886
Go flirt with this girl for me.

43
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:03,857
Make sure she falls for you,

44
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:09,729
desperately in love with you.

45
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,458
Then you dump her.

46
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:19,216
I want her to understand

47
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,744
what losing someone she loves

48
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:25,038
feels like.

49
00:03:26,652 --> 00:03:27,328
What for?

50
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:29,759
I can’t tell you yet.

51
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,274
But if you do it,

52
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,241
I…

53
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,463
willl be yours. Forever.

54
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,800
I’ve done everything you told me to.

55
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,812
You told me to go flirt with Tulip.

56
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,425
Make her like me.

57
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:35,912
What are you doing all this for?

58
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,785
I still can’t tell you yet.

59
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,551
So…

60
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:51,241
How long do I have to
pretend I like Tulip?

61
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:56,081
Until…

62
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,538
Until she really falls for you. Hard.

63
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,452
Like, really hard.

64
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:08,348
And when that time comes,

65
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,165
That’s when 
you dump her.

66
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,484
Just so you know,

67
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:20,727
everything I’m doing,

68
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,634
itt’s all for you.

69
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,123
Hey.

70
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:04,522
Did the noise wake you up?

71
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,982
No, no.

72
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:10,046
Why did you get home just now?

73
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:12,544
Oh.

74
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:15,000
My mom wasn’t feeling well last night.

75
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,115
So I…

76
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:18,153
kept her company last night.

77
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,008
Is she better now?

78
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,577
Yeah. She’s fine now.

79
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:23,655
I’ve got a morning class. I’ll go shower first.

80
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:24,340
Hey, wait.

81
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:27,550
I don’t know if you saw my message…

82
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,409
the one where I said I’m dating Tao now.

83
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:33,607
Oh, yeah?

84
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,295
He finally found the guts to ask you?

85
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,281
Yeah, I was kinda surprised too.

86
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,077
But now that we’re actually together…

87
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:41,566
I don’t really know how to act.

88
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:43,825
Don’t overthink it.

89
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,100
He’s a good guy.

90
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,373
And I believe he can take care of you.

91
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:49,429
I hope so too.

92
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,578
And whose shirt are you wearing?

93
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,702
It’s huge, like a guy’s shirt.

94
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:57,315
It’s mine.

95
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,918
I like wearing oversized shirts.

96
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:00,633
You didn’t know?

97
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:08,435
Hey.

98
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:10,609
Tulip.

99
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:15,653
Ooh—ooh—ooh!

100
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:16,270
Tao, sir!

101
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,006
What?

102
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:18,201
Is this your grand opening or what?

103
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:20,193
Hey, hey! Keep walking. Stop teasing.

104
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:21,930
Holding hands already.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,049
They’re asking for it.

106
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,458
Tulip.

107
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,154
When class is over, come find me.

108
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:39,941
What’s up?

109
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:42,893
I’ve got something to talk to you about.

110
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:47,055
Just the two of us.

111
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:04,670
What happened?

112
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:07,397
Well…

113
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:09,570
Last night…

114
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:19,950
Wawwa!

115
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,968
Wawwa!

116
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,575
Did you file a police report yet?

117
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:24,949
Not yet.

118
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:27,110
The professor said 
they don’t want this blowing up.

119
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,087
Someone literally got attacked.

120
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,718
How is that not a big deal?

121
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,086
I'm also waiting for Wawwa 
to wake up and fill me in.

122
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:39,118
So…why…

123
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,816
were you calling Wawwa last night?

124
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,277
Last night,

125
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,764
Wawwa was looking for you.

126
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,393
She had something 
she wanted to talk to you about.

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,053
So I helped her try to find you.

128
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:51,240
Oh…

129
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:52,781
Those missed calls yesterday?

130
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,066
Sorry.

131
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:56,541
I was with Tao, so I didn’t get to call back.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,734
It’s okay.

133
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:03,984
Wawwa just found out something.

134
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:05,322
So she wanted to talk to you.

135
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:08,038
About what?

136
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,176
Baikhaw.

137
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:14,827
Wawwa said…

138
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,619
Baikhaw once poisoned a senior 
at her old school.

139
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:19,446
The girl almost died.

140
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:20,660
What?

141
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:25,736
If that’s really true,

142
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,587
it means you’re living with someone who's…

143
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,655
seriously dangerous.

144
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,015
How can you say that 
I'm blowing this out of proportion?

145
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:36,437
My daughter almost died!

146
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:37,965
Isn’t that big enough for you?

147
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:39,780
Ma'am.

148
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,304
Is something wrong?

149
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,112
Tulip.

150
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,419
This professor won’t let me file a report

151
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,335
because they’re afraid 
it’ll hurt the university’s reputation.

152
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:47,765
That’s not why.

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,564
We haven’t gone to the police because

154
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:54,734
at the campus
not a single CCTV camera caught what happened.

155
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:57,588
None of them?

156
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:58,578
Yes.

157
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,982
Right now,

158
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:01,325
we don’t even know for sure

159
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,547
that this incident
actually happened the way it seems.

160
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,431
Umm…

161
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,127
What do you mean by that?

162
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:08,793
Are you saying

163
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:12,863
that Wawwa made this up
and injured herself this badly on purpose?

164
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,226
Here…

165
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:16,724
This is Wawwa’s bag.

166
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,086
It was found at the scene.

167
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,184
Wawwa.

168
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,163
It’s me, Tulip.

169
00:11:55,897 --> 00:11:56,430
Tulip!

170
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:57,988
Why can’t I see anything?

171
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:58,805
What happened to me?

172
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,652
Calm down, okay?

173
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:03,124
You probably won’t be able to see 
for a little while.

174
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:05,088
And…

175
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:08,798
Is— is anyone else here?

176
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:09,830
No, no.

177
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,707
Right now, it’s just you and me.

178
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,492
Tulip, it was so really scary.

179
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:17,112
Someone… I don’t know who…

180
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,530
poured some kind of chemical
right onto my eyes.

181
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,902
It burned so much.

182
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,459
And…

183
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:23,192
did you see their face at all?

184
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,177
Who was it?

185
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:26,372
No, nothing.

186
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:27,546
It was so dark.

187
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,210
I…

188
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:30,561
I think…

189
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:31,960
It had to be Baikhaw.

190
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:33,017
Tulip.

191
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,807
I found out that
Baikhaw poisoned a senior at her old school.

192
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:37,897
It has to be her.

193
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:40,541
She must’ve known I found out.
So she came after me and attacked me.

194
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:42,277
Wawwa.

195
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:44,528
Let me ask you honestly.

196
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:47,245
Were you using drugs?

197
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:48,381
Huh?

198
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,434
What did you just say?

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,758
It’s just…

200
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:57,376
The professor found this

201
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,584
in the bathroom.

202
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:00,976
What is it?

203
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:11,970
Tulip.

204
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:14,574
I don’t even know what that is.

205
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:15,816
But if it’s drugs,

206
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:16,583
they’re not mine.

207
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,000
You know I don’t do drugs.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,270
But it was in your bag.

209
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,682
It’s not mine!

210
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:22,685
Anyone could’ve put it there.

211
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:23,185
Tulip.

212
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,160
You have to believe me.

213
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,348
Baikhaw—

214
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:27,011
She must’ve planted it in my bag.

215
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:28,030
Wawwa.

216
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:29,231
Enough!

217
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,843
This isn’t something small anymore.

218
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,935
But it’s not mine!

219
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:35,325
I have no idea how it got in my bag.

220
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:36,189
Someone’s framing me.

221
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:36,899
Wawwa.

222
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:37,713
Mom?

223
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:38,213
Mom!

224
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:38,713
Help me!

225
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:39,869
The drugs aren’t mine.

226
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:41,247
I’m here, sweetheart.

227
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,292
Mom, please help me.

228
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,656
Someone attacked me
and planted drugs on me.

229
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,548
It wasn’t me.

230
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:48,635
So I want you to leave her alone.

231
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,104
Tulip has me as her friend

232
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:52,499
and Tao as her boyfriend.

233
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,517
That’s enough.
