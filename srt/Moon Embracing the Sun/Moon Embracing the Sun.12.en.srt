1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,340
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,590
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historic basis.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,600
Episode 12

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:26,150
How long have you known?

5
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,620
Since you do not ask,
I guess you did really know.

6
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,920
Does she resemble her that much?

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
Is that what His Majesty said?

8
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,160
That she resembles that child?

9
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,690
And so, did he command you
not to tell me?

10
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,400
My Lord.

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,030
I see that you too have become...

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,700
...one of His Majesty's people.

13
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,430
I enjoyed the show.

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,510
I am relieved to hear
that you feel that way.

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,680
However, the story was complete garbage
and full of plot holes.

16
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,320
Excuse me?

17
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,190
A common maiden meets the King
who is travelling incognito.

18
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,260
She does not realize he is the King
and falls in love?

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,060
Does that make any sense?

20
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,460
Would a King on official business
have time to be distracted by a lady?

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,800
With a King like that, what sad state
would the country be in?

22
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,100
I was almost about to drag them
to the state tribunal.

23
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,910
And was that all?

24
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,810
The maiden was equally unbelievable.

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,670
Even if he were wearing doghide,

26
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,080
how could that hide
the noble aplomb of a King?

27
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,050
And yet, she couldn't tell it was a king?

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,130
Such far-fetched nonsense.

29
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,190
It is certain that maiden knew he was King
and approached him intentionally.

30
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,730
That is not necessarily...

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,490
And on top of that, what?

32
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,180
She is brought to the palace
as a court lady,

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,960
and meets the King again
inside the palace?

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,630
Oh my.

35
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,240
Do they think this country's court ladies
are selected that superficially?

36
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,880
A person who tells such deceitful tales
must be dragged in and punished...

37
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,210
Why do you look at me like that?

38
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,320
Because they are people.

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,790
Among people, isn't it possible?

40
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,400
What?

41
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,370
How can the things
that happen between people...

42
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,300
...be explained simply
through a puppet show?

43
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,440
Well...

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,940
...In any case,
I am saying I enjoyed the show.

45
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,220
I will give you your money back,
so do not worry.

46
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,860
You needn't worry about that.

47
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,600
I wouldn't endure having debts.

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,260
I will repay you, so I will arrange...

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,570
...I guess that we'll see each other
in the evening.

50
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,900
This evening...

51
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,760
...I shall not be at your side
to watch over Your Majesty.

52
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,300
Regretfully...

53
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,170
...I shall be leaving
the Seongsucheong shortly.

54
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,500
I have sent Jan Shil safely back
to the Seongsucheong.

55
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,630
Why are you so late?

56
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,080
If you're not careful, you may suffer
the same fate as Jan Shil,

57
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,420
and be dragged in by your ears
by those scary ladies.

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,220
Then, the person
who took care of Jan Shil...

59
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,200
It was me.

60
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,690
She came looking for me,
saying she had nowhere to go.

61
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,210
This charm of mine...

62
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,450
Then, the broad minded, free-spirited,
chivalrous man.

63
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,100
Was that you, my Lord?

64
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,700
Oh! Is that how Jan Shil described me?

65
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,940
That kid.

66
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,830
I see she is a good judge of character.

67
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,730
I had worried that perhaps
she had been ensnared by a swindler.

68
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,820
With a swindler as handsome as this,
wouldn't it be worth getting snared?

69
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,490
In any case, I'm really grateful.

70
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,500
So, please be on your way.

71
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,990
You claimed to be so concerned, and yet...

72
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,110
Why...

73
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
...why did it take this long
for you to remember Jan Shil?

74
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,270
Excuse me?

75
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,540
You forgot the person
you were looking for,

76
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,460
and those who were waiting for you.

77
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,700
Was there something...

78
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,200
...that captivated you that much?

79
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,580
I saw it once and overlooked it.

80
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,380
But, I am not confident I can do it twice.

81
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,690
What?

82
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,490
You directing your gaze as someone else,
in another place...

83
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,130
...and having to witness it once again.

84
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,240
My Lord.

85
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,310
So then, I shall see you again.

86
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,560
Just a moment. My Lord!

87
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,630
Why must you always do this, Your Majesty?

88
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,070
If you wanted to travel incognito,
you should have told me beforehand.

89
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,270
How could you order me
to make you a useless snowman?

90
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,570
I did apologize, did I not?

91
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,250
You asked me to use only clean white snow
that no one had trod upon,

92
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,220
so I went all the way up the roof
and I could have lost my life.

93
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,490
Fortunately, you are alive.

94
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,740
How can you be so cruel?

95
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,390
Does Your Majesty not see
my frostbitten hands?

96
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,980
Handling the frozen snow,
I could have caught...

97
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,420
What are you doing, Your Majesty?

98
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,310
Come here. I shall melt your hands
with the heat in my chest.

99
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:41,580
I must go and prepare
the post-dinner fare.

100
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,760
Please let go.

101
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,150
If you go to Gangnaru tomorrow morning,

102
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,490
there will be someone there
to take you to your destination.

103
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,390
As you have resolved to depart,
go somewhere far from the capital.

104
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Why do you not answer?

105
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,770
I guess that we'll see each other
in the evening.

106
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,770
Mistress.

107
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,940
Just for tonight, could I not spend
one last evening in the King's palace?

108
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,180
Why are you wavering in your resolve?

109
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,690
I just feel that it isn't proper.

110
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,640
I feel that saying my farewell before...

111
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,800
Do you have the sort of relationship
with His Majesty that requires a farewell?

112
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,100
If you have resolved to leave,
then stay firm in that resolve.

113
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,110
There is something
I must say to His Majesty.

114
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,920
After I bid him farewell,
I will definitely depart.

115
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,790
So, please allow me to go
for this evening only.

116
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,670
Please, Mistress.

117
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,570
His Majesty spoke loudly
and pressed the shaman for answers.

118
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:46,840
She said, "I don't know how much
I resemble her, I'm not her."

119
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,650
"If you have any more questions,
please ask her directly."

120
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,880
That is what she said.

121
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,290
Your Majesty!

122
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,470
Are you on your way to the King's palace?

123
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,060
That is so, Your Majesty.

124
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,380
I'd like to have a word with you,
for which I took a difficult walk.

125
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,820
So, please remove your veiling cloak.

126
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,150
Did I not tell you to remove your cloak?

127
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,790
That is not possible, Your Majesty.

128
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,830
This girl is the Office of Astronomy's...

129
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,460
Do you not hear me?

130
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,610
Show me your face.

131
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,460
I see your discipline has faltered.

132
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,570
Why are you so late...

133
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,810
Are you disappointed that it isn't
who you expected?

134
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,240
What brings you here, Queen?

135
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,720
I've now confirmed
just by looking at your face...

136
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,370
...what you've been hiding from me
all this time.

137
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,330
Eight years ago, when I first saw you
at the Hidden Moon Pavilion,

138
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,820
Your Majesty wore that same expression
you wear this evening.

139
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,660
Even though we are not
of one mind or heart,

140
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,860
I had assumed
you were perceptive, at least.

141
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,710
I see I was mistaken.

142
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,090
I am certain I told you not to step foot
into my quarters, did I not?!

143
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,700
What exactly has you spellbound?

144
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,990
How does that lowly shaman...

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,930
...resemble the child who died
eight years ago?!

146
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,070
-Queen!
-Yes! Have your way with her.

147
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,690
Be it a spirit or a talisman,
go ahead and have your way with her!

148
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,210
I won't concern myself over it.

149
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,790
Did you not say
I would never obtain your love?

150
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,460
It doesn't matter. It's fine.

151
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Queen!!

152
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,990
However!

153
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,550
You had better not forget.

154
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,490
No matter who is in your heart,
no matter who has your devotion...

155
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,040
...I am this country's Queen.

156
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,780
Do you understand?

157
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,370
What I'm saying is that
the place at your side is mine.

158
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,470
You will have to acknowledge
that truth yourself very soon.

159
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,520
Go on inside and serve His Majesty.

160
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,910
Who are you?

161
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,070
Excuse me?

162
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:34,180
I am the conception talisman
sent by the Office of Astronomy.

163
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,300
Then, what happened to
the talisman who was sent to me?

164
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,230
She has completed her duties.

165
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,800
And I hear she will shortly
depart the Seongsucheong.

166
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,390
Now that you are about to leave,
are you sad?

167
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,710
I'm not sad.

168
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,160
It's just that I feel
I have not helped His Majesty.

169
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,860
And so I am regretful, that is all.

170
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,170
But, your face looks as if
you're about to cry.

171
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,610
She could have let you go one more night
to say goodbye.

172
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,680
And she refuses to the very end!

173
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,640
How cruel.

174
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,240
Change your clothes.

175
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,760
Why have you stopped?

176
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,020
Do not misinterpret the reason why
His Majesty has called for you.

177
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,770
His Majesty is mistaking you
for someone else.

178
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,550
Why do you speak to me with honorifics?

179
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,760
Ah. I... Did I?

180
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,340
Are you not mistaking me for her as well?

181
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,190
Do not worry.

182
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,550
I know well what it is
that you are concerned about.

183
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,980
I shall not misinterpret his feelings.

184
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,880
Who told you that you could leave
at your own will?

185
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,690
Tell me.

186
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,100
Who gave you permission to depart?

187
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,760
As I have completed my duty,
is it not proper that I withdraw?

188
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,060
Who said you have completed your duty?!

189
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,470
The person Your Majesty needs is not me.

190
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,970
Who was it who said
she would comfort the pain

191
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,140
that sits in the King's heart?

192
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,060
I can not take the place of that person.

193
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,960
Who said she would bring solace
to the exhausted King?!

194
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,090
It was Your Majesty who ordered me
not to come close.

195
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,100
I never ordered you to go far either!!

196
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,800
What you say is right.

197
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,070
I'm confused whether the
person I'm seeing...

198
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,110
...is you, or that child.

199
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,890
However, until I put
this confusion to rest...

200
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,990
...until I understand
what this feeling is...

201
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,170
...don't you dare...

202
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,920
...go far from me.

203
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,010
That is an order.

204
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,280
Did you say in three days?

205
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,450
Yes. The Office of Astronomy said
the 18th is an auspicious day,

206
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,530
and has given the date
to the Queen Dowager.

207
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,810
Why is it so soon?

208
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,680
According to Professor Na,

209
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,890
it is the most propitious day.

210
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,370
If the King and Queen form a union
between the hours of seven and nine,

211
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,190
you shall conceive a royal son whose name
shall be renowned for ages to come.

212
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,500
Therefore, please do not listen
to pointless rumours any longer,

213
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,270
and focus solely on keeping your health
and heart in order.

214
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,740
I will take that to heart.

215
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,220
So, what will you do, Your Majesty?

216
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,450
Do you intend to avoid me again,
using ill health as an excuse?

217
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,810
I'm sorry, but this time,
it will not happen as you wish.

218
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,730
Court Lady Jo.

219
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,300
Yes, Your Majesty?

220
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,070
Please ask Father to stop
by my quarters before he leaves.

221
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,030
I shall do as you ask.

222
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,910
Aigoo, my head.

223
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,640
The drinks I had yesterday
are still affecting me today.

224
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,610
Doesn't that seem suspicious to you?

225
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,310
What are you saying is so suspicious?

226
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,070
I mean those girls kept recommending
that liquor from Gaeseong,

227
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,590
but when you consider how long
it is affecting me,

228
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,460
doesn't it seem like
they mixed something foreign in it?

229
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,430
The way I see it,
the liquor is not the problem.

230
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,060
But that you're getting old.

231
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,330
Look at me. I'm fine.

232
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,470
What kind of ridiculous nonsense
are you spouting?

233
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,410
I am still as alive as ever.

234
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,610
My Lord?

235
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,180
What is the matter?

236
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,290
Go on ahead. I will follow soon.

237
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,690
Yes, sir.

238
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,740
Let's go.

239
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,570
Are you arriving just now, my Lord?

240
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,730
Why are you all so busy?

241
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,170
Yesterday, His Majesty came and turned
the Royal Secretariat upside down again.

242
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,910
We took the opportunity
to do some overdue housekeeping.

243
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,710
His Majesty did?

244
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,440
Chief Royal Secretary, there are
a few volumes missing from the records.

245
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,830
What?

246
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,410
That would be scandalous.

247
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,550
How many are missing?

248
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,420
A few from about eight years ago.

249
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,540
Unless they have grown legs,
they can't have gone anywhere.

250
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,160
Look again carefully!

251
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,290
Yes.

252
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,980
I'm certain they were gone earlier.

253
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,990
My Lord! I've found them!

254
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,030
Nicely done.

255
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,130
If you were even just a little later,
we may have been caught.

256
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,690
That old raccoon dog Chief Councilor
must not pick up a suspicious scent.

257
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,860
We shall need to be more careful.

258
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,300
Your Majesty.
Something terrible has happened.

259
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,580
What is it?

260
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,340
The chief royal attendant of the late King
has committed suicide.

261
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,260
It's pointless to investigate.

262
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,220
It's clearly a case of suicide.

263
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,460
So what I'm saying is...

264
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,910
We should stop looking for a suspect
and try to uncover why he died.

265
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,910
There is some situation here, I tell you.

266
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,810
I'm sensing it!

267
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,020
What exactly was he hiding?

268
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,350
What was he was protecting
at the cost of his own life?

269
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,960
Your Majesty. It is time for lunch.

270
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,280
One thing has become certain.

271
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,290
That there is a secret
I must not know about.

272
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,080
-Hyung Sun.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,470
Go to the State Tribunal and bring
all the records concerning its activities.

274
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,540
Do not leave out a single record.

275
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,500
And furthermore...

276
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:32,350
I understand that if I speak of it,
my life shall not be safeguarded.

277
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,670
Just a second!

278
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,770
At least give me a general idea
of the circumstances.

279
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,810
Why exactly are you having me
dress as an attendant?

280
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,080
How obstinate.

281
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,610
But, why do I feel as though
this has happened before?

282
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,110
Chief Royal Attendant!

283
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,060
Do you remember me?

284
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,100
How could your humble servant
have forgotten Your Majesty?

285
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,380
I see that my fellow Sungkyunkwan student
has become a State Tribunal captain.

286
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,800
I was very happy to find your name
in the State Tribunal records.

287
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,730
Your grace is unbounded, Your Majesty.

288
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:58,180
Are you aware that the former
chief royal attendant committed suicide?

289
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,090
I am aware of it.

290
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,500
Was this case transferred from
the Ministry of Justice to the Tribunal

291
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,090
because you doubted their integrity?

292
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,630
You are still as clever as ever.

293
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,650
That faction already controls
the Ministry of Justice,

294
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,970
and if the case falls into their hands,

295
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,670
I shall never discover the truth, shall I?

296
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,380
The truth? What truth do you speak of?

297
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,680
That is what I shall be asking you
in the future.

298
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,510
Excuse me?

299
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:40,360
Starting today, pretend to investigate
the former attendant's death.

300
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,530
Did you say a pretend to investigate?

301
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,520
I did.

302
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,000
There is a separate case
you are to investigate.

303
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,430
What I want to find out
through your efforts...

304
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,750
...is the whole story surrounding
the Crown Princess's death.

305
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,620
What do you mean His Majesty's actions
seem unusual?

306
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,490
I am not certain, but judging
from his recent secretive actions,

307
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,870
I believe he has suspicions
regarding events from eight years ago.

308
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,800
We must come up with a plan.

309
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,780
If by some chance the truth is revealed,

310
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,400
he could use this as an opportunity
to remove the maternal clan from power.

311
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,950
Moving up the date of the marital
consummation safeguards us in many ways.

312
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,270
It is certainly a move made by the
heavens.

313
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,510
What does that have to do with anything?

314
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,260
When one has a child,
a parent's heart seeks to ensure safety.

315
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,640
Indeed, the late King, after fathering
Prince Yang Myung and the Crown Prince,

316
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,560
began acting less rashly,
with the princes' well-being in mind.

317
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,870
What are you so worried about,
Chief Councilor?

318
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,430
We have a safety shield.

319
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,120
No matter how deep His Majesty digs,
nothing will come out of it.

320
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,820
And even if something
were to be uncovered,

321
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,050
he will have no choice but to cover it up.

322
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,150
Why do you stare at me like that?

323
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,420
You are most handsome
when you are reading.

324
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,770
When you smile,
you are all the more handsome.

325
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,940
I am embarrassed
so please do not stare any longer.

326
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,570
But, Husband,
how long do you intend to read?

327
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,850
Why do you not fix your gaze upon me?

328
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,300
If only I were that book.

329
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,690
If there were characters
brushed on my body,

330
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,240
would you look at me more?

331
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,820
It would be quite a struggle
to wash the ink off your body.

332
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,550
What is that supposed to mean?!

333
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,200
Our eyes had only just met that moment!

334
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,250
Since he left, it's been already...

335
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,790
...I guess it's only been two days.

336
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,020
Please take care of Mother
while I am gone.

337
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,850
I should do as he asks.

338
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,830
Mother. Your daughter-in-law is entering.

339
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,940
Yes, Princess. Please come in.

340
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,680
Mother, what were you doing?

341
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:05,520
I was reading a letter
sent by the Queen Mother.

342
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,290
From the Queen Mother?

343
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,190
What did she write?

344
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,080
She asked if you were doing well.

345
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,110
And?

346
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:20,660
She writes that the date for His Majesty's
marital bed has been moved up.

347
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,200
Marital bed?

348
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,570
When is that to be?

349
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,350
In three days, on the 18th.

350
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,250
That soon?

351
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,550
Mother, I believe
I need to go to the palace.

352
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,550
Going to the palace is fine,
but suddenly why...

353
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,230
I have a few words of advice
for Her Highness, the Queen.

354
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,470
Then, I will take that
as permission to go.

355
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,520
To conceive a son...

356
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,190
First, eat a lot of vegetables.

357
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,250
And you must sleep on your left side.

358
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,640
And, what else was there?

359
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,970
Your Highness. I beg you to behave...

360
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,700
Ah, that's strange.
I'm sure I saw it earlier.

361
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,720
Seven Dangers Eight Benefits.
Where was it?

362
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:44,090
I think I saw it here.

363
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,090
What is this? Have you read this book too?

364
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,560
What use have you for it?

365
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,210
For teaching purposes.

366
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:00,430
Aigoo. You've seen it all,
and yet act so innocent.

367
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,010
Seven Dangers Eight Benefits...

368
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,390
In return for sharing these secrets
with the Queen,

369
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,620
what shall I request?

370
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,500
Shall I ask her for a peony ornament?

371
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,610
Or a pearl hairpin?

372
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,560
Princess! It has been such a long time!

373
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,200
Your Highness.

374
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,030
Have you been well?

375
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,010
And the Prince Consort is well too?

376
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,650
Yes. And has Your Highness been well too?

377
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,570
No. Your Grandmother has not been well.

378
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,900
Excuse me?

379
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,550
Since the one and only Princess
does not come see me, how could I be well?

380
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,610
Forgive me.

381
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,850
Oh dear. It was merely in jest.

382
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,070
Were you coming to see the Queen Mother?

383
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,400
I'm on my way. Come with me...

384
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,500
Oh, no. I just received an urgent message
summoning me home.

385
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,680
And so, I was on my way out.

386
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,230
Please be well.

387
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,930
A truth bound and tied by the late King.

388
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,560
A secret safeguarded by that attendant
at the cost of his life.

389
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,010
What could it possibly be?

390
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,210
Your Majesty.

391
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,280
Professors from the Office of Astronomy
and the Royal Physician seek an audience.

392
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,580
Send them in.

393
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,890
Your Majesty,
I would like to check your pulse.

394
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,850
So if you would please turn for a moment.

395
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,910
It is not time for the monthly meeting.

396
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,490
So how is it that all of you
have come together?

397
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,260
What is this?

398
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,310
A designated date for the marital bed,
Your Majesty.

399
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,630
-In three days?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,970
It is the most auspicious date,

401
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:09,570
and the perfect date for His Majesty
and the Queen's consummation.

402
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,740
And the weather will also never be better.

403
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:20,810
Yes, we have also designated
the most suitable bed chamber.

404
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,250
Above all, with your health recovered,

405
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,130
it is essential you share the marital bed
as soon as possible.

406
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,430
I have not recovered to that point yet.

407
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,420
Forgive my presumption,

408
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,610
but your recovery has been significant.

409
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,010
If I say I am ill, I am ill!

410
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,700
However, it is unknown
when providence may shift.

411
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,300
That is so, Your Majesty.

412
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:50,070
It is rare for conditions to be
so optimal for consummation,

413
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,140
Your Majesty.

414
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,060
You cannot delay any longer.

415
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,740
-For the sake of national stability.
-Did I not say I am still unwell?!

416
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,610
You are disturbing my work,
so leave at once!

417
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,840
Your Majesty.

418
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,750
Do you not hear my order?

419
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,420
Leave at once!

420
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
It's not the first time
nor a rare occurrence,

421
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,850
that the King rejects the marital bed.

422
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,180
It is as I expected.

423
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,900
A date for the marital bed
obtained with difficulty

424
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,460
is at risk of being lost.

425
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,960
How is it that you are so calm?

426
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,130
Well, we must make it happen,
no matter what it takes.

427
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,860
Then, do you have any particular leverage?

428
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,070
The human talisman
that I mentioned earlier...

429
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,550
That again?

430
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,710
His Majesty knows of her existence.

431
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:14,630
Wasn't that shaman to watch over him
as he slept?

432
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,320
Which is why it is strange.

433
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,000
He has never been one to comply
with having talismans in his chambers.

434
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,930
His Majesty doesn't allow anyone near him
but Woon and the chief attendant.

435
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,910
And yet, he has allowed the shaman to stay
even after he has discovered her.

436
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,710
What could that mean?

437
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,910
Do you think he is merely complying
in good faith?

438
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,820
What, then?

439
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,100
It's love.

440
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,310
If that's true, we can not just sit back
and watch this go on!

441
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,850
And if we don't sit back and watch?

442
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,340
We must remove that shaman at once...

443
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,630
We cannot do that.

444
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:03,370
That shaman must be kept with His Majesty
until the upcoming consummation date.

445
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,370
You told me eight years ago
a Royal Marriage is not a matter of love.

446
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,220
You were right.

447
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,070
But the marital bed can be realized
with the use of love.

448
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,210
As it is a love that I can not possess...

449
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,480
...what else can I do, but use it?

450
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,470
What you say is right.

451
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,320
I'm confused whether
the person I'm seeing

452
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,650
is you, or that child.

453
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:05,100
However, until I put
this confusion to rest,

454
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,250
until I understand what this feeling is,

455
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,710
don't you dare...

456
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,730
...go far from me.

457
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,150
-So pretty.
-Look at these colors. So pretty.

458
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,180
Come quickly. A huge present came for you.

459
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,040
So pretty.

460
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,650
-The colors!
-So pretty.

461
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,230
They're so pretty.

462
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,870
Look at the blade craftsmanship.
It's completely perfect.

463
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,420
And, isn't this sound marvelous?

464
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,010
Jan Shil. Where did this come from?

465
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,660
Here's the letter.

466
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,720
Do they please you?

467
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,810
May you unfold your divine powers
to your heart's content.

468
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,540
The broad minded, free-spirited,
chivalrous man.

469
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,600
Oh! What brings her all that luck anyway?

470
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,130
Did she save the country in a former life?

471
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,490
Are you looking for me?

472
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,530
Did my gift please you?

473
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,980
I didn't know what you'd like so I brought
a male shaman to select them for me.

474
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,510
Ah, next time I will get you
a grass chopper.

475
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,120
Why do you do this, Lord?

476
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,940
What do you mean?

477
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,080
I am a shaman.

478
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,720
Which is why I sent
objects used for shaman rituals.

479
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,630
I am asking why you sent me gifts.

480
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,160
Do you really have no idea?

481
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,430
I do not.

482
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,850
Because I like you.

483
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,320
Because I have feelings for you.

484
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,120
Your jesting goes too far.

485
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,400
I am not jesting.

486
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,020
If it is not in jest, then what is this?

487
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,960
If a man holds feelings for a woman,
what else could it be but love?

488
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,700
What do you know of me
that you should feel love for me?

489
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,210
Because you were the first.

490
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:43,460
To tell me not to mask myself
with laughter and deception.

491
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,450
To let go of the pain I hold in my heart.

492
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,690
Because you were the first
to say such things to me.

493
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,330
And because to me...

494
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,970
...those words provided solace.

495
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,580
Yes, what you say is true.

496
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,880
What could I know of you?

497
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,100
At first, I looked upon a woman

498
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,040
who merely resembled a girl
I once held in my heart.

499
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,650
But now, that is not the case.

500
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,200
The person I look upon now...

501
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,320
...is you.

502
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,330
Again, fates that must not be connected
are being woven together.

503
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,700
I feel an uneasy energy.

504
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,010
There will be chaos.

505
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,690
It will be an omen
of the bloodbath to come.

506
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:55,800
How can mere humans block destiny?

507
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,290
The final opportunity,

508
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,760
for this chaos to end is in three days.

509
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,670
If the marriage
is successfully consummated,

510
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,700
these bonds of fate will be broken again.

511
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:17,410
Once that day passes, I will send the lady
to a safe place far away.

512
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,070
Do you think that sending her away
will suffice?

513
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:27,710
The truth that we buried
is slowly beginning to show its face.

514
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,410
Even if the truth is uncovered,
nothing changes.

515
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,450
You know the situation.

516
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,770
As long as they hold
everyone's weaknesses,

517
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:45,450
there is no one who can avoid
the miserable fate that approaches.

518
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,970
I know well how good-looking I am,
but please stop staring.

519
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:18,150
Though, I suppose a man at work
always looks quite grand.

520
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,580
And, on top of that,
a King of a country...

521
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,180
It must be a grand sight, indeed.

522
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,990
You laughed?

523
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,720
Did you just laugh?

524
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,660
I've made a mistake worthy of death.

525
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,370
Follow me. We shall go for a walk.

526
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,660
Do you hold a grave anxiety in your heart?

527
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,170
Your Majesty's face is filled
with signs of exhaustion.

528
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:17,740
Today, someone died because of me.

529
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,570
Because I made a mistake in my judgement,
he took his own life.

530
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:31,690
Therefore, I am the one who killed him.

531
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,090
The shadow of death always follows me.

532
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,040
The people I hold dear
all fall into danger because of me.

533
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,180
I can not protect them.

534
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,510
Not only am I unable to protect them...

535
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,470
...I am unable to redress
the injustices they suffer.

536
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:04,300
It is not Your Majesty's fault.

537
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,450
It is most likely they were all aware,

538
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,500
of how hard Your Majesty
tried to protect them.

539
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,600
Of how deeply you cared for them.

540
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:22,760
It is most likely
they felt your true heart.

541
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,590
So, please do not blame yourself.

542
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,460
Use your divine powers and tell me.

543
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,990
Will I be able to uncover the truth
I am seeking?

544
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,880
You will uncover it.

545
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,980
Then, do not rely on your
divine powers this time...

546
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,480
...and tell me your thoughts.

547
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,700
Will I be able to uncover the truth
I am seeking?

548
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,510
You will uncover it.

549
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,350
How can you be so certain?

550
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,290
Because I have faith
in Your Majesty's benevolence and wisdom.

551
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:11,080
Twisted and entangled knots
cannot be unravelled in a single attempt.

552
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,050
But as each entangled portion
is disentangled...

553
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,810
...wouldn't the hidden truth show itself
at some point?

554
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:31,160
Therefore, please have faith in yourself,
Your Majesty.

555
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,230
Thank you.

556
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,910
It has been a very long time
since I have received...

557
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,400
...such warm solace.

558
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,390
How many times must I repeat
the same thing?!

559
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,400
Have I not said that I am still unwell?!

560
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:14,220
Are you certain there is no reason
other than your ill health?

561
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,110
So, are you saying the King is a liar?

562
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,820
It has been days since the human talisman
was placed in the King's palace.

563
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,320
Why do you bring that up
in this conversation?

564
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:32,320
Did it not have any effect?

565
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,720
I asked you why you bring that up now.

566
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,470
If the shaman to help you
recover your health

567
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,080
could not accomplish that mission,

568
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,430
mustn't we handle it according to the law?

569
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,060
What do you mean,
handle it according to the law?

570
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,160
Upon entering the King's bed chamber,

571
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,330
one must proffer one's life as collateral.

572
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,980
If several days in the King's bed chamber
have not served to improve his health...

573
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,240
...it is a sufficiently suspicious act.

574
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,520
For the sake of protecting
the safety of the country,

575
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,870
she must be eliminated.

576
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,490
It is love.

577
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,910
We can use that love.

578
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,870
If he uses poor health as an excuse
to refuse the marital bed once again...

579
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,150
...we blame the human talisman
for not performing her duty,

580
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,250
and handle it appropriately
according to the law.

581
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:36,060
And if His Majesty
agrees to the marital bed?

582
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,440
Then, since the human talisman
has fulfilled her duty, we let her go.

583
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:46,510
Whether she leaves as a living being
or a dead body

584
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,960
is the only difference.

585
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,970
That girl's life is in our hands.

586
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,070
What if...

587
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:04,340
...even after the marital bed, he insists
on keeping the shaman with him...

588
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,370
...and issues a royal order?

589
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,380
What will you do then?

590
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:19,120
Then, you will need to rouse
the Confucian scholars.

591
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,330
Isn't Joseon built
on the foundations of Confucianism?

592
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,620
If His Majesty, who is to be
a role model for the people,

593
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,220
secretly keeps a shaman
in his private palace...

594
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,780
...how would the Confucian scholars react?

595
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,520
I know well how good-looking I am,
but please stop staring.

596
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,450
Unnie.

597
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,010
We already cleaned this morning.
Why do we have to do it again?

598
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,830
I've told you already that tonight
Their Majesties join in the marital bed.

599
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,260
Marital bed?

600
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,660
That's right, marital bed.

601
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,400
And so, as I said, we are going to gather
and pray for a successful union.

602
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,760
Aigoo, you little crow of a girl.

603
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,540
Your Majesty.

604
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:59,510
To strengthen the relationship
between King and country.

605
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:05,820
It is a matter of course
that you must establish an heir.

606
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,900
That is the only way you can ensure
the entire country's stability.

607
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,230
That's enough.

608
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,220
Before my duty to serve you,

609
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,930
I have an appointed duty
to serve the country.

610
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,890
-You can not delay this any longer...
-How can you be acting like this too?!

611
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,270
More than anything,
now that they know about her,

612
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,830
you will need to be extremely cautious
in your decisions.

613
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,320
If you continue to refuse so vehemently,

614
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:40,470
it is the girl who will be endangered.

615
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:52,170
I am concerned that Your Majesty
will be scarred yet again.

616
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:58,830
I am worried you will blame yourself again
that you could not protect her.

617
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,140
Your Majesty.

618
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:13,310
Do not bring the girl in tonight.

619
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,170
I do not wish for her...

620
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,770
...to watch over an empty room alone.

621
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:40,500
Your Majesty, His Majesty has arrived.

622
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:17,590
You are not to go
to the King's quarters tonight.

623
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:27,010
What thoughts bring
such a saddened expression to your face?

624
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,320
Why have you come here again?

625
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,260
Is it because you have heard about
the King and Queen's consummation?

626
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,200
Please go.

627
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,110
His Majesty is the King of a country.

628
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:58,000
Establishing a successor for the welfare
of the nation is a matter of course.

629
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,150
I know that.

630
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,850
If you hold His Majesty in your heart,
the only things that await you...

631
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,180
...are imprisonment and pain.

632
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,220
That too, I know.

633
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,520
Then, why do you show tears?

634
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,120
Can it not be me?

635
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:32,670
Can it not be me?

636
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:41,390
Your Majesty shall remove
your head piece.

637
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:03,470
Your Majesty shall unfasten your belt.

638
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:17,260
You must be pleased to have things
work out as you wished, Queen.

639
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:24,620
How could this be solely my wish?

640
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,340
From the Queen Dowager
all the way down to the land's people...

641
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,960
...isn't it everyone's wish?

642
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:41,730
Can I not be the one?

643
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,880
Please go.

644
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,900
Will you go with me?

645
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,780
The title of Prince makes me sick.

646
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,430
I am ready to shed it at any moment
and depart.

647
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:02,590
I am sure you are not completely happy
living as a shaman either.

648
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,610
If you want to run away
from these troubling circumstances.

649
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,940
If that is the case.

650
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,400
Will you run away with me?

651
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,280
No matter what Your Majesty says,

652
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,810
I am your woman.

653
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:07,590
After all, if you cannot have
the King's heart...

654
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:12,770
...I suppose you would want, at least,
to be mother to the future King.

655
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,190
Fine.

656
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:30,860
I shall for once untie your ribbon.
