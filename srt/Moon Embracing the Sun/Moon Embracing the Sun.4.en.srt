1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,050
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,700
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historic basis.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,190
Episode 4

4
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,070
Your name, Yeon Woo...

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,920
...does it mean gentle rain?

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,200
Yes. It is those Chinese characters.

7
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,780
Then, I suppose it could also mean
a misty rain, then.

8
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,960
That's a pretty name.

9
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,070
Forgive me, but...

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,430
...may I ask the meaning
of your birth name, Your Highness?

11
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,490
It is a name His Majesty gave me in hopes
that I would become like the Sun.

12
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,270
Lee Hwon.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,650
But, why have you been avoiding me?

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,740
Was it...

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
...because you dislike me?

16
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,780
No!

17
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,450
So, you don't dislike me.

18
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,470
Then, why make me undertake
this much risk?

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,440
How disloyal of you.

20
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,450
I'm not the one you hold in your heart.

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,930
What do you mean?

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,590
I've heard that recently
in this same spot...

23
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,430
...you met the
Personnel Minister's daughter in secret.

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,210
That was purely because of you.

25
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,300
If you hadn't lied, there would have been
no reason for me to mistake her for you.

26
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,500
Mistake?

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,980
Then...

28
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,440
You don't even think of your disloyalty
in fooling the Crown Prince.

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,620
You just blame...

30
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,660
Wait a minute.

31
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,570
-Could it possibly be that you...
-Yes?

32
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,860
Were you jealous of us?

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,900
Excuse me?

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,850
No.

35
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,800
This is a big problem.

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,020
A woman's jealousy is one
of the seven reasons to divorce a wife.

37
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,260
And, to think the girl
who's going to be my queen is so jealous.

38
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,680
I said it wasn't so, why do you keep...

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,530
Excuse me?

40
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,090
Soon, a ban on weddings will be issued.

41
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,300
That means a Crown Princess
will be selected soon.

42
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,550
You will put your name
on the maiden list too, won't you?

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,990
I will be waiting.

44
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,220
Knowing you, I'm certain
you can become the Crown Princess.

45
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,490
You told me to throw it away,

46
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,800
but I knew you would look for it again.

47
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,420
I did well not to throw it away, didn't I?

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,590
Hyung Sun.

49
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,570
Yes, Your Highness?

50
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,840
You don't know the reason the maiden
Yeon Woo sent me lettuce, do you?

51
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,920
Wouldn't it be to symbolize waiting
and to relay the hearts of the people?

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,580
Your Highness waited and waited to see
what would grow out of the pot.

53
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,050
However, no matter
how long that wait felt,

54
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,130
how could it compare to the feelings
of the farmers waiting to harvest rice?

55
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,980
Furthermore, lettuce is a vegetable
used as medicine.

56
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,680
If one takes lettuce, one may temporarily
feel sleepy, but later, the head clears

57
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,510
and not only does it make one wiser,

58
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,140
but it also breaks up the anger
stacked up in one's chest.

59
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,970
And because recently, Your Majesty
harboured resentment towards Tutor Heo,

60
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,160
don't you think an entreaty to let go
of that anger and focus on your studies

61
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,740
could have been part
of Miss Yeon Woo's profound thoughts?

62
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,710
How is it that you...

63
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,640
...the maiden Yeon Woo told me alone.

64
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,010
This is already the 14th time
you've talked about that lettuce.

65
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,650
Unless my head is a block of stone,
how could I forget?

66
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,610
I told you?

67
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,530
-Yes.
-When?

68
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,750
After you met at Hidden Moon Pavilion
for the ceremony and spoke of the lettuce,

69
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,900
every time you see me,
every time you have a free moment,

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,180
constantly...

71
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,160
Then, you must have also marvelled
at maiden Yeon Woo's wisdom.

72
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,550
At first, I marvelled
and it even made me shiver.

73
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,940
But, even the most beautiful song,
if heard too much...

74
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,690
Wait and see.

75
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,280
The girl will definitely become
a benevolent queen adored by all people.

76
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,860
A ban on weddings!

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,520
We will end our lesson here today.

78
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,120
Has the maiden Yeon Woo
been put on the maiden list?

79
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,660
Not yet.

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,310
Is there possibly some problem?

81
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,640
Crown Prince.

82
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,640
I pray you would listen
to your subject's small entreaty.

83
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,640
What do you mean entreaty.

84
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,620
As one of Joseon's people,

85
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,130
I know that putting her name on the list
is the proper thing to do,

86
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,810
but won't you please,
please exclude my sister?

87
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,400
I kneel and beg of you.

88
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,120
Why would an upright man of integrity
like you make such an entreaty?

89
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,090
The Crown Prince is asking his subject!

90
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,990
Answer the question.

91
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,450
Because she cannot be with Your Highness.

92
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,720
What do you mean that maiden Yeon Woo
cannot be with me?

93
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,210
What sort of outrageous nonsense is this?

94
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:18,500
I will pay for my crime
of disloyalty today in the future.

95
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,840
-However, please...
-So you're saying...

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,940
...that you intend to violate royal law
and become a rebellious subject?

97
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,250
Your Highness.

98
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,300
I cannot do that!

99
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,670
I cannot accept your entreaty.

100
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,240
The first reason is that
I don't want to lose you.

101
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,810
The second reason is that I...

102
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,280
I...

103
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,680
With your sister, Tutor Heo...

104
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,320
...I'm in love.

105
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,300
Your Highness, Your Highness...

106
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,070
No way.

107
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,010
The person His Highness has affection for
is absolutely not Tutor Heo.

108
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,820
Do not misunderstand.
It is not you, Tutor Heo.

109
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,230
Though I cannot tell you who it is,

110
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:51,070
just know that it is a female person
that looks just like you.

111
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,960
Your Highness...

112
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,310
Your Highness.

113
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,350
What are you going to do
about all this innuendo?

114
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,160
If you're going to profess your feelings,
you should be clear about who...

115
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,310
Quiet!

116
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,690
I haven't even professed my feelings
to her yet.

117
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,820
How can I tell someone else first?

118
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,190
Then, you shouldn't have
even mentioned it.

119
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,230
Disappointment, disappointment,
supreme disappointment!

120
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,300
None other than Tutor Heo!

121
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,290
How could he make such an entreaty to me?

122
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,230
Do you really have no idea why?

123
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,410
I suppose he doesn't find me
suitable for his sister.

124
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,850
Forgive me, but...

125
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,480
...I believe that is likely not what
Tutor Heo is thinking.

126
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,310
Then, what is he thinking?

127
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,620
The person to be selected
has already been designated anyway.

128
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,340
The Personnel Minister's daughter
has already been unofficially chosen.

129
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,300
What's the point
of putting her on the maiden list?

130
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,070
What good could possibly come out of it?

131
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,570
What are you doing?

132
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,870
What if our Yeon Woo...

133
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,510
...is selected
as a third stage final candidate?

134
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,770
Please give it to me.

135
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,630
Maidens not chosen in the third stage
are forever the Crown Prince's women,

136
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,900
and they must live forever alone,
do you not know that?

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,930
Wife!

138
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,950
Our Yeon Woo...

139
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,800
...are you saying you'd be fine with it...

140
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,890
...if we, with our own hands,

141
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,660
made her end up living alone forever
as if she were in mourning, my lord?

142
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,610
Then, as righteous loyal subjects,
we should violate the law?

143
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,800
How can you be so inflexible?

144
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,640
You can entreat His Majesty
to keep Yeon Woo's name off the list!

145
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,920
Absolutely not.

146
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,850
It's not enough that it's disloyal,
but what you're saying is also unethical.

147
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,040
Then, are you saying we just sit back
and watch helplessly?!

148
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,460
And therefore,
Tutor Heo likely made his entreaty

149
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,610
because of his love and concern
for his sister.

150
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,290
Then, the maidens that are not chosen
cannot enter the palace?

151
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,220
Occasionally they are pitied
and brought in as royal concubines.

152
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Was Yang Myung's mother also possibly...

153
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,260
That is so.

154
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,180
Consort Park was a final candidate
that was ultimately not selected,

155
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,260
and His Majesty felt pity for her
and brought her into the Palace.

156
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,360
However, most maidens are just forgotten.

157
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,020
Your Highness?

158
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,800
It's the Queen Mother.

159
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,830
Excuse me?

160
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,600
The elder supervising the Committee
is the Queen Mother.

161
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,460
What better opportunity to increase
the power of her side of the family?

162
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm certain the predesignated choice is...

163
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,960
I am the Personnel Minister
Yoon Dae Hyung's daughter,

164
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,590
Yoon Bo Kyung.

165
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,590
Your Highness.

166
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,280
Your Highness, where are you going?
Your Highness.

167
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,410
Your Majesty, His Highness,
the Crown Prince is here to see you.

168
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,120
Your Majesty.

169
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,980
I have something to say.

170
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,890
Please excuse us.

171
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,320
What is it you have to say?

172
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,100
Your Majesty.

173
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,400
Please do away with the predesignated
Crown Princess.

174
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,250
Is the Crown Prince having an audience
with His Majesty, the King?

175
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,360
Yes, that is so.

176
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,130
Do you feel they will be long?

177
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,230
There has been an order not to let
anyone in for the time being.

178
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,580
The elder supervising the Committee
is not me, but the Queen Mother.

179
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,560
Then, please issue a decree so that
the selection follows a strict criteria.

180
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,390
That is also outside of my authority.

181
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,130
That type of request should be made
to the Queen Mother.

182
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,450
Please overstep
the Queen Mother's authority.

183
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,650
Being King doesn't give one blanket right
to overstep anyone's authority.

184
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,690
Even more so, it doesn't give the right
to overstep filial propriety.

185
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,020
I understand it is not without precedent
that a King oversees the selection.

186
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,320
I won't be making any intervention
for the sake of your feelings.

187
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,510
I am not entreating you purely
because of my feelings.

188
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,050
If it's not because of your feelings,
then what?

189
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,760
This is to be the Crown Princess.

190
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,050
It is the selection
of this country's future Queen.

191
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,990
Isn't it right that a person befitting
that position is selected?

192
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,240
A fellow that knows such a thing
behaved so rashly?!

193
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,110
It's a marriage hastened to block
any sort of rumoured scandal about you.

194
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,870
You can't think of your own mistake
that put us in this situation.

195
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,230
Who are you expecting to make this right?!

196
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,770
If I were to put everything back
in proper order...

197
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,930
...will you degree a just
and fair selection?

198
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,440
Immediately send a page...

199
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,620
...to look into
the Sungkyunkwan student council

200
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,090
and find out who the head
of the student council is.

201
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,080
Excuse me?

202
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,230
Why the head
of the Sungkyunkwan student council?

203
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,330
Tell him this is strictly confidential,

204
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,640
so if he speaks recklessly,

205
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,760
I cannot safeguard his life.

206
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,410
That goes for you too, Hyung Sun.

207
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,350
Do you understand?

208
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,890
Yes, I shall carry out your command.

209
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,840
What do you mean "promise?"

210
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,350
What are you saying that I promised you?

211
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,340
You said that after
His Highness the Crown Prince's ceremony,

212
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,140
you would arrange a ceremony between
the Director Heo's daughter and myself.

213
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,330
If that's what you are talking about,
I made no such promise.

214
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,790
But, you certainly...

215
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,260
I said I would think about it.
I never promised to make it happen.

216
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,330
If you have finished what
you've come to say, you may leave now.

217
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,450
Is the reason
you've suddenly changed your feelings...

218
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,810
...that the Crown Prince
has perhaps made an entreaty?

219
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:27,090
Did the Crown Prince indeed
make the same entreaty as I?

220
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,670
Just as in general...

221
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,550
...there are men who are meant to be kings
and those meant to be subjects...

222
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,020
...it is the same for women.

223
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,210
Some are meant to be queens and others
are meant to be princess consorts.

224
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,950
Director Heo's daughter, then...

225
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,190
...is meant to be Queen?

226
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,120
If that child is chosen, I suppose so.

227
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,950
If she is not chosen in the process...

228
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,630
...then will you give me permission?

229
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,720
The maidens not chosen in the final stage
are the Crown Prince's women.

230
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,320
Have you forgotten that is the law?!

231
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,260
Then...

232
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,560
...are you ordering me
to just sit and watch,

233
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,660
as the girl I love falls into misery?

234
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,560
What?

235
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,570
Everyone knows that Minister Yoon's
daughter has been predesignated.

236
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,050
How can you order me
to just sit and watch?

237
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,940
Do I have to enforce the law
to shut that mouth of yours?!

238
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,200
Don't ever utter those words again.

239
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,180
If you ever show such disloyalty again,
it will be considered...

240
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,420
...treason.

241
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,080
Do not laugh like that.

242
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,890
Everything I've sought...

243
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,350
...and everyone I've wanted...

244
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,700
...have been placed in your hands
much too easily, Crown Prince.

245
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,090
Please,

246
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,390
wipe that innocent smile
you send my way off your face.

247
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,960
So that I may hate Your Highness
to my heart's content...

248
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,920
...please.

249
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,350
And if you cannot even permit me that...

250
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,660
...please put this cold rough wind
blowing in my heart to rest.

251
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,670
Your Majesty.

252
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,730
Let's go to the Princess' quarters.

253
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,270
It's been a while
and I'd like to hear her laughter.

254
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,810
Forgive me.

255
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,820
My mind was elsewhere and I...

256
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,390
It's a longevity bracelet I made for you.

257
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,680
Please accept it.

258
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,430
I am honoured.

259
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,770
But, for what reason
have you approached me?

260
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,320
Reason?

261
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,060
Ah, is Yeon Woo well?

262
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,650
That's my reason.

263
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,030
Yes, she is well.

264
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,670
But, do you have a wife?

265
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,200
I am still unmarried.

266
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,030
Wow!

267
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,790
Then, what about a betrothal?

268
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,320
Do you have a betrothed maiden?

269
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,920
I do not yet.

270
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,900
These days,

271
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,500
I'm reading
the Book of the Virtuous Woman.

272
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,530
Excuse me?

273
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,180
What the Crown Prince said the other day
about me not knowing Chinese characters,

274
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,150
is not true.

275
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,700
Oh, right right right!

276
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,040
The riddle you presented,
I got the answer to that too!

277
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,730
If you close your eyes like this...

278
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,450
...the entire world becomes dark,

279
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,150
and if you open your...

280
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,360
Look at me, will you? Huh?

281
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,400
Look.

282
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,240
If you close your eyes like this,
the entire world becomes dark,

283
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,590
and if you open your eyes like this,
the entire world...

284
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,110
...becomes bri...

285
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,650
So pretty.

286
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,440
Your Majesty!

287
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,300
It's our Princess!

288
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,060
I am no longer a child.

289
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,260
What?

290
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,110
As a matter of fact, I had something
to discuss with Your Majesty.

291
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,550
Please come into my chambers.

292
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,970
What could our little Princess
have to say to me?

293
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,510
Did you just ask to be wed to Tutor Heo?!

294
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,670
Yes.

295
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,070
Since the Crown Prince will be having
his wedding ceremony soon...

296
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,320
...I also...

297
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,620
You cannot.

298
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,510
Excuse me?

299
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,420
Why not?

300
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,030
That young man is a rare man of talent
that will become a pillar of our country.

301
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,050
Then...

302
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,850
...isn't he plenty qualified
to wed a princess?

303
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,330
You are still young
and might not understand...

304
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,480
...but once a man marries a princess,
he cannot serve an office in government.

305
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,920
Not only that, he cannot hope to engage in
or propose any political activity.

306
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,220
And so?

307
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,560
Therefore...

308
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,460
...a rare man of talent cannot be trapped
as a princess' husband.

309
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Excuse me?

310
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,820
Then, only an ugly, foolish,

311
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,580
and dunce like fellow could marry me?

312
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,140
That is not what I meant.

313
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,460
I'm just saying it can't be Tutor Heo.

314
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,930
He is a man that will advise
the future King

315
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,560
and help lead our country in the future.

316
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,080
I don't like that.

317
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,770
All the men of excellence go to others...

318
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,550
...while the Princess marries an ugly
dunce, what's the meaning of that?!

319
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,920
Not a dunce.
I will marry you to a good man.

320
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,490
I don't want that.

321
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,270
If it's not him, I don't want to!

322
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,780
Didn't I say you cannot?!

323
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,830
Min Hwa.

324
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,520
If a man like that marries a Princess,
he will become miserable.

325
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,310
If he is bridled with that position,
his talents are tied down,

326
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,510
and his wings are clipped,
what could be sadder than that?

327
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,730
Forget Tutor Heo.

328
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,700
I don't want to!

329
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,590
Your swordsmanship is impressive.

330
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,470
I'm sorry, young master.

331
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,210
I told you it was all right, didn't I?

332
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,780
But, what brings you here?

333
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,310
Ah. Actually, I came to ask you something.

334
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,730
First, look me in the face, please.

335
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,020
Excuse me?

336
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,970
How could a lowly person like me
look at your face?

337
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,690
It's all right, so please look at me.

338
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,190
If there was a girl
that looked just like me,

339
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,720
who could it be?

340
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,130
Miss Yeon Woo.

341
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,910
Indeed.

342
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,950
But he wouldn't
have had a chance to meet her.

343
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,310
When, where?

344
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,870
How could they have met?

345
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
The day of the ceremony
where you received your exam honours...

346
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,000
...I happened to meet him in the palace...

347
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,350
Do you also...

348
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,930
...share the Crown Prince's feelings?

349
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,790
Do you feel the same way?

350
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,750
I know very well
what you are worried about, Brother.

351
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,700
-However...
-Do you know that...

352
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,800
...there is already a predesignated choice
for the Crown Prince?

353
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,580
I do know.

354
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,450
Fake an illness.

355
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,330
Fake an illness
and avoid the selection process.

356
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,490
Do you remember when I taught you
how to play baduk,

357
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,320
the critical points to keep in mind?

358
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,490
"Pi Gang Ja Bo."

359
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,130
"When the opposition is strong,
first make a plan to secure your safety."

360
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,230
-Brother.
-If, by any chance,

361
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,480
they find out about your relationship
with His Highness, you will be in danger.

362
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,850
Yeon Woo, you could become
a sacrifice of war.

363
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,230
I cannot.

364
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,450
Yeon Woo.

365
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,720
"Il Su Bul Toe."

366
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,250
"A piece that has been placed
cannot be taken back or moved."

367
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,930
I'm certain you taught me that, right?

368
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,140
A person's heart is the same.

369
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,740
A heart that has been placed
cannot easily be moved...

370
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,730
...so whatever the results
of the selection process may be...

371
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,080
...I cannot trick
the Crown Prince like that.

372
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,600
Why on earth are you having me dress
like a palace attendant?

373
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,370
So bristly!

374
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,440
Show your manners
in front of His Highness.

375
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,530
Ah, yes.

376
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,390
Are you the head of the student council
at Sungkyunkwan, Hong Gyu Tae?

377
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,660
Yes, I am.

378
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,470
How is it that you've given audience
to such a simple fellow?

379
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,380
When I was crowned,
I was also admitted into Sungkyunkwan.

380
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,150
Therefore, even though
we do not take our lessons together,

381
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,290
I am also like you,
a Sungkyunkwan student,

382
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,510
and have always been proud of that.

383
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,610
Your grace is immense.

384
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,150
However,

385
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,920
these days, I am ashamed
of my admission into Sungkyunkwan.

386
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,240
Excuse me?

387
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,750
When treading the path of learning,
actions reflect the ethics learned.

388
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,290
And when the King deviates
from the path of righteousness,

389
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,760
it is the subjects' duty
to lead him back to the right path.

390
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,630
How can those at Sungkyunkwan just sit
and observe the current state of affairs?

391
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,140
I don't know if this lacking subject
is misunderstanding your words.

392
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,230
But...

393
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,070
...could you possibly be referring
to the upcoming Crown Princess selection?

394
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,970
Answer me with your own mouth
as the King's subject.

395
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,070
Can the selection of the Crown Princess...

396
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,450
...be used as an instrument by one clan...

397
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,880
...to retain power?

398
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,450
We must take precautions
for the possibilities, you say?

399
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,830
Yes, we must.

400
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:44,520
As long as His Majesty and His Highness
favour Director Heo's daughter...

401
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,240
...we cannot be completely at ease.

402
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,640
Don't worry.

403
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,900
I am heading the selection process.

404
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,750
Is the Crown Princess the only one
who'll have a place next to His Highness?

405
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:03,360
If he were to bring that child
into the palace as a concubine...

406
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,040
That wouldn't be good.

407
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,630
That's not all.

408
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,830
If, by any chance,
she were to conceive first...

409
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,370
Indeed, that wouldn't be good.

410
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,970
What you say is right.

411
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,250
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to take precautions for the possibilities.

412
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,980
But, a plan?

413
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,830
It's not an easy task.

414
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,970
Aren't you the person
that eliminated a "Sun?"

415
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,290
You don't think
you could eliminate a "Moon?"

416
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,580
Furthermore...

417
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,980
...the High Shaman of Seongsucheong
is one of your people.

418
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,730
What problem could there be?

419
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,020
Throughout history, when the maternal clan
of the royal family takes over,

420
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,790
you know very well
the pathetic state the country falls into.

421
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,280
There are pay-off deals
for government appointments.

422
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,090
And the line of supporters
of the maternal clan is increasing.

423
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,390
Those who have bought their positions
are engaging in countless abuses of power.

424
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,070
How is it that the Sungkyunkwan students
who receive government salaries

425
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,780
can just stand idle like this?!

426
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,670
The Sungkyunkwan procession
with petitions for appeal.

427
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,620
Petitions for appeal!

428
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,570
The Sungkyunkwan procession
with petitions for appeal.

429
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,710
Petitions for appeal!

430
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,660
A Crown Prince that instigates
a student protest movement...

431
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,960
It appears that
the future of this country

432
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,650
will be quite interesting.

433
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,990
All things have their proper places.

434
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,470
I feel that is genuine governance.

435
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,520
All things and all people...

436
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,700
...must be enabled
to take their proper place.

437
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,780
That is what I, as future monarch,

438
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,800
believe my duty to be.

439
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,980
And that should begin

440
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,290
with the selection of the Crown Princess,
don't you think?

441
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,610
Is that your conviction of what is right?

442
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,550
It is.

443
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,530
Then...

444
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,490
...show me.

445
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,770
Attempt to convince me.

446
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,010
That is...

447
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,610
...what politics is about.

448
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,390
You intend to mobilize the Sungkyunkwan
to manipulate public opinion.

449
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,250
Impressive, Crown Prince.

450
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:45,360
Please send down a response
to our appeal, Your Majesty!

451
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,060
Please issue a decree for a just
and impartial Crown Princess selection

452
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,530
-that defies external pressures!
-Please issue a decree!

453
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:59,370
Aigoo! Aigoo!

454
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,560
A wailing protest,
what is the meaning of this?!

455
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,460
What sort of an outrage is this
with the selection almost upon us?!

456
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,980
It's already been 5 days, Your Majesty.

457
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,340
You must send down a response.

458
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,090
That is so, Your Majesty.

459
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,270
Whether the Sungkyunkwan students' appeal
is right or wrong,

460
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,300
it is customary for the King to send down
a positive or negative response.

461
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,440
This is utterly unjust, Your Majesty.

462
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,930
Since olden times,

463
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,370
the selection has been under
the jurisdiction of ranking court ladies.

464
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,080
Do not give your ear
to their impudent words.

465
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,400
This subject thinks the same,
Your Majesty.

466
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,970
To wail and lament

467
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,760
in the face of an upcoming
national event is a travesty of loyalty!

468
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,150
Eradicate the leaders of the protest
and punish them!

469
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,210
Punish them!

470
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,180
Their actions stem from concern
for their country with no self-interest.

471
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,360
How can we fault them for that?

472
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:59,090
Also, if we suppress their spirit
and block their admonitions,

473
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,060
who in the future would muster
the courage to criticize the government?

474
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,940
Regardless of the era,

475
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,730
consulting the public is the way to obtain
the consenting hearts of the people.

476
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,210
Where there is public consultation,

477
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,360
even the lower class
cannot be treated lightly.

478
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,800
And where there is no public consultation,

479
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,150
even the words of the highest officials
have no weight.

480
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,110
The Three Offices
have reviewed their petitions.

481
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,080
We feel that it would be appropriate

482
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,780
to consider public opinion
and issue a sincere response.

483
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,230
However, Your Majesty!

484
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,880
Royal secretaries, listen.

485
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,790
Please give your instructions.

486
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,030
I will respond to the students' appeal,
so draft it as follows.

487
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,980
I trust in your devoted loyalty
and will reflect your will

488
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,010
in the policies of the state.

489
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,220
Regarding this upcoming
Crown Princess selection...

490
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,640
...I will break with the custom
of the ranking court ladies...

491
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,310
...and will directly oversee the decision.

492
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,660
Moreover, I and three members each

493
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,110
from royal family,
Three Offices and State Council

494
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,600
will participate in the selection
of the Crown Princess.

495
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,080
I pledge the selection
will be just and impartial.

496
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,580
In addition,

497
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,880
the selection process will be held
in the King's quarters.

498
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,090
Furthermore,

499
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,990
to avoid extravagance
and financial burden on the people,

500
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,950
we shall employ a two-stage rather than
a three-stage selection process.

501
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,610
A royal marriage is an institution

502
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,940
that carries on the royal family
and the spirit of a nation.

503
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,430
How can you be inclined to listen to
the slander of foolish, immature students.

504
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,690
How can you refer to the students'
earnest admonitions as slander?

505
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,400
Earnest? Admonitions?

506
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,630
A predesignation is part
of the selection process.

507
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,810
If that is illegitimate, the royal family
in itself holds no legitimacy.

508
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,490
Queen Mother.

509
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,640
The maiden was designated after
repeated consideration and deliberation.

510
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,540
I'm saying she wasn't chosen because
of her bloodline. Do you understand?!

511
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,690
Then there should be no problem
if we change the selection process, right?

512
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,340
What?

513
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,660
If the maiden is so well-qualified,
then even if she is not predesignated,

514
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,070
wouldn't she be selected?

515
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,140
Then...

516
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,470
...are you saying
you are determined to defy me?

517
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,750
Sentiment and public opinion
are speaking as one right now.

518
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,080
It is something I can no longer ignore.

519
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,690
A monarch may not have a duty to be loyal,
but he has a filial duty.

520
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:49,070
How can a nation's monarch consider
only his bloodline as his parents?

521
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:54,220
If a King is the father of his people,
then the people are also his parents.

522
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,500
Your Majesty!

523
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,580
Queen Mother.

524
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,000
Who is it that protected your throne
from the traitors that threatened it?

525
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,300
You haven't forgotten what my clan
and I have done for you, have you?

526
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,860
I have not forgotten.

527
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,380
How could I have possibly forgotten?

528
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,970
For the sake of power
and the advancement of the clan...

529
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,910
...the horrific events
you and Yoon Dae Hyung orchestrated...

530
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:45,070
...the falsely accused
and slaughtered Prince Ui Seong.

531
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,830
If you knew about it...

532
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,990
...then even more so,
you cannot be doing this to me.

533
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,750
I made it so that not a drop of blood
touched your hand,

534
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,580
you cannot forget how I've served you!

535
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,200
Why do you think
I've been silent for this long?!

536
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,980
I couldn't exonerate Prince Ui Seong
even when I later found out the truth...

537
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,470
For whom do you think I kept quiet?!

538
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,290
I have fulfilled my filial duty
in keeping silent for 13 years.

539
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,900
No.

540
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,180
Do not desire anything more.

541
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,400
The selection will be executed justly
and impartially as decreed.

542
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,010
Is someone out there?

543
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,570
Please escort the Queen Mother.

544
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,940
Your Majesty.

545
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,460
You cannot do this to me.

546
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,020
Wait and see.

547
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,170
I am not one to back down now.

548
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,240
No, no.

549
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,580
That's too gentle.

550
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,570
Make your gestures bigger and plop down.

551
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,730
You have to make a noise when you sit.

552
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,770
Like this?

553
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,490
Yes.

554
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,080
That's enough of that.

555
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,920
If noodles are served,

556
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,700
make sure you make noise
and slurp them up.

557
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,220
It would be even better if you spilled
here and there, making a mess.

558
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,730
Ah! And tell them your hobby is reading.

559
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,190
Say you've avoided things like embroidery
and needlework altogether.

560
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,260
That much is true,
so it won't be hard to answer.

561
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,640
If they possibly ask you
how much literature you've mastered,

562
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,740
without fail, right or wrong,

563
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,690
tell them you mastered the Four Books
and Three Classics at age three.

564
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,480
And what else was there?

565
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,650
Mother.

566
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,820
What is it?

567
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,750
Do you think if I do those things,
I will be rejected in the first stage?

568
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,560
Huh?

569
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,680
What are you saying?

570
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,390
I was just anticipating the questions
they would ask...

571
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,740
You figured out what I was doing?

572
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,770
It would be strange if I didn't notice.

573
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,800
Don't do this, Mother.

574
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,710
Whatever the result may be,

575
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:05,280
I want to be a daughter
that Father can be proud of.

576
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,320
So, please just watch over me.

577
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,700
I will be waiting.

578
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,500
Knowing you, I'm certain
you can become the Crown Princess.

579
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,590
What are you doing here again
at this late...

580
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,220
Are you going somewhere?

581
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,610
I've already had a relapse
of my wandering habits.

582
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,790
I thought I'd come by and have a look
at your face before I left.

583
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,250
What a homely face.

584
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,120
Now that I've had a good look,
that's enough.

585
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,920
I'm going.

586
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,810
Will you be returning?

587
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,990
Why?

588
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,060
Are you worried I won't return?

589
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,790
Since you cut off communications
for a while when you're gone,

590
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,410
everyone worries.

591
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,060
You should send your kin news
occasionally during your travels...

592
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,520
Will you come with me?

593
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,710
They say the Crown Princess
has been predesignated...

594
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,460
...and ultimately the Personnel Minister's
daughter will become the Crown Princess.

595
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,310
You can only end up
becoming a concubine...

596
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:47,560
...or prohibited from marrying,
live forever alone.

597
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,400
If you want to run away
from these troubling circumstances...

598
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,210
...if that's the case,

599
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,760
I can throw away my princehood,
the title of Prince Yang Myung, all of it,

600
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,250
wrap you up and run away with you.

601
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,720
You go too far with your jesting.

602
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,870
Right.

603
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,250
I went too far, didn't I?

604
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:27,380
You're certain you won't regret
the path you choose, right?

605
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,340
Yes.

606
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,300
Then, don't be so troubled.

607
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,320
Knowing you, I'm certain you will do well.

608
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,700
Take out that Personnel Minister's
daughter with one blow.

609
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,630
Understand?

610
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,770
Since you weren't at your residence,

611
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,880
I thought I would be able
to find you here.

612
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,030
I heard that the first stage selection
has been made.

613
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,230
Why didn't you make
an entreaty to the King?

614
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,700
One day, a man named Zengzi
sought out Confucius and said,

615
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,520
"Master, won't you praise me?"

616
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,400
"My father beat me
for no particular reason today,"

617
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,050
"and I just bore it, staying still. "

618
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,260
"Wasn't that commendable?"

619
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,330
Then, do you know what Confucius said?

620
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,170
"You fool. "

621
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,530
"If you were to die,"

622
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,870
"your father would have become
a murderer of his own son."

623
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,840
"What a huge travesty
of filial devotion that would be."

624
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,550
"When your father beats you
without a reason..."

625
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,000
"...you must run away."

626
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,160
And so, you're going to leave?

627
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,620
The tree just wanted to stand still.

628
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,740
But the wind keeps blowing,
so what is there to do?

629
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,720
The best plan is to avoid it
before bending or breaking.

630
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,340
Or, is it the worst plan?

631
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,850
But, that moon...

632
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,500
...it will probably follow
wherever I go, right?

633
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,430
10 Days later Second Stage Selection

634
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:04,750
Being chosen in the first stage
and reaching this final stage,

635
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,390
you've gone through much difficulty.

636
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,410
I see you are all too nervous.

637
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,870
The palace is indeed a place where
people live, so don't be too frightened.

638
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,850
Since Your Majesty
is participating directly like this,

639
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,520
isn't it natural
that they'd be frightened?

640
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,260
Today, I have something I am curious about
and would like to ask you.

641
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,100
I am this country's King.

642
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,740
If you were to calculate
my worth in money...

643
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,710
...how much would it be?

644
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,900
Will you answer first,
daughter of Choi Sang Jin?

645
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,730
Excuse me?

646
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,090
One million, no ten million nyang.

647
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,630
Please be understanding.

648
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,480
I am ignorant in the matters of money,

649
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,550
I don't really know well how much
makes a large amount of money.

650
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,160
Then...

651
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,490
...will you answer next,
daughter of Yoon Dae Hyung?

652
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,940
Your Majesty's virtues,

653
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,760
are higher than the mountains
and wider than the seas.

654
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,320
How could one dare to count in money
and calculate in silver?

655
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,190
I dare entreat you,

656
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,960
when there exists a tool

657
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,050
to measure the weight of the heavens
and the depth of the ocean,

658
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,560
please ask me once again.

659
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,310
Then, will the daughter of Heo Young Jae
answer the question?

660
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,000
I will dare answer because you ask.

661
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,910
It is one nyang.

662
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,660
A miss!

663
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,280
A miss!

664
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,640
Your Highness!

665
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,870
Your Highness!

666
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,010
Your Highness! Your Highness!

667
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,110
Your Highness!

668
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,440
What happened?

669
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,510
I'm asking you what happened.

670
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,800
That...

671
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,640
To the people that are starving
and dressed in rags,

672
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,040
there is nothing more earnestly valued
than one nyang.

673
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,980
A wealthy man who has ten thousand nyang,

674
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,910
doesn't know how precious one nyang is,

675
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,060
but a poor man who has nothing

676
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,270
knows piercingly well
how precious one nyang is.

677
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,060
To the poor...

678
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,980
...Your Majesty is as acutely precious
as one nyang.

679
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:21,570
Please, I pray you govern
all of the people with impartiality.

680
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,250
What do you think, my Queen?

681
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,080
Isn't she quite a lovely daughter-in-law?

682
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,720
She is quite so.

683
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,140
It is a blessing to the country.

684
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,030
I was happy in knowing I had gained
good men in your father and brother.

685
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,920
But, now I see he had
a wise and beautiful daughter as well.

686
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,310
Won't you provide the Crown Princess
with some words of advice?

687
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,690
What could an old woman
have to say in addition?

688
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:07,280
Please serve the Crown Prince
with devotion and reverence.

689
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,330
I will continue to take it to heart.

690
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,270
Your Highness,
please won't you take one bite?

691
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,490
You will get sick.

692
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,200
Didn't I tell you I don't need it?

693
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,150
Why are you being like this?

694
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,410
The royal family
is terribly worried about you.

695
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,090
And since you were absent from the meeting
with the Crown Princess...

696
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,210
Crown Princess?

697
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,720
What does that have to do with me?

698
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,360
Didn't you like that maiden?

699
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:47,360
That...

700
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,030
...that was when I thought
she would be my husband's sister.

701
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,030
Excuse me?

702
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,710
Why is it that she can...

703
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,470
...and I cannot?

704
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,410
Take that table away!

705
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,450
I'm going to starve to death!

706
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,390
What is the matter?

707
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,320
Now then.

708
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,150
Don't cry and tell me.

709
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,160
Queen...

710
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,090
...please entreat His Majesty.

711
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,040
I will die if I can't be with him!

712
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,340
What sort of nonsense is this
to say to your mother?

713
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,180
Didn't I tell you
never to speak of that again?

714
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,680
I don't like that!

715
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,830
And, I don't like His Majesty, Brother,
Yeon Woo, none of them!

716
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,910
And I don't like you either!

717
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,880
Princess.

718
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,200
Princess!

719
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,240
Queen Mother!

720
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,110
Please entreat His Majesty.

721
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:16,450
Tell him to make Tutor Heo my husband!

722
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:19,460
What in the world is this?

723
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,050
-Please entreat him!
-Forgive me, Your Highness.

724
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,870
-Queen Mother!
-What are you doing just standing there?

725
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:29,210
-Take the Princess.
-Please entreat him!

726
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,840
-Please entreat him, please!
-Your Highness, please...

727
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,500
Queen Mother. Queen Mother!

728
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,880
Queen Mother! Please entreat him!

729
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,020
Queen Mother! Entreat him, please!

730
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,860
Queen Mother!

731
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,900
High Shaman.

732
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,180
What is it?

733
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,700
You have been summoned to see
the Queen Mother in secret this evening.

734
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,140
The Hidden Moon Pavilion

735
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,020
will be where you will stay
until the wedding.

736
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,220
It is customary to stay at a location

737
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,040
between the palace and your private home
before the wedding,

738
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,800
but His Majesty has designated
the Pavilion particularly for you.

739
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,130
It is one of the most beautiful buildings
in the palace.

740
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,170
Yes.

741
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,040
It is as beautiful as its name.

742
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,470
Please speak without honorifics.

743
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,520
Excuse me?

744
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,800
All right.

745
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:19,140
Tomorrow, you'll begin learning
what is expected of you in the ceremony.

746
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,070
So, you should sleep early this evening.

747
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,200
And also...

748
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,320
What is the handkerchief for?

749
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,150
You will be needing it.

750
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,960
We will step outside now.

751
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,630
Please rest comfortably.

752
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,670
Mother.

753
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,400
So, this is why she said
I would be needing it.

754
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:58,770
Were you, perhaps, weeping,
thinking of the family you left.

755
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,580
If that is so, open your window.

756
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,390
Your Highness!

757
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,320
Are you surprised?

758
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,070
You are prohibited from being here.

759
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,970
What are you doing here?

760
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,560
I bribed the palace ladies.

761
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,260
Wait a moment!

762
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,370
Wait a moment, Yeon Woo!

763
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,130
Please go back.

764
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,980
Your Highness, you are the Crown Prince
and must be a role model.

765
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,130
Your Highness!

766
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,540
Are you done crying now?

767
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,200
Your Highness.

768
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,190
I received special permission
from the King, so don't worry.

769
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,990
I've prepared
a one-man puppet show for you.

770
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,610
Neither you nor I will be able
to sleep tonight anyway,

771
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,220
so let's watch it together.

772
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,630
As it is a performance
put together in haste,

773
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,410
if the puppeteer's performance
isn't up to par,

774
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,770
I hope you will be understanding.

775
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,040
Please begin.

776
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,530
What did you just say?

777
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,630
Since the Crown Princess has changed,

778
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,010
I said to get rid of her.

779
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,830
His Majesty is having her building
guarded tightly.

780
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:27,930
An attack or poisoning is impossible.

781
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:33,890
The only way to proceed without
approaching her is through your skills.

782
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,420
I am here to safeguard the lives
and fortunes of the royal family.

783
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,860
As she is already been selected
as Crown Princess.

784
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,460
She is now also part of the royal family.

785
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:48,330
I don't believe Seongsucheong
is in such a good position right now.

786
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,890
With the incessant demands
of the Confucian scholars to close it,

787
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:54,520
isn't Seongsucheong
on the verge of being abolished?

788
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,470
If I no longer protect it,

789
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,150
what do you think will happen to it?

790
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,120
-Is that a threat?
-It is an order.

791
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,320
She is the Crown Princess.

792
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,760
Once you kill her,
she will no longer be Crown Princess.

793
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,590
With your own mouth,

794
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,540
you said the Personnel Minister's daughter
was the master of the Queen's quarters.

795
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,570
You need to take responsibility
for your words.

796
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,880
Use your black skills...

797
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:28,900
...to kill the child Heo Yeon Woo.

798
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,250
It was me, Ari?

799
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:57,670
It was to be me who drives that child
to the jaws of death?

800
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,480
Tell me, Ari.

801
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,610
What am I to do?

802
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,020
That child or Seongsucheong,

803
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,060
which do I protect?

804
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:46,410
Yi In Gong (There are Two People Inside)

805
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,770
Mu (Mudang)

806
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,230
Mother.

807
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:12,500
I've come to see you today
with something to say...

808
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,990
If she gets too close to the sun,

809
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:17,710
the demise of her family
will be brought upon her.

810
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:21,000
But the child was born,
destined to protect the sun.

811
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,710
I... I love you.

812
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:28,230
Oh my. I'm so embarrassed.

813
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,350
-I too...
-Truly...

814
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,770
Do I not have any other choice
but to kill her?

815
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,940
Crown Princess!
