1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,390
This drama is set in the Joseon Era
under a fictitious king.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,380
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historic basis.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,680
Episode 3

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,500
If she gets too close to the sun,

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,200
the demise of her family
will be brought upon her.

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,270
But the child will be born, destined
to be at the sun's side to protect it.

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,210
Please make sure that the child is safe.

8
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,530
Please protect her.

9
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,430
Two moons.

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,570
Milady, what are you doing at the palace?

11
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,160
Could it be that you are also to be
a companion to the princess?

12
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,620
Then, you too?

13
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,490
High Shaman.

14
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,150
The Queen Mother is waiting for you.

15
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,410
Let's go.

16
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,650
I, High Shaman of Seongsucheong,

17
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,160
have returned from the blessing ceremony
and come to see you, Your Highness.

18
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,840
Fine.

19
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,520
Were you able to carry out everything
as you had hoped in Songak?

20
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,860
There was confusion and disorder
amidst the heavens' divine secrets.

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,900
Therefore we offered up fervent prayer
for a few more days,

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,270
and I returned to the palace
later than expected.

23
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,970
I ask for your understanding.

24
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,770
Would I be so narrow-minded?

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
Aside from that...

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,310
...as you have received the message,
you must already know...

27
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,710
...that I would like
a physiognomy assessment,

28
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,550
of the Princess's companions
entering the palace.

29
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,590
What do you want to determine
through this assessment?

30
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,790
The countenance of a Queen.

31
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,400
After travelling through mountains
and streams purifying mind and spirit,

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,740
you must have more clarity
in your eyes than ever.

33
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,630
Between the two children,

34
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,500
determine if there is the countenance
of a future Queen.

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,340
Until the Queen calls for you,

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,500
please wait here for a while.

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,350
Excuse me.

38
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,830
Your name is Bo Kyung, right?

39
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,250
Although our first meeting
was not so pleasant,

40
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,560
couldn't we just forget the past
and try to get along from now onwards?

41
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,840
In the palace...

42
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,080
...you must not make anyone
into your enemy.

43
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,700
Even if it is your enemy,

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,530
on the outside, you must bite your tongue.

45
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,250
You must never show your true feelings...

46
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,200
...or allow anyone to discover them.

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,350
That is politics.

48
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,820
All right. Let's get on well.

49
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,910
Thank goodness. I thought
that you might still be angry at me.

50
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,500
No.

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,510
I was really sorry for what happened
that day as well.

52
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,990
Since you put it that way,

53
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,770
I do feel really relieved.

54
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,060
From now on, let's truly try
to get along well, shall we?

55
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,830
All right.

56
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,460
No matter how I look at this,
it doesn't seem like a flower at all.

57
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,580
What can this be?

58
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,090
That's right.

59
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,900
I can see her and ask her directly.

60
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,340
Your Highness.

61
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,390
I have confirmation that the companions
have already entered the palace.

62
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,460
Oh, right.

63
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,530
And did you manage to find out
whose daughters they are?

64
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,480
The Personnel Minister's daughter,
Yoon Bo Kyung

65
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,440
and Director Heo's daughter, Yeon Woo.

66
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,140
She has entered the palace
as I had guessed.

67
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeon Woo.

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,820
Yeon Woo, is it?

69
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,560
It's a very pretty name.

70
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,220
Could it be...

71
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,750
...that you have a maiden in your heart?

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,760
Hyung Sun.

73
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,250
I can only depend on you.

74
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,570
Your Highness.

75
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,910
Why?

76
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,930
Why are you acting like this?

77
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,310
Your Highness.

78
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,890
I can't do that, Your Highness!

79
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,780
Why can't you do it?

80
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,320
For a crown prince and a maiden
from a respectable home to meet alone.

81
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,390
And more over, inside the palace.
And in secret on top of that.

82
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,260
That is something
that absolutely cannot happen!

83
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,540
Furthermore...

84
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,250
...to penetrate the heavy security
and move about secretly

85
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,070
is, in a word, impossible!

86
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,140
That's why I am asking you
to help me, isn't it?

87
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,550
Have you forgotten about the recent
wall climbing incident?

88
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,530
The wounds on my exposed backside
from the brutal punishment,

89
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,190
have not even healed yet.

90
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,000
And is that all?

91
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,990
Today's schedule is no child's play.

92
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,050
In place of the His Majesty, the King,
busy with all matters of state,

93
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,330
you must attend the ball game
of the Seonjeongwan's new appointees.

94
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,650
-And also...
-The Eunuch Examination.

95
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,770
When you did not pass the examination
and were in utter despair...

96
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,440
...the person who earnestly comforted you,

97
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,740
the person who helped you.

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,050
Who was it, again?

99
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,760
It... it...

100
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,660
It was you, Your Highness.

101
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,790
The person who provided you
with focused tutoring,

102
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,730
on the subject to be tested,
The Doctrine of the Mean.

103
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,750
Who was it?

104
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,740
It was you, Your Highness.

105
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,400
And thus, you were not dismissed,
but rather, your rank was promoted.

106
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,300
Who was that due to?

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,410
It... it...

108
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,260
It was you, Your Highness.

109
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,890
Upon hearing the news
that you were entering the palace,

110
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,760
I was unable to sleep.

111
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,520
I will send someone shortly,
so let's meet again then.

112
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,110
Lee.

113
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,150
Hwon.

114
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,560
Always the same story...

115
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,130
That's absolutely...

116
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,520
...possible.

117
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,040
It must be hard on you,
entering the palace.

118
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,570
Through the Queen Mother's decree,

119
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,810
I am to be responsible for the education
of the Princess's companions.

120
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,910
And I have heard that
you have already completed

121
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,330
your studies of elementary
Chinese characters

122
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,830
and the Four Books for Women at home.

123
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,060
Is that right?

124
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,250
-Yes, that is so.
-Yes, that is so.

125
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,490
And so, I don't think I will give you
additional lessons on them.

126
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,190
Please just keep our Princess Min Hwa
company and enjoy yourselves.

127
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,800
Your Highness, have you been well?

128
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,150
Between the two of you,

129
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,810
which of you is Tutor Heo's sister?

130
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,720
-Princess.
-Is it you?

131
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,100
Is it you?

132
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,860
Which of you is Tutor Heo's sister?

133
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,950
It is I.

134
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,090
So it is.

135
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,190
I just knew it was you.

136
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,720
You resemble Tutor Heo,

137
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,880
so you are pretty as well.

138
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,620
Oh, right.

139
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,070
This is for you.

140
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,980
Inside it, there's a trinket.

141
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,720
I am deeply grateful.

142
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,890
I am the daughter
of Director Heo Young Jae

143
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,280
from the Office of Special Advisors...

144
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,960
...Heo Yeon Woo.

145
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,500
I am the daughter of Personnel Minister
Yoon Dae Hyung,

146
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,150
Yoon Bo Kyung.

147
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,070
Queen, Royal Consort.

148
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,230
Yes, Your Highness.

149
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,560
They are lovely children, are they not?

150
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,750
It is as though flower petals
have floated into the palace.

151
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,720
I hope that the both of them will become
good companions of the Princess.

152
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,500
-We shall heed your word.
-We shall heed your word.

153
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,010
Two moons risen up in the Joseon sky.

154
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,420
All you need to do is attend and watch.

155
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,940
There is no need for you to take part
in the match personally.

156
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,250
What if Your Highness were to be injured?

157
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,750
If I'm dead, so be it,
but I cannot tolerate boredom.

158
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,100
The day His Majesty finds out
about this, I'll be put to death.

159
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,170
Really.

160
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,280
You talk too much.

161
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,270
Have you been well, Your Highness?

162
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,530
Oh, Hyungnim!

163
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,580
Of course, I've been well.

164
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,400
Were you making your way
to the East Palace?

165
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,870
Yes, I was going to see you.

166
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,050
And perhaps see Tutor Heo
in the lecture hall.

167
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,850
Is Tutor Heo someone that you know?

168
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,300
He is a friend I made
after I left the palace.

169
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,120
Oh, I see.

170
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,240
I didn't know as Tutor Heo
didn't mention it.

171
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,720
Let's find another place to talk
instead of just standing here.

172
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,360
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

173
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,170
You must stay with your schedule.

174
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,760
It appears you are busy.

175
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,370
I will go and talk with Tutor Heo,

176
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,110
so please go on with your schedule.

177
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,860
That works out well!

178
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,530
Hyungnim, you should compete too.

179
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,120
Excuse me?

180
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,580
Guards, listen.

181
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,730
You and the Seonjeongwan members
are to split into two teams,

182
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,300
and we will play a ball game.

183
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,690
Your Highness.

184
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,050
With the East Palace's name at stake,
we absolutely must win.

185
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,320
Do you understand?

186
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,690
Certain victory!

187
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,570
Do you know each other?

188
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,620
He is a friend who studied with me
under the Chief Tutor.

189
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,440
He is Kim Jae Woon, the top
military scholar of the recent exams.

190
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,880
Didn't I tell you already?
I'm not a thief.

191
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,730
I am here to watch my brother
be awarded the top military scholar.

192
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,210
Why is it you blame everyone else
and tell lies when you open your mouth?

193
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,880
The person awarded top
military scholar is my brother's friend.

194
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,940
Well, if it isn't the person
who nearly became my brother?

195
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,370
This is another interesting
connection of fate.

196
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,850
Upon hearing the news
that you were entering the palace,

197
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,890
I was unable to sleep.

198
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,130
I will send someone shortly,

199
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,650
so let's meet again then.

200
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
-What's that?
-What?

201
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,290
It's nothing at all.

202
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,440
I can't do, it's too boring.

203
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,870
Let's go out and play, Yeon Woo.

204
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,460
-Excuse me?
-Hurry.

205
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,390
Quickly.

206
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,970
Now.

207
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,980
Princess, Princess.

208
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,490
Princess.

209
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,740
Princess.

210
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,150
Lee Hwon?

211
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,550
Let's go there, over there.

212
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,000
Come over quickly, quickly.

213
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,710
Start!

214
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,610
-Over here.
-Milady, here.

215
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,520
-Over here.
-Milady, here.

216
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,160
-Here, here.
-Over here.

217
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,430
-Over here.
-Milady, here.

218
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,210
I am from the East Palace.

219
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,620
I will send someone shortly,

220
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,520
so let's meet again then.

221
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,290
You are Tutor Heo's sister, correct?

222
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,930
I... it's not I.

223
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,460
-Here, here.
-Over here.

224
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,150
How can that be?
She looks really like Tutor Heo.

225
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,930
-Over here.
-Milady, here.

226
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
Hyung Sun.

227
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,980
What are you doing here?

228
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,810
Oh, yes.

229
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,660
I was just passing by. Now then...

230
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,860
Is there anything
that you may like to ask?

231
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,180
Is Tutor Heo in the Crown Prince's study?

232
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,540
Tutor Heo and the Crown Prince
are at the fields...

233
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,770
Tutor Heo playing ball games?

234
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,310
Princess.

235
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,600
Where are you?

236
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,760
Can you please clap your hands at least?

237
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,550
Here, over here.

238
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,050
-Tutor Heo is over there, over there.
-Where?

239
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,710
So then,

240
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,550
was there the countenance of a Queen?

241
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,350
Why are you not answering me?

242
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,620
There wasn't?

243
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,730
Congratulations.

244
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,650
Everything will go
according to your wishes.

245
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,480
So then...

246
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,140
...the Personnel Minister's daughter...

247
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,920
...she will one day be master
of the Queen's quarters.

248
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,160
What sort of joke of destiny is this?

249
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,480
Though one has
the countenance of a Queen...

250
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,800
...she is fated never to be master
of the Queen's quarters.

251
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,590
Although the other doesn't have
the countenance of a Queen,

252
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,030
she is fated to be master
of the Queen's quarters.

253
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,830
Two moons.

254
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,330
Two Suns.

255
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,750
And...

256
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,630
...the smell of death.

257
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,020
Your Highness!

258
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,860
-His Highness.
-His Highness.

259
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,820
Your Highness!

260
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,470
Capture that man at once!

261
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,460
Yes.

262
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,510
Your Highness.
It's a misunderstanding, your Highness.

263
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,990
All of you, stop!

264
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,230
Let him go at once.

265
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,090
Your Highness, I deserve to die.

266
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,610
This is a serious, competitive match.

267
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,120
From this point on, if you intentionally
allow me to steal the ball

268
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,780
or allow me to get by you...

269
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,720
...or leave the goal open for me,

270
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,140
all of you will be severely punished
under military law!

271
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,060
Take heed.

272
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,300
-We shall obey your order!
-We shall obey your order!

273
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,410
Princess.

274
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,330
Why are you being like this?

275
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,210
If the King finds out,
there will be big trouble.

276
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,860
Don't worry.

277
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,800
The King always takes my side.

278
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,950
What are you all doing?

279
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,790
Take the Princess back at once.

280
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,750
It is fine if everyone becomes one
of the Crown Prince's people.

281
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,660
Heo Yeon Woo,

282
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,530
as long as you are willing to be mine.

283
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,730
Your Majesty!

284
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,290
Oh, it's you, Princess.

285
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,220
Are you enjoying your time
with your companions?

286
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,100
Yes.

287
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,220
I like this girl especially.

288
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,430
Whose daughter are you?

289
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,750
I am the daughter of Director Heo,
Yeon Woo.

290
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,530
Then you must be
the Personnel Minister's daughter.

291
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,830
That is so.

292
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,400
You truly have outstanding daughters.

293
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,010
Your kindness is immeasurable,
Your Majesty.

294
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,380
I hope that you will become
good companions of the Princess.

295
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,210
-We shall take it to heart.
-We shall take it to heart.

296
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,160
But since you have already
entered the palace,

297
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,430
you are not allowed to talk
of the greenhouse trees.

298
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,280
Do you understand
the meaning of my words?

299
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,930
Personnel Minister's daughter,
would you answer?

300
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,910
Please forgive me.

301
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,120
I have always been taught by my father

302
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,710
that literature and politics
are the realms of men,

303
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,070
and that virtues and obedience
are the realms of women.

304
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,040
And so,

305
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,740
I have only studied Chinese characters,
the Four Books for Women,

306
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,340
and the Book of the Virtuous Woman.

307
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,880
It's enough for a girl to learn
to that standard.

308
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,740
So, then...

309
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,880
...Director Heo's daughter,
would you like to offer an answer?

310
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,900
The phrase "not to talk
of the greenhouse trees,"

311
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,580
originates from the tale
of Kong Guang, a Han Prime Minister.

312
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,730
All right. What is the tale?

313
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,720
Even when those closest to him asked
what trees grew in the greenhouse,

314
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,720
it is said that Kong Guang
would never answer.

315
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,470
Would you also explain
the meaning of the tale?

316
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,880
It means that matters
of the palace and the court,

317
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,530
must never be divulged
outside the palace walls.

318
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,220
You're doing very well, I see.

319
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
It is just as you said.

320
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,300
You must never speak of things you see,

321
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,620
hear or feel inside the palace
outside its walls.

322
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,580
Will you take that to heart?

323
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,540
-Yes.
-Yes.

324
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,580
Your Majesty.

325
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,550
Prince Yang Myung is requesting
an audience.

326
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,860
Let him in.

327
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,940
I suppose there will be another fit
of scolding like a bolt out of the blue.

328
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,330
Your loyal subject, Yang Myung,
is here to pay respects to Your Majesty.

329
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,220
What brings you here?

330
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,550
Please forgive me.

331
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,320
It's not that I have forgotten
Your Majesty's warning

332
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,330
to be cautious of making personal visits
to the palace, but...

333
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,660
I am asking why you have come to see me.

334
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,410
Your subject...

335
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,700
...has a small request to make
of Your Majesty.

336
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,490
You have a...

337
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,790
...request?

338
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,340
That is so.

339
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,680
Speak.

340
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,300
There is a girl I have in my heart.

341
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,360
Whenever it might be, at some point,

342
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,300
she is the woman I want to make
my companion for life.

343
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,330
And if...

344
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,940
...by any chance,

345
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,830
you have already made arrangements
regarding my marriage...

346
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,340
It is my hope...

347
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,770
...that you would also consider
what is in my heart.

348
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,120
Your loyal subject...

349
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,950
...dares to entreat Your Majesty...

350
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,060
...and make this my first
and final request.

351
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,570
Whose family's daughter is she?

352
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,820
-Excuse me?
-Did you not understand my words?

353
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,050
I am asking you,
whose family's daughter is she?

354
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,670
She is the daughter of the Director
of the Office of Special Advisors...

355
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,470
...a maiden by the name of Heo Yeon Woo.

356
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,760
I understand.

357
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,600
I will think about it.

358
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:51,530
What is it you just said?

359
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,600
I said that I'll think about it.

360
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,160
Your benevolence is immeasurable,
Your Majesty.

361
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,670
Fool.

362
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,970
I just told you to show caution
with your visits to the palace.

363
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,270
Did I ever tell you
to stop coming completely?

364
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,100
So then...

365
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,810
What is your initial feeling
of entering the palace,

366
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,850
for the first time as a companion
to the princess?

367
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,620
I liked it.

368
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,980
That couldn't possibly be all, could it?

369
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,160
Yes, it is.

370
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,250
What is that?

371
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,310
I've been curious and nervous
about how you were doing in the palace.

372
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,930
So I have been waiting the whole day
for you to come home.

373
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,140
And to hear you say only that
is not interesting at all.

374
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,490
Ah, I saw Brother in the palace.

375
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,570
-How were you able to see me?
-It's a secret.

376
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,620
What?

377
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,250
As I'm not to speak
of the greenhouse trees,

378
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,160
please don't ask me anymore.

379
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,570
Yeom, it looks like
you could learn a lesson from her.

380
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,300
It looks that way.

381
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,050
I was worried over
having you enter the palace,

382
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,120
but it seems it was unnecessary.

383
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,840
I feel that compared
to any maiden in this world...

384
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,050
...my daughter is
the most kind-hearted and wise.

385
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,940
To me as well, Father, you are the best!

386
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,830
Listen to you two.

387
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,290
There's no room for anyone
to get between father and daughter.

388
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,670
I'm so sad, how shall I keep on living?

389
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,780
Yeom.

390
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,940
As for your mother, I feel that
compared to any scholar in the world,

391
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,730
my son is the wisest and most handsome.

392
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,910
Yes, Mother.

393
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,890
I think that my mother
is the best as well.

394
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,670
Seol.

395
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,770
It's me.

396
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,950
I am so sorry, Milady.

397
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,250
I didn't realize...

398
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,420
Where did you get that wooden sword?

399
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,030
Oh, I just made it little by little
whenever I was free.

400
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,430
But what brings you here, Milady?

401
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,730
The truth is,

402
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,500
I have something to ask you about.

403
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,610
What is it?

404
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,680
There is someone
who received a letter from someone else.

405
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,110
But she doesn't quite understand
what it means.

406
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,150
What was written in it?

407
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,850
Because of you, I was unable to sleep.

408
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,230
I'm sending someone over.

409
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,240
Let's meet then.

410
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,760
So, it's a threat letter,
saying there will be a fight soon.

411
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,580
But, did the person they sent over
find who he was looking for?

412
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,690
Ah, he did go looking,

413
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,980
but the person said it was a mistake
and avoided...

414
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,800
What a fool! He just made matters worse!

415
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,120
In a situation like that,
one needs to face it head on!

416
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,120
Do you think there will be repercussions?

417
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,400
That goes without saying!

418
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,120
Avoiding a challenge like a coward
and lying even?

419
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,880
That's the worst situation!

420
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,080
Sounds like there's going to be
some major bloodshed soon.

421
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:20,670
Do you think I'm trying to scare you?

422
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,490
Aren't you?

423
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,310
Well...

424
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,020
What do you think?

425
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,320
If I were to answer that
I don't think so...

426
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,460
...will you send someone again?

427
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,770
If I do...

428
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,650
...will you come to meet me?

429
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,050
Will you come to meet me?

430
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,700
I do want to meet you at least once.

431
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,930
Will you...

432
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,710
...send someone again?

433
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,950
Are you enjoying your time
with your companions?

434
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,910
Yes. I like this girl especially.

435
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,500
Father, it's Bo Kyung.

436
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,170
Come in.

437
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,510
You were looking for me?

438
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,830
In the palace today.

439
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,380
Did you do anything inappropriate?

440
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,000
I didn't.

441
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,990
There was absolutely nothing like that.

442
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,520
Then, why were you not able
to win the Princess' favor?

443
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,840
What are you crying for?!

444
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,690
It's because I am not Tutor Heo's sister.

445
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,950
What?

446
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,710
The Princess has an affection
for Tutor Heo.

447
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,540
And so of course his sister, Yeon Woo,
would win her favor.

448
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,810
And it's not only the Princess.

449
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,520
Someone in the royal family
named Lee Hwon,

450
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,390
sent a letter to the girl as well.

451
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,150
There is no one in the palace on my side.

452
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,070
They are all on her side.

453
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,000
So how can I win anyone's favor?

454
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,020
Just now...

455
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,720
What did you say?

456
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,160
-Excuse me?
-Did you not just say that someone...

457
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,130
...in the royal family sent her a letter?

458
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,570
I am not sure about it...

459
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,290
But since the surname was "Lee."..

460
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,880
The name of that royal family member...

461
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,110
...what was it, again?

462
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,510
Lee Hwon.

463
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,140
On the letter...

464
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,210
...it clearly said "Lee Hwon."

465
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,470
A letter, you say?

466
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,370
Our Crown Prince
is already at the age for love.

467
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,680
The Crown Prince spends
all his days in the palace.

468
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,450
How did he even know that child
to send her a letter?

469
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,910
Her brother is part
of the Sigangwon, is he not?

470
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,010
That man, Heo Young Jae,

471
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,040
our relationship with him
is ill-fated in so many ways.

472
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,530
From what I see,

473
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,740
she seems to be a very clever child.

474
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,110
There is no need to worry.

475
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,530
Even if the Crown Prince
already has her in his heart,

476
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,190
what problem could it pose?

477
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,780
Can a royal wedding happen
merely out of love?

478
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,790
I don't mention it merely
because of the Crown Prince's feelings.

479
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,880
The way that His Majesty, the King,
looked upon the child...

480
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,700
...was also special.

481
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,350
To summon both that man's son
and daughter into the palace.

482
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,600
What do you think his intentions could be?

483
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,350
To restrain the maternal side
of the family.

484
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,570
We must hasten a royal wedding.

485
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,070
Royal wedding, you say...

486
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,030
If we just wait and put our faith
in the High Shaman's words,

487
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,660
we cannot know when we will see
a new master of the Queen's quarters.

488
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,750
If the heavens have already
determined what shall be,

489
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,430
it is up to the people now to make it so.

490
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,570
Do all we can and only then,
leave the rest to the heavens.

491
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,900
That is a very good saying indeed.

492
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,150
You move the Ministers.

493
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,270
And I shall move the ranking women
of the court.

494
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,570
I shall do as you say, Your Highness.

495
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,330
Nanny, please tidy up my hair.

496
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,490
You have already spent too much time
on your appearance.

497
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,250
If you are any later, it will be awkward.

498
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,420
Don't worry.

499
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,550
My father said
that he would explain it well.

500
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,440
It's done, Milady.

501
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,920
Come and meet me here
when it's time to leave the palace.

502
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,880
Yes.

503
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,770
Let's go.

504
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,910
Father.

505
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,670
I want to live in the palace.

506
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,850
Please make it
so I can live in the palace.

507
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,620
I am here from the East Palace.

508
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,720
The Crown Prince...

509
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,760
...quietly wants to meet you.

510
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,360
For Your Highness,

511
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,660
the gallant posture of your turned back
is particularly attractive.

512
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,920
You could stand
with your back to the door...

513
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,930
...and then as you slowly turn around...

514
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,550
...if you were to break out
that deadly smile.

515
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,340
You could capture the heart of any girl.

516
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,150
I finally am able to meet you.

517
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,750
It is so.

518
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,710
You must know already,
but I am not an attendant.

519
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,400
But this nation, Joseon's Crown Prince.

520
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,000
Although I don't know the reason.

521
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,530
After that day...

522
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,430
...I could not forget your face.

523
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,230
When I heard the news that
you entered the palace as companion,

524
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:38,490
I felt I had to meet you again,
even if it was like this.

525
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,260
You are really an unfeeling girl.

526
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,540
It was so difficult to meet...

527
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,550
...and yet, you won't even let me
look upon your face.

528
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,750
Who are you?

529
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,070
Excuse me?

530
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,670
I am asking who are you
and why you came here.

531
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,130
I am the Personnel Minister
Yoon Dae Hyung's daughter...

532
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,620
...Yoon Bo Kyung.

533
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,450
You sent an East Palace attendant...

534
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,930
...so I just...

535
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,090
I am sorry.

536
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,920
Excuse me?

537
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,530
There's been a misunderstanding.

538
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,970
Your Highness.

539
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,130
What do you think?

540
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,190
The longevity bracelet that I made
is prettier, right?

541
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,000
Yes.

542
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,590
The longevity bracelet that you made
is much prettier.

543
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,530
Ask me who I am going to give this to.

544
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,530
Who are you going to give it to?

545
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,840
Tutor Heo.

546
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,150
Excuse me?

547
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,870
And, to whom are you going to give
the one you made?

548
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,880
I, too, was making it for my brother.

549
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,740
You can't!

550
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,440
I will give mine to your brother.

551
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,720
You can give yours to my brother.

552
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,370
Then wouldn't that be fair?

553
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,570
The Cr...

554
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,630
The Crown Prince?

555
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,290
How could I dare?

556
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,360
I'll deliver it, so give it to me.

557
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,180
I'm going to make it again.

558
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,990
This one is really too poorly made.

559
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,530
If you wish.

560
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,280
Hello.

561
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,240
Try wearing it.

562
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,910
When I heard that you had entered
the palace as a companion...

563
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,660
...I felt I had to meet you again...

564
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,120
...even if it was like this.

565
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,780
What? The Crown Prince and the
Personnel Minister's daughter?

566
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,110
Are you sure that it was her?

567
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,450
And not Director Heo's daughter?

568
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,880
I saw them coming out
of the Hidden Moon Pavilion.

569
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,180
Really?

570
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,640
It doesn't look like
they had just a common relationship.

571
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,910
Could it be that they knew each
other before she entered the palace?

572
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,450
If she's Minister Yoon's daughter,

573
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,960
then she's a relative of the Queen Mother.

574
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,110
The Queen Mother may have made
a liaison between the two.

575
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,810
What did you say just now?

576
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,130
You had better truthfully tell me
everything you know.

577
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,410
Do you call that an excuse?!

578
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,970
I really feel this is unfair.

579
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,230
When I asked her, she clearly stated
with her own mouth,

580
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,520
that she wasn't Tutor Heo's sister.

581
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,330
Why would that child
be telling such a lie?

582
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,870
If you have to ask me such a question,

583
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,810
you put me in a difficult position.

584
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,470
There is no reason for that girl
to be avoiding me.

585
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,470
If you insist on asking, then...

586
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,760
What's that thing?

587
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,360
I drew a picture of the thoughts
in Miss Yeon Woo's head.

588
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,310
-The thoughts in her head?
-Yes.

589
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,800
First, Miss Yeon Woo's brother,
namely Tutor Heo.

590
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,140
He occupies at least 70 percent
of her thoughts.

591
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,640
-As much as 70 percent.
-Yes.

592
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,210
Miss Yeon Woo has grown up
under the same roof

593
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,960
with a genius like Tutor Heo,
a man with unsurpassed beauty.

594
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,620
Therefore, an average boy
will not garner any attention.

595
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,750
Furthermore, the classmates
who studied with Tutor Heo,

596
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,270
Prince Yang Myung and Kim Jae Woon,

597
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,200
have significant appeal themselves.

598
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,660
The magnanimous and delightfully charming
Prince Yang Myung takes up 20 percent.

599
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,750
Cold palace man Kim Jae Woon
takes up 10 percent.

600
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,080
Cold palace man?

601
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,070
It's the shortening "the stone cold man
from within the palace."

602
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,520
This is the nickname given to him
by the court ladies.

603
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,680
But then...

604
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,940
...what's that small dot
that's over there?

605
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,790
This is you, Your Highness.

606
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,450
What are you saying?!
That my existence to Miss Yeon Woo

607
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,450
is as tiny as that eye crust sized dot?!

608
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,500
There is a reason for that as well.

609
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,550
From a geographical standpoint,

610
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,900
you have been
separated by a very long distance.

611
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,280
Then, she mistook you for a thief
when you first met.

612
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,770
And you yourself told her
you were an attendant.

613
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,750
And so, the lady's
first impression of you

614
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,560
is that of a thief and an attendant,
an attendant and a thief,

615
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,640
nothing less, nothing more.

616
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,780
Shut up! Shut up! Keep that mouth shut!

617
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:45,940
I can't stand looking at you.

618
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,670
So, stand with your face turned
for the time being.

619
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,930
Your Highness, it's the Chief Eunuch.

620
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,980
Come in.

621
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,970
Your Highness.

622
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,910
His Majesty has requested your presence.

623
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,930
His Majesty?

624
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,700
What are you guards doing
in the East Palace?

625
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,170
We are under royal orders.

626
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,760
Your Highness! Your Highness!

627
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,940
Your Highness!

628
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,670
Your Highness! Your Highness!

629
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,150
Your Highness! Your Highness!

630
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,900
Are the rumours true?

631
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,110
Is it true that you met
Minister Yoon's daughter privately?

632
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,760
It is true that we met...

633
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,140
...but it was a mistake.

634
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,140
No, a misunderstanding...

635
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,590
Are you trying to make excuses?!

636
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,790
I know well that
there is no leeway for excuses.

637
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,910
But please let me clear up
one misunderstanding.

638
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,510
What misunderstanding would that be?

639
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,700
Please forgive me...

640
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,300
...but there is already a girl
I have in my heart.

641
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,330
What?

642
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,720
When I heard that she entered the palace
as a companion to the Princess,

643
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,520
it is true that I wanted to meet
with her in secret.

644
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,490
But it is not Minister Yoon's daughter.

645
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,860
The girl that is in my heart...

646
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,520
...is the daughter of the Director
of the Office of Special Advisors.

647
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,380
There is a girl I have in my heart.

648
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,250
She is the daughter of the Director
of the Office of Special Advisors...

649
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,280
...a maiden by the name of Heo Yeon Woo.

650
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,590
Although I cannot explain
the situation in detail,

651
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,440
my heart is already with...

652
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,440
I shall pretend I didn't just hear that.

653
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,060
But, Your Majesty!

654
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,470
Have you forgotten that you are
this nation's Crown Prince?!

655
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,940
Because of your reckless behaviour,

656
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,200
that child could become a sacrifice
in a political war.

657
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,250
How could that thought not occur to you?!

658
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,440
I will let it slide quietly this time.

659
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,930
Please don't disappoint me a second time.

660
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,210
Do you understand?

661
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,140
I'll bear it in mind.

662
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,550
The Ceremonial Committee
will be set up shortly.

663
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,780
Know this and leave now.

664
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,440
Bo Kyung.

665
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,750
Will it be all right for you
to ride in the palanquin?

666
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,020
I heard you had suffered severely
due to motion sickness.

667
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,150
What does that have to do with you...

668
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,550
Ah, that...

669
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,400
Thank you for your concern...

670
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:06,030
...but actually, I wasn't late because
I had motion sickness.

671
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,070
Then why?

672
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,400
This is a secret.

673
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,810
At the Hidden Moon Pavilion earlier...

674
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,020
...I met with the Crown Prince.

675
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,580
He says that he has been watching me
from afar.

676
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,750
That he had to meet me at least once
even if it was like that.

677
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:39,160
You have to keep this secret.

678
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,390
Recently, the Queen Mother
has given earnest orders

679
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,570
to welcome a Crown Princess
for the Crown Prince.

680
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,930
The Crown Prince is already
fifteen years old this year.

681
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,330
So, naturally, we plan to hold
a Crown Princess selection.

682
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,370
Please voice your opinion.

683
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,890
I feel that what Your Majesty said
makes for a reasonable argument.

684
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,200
That is what this subject thinks as well.

685
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,330
We should hasten a royal wedding
and ensure an heir to the throne.

686
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,780
Rites Minister, please listen.

687
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,110
From Hanyang to the rural districts,

688
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,910
all unmarried maidens
from the age of twelve to sixteen

689
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,640
are to be prohibited from marrying
and will be added to the maiden roster.

690
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,700
I shall carry out as instructed.

691
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,180
And also, we will be having
a Narye ceremony this evening,

692
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,530
so Officers and Ministers, please attend
and enjoy yourselves.

693
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

694
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:43,800
Your Highness.

695
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,190
The banquet is starting soon.

696
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,970
You must hurry and get dressed.

697
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,990
-Hyung Sun.
-Yes, Your Highness.

698
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,450
What kind of flower is this?

699
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,280
I will take a moment to look.

700
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,570
This is not a flower.

701
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,390
It's lettuce.

702
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,250
Lettuce?

703
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,330
Yes.

704
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,180
Lettuce.

705
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,800
Why did she give me lettuce?

706
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,370
Now...

707
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,670
...I will never be able
to hear that answer.

708
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,610
Throw it away.

709
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:46,750
What?

710
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,880
Because of your reckless behaviour,

711
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,160
that child could become
a sacrifice in a political war.

712
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,990
How could that thought not occur to you?!

713
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:33,420
Shortly, we will be going to the palace
for the ceremony.

714
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,370
Although we have the approval
of the Queen Mother,

715
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:40,080
we still need to move cautiously
so as not to attract attention.

716
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,410
Yes, High Shaman.

717
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,130
But whose spirit are we comforting
in this ritual tonight?

718
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,700
It's for the mother of Prince Ui Seong.

719
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,750
Ever since a few years ago,

720
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,970
people say they hear a phantom crying
in the room she used to sleep in.

721
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,210
And so, every lunar new year's eve,

722
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,830
by order of the Queen Mother,
we perform a comforting ritual.

723
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:00,960
Please run away.

724
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,600
This is not a destiny you can handle.

725
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,090
Do not make the ties any stronger.

726
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,880
Right now is your only chance
to avoid it.

727
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,320
Do not make the ties any stronger.

728
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,980
Right now is your only chance
to avoid it.

729
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,620
While you can avoid it,
as much as you can avoid it,

730
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,540
you must run away.

731
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:34,980
Do you...

732
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,950
...recognize me?

733
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,380
Please say who it is...

734
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,080
...that I am.

735
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,530
This nation, Joseon's...

736
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,590
...Crown Prince...

737
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,850
...Lee Hwon.

738
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,320
Did you tell me to forget you?

739
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,000
Did you want me to forget you?

740
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,310
I'm sorry.

741
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,360
Although I tried to forget...

742
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,110
...I could not forget you.

743
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:01,290
What do you mean I cannot be
with the maiden Yeon Woo?

744
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,470
What sort of outrageous nonsense is that?

745
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:06,010
It is the selection
of this country's future Queen.

746
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,990
Please allow the selection process
to be just and legitimate.

747
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,150
Please override Queen Mother's action.

748
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:13,880
Do you share the Crown Prince's feelings?

749
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,440
Are you going somewhere?

750
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,850
Will you come with me?

751
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,310
That child, Heo Yeon Woo.

752
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,590
Kill her!
