1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,340
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,160
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,180
Episode 8

4
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,450
Whose memories are these?

5
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,750
Whose memories are these?

6
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,970
Swelling, go down. Go down. Go down.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,710
Go down. Please go down.

8
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,460
I've been longing so much
that I'm hallucinating now.

9
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,440
Do I look like a hallucination?

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,740
Why do you keep avoiding my eyes?

11
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,810
My face is ugly.

12
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,240
It's not ugly.

13
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,490
Liar. Did you not laugh just now?

14
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,380
I laughed because you are lovely.

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,000
Am I really lovely?

16
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,890
Have you known me to lie?

17
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,420
Then, you will not abandon me?

18
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,150
How could you say such a thing?

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,930
Promise me.

20
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,030
That no matter what happens,
you will not abandon me.

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,870
If I offered up my life,
would you believe me then?

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,480
Princess.

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,980
The innkeeper made pancakes.

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,910
I stepped away
for just a moment to taste.

25
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,300
-She must have gone to look for Seol.
-What about me?

26
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,550
Where have you been running about
instead of protecting the child?!

27
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,000
Didn't I tell you repeatedly
not to step foot in the Northern Village?!

28
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,090
What's the matter?

29
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,740
Has something happened to Milady?

30
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,090
Let's have a word.

31
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,180
They said to give this to you.

32
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,500
As you refuse to return,

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,070
I will take your young successor instead.

34
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,290
If you wish to find her,

35
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,790
you will need to return to the palace.

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,000
What's the matter? What is it?!

37
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,990
Gather our things.
We have to go to the capital.

38
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,110
Move again?

39
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,320
What about Milady?

40
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,910
Stop your complaints
and gather our things! Quickly!

41
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,630
This is big trouble, my Lord.

42
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,970
I think she's dead.

43
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,280
She's alive.

44
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,020
Quickly fetch some water. Quickly!

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,070
Yes.

46
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,260
Are you all right?!
Your nose, it's bleeding.

47
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,060
Go catch the girl first!

48
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,420
Go, get her!

49
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,840
Catch her!

50
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,000
Quickly, go and catch her!

51
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,380
-Are you all right?
-Does it hurt that bad?

52
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,950
Stop right there!

53
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,030
Stop! Stop there!

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,620
-Stop!
-Stop right there!

55
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,760
-Stop there!
-Stop right there!

56
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,180
Stop there!

57
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,660
Prince Yang Myung!

58
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,110
-Aigoo, what...
-Prince Yang Myung!

59
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,180
Prince Yang Myung!

60
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,380
They are relentless.

61
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,210
My Lord!

62
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,690
My Lord!

63
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,390
Prince Yang Myung! My Lord!

64
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,570
Just give us a few moments of your time!

65
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,760
We're not bad people.

66
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,100
Aigoo, where is he?

67
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,780
What are you doing?
Why aren't you looking for him?

68
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,390
He is just too fast.

69
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,420
Prince Yang Myung.

70
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,420
-Prince Yang Myung!
-Wait, how did they know?

71
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,320
It's Prince Yang Myung!

72
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,630
-My Lord!
-My Lord!

73
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,090
There she is! Stop!

74
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,620
Stay right there!

75
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,730
Monk.

76
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,220
I'm being chased. Please help me.

77
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,830
-Monk!
-Stop right there!

78
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,050
You stay right there!

79
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,800
Stay there! Catch her!

80
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,260
Catch her!

81
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,710
Catch her!

82
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,630
What kind of rude behavior is this?

83
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,940
Do you really...

84
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,180
...not know who I am?

85
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,320
Are you serious?

86
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,270
You truly don't?

87
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,790
What a nice picture!

88
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,570
A shaman and a wayward monk
in each others' arms in broad daylight!

89
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,100
What are you doing?

90
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,990
Move out of the way.

91
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,070
If anyone lays a finger on this woman,
he shall pay with his life.

92
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,880
Is that so? Who do you think you are
to flap your mouth like that?!

93
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,630
Don't you know that shamans and monks
are prohibited from entering the capital?

94
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,410
Are you really a shaman?

95
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,870
Yes, I am.

96
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,140
Do you really not know me?

97
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,080
Forgive me,
but I've never seen you before.

98
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,980
If you take the back door
and follow the street,

99
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,220
you will see a greenhouse.

100
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,550
Will you wait for me there
for just a short while?

101
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,330
Will you wait for me?

102
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,660
I will.

103
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,350
Stop!

104
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,990
It sounds like the professors have caught
the shaman wench, so let's go.

105
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,300
Let's go.

106
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,030
What? She refuses to return?

107
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,270
That is so.

108
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,070
And you are certain you told her
I called for her?

109
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,260
Could there be any doubt?

110
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,570
It appears the dog I raised
just bit my hand.

111
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,680
Then, are you saying
you came back empty-handed?

112
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,310
We could not change her mind,

113
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,120
but we brought
her young successor in her stead.

114
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,030
How could that child take her place?!

115
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,890
If we have her,
then Shaman Jang will make a move.

116
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,490
So then...

117
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,150
Are you saying she's a hostage?

118
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,530
Not just a hostage.

119
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,160
What do you mean by that?

120
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:48,200
Forgive me, but have you heard
of a human talisman?

121
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,740
Human talisman?

122
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,270
Yes, Your Highness.

123
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,960
A human becomes a talisman herself

124
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,000
and receives the misfortunes
and evil spirits of another into her body.

125
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,850
From what I understand,
there is no stronger talisman.

126
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,990
If we put her in the King's bedchamber
as a receptacle of misfortune...

127
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,280
But how could you bring that lowly shaman
into the King's quarters?

128
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,780
Moreover, the King will never approve.

129
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,950
It would all happen in secret
while he is asleep.

130
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,100
And the girl's divine powers?

131
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
Are they reliable?

132
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,290
Her physiognomy reflects
fruitful consummation of the marital bed.

133
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,450
It is one month.

134
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,140
Excuse me?

135
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,060
One month until the next auspicious date
for the King and Queen's marital bed.

136
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,870
If that child could recover
the King's health by that date...

137
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,830
Then the marital bed will bear fruit.

138
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,210
A human talisman, you say?

139
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,460
So you are Nok Young's young successor?

140
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,270
Who are you?

141
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,890
Then, I suppose you know
what your duty is tonight.

142
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,680
I was dragged here with no explanation.
How would I know?

143
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,710
True, what use would it be
for a wench like you to know?

144
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,110
You just do as you're told.

145
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,210
Are you outside?

146
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,350
Yes, Mistress.

147
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Drag her away and get her prepared.

148
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,250
Yes.

149
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,420
Let go!

150
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,190
Please bring my shaman mother.

151
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,740
Without her permission, I won't...

152
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,430
You impudent little wench!

153
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,460
Who do you think you are,
a nobleman's young maiden?

154
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,470
Let me tell you something very clearly.

155
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,300
If you say one word there,
or move even one finger...

156
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,620
...there will be a knife
lodged in your neck.

157
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,730
She disappeared without a trace?

158
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,060
That is so.

159
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,970
So, it's certain then.
She was a spirit after all.

160
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,370
If she were one, her soul
would have harbored much resentment.

161
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,910
I was willing to listen to her grievances
and help resolve them.

162
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,050
But she did not give me a chance
to be a good and wise King.

163
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,490
I will search again.

164
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,320
No. Let it be.

165
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,230
It was probably a single night's
dream and illusion.

166
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,960
It's probably for the best this way.

167
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,740
As there is no likelihood
of meeting her again...

168
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,220
...neither will there be any cause
to be bewitched by delusions.

169
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,510
Your Majesty.
The court physician is here.

170
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,890
Have him enter.

171
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,410
What type of tea is this?

172
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,610
It is chrysanthemum tea
from the Royal Clinic.

173
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,770
It contains jujube and thuja seeds,
which aids sleep.

174
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,320
Why are you going so far
as to use drugs to put me to sleep?

175
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,280
It's a directive from the Office
of Astronomy, so I wouldn't know.

176
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,340
The Royal Clinic's responsibility
was merely to ensure you sleep soundly.

177
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,220
You have had trouble sleeping.

178
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,370
So there's really no reason to refuse.

179
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,570
A tea that brings a deep sleep, you say.

180
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,950
I am just a lowly shaman.

181
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,350
Our paths
could not possibly have crossed.

182
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,360
Then, I suppose I won't be troubled
by senseless dreams either.

183
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,420
When you hear the summoning of the gong,

184
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,670
you will bring in the talisman
from the Office of Astronomy.

185
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,410
Who wears a veiling cloak
inside the palace?

186
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,860
It is not a person, but merely a talisman.
Please let her through.

187
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,330
If the energy gets dispersed,

188
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,560
the effect of the talisman
could disappear.

189
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
Yeon Woo.

190
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,570
Yeon Woo.

191
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,370
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo.

192
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,060
Your Highness.

193
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,890
I love you, Crown Princess.

194
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,200
Oh my. I'm so embarrassed.

195
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,940
I love you too, Your Highness.

196
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,080
My Lord. Prince Yang Myung.

197
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,410
My Lord.

198
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,770
Are you feeling more clearheaded?

199
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,750
You collapsed at the door
and an attendant brought you in.

200
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,060
Do you remember?

201
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,330
My Lord.

202
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,210
Prince Yang Myung!

203
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,300
My Lord!

204
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,060
My Lord!

205
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,270
Did someone come to my side
in the middle of the night?

206
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,240
Professor Na from the Office of Astronomy
came with a talisman.

207
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,730
Did you sleep comfortably?

208
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,170
A talisman, you say.

209
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,000
How strange.

210
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,480
I've always hated
the thought of talismans.

211
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,390
But I feel so much lighter.

212
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Are you the royal kitchen maids?

213
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,010
We are, Your Majesty.

214
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,560
The stew you prepared this morning
was delicious.

215
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,480
I enjoyed it.

216
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,580
He's always been so cold.

217
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,460
What happened this morning?

218
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,640
-Let's serve stew again tomorrow.
-Yes.

219
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,230
If I could just see that smile again,
I'm going to prepare only stew every day.

220
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,940
While I lay on my sickbed,
I read the documents you organized.

221
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,420
You must have been pressed for time.

222
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,510
And yet it was organized impeccably.

223
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,450
How incredible that
not one calculation error could be found.

224
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,180
Somebody might have mistaken it
for a fabrication.

225
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,310
That was a joke.

226
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,270
In the event that a head of household
is enslaved and his family faces hardship.

227
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,280
I told you to exempt him
and send him home. How is that going?

228
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:57,020
In cooperation, we examined the roster
and sent those men back to their trades.

229
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,090
And, the fellow Pi Han Dol
whom I asked you to find?

230
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,850
He is waiting to present himself.

231
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,590
Oh, really?

232
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,030
And here I thought our Finance Minister
was only good at Gyeokgu.

233
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,700
But your actions are swift.

234
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,800
Bring in Pi Han Dol.

235
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,340
Are you Pi Han Dol?

236
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,430
I am, Your Majesty.

237
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,890
You must have suffered much.

238
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,850
Wasn't the labor difficult?

239
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:39,760
No. The labor was rather easy
in comparison to other work.

240
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,670
That's a relief.

241
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,170
What job did you do
in the restoration of Boyong Pavilion?

242
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,360
Excuse me?

243
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,970
I worked on the demolition
of the existing bridge.

244
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,350
Oh. Really?

245
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,090
Then,

246
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,500
you'll have seen the lotus flower pattern
engraved on the stone railing.

247
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,170
The lotus flower... ah, I remember.

248
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,280
What did you think of it?
Isn't it quite lovely?

249
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,700
Yes, it was truly beautiful.

250
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,310
Right. It is truly a beautiful pattern.

251
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,020
I looked for you because
of your son's earnest entreaty.

252
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,540
Excuse me?

253
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,880
Are you speaking of my son?

254
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,180
Yes.

255
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,150
Taking care of his sister in place
of his parents, his heart was admirable.

256
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,100
He was putting in such an effort
to protect his family at such a young age.

257
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,220
And, what have I done for the people
as King? I reflected deeply.

258
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,960
I am in awe of your grace.

259
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,410
You will receive a gift of a small field.

260
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,810
So return to your hometown
and live comfortably with your family.

261
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,480
Your Majesty. Your grace is immeasurable!

262
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,300
This is your payment
for answering well as directed.

263
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,460
Use it for your travel money.

264
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,110
If, by any chance, you open your mouth
and say the wrong thing.

265
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,180
We will start by taking
your children's lives.

266
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,310
So, keep that in mind!

267
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,790
Yes, sir.

268
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,200
Why are you doing this?!

269
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,640
So, did you enable
Pi Han Dol's safe departure?

270
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,680
Yes. I made certain all the family
is moved to a safe location.

271
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,260
Good work.

272
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,250
How did you know?

273
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,580
Know what?

274
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,200
How did you know to send me?

275
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,130
The man's hands.

276
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,220
The callouses on the man's hands
were not from labor.

277
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,640
Those are commonly seen on those
who handle swords for the first time.

278
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,540
Therefore, I threw out some bait.

279
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,760
And he naively bit it without hesitation.

280
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,920
What did you use as bait?

281
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,240
A lotus pattern.

282
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,730
On the stone rail
of the Boyong Pavilion bridge,

283
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,920
there is no lotus pattern.

284
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,070
And so...

285
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,460
What did you catch with the bait?

286
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,100
Suspicion.

287
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,680
Did you say suspicion?

288
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,770
That's right. Suspicion.

289
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,080
Why did he say that a pattern is beautiful
when it doesn't even exist?

290
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,880
Why did they send assassins
to attack a naive man?

291
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:59,790
What were they trying to hide
with his death?

292
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,370
Did you get an answer?

293
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,990
Could I possibly have gotten an answer?

294
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,640
Relying on slave labor,
they select young, able men.

295
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,810
And after securing funds
for a false construction project,

296
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,740
in an unnamed place that isn't Boyong,
they secretly train an army.

297
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,840
What do you think?

298
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,400
In my opinion, I think it's an explanation
that fits quite well.

299
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,530
If that's true, then it is treason.

300
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,550
That is so, isn't it?

301
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,990
And my life, too,
hangs on any given moment.

302
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,210
Your Majesty.

303
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,990
Do not worry.

304
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,460
As it is not time yet.

305
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,300
Until they get what they want...

306
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,320
...I am still alive.

307
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,750
Due to the king being ill, we were able
to put out the most urgent fires.

308
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,460
But we cannot know when our necks
will be strangled yet again.

309
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,590
It is urgent that we prepare
for what happens to us after he dies.

310
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,760
We have invested in him for years,
but it hasn't resulted in anything.

311
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,110
If we don't use some other method...

312
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,670
There are many methods.

313
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,910
We can place talismans
in the King's quarters for conception

314
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,190
and we have the Queen work
on her bed chamber skills.

315
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,780
Why are you all giving me a hard time?!

316
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,270
We need to do something
to enable the birth of a Prince!

317
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,750
We'll have to allow him
to rest comfortably.

318
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,790
Hasn't His Majesty
been overworking himself with his duties?

319
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,240
Therefore, if he were
to suddenly become ill and collapse...

320
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,680
...it would be no great
surprise, would it?

321
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,880
That's right.

322
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:01,250
However, that is in the future,
after a Crown Prince has been conceived.

323
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,320
That Pi Han Dol, did you handle him?

324
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,650
Of course.

325
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,630
What happened?!

326
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,460
-An attack...
-Who exactly attacked you?!

327
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,850
His face was veiled
so I could not see him.

328
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,240
But he had swordsmanship
never seen before.

329
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,060
Never seen before...

330
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,820
Was that Woon?

331
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,450
Were his skills that exceptional?

332
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,890
Was that a warning, Your Majesty?

333
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,400
Really?

334
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,910
He has recovered to the point that
there's chatter about it in his palace?

335
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,030
That is so. He ate some of everything
in his morning meal.

336
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,550
And there was less left over than ever.

337
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,950
The human talisman
is truly having an effect!

338
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,780
It is certainly so, Your Majesty.

339
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,380
In one night, it has spread news
of the King's health.

340
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,740
What a miraculous child.

341
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,590
I shall have a look at her face directly
and give her praise.

342
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Yeon Woo.

343
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,050
Misty rain.

344
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,570
Or does it mean a gentle rain?

345
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,510
Yeon Woo.

346
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,340
What sort of person is she?

347
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,930
The one for whom
he has such deep devotion.

348
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,780
Maybe if I had been her...

349
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,760
If I weren't a shaman...

350
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,380
...but rather the person named Yeon Woo.

351
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,610
Would his heart have found comfort?

352
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,430
Your Highness.

353
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,850
Have you seen such willful impudence?!

354
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,890
How dare you block my path?

355
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,690
Will you not clear the way immediately?

356
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,320
It is a body
that has just taken in misfortune.

357
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,350
How can you think of seeing her directly?

358
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,250
What are you all doing?!

359
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,520
Take this woman immediately and...

360
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,250
Queen Dowager!

361
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,520
I was just on my way to call on you,

362
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,620
but how is it you've come
all the way here directly?

363
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,630
I see it was very difficult
for you to come here.

364
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,470
When you were summoned repeatedly,
you consistently declined.

365
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,690
So, why have you come on your own accord?

366
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,660
That's a misunderstanding, Your Highness.

367
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,490
How could I betray your favor
and refuse your call?

368
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:37,160
With all the wandering I'd done,
a dirty spirit clung to me,

369
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,760
and I could not bring myself
to stand before you with it, that is all.

370
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,720
I merely requested to cleanse myself
of the spirit before returning.

371
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,460
But the Office of Astronomy professors
have distorted my response.

372
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,550
Please understand.

373
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,520
You do speak eloquently.

374
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,760
I assume you've come because you're afraid
we'll take away your successor.

375
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,680
Before she is my successor apprentice...

376
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,560
...that child is a shaman you placed
on the Seongsucheong registry.

377
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,380
Even if she were taken away,
what could I have to say?

378
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,200
Then, why did you hide all these years?

379
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,000
If you have a mouth, speak.

380
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,120
Eight years ago,

381
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,170
because I practiced black art,
my divine powers were damaged.

382
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,030
And I was afraid Your Highness
might face trouble over the incident.

383
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,050
So, I wandered the earth
and waited for the right time.

384
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,050
You waited for the right time.

385
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,360
Then, are you saying
that now is that time?

386
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,960
It is.

387
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,770
And fate will be smiling at Your Highness.

388
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,020
So, will I be able to see a Prince?

389
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,970
Could there be any doubt?

390
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,630
The present Queen will never
bear a prince from her body.

391
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,670
Then, have you returned
to the Seongsucheong for good?

392
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,400
If your Highness would only take me in,

393
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,730
I will bury my bones at the Seongsucheong.

394
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,100
However...

395
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,610
However?

396
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,980
Is there really a need
for two captains on one boat?

397
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,370
One of them has only ears to eavesdrop
out of concern for her own welfare,

398
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,630
and no true loyalty to the royal family,

399
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,800
so I strongly advise you to oust her.

400
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,710
I see you still have quite the nerve.

401
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,580
Did you hear?!

402
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,710
The mistress of Seongsucheong
has returned, so vacate the residence.

403
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,230
Is that satisfactory?

404
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,530
Your grace is unbounded.

405
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,800
Now then. Bring your successor.

406
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,760
Why do you want me to bring that child?

407
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,540
Ever since we brought her in
as a human talisman,

408
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,210
the King's health has improved remarkably.

409
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,580
I want to praise her service,
so bring her to me.

410
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,230
That cannot happen.

411
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,880
What do you mean that cannot happen?

412
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,320
She is a human talisman whose entire body
has taken in misfortune all night.

413
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,820
If you are in her presence
before the cleansing is complete,

414
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,300
that misfortune could stick
to Your Highness.

415
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,470
Also, if a talisman moves about rashly,
something may go wrong.

416
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,210
Until the spirit is revived in the King's
body and the marital bed is fruitful,

417
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,030
shouldn't we be cautious?

418
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,380
I pray you be careful,

419
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,400
and until that child has completed
the duty she has undertaken,

420
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,220
you do not have her in your presence.

421
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,540
Are you really not hurt anywhere?

422
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,990
Seol. You're making me dizzy.

423
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,310
Didn't I tell you
not to go outside so recklessly?

424
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,200
Milady, are you seven years old?

425
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,240
Why do you not listen? Really!

426
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,850
Please just note that this happened
while I was looking for you.

427
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,220
I'm sorry. It is all my fault.

428
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,440
What's the matter? It was a joke, a joke.

429
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,660
I'm sorry.

430
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,520
I shouldn't have eaten that pancake.

431
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,400
Jan Shil, I'm all right.

432
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,310
Seol and Jan Shil.

433
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,010
Yeah, we'll go out. Go ahead and talk.

434
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,020
Goodness. So, she was
the High Shaman's spirit daughter?

435
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,140
No wonder, she held herself
so high and pompous.

436
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,960
But, still, she must have
impressive divine powers.

437
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,980
The Queen Dowager even came to visit.

438
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:14,340
Is that because of divine powers
or patronage, who knows?

439
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,340
She really irritates me. A clumsy newcomer
and yet already entering the palace.

440
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,070
You wench!

441
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,090
You wenches are committing crimes
with those beaks of yours.

442
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,250
Do you know who that person
that you recklessly speak ill of is?

443
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,840
That person is none other than the Moon.

444
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,110
The lady's name is Wol,
the character for Moon.

445
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,260
She doesn't know
her characters very well yet.

446
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,290
Anyhow, please treat our lady well.

447
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,250
Why are you doing this, Mistress?

448
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,780
You must leave this place immediately.

449
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,890
Excuse me?

450
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,710
Do you not know that
disobeying a royal decree is treason?

451
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,670
I will make excuses as best I can.

452
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,490
You must take Seol and leave immediately.

453
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,980
I cannot do that.

454
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,450
I cannot turn all of you into criminals.

455
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,150
Then, are you saying
you will continue with that task?!

456
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,820
It's only one month.

457
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,530
I just need to watch over his sleep
for one month.

458
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,180
It is not like you
to make problems even bigger.

459
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,560
I'm all right.

460
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,570
It's not a bad thing.

461
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,410
If my presence can help his recovery...

462
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,120
...I want to ease his pain, even a little.

463
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,890
I see you've completely disregarded
what I've said.

464
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,660
Excuse me?

465
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,190
Did I not tell you to avoid him?

466
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,930
Did I not tell you not to bring him
into your heart or form any attachment?

467
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,320
Mistress.

468
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,740
A shaman receptacle of misfortune
is not a person,

469
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,190
but merely a talisman.

470
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,200
Even if you have eyes,
you cannot see anything.

471
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,430
Even if you have a mouth,
you cannot say anything.

472
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,890
You only enter after he has fallen asleep,

473
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,310
and you must vanish without a trace
before he awakens.

474
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,370
Even though you sit the closest to him,

475
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,160
you can never and may never meet him.

476
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,030
That is a human talisman.

477
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,950
And you still want to do it?

478
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,100
Speak. Are you still going to do it?

479
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,270
A shaman...

480
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,300
...is someone who comforts the hearts
of those who have been hurt, is she not?

481
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,030
Does it matter whether
the person is lowly or noble?

482
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,390
Even though I have eyes, I will not see.

483
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,120
Even though I have a mouth,
I will not open it.

484
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:24,790
And I will never let my existence
be exposed.

485
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,500
I know well what it is
you are worried about.

486
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,780
But, he is as high as a man can be...

487
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,190
...and I am merely a human talisman.

488
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,380
What you are worried about
will never happen.

489
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,300
Mother. Mother.

490
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,040
Yes, Princess.

491
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,940
What are you thinking about so deeply?

492
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,540
It's nothing.

493
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,560
But, what is it?

494
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,140
Mother. Please look at this.

495
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,680
What sort of insect are they?

496
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,480
They're not insects.

497
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,570
They're cranes.

498
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,800
They are cranes?

499
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,380
I embroidered a couple of cranes,
but then...

500
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,630
...they became a couple of quails.

501
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,130
I suppose this wouldn't do, right?

502
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:46,290
I wanted to personally embroider it
on Husband's uniform...

503
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,860
No, I was just joking.

504
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,620
They do look like cranes.

505
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,300
It's just that...

506
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,610
What?

507
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:06,330
You could stretch the legs longer.

508
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,270
Spread out the wings
and increase their spirit,

509
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,680
so they will become more gallant cranes.

510
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,510
If I do that, will they really become
impressive cranes suitable for my husband?

511
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,620
Of course.

512
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:21,320
If you find it too difficult,
shall I do it for you?

513
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,180
No. It's a present for my husband,

514
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,080
so I will do it all myself.

515
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,380
So, if you run into a difficult part,
please ask.

516
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,750
I will help you any time.

517
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,880
Yes, Mother.

518
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,850
What are you doing here?

519
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,680
Husband.

520
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,670
Did I startle you?

521
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,500
No, Husband. I wasn't startled.

522
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,200
But, what brings you to this room?

523
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,910
Ah, Brother!

524
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,940
You are unbelievable.

525
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,450
What's the matter?

526
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,060
Did I do something wrong?

527
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,090
Why do you always ask
"What brings you here?"

528
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,900
"I missed you."

529
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,790
Couldn't you just say something like that?

530
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,170
I'm sorry. I was shortsighted.

531
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,680
If you're really sorry...

532
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,960
...then...

533
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,960
...hold me.

534
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,920
Excuse me?

535
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:49,100
Tonight, could you come
to the women's quarters?

536
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:53,300
But, Prince Yang Myung is here.

537
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,100
Brother isn't here right now,
so what does that matter...

538
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,760
Take no notice of me and continue.

539
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:12,130
I didn't see anything.

540
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,040
Brother, I really...

541
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,130
...hate you.

542
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,230
But, where have you been?

543
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,560
Why don't you lie down longer?

544
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,680
This interferer will leave now.

545
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,850
And lying down takes up space
in the master's study...

546
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,330
I don't think I can do it any longer
and withstand Princess Min Hwa's glares.

547
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,940
But you're not even completely healed yet.

548
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,370
I've troubled you enough.

549
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,300
I will be going now...

550
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,320
...so continue as you were.

551
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,740
Oh, my Lord.

552
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,100
Don't go, Brother.

553
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,320
Why not?

554
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,100
If I'm here, you can use it as an excuse
to keep visiting the master's study?

555
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,020
Where are you intending to go
in your body's current state?

556
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,260
And if you go,
how worried Husband would be.

557
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:03,470
Leave when your wounds have all healed.

558
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,830
While you're here,
I won't come to the master's study.

559
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,190
I'm a patient.

560
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,410
Handle it gently. Gently.

561
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,790
Your Majesty. The gong will strike soon.

562
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,510
Please drink the tea from the Royal Clinic
before it goes cold.

563
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,270
This is my own regimen for health,
so don't concern yourselves.

564
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,840
You could hurt yourself.

565
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,240
I am healthier than I've ever been.

566
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:40,070
I am so healthy it's strange.

567
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,790
They say that too much is as bad as
too little. It's been half an hour.

568
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,860
The spirit that's finally returned
to your body could dissipate...

569
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,840
You really talk too much.

570
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,320
My blood is hot, and my internal organs
are carrying out a rebellion!

571
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,240
-So I have to exercise like this!
-His blood is hot?

572
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,550
I must become healthier than anyone,
at any point in time.

573
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,560
Only then can I carry out my intent.

574
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,810
Intent...

575
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,140
Could it be?

576
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,760
Conceiving a Prince?

577
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,350
Why are you all looking at me like that?

578
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,730
You will carry it out.

579
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,360
You will absolutely carry out your intent.

580
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,710
A prince that looks just like you
and the Queen will certainly...

581
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,260
What are you saying right now?!!

582
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:45,830
Hyung Sun, why can you not read
the deeper meaning in my heart?

583
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,210
That thinking is so cheap.

584
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,910
This is why I don't talk to you
very often these days!

585
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,440
I don't even want to see your face
so turn around!

586
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,890
Are you crying?!
Are you seriously crying right now?

587
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,040
Are you making a fuss
over such a little remark?

588
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,170
It's not that.

589
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:23,630
For a moment, it felt as if I were
seeing you before you became King.

590
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:32,170
I pray that you continue to be as healthy
as you are right now, Your Majesty.

591
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,770
Really. You have many ways
of making me hear you talk.

592
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,600
Hyung Sun. I will get ready to sleep now,
as you wish.

593
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:46,820
So stop.

594
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,160
Why is the chrysanthemum tea so hot?!

595
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,220
Oh water, water. A towel, a towel.

596
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,470
Turn around!

597
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,060
Were you well today?

598
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,710
Your color looks much better today,
thank goodness.

599
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,530
Do not frown.

600
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,660
Your Majesty looks much better
when you're smiling.

601
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,430
I'll just see her and ask her in person.

602
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,330
Are you saying my existence
to Miss Yeon Woo,

603
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,370
is as tiny as that eye-crust sized dot?!

604
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,800
The first reason is that
I don't want to lose you.

605
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,520
The second reason is that I...

606
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,680
It's your sister...

607
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,950
...I think I'm in love.

608
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,670
The two of them together
make such a lovely painting.

609
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,450
Do you think the rumor is true?

610
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,350
Rumor? What rumor?

611
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,050
That the reason His Majesty
doesn't visit the Queen's quarters

612
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,870
is because of Swordsman Woon? That rumor?

613
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,070
If it were me and such a magnificent human
were next to me,

614
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,930
could I possibly notice anyone else?

615
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,580
Listen to you...

616
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,340
Let's go.

617
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:59,480
It was a smile he has never once,
ever, shown me.

618
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,440
Your Majesty.

619
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,270
Where are you going?

620
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,740
I'm going to see His Majesty.

621
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,420
You cannot, Your Majesty.

622
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,030
Will you not let go of this hand?!

623
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,260
Exactly how long am I to just sit
and wait for a notice from the King?

624
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,160
I cannot do this any longer.

625
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,880
I'm going to see him directly...

626
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,400
What is going on, Court Lady Jo?

627
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,830
Why are you so rash?

628
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:33,350
In the palace
the walls have eyes and ears.

629
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,890
Didn't I tell you to always take notice
of your surroundings as you move about?

630
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:42,110
These days, I have really strange dreams.

631
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,590
If you cling to a night's dream
and move so rashly,

632
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,570
then how is this different from
any other lady's private sitting room?

633
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,800
He is only now recovering his health.

634
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:58,390
If you were to enter the King's quarters,
and he fell ill again,

635
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,920
how would you handle the aftermath?

636
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,790
Being cautious is all you need to do!

637
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,050
Before the designated evening
for the marital bed...

638
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,700
...do not even look towards
the King's quarters.

639
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,190
Do you understand, Your Majesty?

640
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,470
I will keep that in mind.

641
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:32,020
Over all these years, how is it
that you can't win over a man's heart?

642
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:37,920
If you had only conceived a Prince,
things wouldn't be so troublesome.

643
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,970
Please call Mother.

644
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,610
I miss her.

645
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,620
It has truly been a long time
since I've seen you in military uniform.

646
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,220
I thought I'd wear it to the skills
display of the new royal messengers.

647
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,330
Do you like it?

648
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:20,270
I hear you have recovered your health,
but right now it's better to be safe.

649
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,860
Do not allow him to grow fatigued
with his schedule.

650
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:26,250
Even if I overexert myself,
I would just need to lie down a bit.

651
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,910
And, you probably wouldn't consider that
bad news.

652
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,420
How can you make
such a groundless statement?

653
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,350
Ah, by the way, I am late to thank you.

654
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:41,900
When I was taking my recuperative trip,
I appreciated the gift you sent.

655
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,310
Thanks to you, I broke into a nice sweat
and had a chance to loosen up my body.

656
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,240
I had heard ginseng was therapeutic
in the hot springs,

657
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,630
so I merely sent some.

658
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:06,520
To hear that you found it satisfactory,
I am quite relieved.

659
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:08,570
Ginseng.

660
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,810
Ginseng, you say.

661
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:16,770
Well, whether this or that,
it increases body temperature,

662
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,410
so I suppose there isn't much difference.

663
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,560
In any case, thank you.

664
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:26,210
Since you received it so wholeheartedly,
I can only be moved to tears.

665
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,180
At any time...

666
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:31,980
...I'd be happy to send more.

667
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,310
I look forward to it.

668
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,010
What is the matter?

669
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,770
Are you not feeling well?

670
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,890
I am fine.

671
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,170
Your Majesty,
the court physician is here.

672
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,420
Send him in.

673
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:38,040
At any time, I'd be happy to send more.

674
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,900
I will test it for you.

675
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,040
Are you concerned because
of what I said to you a while back?

676
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,180
Do not worry.

677
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,330
As I told you, it is not time yet.

678
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,700
Your Majesty. Are you all right?

679
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,090
It just went down my windpipe.
Don't make a fuss.

680
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,280
The constellation of the wolf...

681
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:32,420
...is shrouded in darkness.

682
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,210
Were you well today again?

683
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:43,730
I have heard that your health
has recovered significantly.

684
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,620
That is truly fortunate.

685
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,740
Do you know?

686
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,880
For the first time, I feel that
it's fortunate I am a shaman.

687
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:03,680
Because I can be of help to you,
watching over you at your side...

688
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,350
...I consider it very fortunate.

689
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:10,980
Is that blasphemous?

690
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,330
Who are you?

691
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,240
Speak!

692
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,250
What is your true identity?!
