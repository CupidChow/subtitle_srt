1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,240
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,870
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,110
Episode 13

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,230
No matter what you say,

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,640
I am your woman.

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,240
After all, if you cannot have
the King's heart...

7
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,080
...I suppose you would want, at least,
to be mother to the future King.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Fine.

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,540
For the sake of my Queen,
I shall, for once, untie your ribbon.

10
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,400
You are too cruel.

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,890
I am a woman, too.

12
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,430
Instead of treating me like a stranger...

13
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,100
...can't you please see me as a woman
who misses her husband?

14
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,190
Why are you acting like this again?

15
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,880
Are you trying to turn back things
to the way they were?

16
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Your Majesty…

17
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,460
Your Majesty.

18
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,690
Your Majesty!

19
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,240
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

20
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,690
Anyone? Is there no one out there?

21
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,980
Your Majesty.

22
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,720
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

23
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,520
Please wake up, Your Majesty!

24
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,930
Your Majesty!

25
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,230
Call for the physician immediately!

26
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,300
Yes.

27
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,290
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

28
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
Your Majesty!

29
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,120
Please wake up, Your Majesty!

30
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,430
Thank you.

31
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,550
For what?

32
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,340
For treating a lowly shaman as a person...

33
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,380
...for seeing me as a woman,
and even giving me your heart.

34
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,660
I am extremely grateful.

35
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,860
You said you would help me escape
from being a lowly shaman,

36
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,350
you would help me
escape this very difficult situation.

37
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,270
I am thankful for those words.

38
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,850
Extremely thankful.

39
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,870
I did not say those difficult words
to hear your gratitude.

40
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,060
However, though I am grateful...

41
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,410
...I cannot give you my heart falsely,
isn't that right?

42
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,360
Please allow me to be grateful
for all the sympathy you've given me.

43
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,040
Perchance...

44
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,000
...do you already have someone you like?

45
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,420
A shaman like me couldn't possibly
have feelings for someone.

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,650
Isn't a shaman a person, too?

47
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,670
A shaman is just
a receptacle that God uses,

48
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,190
unable to hold anything,
and who should not hold anything.

49
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,820
Does that mean regardless of the person,
no one can move your heart?

50
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,590
Wol.

51
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,810
Something awful has happened!

52
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,760
His Majesty has fainted.

53
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,390
You have been summoned
to the King's quarters.

54
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,340
You're just a receptacle that God uses.

55
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,070
Unable to hold anything,

56
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,940
and who should not hold anything?

57
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,800
Then, you should not
have been so obvious.

58
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
You wench!

59
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,700
You were told to watch over the King
during the consummation

60
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,070
in order to ward off any evil,

61
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,650
but where the hell were you
to only show up now?

62
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,130
Did you worry?

63
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,240
I did.

64
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,930
What were you so worried about?

65
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,210
Everything...

66
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,210
I was worried about everything.

67
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,770
It wasn't that
I was embracing another woman?

68
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,090
How could I dare?

69
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,980
Will you stay by my side
until the morning?

70
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,290
With you by my side...

71
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,610
...I think I can sleep peacefully.

72
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,570
If you order me to...

73
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,050
...I will do so.

74
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,340
Hurry and confess!

75
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,800
When you were moving up
the date of consummation,

76
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,600
something went wrong, right?

77
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,370
That's incorrect!

78
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,140
There was definitely nothing wrong
with the chosen date.

79
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,680
Maybe, I'm not sure but the physician
could have missed something…

80
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,840
What?!

81
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,380
Who do you take me for?

82
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,210
Are you trying to frame me right now?

83
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,170
I will put my life on the line to say

84
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,360
that there was nothing wrong
with His Majesty before the consummation.

85
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,380
If nothing was wrong with the date

86
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,930
and His Majesty was healthy,

87
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,570
then why did His Majesty
suddenly pass out?

88
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,370
We also find that worrisome.

89
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,820
But last night,

90
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,510
there was a mysterious energy.

91
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,640
Mysterious? What was it?

92
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,030
That is...

93
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,910
...yesterday, around 7 to 9 PM,
the heavens and earth were dispelled

94
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,480
and there was a force
that invaded the palace.

95
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,360
The heavens that were in one piece
became dispelled

96
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,600
and His Majesty lost consciousness,

97
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,980
so that is as if...

98
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,820
May I boldly suggest that someone
was trying to harm His Majesty's body

99
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,200
and released evil spirits into the palace?

100
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,890
You have come, Your Highness.

101
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,090
Were you on your way out
after visiting His Majesty?

102
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,190
Yes.

103
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,250
After hearing that someone cast a spell
on his body, I could not stay still.

104
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,270
So, how is he feeling?

105
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,580
According to the royal physician,

106
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,690
his pulse and blood circulation
are back to normal,

107
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,810
but to prevent further complications,

108
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,650
he wants His Majesty to take a good rest.

109
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,390
If that is all, the heavens have helped.

110
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,550
I'm sorry,

111
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,160
but His Majesty has just finished taking
the medicine that the physician gave him

112
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,100
and has fallen asleep.

113
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,900
I was this shocked.

114
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,750
So imagine how much more shocked
the Queen was.

115
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,230
I am also worried about the Queen,

116
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,100
so I was on my way to her quarters.

117
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,470
Then, let's go together.

118
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,790
You must have been so shocked.

119
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,230
You look as if you lost
ten years in a day.

120
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,630
I have no right to face Your Highnesses.

121
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,160
Do not forgive me.

122
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,470
Why do you say that?

123
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,340
How is this your fault?

124
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,270
No, Your Highness.

125
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,860
Everything is my fault.

126
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,730
If I had told you beforehand...

127
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,450
Told us what?

128
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,050
Actually...

129
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,210
...I did not report this because
I did not want to worry Your Highnesses.

130
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,730
But the day before the consummation,
I had an ominous dream.

131
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,100
What kind of ominous dream?

132
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,610
A young girl wearing white
appeared before me

133
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,050
and told me.

134
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,100
"From now on, it is my responsibility
to stay by His Majesty's side,"

135
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,540
"so you will never give birth
to a Crown Prince."

136
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,250
How could you...

137
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,080
How could you have such a horrible dream?

138
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,280
I did not want to tell you...

139
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,330
...but the human talisman
used divine powers to tempt His Majesty

140
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,350
to receive undeserved honor.
These rumors are probably the cause of it.

141
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,820
If it's about that matter,
didn't I tell you not to worry?

142
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,270
His Majesty does not know
about her existence.

143
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,780
I apologize.

144
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:14,420
But His Majesty already knew...

145
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,920
...about her coming into his chambers.

146
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,540
A shaman who absorbs bad energy
on your behalf?

147
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,360
Did such a wonderful shaman exist?

148
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,550
Had I known earlier,

149
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,590
I would have gotten one for myself.

150
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,400
Do you think your wife would let you
get away with that?

151
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,790
The day you are caught,

152
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,770
your life as you know it
would turn into chaos.

153
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,990
But how did you know that the shaman
cast a spell on His Majesty?

154
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,060
Oh! A fabrication?

155
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,690
Then, who cast the spell?

156
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,100
Is the truth that important?

157
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,530
It has already happened,

158
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,690
so using it to our advantage
is more important.

159
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,740
To others,

160
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,550
she comes and goes from the King's
chambers after he is asleep.

161
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,920
But should the scholars find out
that he still kept her by his side...

162
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,400
...despite being aware of it...

163
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,410
They would not stay quiet.

164
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,010
However, there is no way that His Majesty
will openly admit to this.

165
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,270
There is nothing for us to lose.

166
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,370
If His Majesty openly admits it,

167
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,610
we don't have to be cautious
of him anymore and we'll do as we wish.

168
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,630
Even if he does not admit it...

169
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,450
...the truth about keeping the shaman
in his quarters will be known.

170
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,530
So his reputation would be tarnished.

171
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,710
That's true!

172
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,660
First, we ruthlessly spread rumors
about him, and then.

173
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,530
"Never mind if it's not true."

174
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,480
This is what politics is all about.

175
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,830
Now, now.

176
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,860
When we review the situation.

177
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,980
First, the King
fell in love with the shaman.

178
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,520
Second,

179
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,010
being in love with him, she used sorcery
to block the consummation.

180
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,620
That should be enough, right?

181
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,700
That noggin.
That brain of yours is very fast.

182
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,830
Then, what should we prepare first?

183
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,110
First of all, we have
to tell that shaman...

184
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,900
...what answers to say
during her confession.

185
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,820
Don't you find it strange?

186
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,530
Why is it that whenever His Majesty
is with the Queen, something happens?

187
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,810
Haven't you heard?

188
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,800
They say it is because His Majesty
has not forgotten his first love.

189
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,840
That's why he is avoiding the
consummation.

190
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,480
That's just a rumor.

191
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,520
Would it make sense that His Majesty
would still harbor feelings for her

192
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,560
after eight years,
living in a place like this?

193
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,230
In my opinion,
I think the other rumor is true.

194
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,620
What rumor?

195
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,620
It's not that
His Majesty is refusing consummation,

196
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,850
but the spirit of the late Crown Princess
is obstructing the consummation.

197
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,110
Even now, at night,

198
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,140
if you pass by the Hidden Moon Pavilion
that was used by the Crown Princess,

199
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,620
they say you can hear
the crying of a ghost.

200
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,580
Then, that's the crying
of the late Maiden Heo?

201
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,890
Why? What would she be so upset about?

202
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,940
I don't know about that.

203
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,490
Anyhow, after a healthy Crown Princess
died suddenly,

204
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,010
some people conjectured whether
it could have been poisoning or murder.

205
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,620
Inside the palace,
it was a hot topic for a while.

206
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,710
Then, there was no evidence
of murder, right?

207
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,330
That's right.

208
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,710
What about poison?

209
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,260
That was also not the problem.

210
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,690
Then, do you remember the symptoms?

211
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,770
Well, that's the thing.

212
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,530
Her pulse was steady
and her organs were healthy.

213
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,490
During my 30 years as a physician,
it was the first time it happened to me

214
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,430
so I remember it very clearly.

215
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,360
But, are you really her relative?

216
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,530
Y... yes.

217
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,800
That's very strange.

218
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,260
Her family members were all good-looking.

219
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,000
So, is there anything else you remember?

220
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,780
Nothing else stood out,

221
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,030
but the parents always come to mind.

222
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,250
Madam called for me, so I went.

223
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,160
The daughter was already dead
but she insisted she was alive

224
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,690
and cried for me to check her pulse.

225
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
That's not all.

226
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,800
I don't know for how long
Director Heo held his dead daughter.

227
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,920
Although a long time had passed
since the daughter died,

228
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,410
her corpse was as warm as she were alive.

229
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,630
Just talking it about it scares me.

230
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,390
I don't need anything.

231
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,570
While we are out,
let us get some tonic for you, Mother.

232
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,650
No, we must not.

233
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,220
You must have it first, Princess.

234
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,180
That way I can have a grandson
who looks just like our Yeom.

235
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,820
If it is that kind of tonic,
I will take it a hundred times.

236
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,860
Even if it is more bitter
than gall bladder,

237
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,090
I will eat it like sweets.

238
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,810
By any chance, do you have that here?

239
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,520
What are you looking for?

240
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,570
Don't talk and listen to me.

241
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,610
I heard there's a medicine
that increases a man's stamina.

242
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,710
Oh, yes. I do have it.

243
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,970
I will pay you a lot for it,

244
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,540
so when you send my medicine,
please send it along.

245
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,140
Yes.

246
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,990
Mother, what are you doing?

247
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,460
Are you looking at that again?

248
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,580
Just before the Crown Princess selection,

249
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,960
Yeon Woo and I came here.

250
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,640
We measured her height.

251
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,450
Right here.

252
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,190
If she were alive,

253
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,250
how much taller would she be?

254
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,180
Actually, a young man came by earlier

255
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,590
and asked about Milady.

256
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,400
Seems like it was because of you, Madam.

257
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,750
About Yeon Woo?

258
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,210
Who did he say he was?

259
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,370
He said he was a distant relative.

260
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,520
Hidden Moon Pavilion.

261
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,720
Crown Princess.

262
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,400
Crown Princess?

263
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,120
Miss Heo.

264
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,210
Yeon Woo.

265
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
Heo Yeon Woo?

266
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,550
Heo Yeon Woo? Heo Yeon Woo.

267
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,830
Yeon Woo.

268
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,120
Yeon Woo.

269
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,860
-Yeon Woo.
-Yeon Woo.

270
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,390
Yeon Woo.

271
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,610
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo.

272
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,930
Yeon Woo.

273
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,300
Yeon Woo!

274
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,320
Shaman Wol, come out
and receive your punishment!

275
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,660
Are you shaman Wol?

276
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,150
-I am, but who are you?
-Me?

277
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,780
Inspector Hong Gyu Tae.

278
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,120
Arrest her immediately!

279
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,220
-Yes.
-Yes.

280
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,140
Why are you doing this?

281
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,850
What is the reason for you to do this?

282
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,600
Milady!

283
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,970
What are you doing?

284
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,490
Why are you doing this to her
when she has done nothing wrong?

285
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,250
Get out of the way!

286
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,140
Shaman Wol is guilty of high treason
so we are arresting her.

287
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,010
She committed treason?

288
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,990
You must be mistaken.

289
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,300
If she has not committed a crime,
that's for the Court to decide.

290
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,300
What are you doing?

291
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,710
Take her away!

292
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,660
Yes!

293
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,680
Jan Shil.
I am going to follow her this way.

294
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,590
Go immediately and tell
Jang ahjumma what happened, okay?

295
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,060
What do I do?

296
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Mistress went out earlier.

297
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,810
What do I do, Mistress?

298
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,390
What do I do?

299
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,540
How could you have done
something so careless?

300
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,930
Do you really want blood on your hands?

301
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:22,570
Until the rightful owner
of Gyo Tae Palace returns,

302
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,430
it should be stopped at all costs.

303
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,700
That fate could have been severed.

304
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
That union is not possible!

305
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,410
If this opportunity is lost,

306
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,810
then the chance to turn everything back...

307
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,110
...will be lost forever.

308
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,240
It's already too late to do anything.

309
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,890
From the moment I used black sorcery
against my shaman conscience,

310
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,260
everything became irreversible.

311
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,190
But didn't you do it to save the Miss?

312
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,310
If it wasn't for Ari's last wish...

313
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,150
...I would have killed her.

314
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,440
I know that you do not mean it.

315
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,780
It was necessary to save both
the Miss and the Seongsucheong.

316
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,150
How can I not know that?

317
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,470
Did you say to protect the Seongsucheong?

318
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,490
It does sound like a worthy reason,
but that is not the truth.

319
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,340
Look here, Miss Jang.

320
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,490
Anyway,

321
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:31,360
it is because of the Queen Dowager's wish
that the Seongsucheong barely survived.

322
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,250
The Seongsucheong should ignore
the heavens and the people,

323
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,370
and do righteous bidding
for the Royal family.

324
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,180
The moment we degenerated
into political tools for the politicians,

325
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,420
the fate of the Seongsucheong
was already sealed.

326
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,760
Even if we were to disappear,

327
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,170
I was selfish to wish
that it would not be because of me

328
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,660
that we defied the heavens.

329
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,110
Then, don't you think it's time
to return things to the way they were?

330
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,320
It is too late to do anything...

331
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,390
at this point.

332
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,790
Do you not understand?

333
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,780
The collapse has already started!

334
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,570
Why did you defy the Office's orders
and left the King's quarters?

335
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,640
I told you already.

336
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,520
It was a royal command.

337
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,130
Then, the time when black sorcery
was used against His Majesty's body,

338
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,340
where were you and what were you doing?

339
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,150
I already told you
that I in the Seongsucheong's courtyard.

340
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,290
Is there any witness that can verify that?

341
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,790
At that time, I was...

342
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,830
Can't you consider me?

343
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,650
Please go back.

344
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,120
I was alone.

345
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,940
Then,

346
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,920
you do not have
anything to prove your innocence!

347
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,310
Let me go and talk.

348
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,800
This rude...

349
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,450
Aigoo, what are you doing?

350
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,780
Stop.

351
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,700
Your Excellency, Chief Councilor.

352
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,040
I have something to say to this child,
will you leave the two of us alone?

353
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,380
Did you just say high treason?

354
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,900
Yes.

355
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,090
They say that she has used
black sorcery on His Majesty.

356
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,470
The punishment for using sorcery
on His Majesty

357
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,390
is beheading, as it should be.

358
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,530
I never used sorcery.

359
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,550
You do not understand what I said.

360
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,490
A curse to harm His Majesty's body
came from somewhere.

361
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,020
Someone needs to be punished for it.

362
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:26,970
Whoever that person may be.

363
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,390
Once you are on torture grounds,

364
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,660
until you admit to the crime,
you will undergo horrific agony.

365
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,550
Blood and flesh will fly,
and your bones will probably break.

366
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,320
You will say, please kill me.

367
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,180
You will plead like that.

368
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,130
However,

369
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,600
depending on your answer,
the situation may change.

370
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,410
That means I can help spare you
of the torture and beatings,

371
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,520
and walk out of here with your two legs.

372
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:14,380
What is it that you want from me?

373
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,040
Now that's more like it.

374
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,320
While you were in his chambers,

375
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,560
it is said that you and His Majesty
secretly shared feelings for one another.

376
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,630
That is absurd!

377
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,270
How could I dare do that to His Majesty?!

378
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,680
That is not the answer.

379
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,030
In order to monopolize
His Majesty's affection,

380
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,440
you left the King's chambers
on the consummation date,

381
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,330
and used black sorcery to block
the consummation from behind the palace.

382
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,390
Is that correct?

383
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,690
I have never used black sorcery.

384
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,860
That is also not the answer.

385
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,780
What are you going to do?

386
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,000
After a harsh accusation,

387
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,710
will you accept the punishment
on your limbs?

388
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,260
Or,

389
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,500
will you obediently admit
to your relationship with His Majesty

390
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,880
and be exiled from the capital?

391
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,840
Ahjumma!

392
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,770
Where have you been all this time?

393
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,080
What happened?

394
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,140
They're still interrogating,
so they say I can't visit.

395
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,760
After which, she will be sent to prison.

396
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,940
I will stay here, so you go back.

397
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,190
No. Until I see Miss's face, I won't...

398
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,340
Go on. Do you not hear me?!

399
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,080
She looks familiar.

400
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,370
I've definitely seen her before.

401
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,360
Mistress.

402
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,830
Are you feeling all right?

403
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,580
For now, I am all right.

404
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,790
Milady, why do you keep suffering
from such ordeals?

405
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,200
More importantly, how is His Majesty?

406
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,870
I did come out after I saw him stabilize,

407
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,330
but I worry that his condition...

408
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,580
Your life is at stake here.
Is that the problem now?

409
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,470
Do you not know the severity
of the crime of sorcery?

410
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,440
I know.

411
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,920
Moreover, it is not important
whether I am guilty or not,

412
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,250
and that using me and be discarded
to justify politics is befitting,

413
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,000
for I am nothing but a lowly shaman.

414
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,480
I am very well aware of that.

415
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,330
Anyway, I won't be able
to escape from here.

416
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,390
Just...

417
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,880
Just what?

418
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,680
His Majesty has fallen
into a predicament because of me.

419
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,820
They will use my entrance into the palace

420
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,380
and ruin His Majesty's reputation
to weaken his authority.

421
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,690
In your state, who are you worrying about?

422
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,100
How can I not be a burden on His Majesty?

423
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,770
Please think with me.

424
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,490
If I confess and say that I am a spy
who tried to harm His royal body...

425
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,970
Are you out of your mind?

426
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,160
Then, do you plan on a false confession?

427
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,650
If I am unable to prove my innocence,

428
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,350
isn't that what I can do
to help His Majesty?

429
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,110
Stop this nonsense!

430
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,310
If you were unjustly
found guilty and punished,

431
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,760
do you think His Majesty would be happy?

432
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,350
That's true.

433
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,590
That will be more painful for him, right?

434
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,010
He will be hurt, right?

435
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,920
Since even a lowly shaman is his subject,

436
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,170
because he is unable to protect me...

437
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,600
...he will probably blame himself, right?

438
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,290
Then... Then what should I do?

439
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:16,050
What can I do
to protect both His Majesty and myself?

440
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,850
It is medicine to restore your health.

441
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,160
Even though you have passed the state
where you have to worry,

442
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,110
you must rest more.

443
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,810
What is it?

444
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,770
That…

445
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,710
That…

446
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,610
I asked what is wrong?

447
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:11,420
Under the allegation of using sorcery,
Shaman Wol was taken into custody

448
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,540
and they will proceed with the torture.

449
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,580
Should I take this one or that one?

450
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,380
It will be inconvenient
if I take too much.

451
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,710
But if I am to attend a palace banquet,

452
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,030
I will probably need
a more presentable attire, right?

453
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,250
That's right.

454
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,470
Look for the banquet attire
that craftsman Kim Dong Su made.

455
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,200
And for the shoes that'll match it...

456
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:44,520
The silk ones embroidered by Master Park,
sewn stitch by stitch.

457
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,060
Did something bad happen?

458
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,790
Why do you think that?

459
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,250
It is because
you are suddenly leaving for a trip.

460
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,320
Because I stayed home for so long,
my body is itching to get out.

461
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,460
Looks like moving around like the wind
is more suitable for me.

462
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,170
If I'm to go to the eastern provinces
to meet the Prince Consort,

463
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,840
it will be a few more days.

464
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,000
Please return as soon as you can.

465
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,910
If you are gone for too long,
everyone worries.

466
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,510
I am too popular.

467
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh, go and get the casserole pot.

468
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,020
The taste of freshly roasted
hunted meat is excellent.

469
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,390
-Jan Shil, what brings you here?
-Brother, something awful happened.

470
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,370
Wol... Wol...

471
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,240
I'm sorry,
but I was setting off on my journey.

472
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,360
Unni was accused of sorcery
and dragged to prison.

473
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,300
Can't you help, Brother?

474
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,030
Brother, just once.
Just this once, please?

475
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,140
It has nothing to do with me.

476
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,560
What do I do now?

477
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,910
I have definitely seen her somewhere.
Definitely.

478
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,530
Oh, that girl...

479
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,110
Do you know her?

480
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,070
Yes.

481
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,980
Last time at the market,
we had a small mishap.

482
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,300
What are you doing right now?!

483
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,900
Proceeding with the torture
without a royal command

484
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,080
is the law of what country?

485
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,220
Many people are watching.

486
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,610
Could we please go to another place
before you ask more questions?

487
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,720
After proceeding with the torture
without a royal command,

488
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,640
you were going to wait for me to decide?

489
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,960
That's right.

490
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,490
That wicked girl hindered the consummation
of His Majesty and the Queen

491
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,740
to not only break
the lineage of this country,

492
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,080
but she committed treason
by casting a curse to harm Your Majesty.

493
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,850
How could I not intensify
the investigation?

494
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,590
Are you saying this
with concrete evidence?!

495
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,070
Although we do not have evidence,

496
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,910
there is also a lack of evidence
to prove her innocence.

497
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,380
And so, in order to find out the truth,

498
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,700
I quickly proceeded with the torture.

499
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,910
If she has committed treason,
I will interrogate her.

500
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,770
You cannot do that.

501
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,790
How can you face such a vicious girl?

502
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:34,690
Then, are you going to defy
a royal command?!

503
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,880
How can we dare defy a royal command?

504
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,450
But, resisting remonstrations
is not what a sage king does.

505
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,690
Requests to abolish the Seongsucheong
and the Office of Astronomy,

506
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,590
and appeals to separate the two
to exclude them from government

507
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,430
are streaming in every day!

508
00:40:54,190 --> 00:41:00,580
You must follow Neo-Confucianism tenets
and be an example for all your subjects.

509
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:09,090
I beg of you, please do not concern
yourself with this matter anymore.

510
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:16,150
If you are stubborn over this matter,
the scholars will doubt your sincerity.

511
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:25,930
Yoon Dae Hyung.

512
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,010
Yoon Dae Hyung!

513
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,100
Where are you going?

514
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,840
-To the torture grounds.
-You must not do that.

515
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,630
She won't lie in order to live,
so what do you think will happen to her?!

516
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,650
Before Your Majesty is a man,

517
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,970
you are this nation's monarch.

518
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,480
What do you think their objective is?

519
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,570
Do you think it is to kill
one lowly shaman?

520
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,040
They are trying to make
all scholars turn their back on you,

521
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,900
so that you will cease being
the court's central figure.

522
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,540
If you take such risks
to save one person...

523
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,460
...you will lose many.

524
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:27,370
You must give her up.

525
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,980
If Your Majesty enters the torture grounds
and takes her side,

526
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,980
you will lose all of your subjects.

527
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,260
She is a smart child.

528
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,130
She will be able
to save her life on her own.

529
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,180
Please trust her
and be indifferent, instead.

530
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,120
That is the only way to save her

531
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,750
and to save Your Majesty's nation.

532
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,530
I will give you another chance to answer.

533
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,860
What is your reason
for casting a curse on His Majesty?

534
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,780
No matter how many times you ask me...

535
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,210
...my answer is the same.

536
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:40,510
I absolutely have never practiced
such sorcery!

537
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,560
I offered you a way to live...

538
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,420
...but you are shortening your own life.

539
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,110
If that is your choice...

540
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,780
...then I have no choice.

541
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,340
Until she confesses,
continue the torture!

542
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,510
Yes!

543
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,980
Please save her, Your Highness.

544
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,000
Saying that she cursed His Majesty
is absurd.

545
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,000
That child does not have
that kind of divine power.

546
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,910
How can I believe you?

547
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,250
They say it has been a long time since His
Majesty found out about her existence...

548
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,140
...but how is it
that I only heard about that today?

549
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,540
That's because I was afraid
that you would needlessly worry...

550
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,010
Although your successor's existence
was discovered,

551
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,640
why did you keep her
by His Majesty's side?

552
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,720
Was it to gain his love?

553
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,440
So, through your successor,
did you want to gain power?

554
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,300
You don't trust me to that extent?

555
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,870
Within your dark heart,
how can I know what you are thinking?

556
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,180
If that's the case, eight years ago...

557
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,830
...why did you trust me that much
and ordered me to cast the curse?

558
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:22,370
How would you know who I would curse?

559
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:28,230
Why did you trust me and give me
such an order?

560
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:34,330
Do you now dare to threaten me?

561
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,780
I have been devoted to you
all these years.

562
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,410
After receiving your order,
I gave my successor as a talisman.

563
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,870
You can't even save her life?

564
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,540
What?

565
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,560
Now that my successor is in danger,

566
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,010
what should I be afraid of?

567
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,320
I will come clean about my crimes...

568
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,610
...and die with her. That's all.

569
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:05,760
Insolent fool!

570
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,900
But...

571
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:11,770
...it will be different for Your Highness.

572
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,840
If by any chance,

573
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,660
His Majesty were to find out
about what happened eight years ago.

574
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,070
Your Highness, His Majesty has arrived.

575
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:38,610
High Shaman Jang Nok Young
pays respects to His Majesty.

576
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,330
Isn't Shaman Kwon
the High Shaman of the Seongsucheong?

577
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,520
She was only the temporary High Shaman,

578
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,610
while I was away from the Seongsucheong

579
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,810
and returned not too long ago.

580
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,340
I will be going.

581
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,240
Please do not give heed to me.

582
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,640
Did you say request?

583
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:43,760
Your Majesty who rarely visits me
is asking this grandmother for help?

584
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:48,390
Such wonders I witness in old age.

585
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,030
Why are you doing this, Your Majesty?

586
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,860
Your Highness, I beg of you.

587
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,080
Please have the head court lady
stop the torture.

588
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:08,840
Before things get worse, please stop it.

589
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,720
What is the matter with you, Your Majesty?

590
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:15,990
You are not by any chance actually worried
that the child will get hurt, are you?

591
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,290
Don't tell me you're infatuated
with a lowly shaman?

592
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:28,180
I am a man, too.

593
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,810
Although it is true
that I was attracted for a while,

594
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,010
it was not love.

595
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
As the nation's King,

596
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,930
how can I love a lowly shaman?

597
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,450
I have that much maturity.

598
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:52,260
Well, Your Majesty does not
give affection that easily.

599
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,240
I simply do not want
this matter to get bigger.

600
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,650
It is human nature to be mesmerized
temporarily by a flower's fragrance.

601
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,650
Just because it happened to be a shaman,
that makes it worse.

602
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:15,000
As this nation's King,
how can I rule my subjects?

603
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,840
I plead of you to please save
the dignity of a King.

604
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:27,470
But, like a weary tiger,
I am an old woman with no power,

605
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,490
so how can I help you?

606
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,940
You are mistaken.

607
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,700
Apart from me and the Chief Councilor...

608
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,050
...who else could act in freedom,
if not Your Highness?

609
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:51,780
If I have to give up one to gain many,

610
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,620
why not give up myself...

611
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,570
...and save the one.

612
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,720
You're tougher than I expected.

613
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,840
I'll ask you one last time.

614
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,780
At that time, where were you,

615
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,470
and who were you with?

616
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,610
I was alone...

617
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,010
...at the Seongsucheong.

618
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,920
-Hit her!
-Yes!

619
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,480
I came to prove that child's innocence.

620
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,250
Your Excellence, Prince Yang Myung.

621
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,830
During the time
when His Majesty's body was cursed,

622
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:59,460
this child was with me
in the yard of the Seongsucheong.

623
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,960
Why are you saying such a dangerous thing?

624
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,220
Dangerous?

625
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,730
A member of the royal family
with a shaman.

626
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,650
On top of that, the fact that you were
at the Seongsucheong

627
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,650
can raise suspicion,
so it is dangerous talk.

628
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,860
How can you have such obscure thoughts?

629
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,710
A man and a woman meeting
under the moonlight to conspire treason

630
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,360
is a waste of youth, don't you think?

631
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,650
Then, as a member of the royal family,

632
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,720
why were you at the Seongsucheong?

633
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,860
The reason is obvious.

634
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,390
I and this child...

635
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,110
I invited him.

636
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,590
This man saved me when I was
in a dangerous situation.

637
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,970
My savior.

638
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,630
The life of a lowly shaman
made me weary and tired,

639
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,460
so I wanted to run away,

640
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,110
but I had no way out.

641
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,960
So I invited him
to the Seongsucheong that night

642
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,730
and begged him to help me escape.

643
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,100
I had no idea
that he was a member of the royal family.

644
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:22,020
If I had known,
I would never have asked him.

645
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,070
Hence, this man has done nothing wrong.

646
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:39,880
Now, her innocence has been proven.

647
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,460
Therefore, release her immediately!

648
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,860
Did you order me to stop the torture?

649
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,760
According to Shaman Jang,

650
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,020
the girl Wol does not have the power
to curse people.

651
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,580
Anyway, Prince Yang Myung
also sacrificed himself

652
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,670
and proved her innocence.

653
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,930
We must acquit her
of the charges of sorcery.

654
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,430
Even if we pardon her for sorcery,

655
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,930
what about seducing
a member of the royal family?

656
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,410
Exiling to the outskirts
of the city will do.

657
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:29,180
I just need to chase her away
from His Majesty's side.

658
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,100
Through this, we definitely suppressed
His Majesty's freedom,

659
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,190
so we achieved what we wanted.

660
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,270
Is that all?

661
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,310
We also acquired a trump card
to use in the future.

662
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,190
By trump card, you mean…

663
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,740
...Romance between
a royal family member and a shaman.

664
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,620
Doesn't that remind you
of Prince Ui Seong?

665
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,400
And so,

666
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,940
Prince Yang Myung that was threatening
His Majesty's safety and power

667
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,920
has come into our hands, as well.

668
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,130
Why did you come to this place?

669
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,940
I've come to tell you a way out.

670
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:48,380
Tell them it wasn't you who seduced me
but that I seduced you.

671
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,820
That way, although you won't be able
to completely clear your name,

672
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,920
it will lighten your sentence.

673
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,600
I will take care
of what happens after that.

674
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,210
I cannot do that.

675
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,690
You cannot?

676
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:03,890
Why is that?

677
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,180
Earlier on the interrogation grounds,
you lied so well.

678
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,490
And it is not exactly a lie.

679
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:14,790
I will figure out my life on my own.

680
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,280
So, don't trouble yourself
to help me again.

681
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,520
No. I cannot do that.

682
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,750
As a Prince of this nation,
I cannot be indebted to a lowly shaman.

683
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,170
Earlier, as you have lied for me,
I will now lie...

684
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,990
Do you think I lied for your sake?

685
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,900
Are you saying you didn't?

686
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:45,670
I used you in order to live.

687
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,660
If you think I did it for your sake...

688
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,280
...you are delusional.

689
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,910
Do not worry.

690
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm not doing this for you, either.

691
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,850
I did it because I could not leave
for my journey feeling awkward...

692
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,910
...so I have to save you.

693
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,260
If you do not like this method,
I will think of another.

694
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,730
Hyungnim interfered at the interrogation
for that child?

695
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:53,140
Then he knew about her as well.

696
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:04,150
Woon, your expression indicates that
you've already known for some time now.

697
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,230
Your Majesty, it is Hyung Sun.

698
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:10,350
Come in.

699
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:16,940
Your Majesty,

700
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,450
His Excellency,
Prince Yang Myung has come.

701
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,870
Since we last met, have you been well?

702
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,990
I'm sorry for causing you such pain.

703
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,020
But if I do not end this,

704
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,070
Your Majesty or My Lord

705
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,710
will both be in much danger.

706
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:04,290
You need not forgive
a cruel person like me.

707
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,320
What made you enter the palace?

708
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:18,390
I have always wasted my time
on worthless activities.

709
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:25,590
Today, I came to the palace to deal
with investigators, so it was cumbersome.

710
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,050
I heard that you testified
at the interrogation grounds.

711
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:35,710
I'm surprised that you went through
so much trouble for a lowly shaman.

712
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,910
It's not like you at all.

713
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,090
It seems as if Your Majesty
does not know me very well.

714
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,150
I am different from Your Majesty,

715
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,270
so in order to gain one,
I will give up everything.

716
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,360
That is what I think.

717
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,610
Then, due to my greed to attain everything

718
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,360
I do not know the value of one.

719
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,320
Is that what you're implying?

720
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,540
It is only natural,
as the monarch of the nation.

721
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,400
And that is why I came to ask you
for that one, lowly as she is.

722
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,600
To ask for her.

723
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,650
Please give me your consent.

724
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,270
That is impossible.

725
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,260
Why is it so?

726
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:33,120
The reputation of the royal family
is closely tied to that of the King's.

727
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,090
My title is Prince,
but everything else is superficial.

728
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:39,540
How can I have
the reputation of the royal family?

729
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,870
If Your Majesty allows it,
I am ready to abandon it any time.

730
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:44,790
In exchange for that child...

731
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,940
I said that is impossible!

732
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,760
When I was a Crown Prince,
you once told me...

733
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,620
...that if it were you,
you would have protected her.

734
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,510
Even if you had to lose everything,
even with your life at stake,

735
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,020
you would have protected her.

736
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,550
Do you think
the royal family is any different?

737
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,190
By keeping her by your side,
how can you expect her to be safe?

738
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:21,410
Please think again

739
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:26,260
about what must be done
to protect that child.

740
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,670
Everything I have ever wanted,

741
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:38,080
and everything I have ever desired,

742
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,360
was always handed to you
on a silver platter.

743
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:45,050
If you will not give me
the one thing that I earnestly want...

744
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:54,490
Was I too cruel to my brother?

745
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:59,330
Do you think I have hurt his heart?

746
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:04,470
Aren't you the one
who was truly hurt, Your Majesty?

747
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,530
Woon.

748
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,750
I do not want...

749
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,700
...to lose any more of my precious people.

750
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,640
But now, it seems like even
my brother is no longer safe.

751
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,310
Councilor Yoon will surely

752
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,810
like the way
he used the cord to try to strangle me,

753
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:30,400
turning my brother's love for the shaman
into something treacherous

754
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,320
and killing them both.

755
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,680
Isn't that very sad?

756
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,640
In the end, the one who gets hurt the most
being caught in the middle...

757
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:45,280
...will be Wol that child.
