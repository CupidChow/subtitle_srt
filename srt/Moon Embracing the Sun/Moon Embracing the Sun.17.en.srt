1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,460
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,670
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,570
Episode 17

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,510
As I've said, there's no nee
to walk me out.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,380
Then, have a safe journey.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,120
You won't suddenly disappear
without telling me,

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,190
won't you?

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,700
Even if I wanted to,

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,260
where would a criminal like me go?

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,330
That's right.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,040
You are a criminal.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,840
You are a criminal and a shaman, Wol.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,840
Aren't you being too mean?

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,710
No, that's not what I mean.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,050
The fact that you are a criminal
and a shaman makes me very happy.

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,720
So go inside and rest.

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,970
Assassins!

18
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,820
Yeon Woo.

19
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,960
Yeon Woo!

20
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,060
Are you real?

21
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,890
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,430
You're not just an illusion,

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,030
but really...

24
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,240
...His Majesty?

25
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,800
I am not an illusion.

26
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,410
I really came here
looking for you, Yeon Woo.

27
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,560
How could it take me so long
to recognize you?

28
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,830
I am so stupid.

29
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,950
Hyungnim!

30
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,150
Your Excellency.

31
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,680
Your Excellency.

32
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,150
Hyungnim.

33
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,920
I am fine.

34
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,570
Where are you planning to go?

35
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,440
Where are we going now?

36
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

37
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,180
There is a wooden hut to the west.

38
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,290
In case there was any danger,
we agreed to take the Miss there.

39
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,960
You lost the girl?!

40
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,660
It was because His Majesty
and his bodyguard Woon appeared.

41
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,100
Furthermore, His Excellency
Prince Yang Myung appeared,

42
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,370
and escaped with that girl.

43
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,670
No matter how, the girl must be caught.

44
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,770
Also,

45
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,450
the Seongsucheong's High Shaman, Jang,

46
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,430
must be quietly eliminated!

47
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,560
You were involved in the death of
the Crown Princess and the only witness,

48
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,230
so His Majesty ordered you to survive
at all cost until this matter is resolved.

49
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,440
You may hide now, but must return at once
should they summon you.

50
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,380
Should you attempt to flee
or take your own life,

51
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,010
your coffin will be exhumed
and you'll be beheaded for your sins.

52
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,990
Where are you going?

53
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,190
-Come with us!
-Let her go.

54
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,860
It's obvious where that girl is going.

55
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,900
What if she goes and doesn't return?

56
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,170
It's just as obvious that she will return,
so stop worrying and follow me.

57
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,700
Your Majesty.

58
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,270
-Call the royal physician!
-Do not bother!

59
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,380
Everything that happened today
must definitely remain a secret.

60
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,020
But, Your Majesty...

61
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,260
Yoon Dae Hyung.

62
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,560
Hyungnim.

63
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,180
Prince Yang Myung.

64
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,020
Prince Yang Myung!

65
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,710
Mother.

66
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,170
-Prince Yang Myung!
-Your Excellency!

67
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,790
Prince Yang Myung!

68
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,220
Though I do not know who you are,

69
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,820
we need to move him inside,
so could you please help me?

70
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,720
-I will.
-Prince Yang Myung.

71
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,230
-Your Excellency.
-Prince Yang Myung.

72
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,000
I am the daughter
of Director Heo Young Jae,

73
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,040
Heo Yeon Woo.

74
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,380
Are you the daughter of Director Heo,
by any chance?

75
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,230
That is correct.

76
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,270
What is the matter?

77
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,020
Why must you suffer
from such painful heartache?

78
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,300
I shall not ask for details
on how you managed to survive.

79
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,630
However,

80
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,000
I can probably guess.

81
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,780
Prince Yang Myung came to me once,

82
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,510
and asked me about reincarnation.

83
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,990
He was more than prepared to give up
power, fame and riches,

84
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,480
but there was this one person

85
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,730
he could never give up.

86
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,400
He probably wanted to show me.

87
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,140
The kind of person who captured
his heart so much.

88
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,350
Although I don't deserve to be his mother,

89
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,250
he dragged his wounded body,

90
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,220
and came all the way here.

91
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,270
They weren't at Jung Temple, either?

92
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,310
That is correct.

93
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,690
Come with me.

94
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,840
Everything has been prepared
as you ordered.

95
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,010
With the exception of Hyung Sun,
everyone leave.

96
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,910
Hand me your sword.

97
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,660
Your Majesty.

98
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,300
Why are you doing this?

99
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,210
Take off your clothes.

100
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,820
Really, you are no fun.

101
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,250
You should at least act surprised
when a sword is drawn on you,

102
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,270
so I can enjoy joking around.

103
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,870
Your Majesty,
why do you keep acting this way?

104
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,770
I was so shocked!

105
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,740
Spending the entire night searching
in the cold must have been tiring.

106
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,270
Get in.

107
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,940
It was for you that I ordered them
to prepare this.

108
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,150
I cannot do that.

109
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,280
Go in.

110
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,220
It is an order.

111
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,750
Your Majesty.

112
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,520
Defying a royal order is disloyalty.

113
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,930
If the chill in your body is passed
onto me, that is also disloyalty.

114
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,290
And causing my brother and I to waver..

115
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,700
..is treason.

116
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,340
Make sure that Woon goes into the bath.

117
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,350
And if he comes out too soon,

118
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,410
kill him with that sword.

119
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,330
Your Majesty.

120
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,490
Woon.

121
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,990
Although I am unable to grant you
the highest position,

122
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,290
I cherish you more than anyone.

123
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,530
So, do not get hurt.

124
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,540
I feel your concern as well.

125
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,530
Which tree is this made from?

126
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,570
That is made from a juniper.

127
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,040
Have you woken up?

128
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,940
I will go ask if breakfast is ready.

129
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,670
Are you feeling all right?

130
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,280
I...

131
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,720
...thought you left already.

132
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,000
I thought I should wait to see you,

133
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,050
so I waited until you awoke.

134
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,210
Will you walk with me a little?

135
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,630
Yes.

136
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,830
How long have you known?

137
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,380
Was it thanks to the Hye Woo Suk?

138
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,550
Wouldn't it be weirder if I didn't know?

139
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,840
Hye Woo Suk was the name I chose,

140
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,010
for a present intended for you.

141
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,440
So who else would know that besides you?

142
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,670
But,

143
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,200
why did you pretend not to know?

144
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,580
Because I didn't want to know.

145
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,950
I wanted to pretend I didn't know
until the very end, if possible.

146
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,370
Even though seeing you back and alive,

147
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,760
made me so happy I could not stand it.

148
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,230
On the other hand,

149
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,250
the moment I acknowledged that,

150
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,940
everything would disappear
like an illusion.

151
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,270
Do you know?

152
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,410
When I wake up in the morning,

153
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,620
having a place to go.

154
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,790
And in that place having a job to do,
and people who need you.

155
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,170
And the chance to see the woman
I missed so much.

156
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,200
It all made me very happy.

157
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,180
I've enjoyed it as well.

158
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,940
Every time it seemed like it was getting
dark and there was no hope,

159
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,730
Prince Yang Myung,

160
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,010
you've been my light.

161
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,420
Thanks to you,

162
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,870
I was able
to temporarily forget my worries,

163
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,740
and laugh brightly.

164
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,520
Whether I was Shaman Wol,

165
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,980
or Heo Yeon Woo,

166
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,150
I was always grateful.

167
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,750
And also...

168
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,030
...always sorry.

169
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,430
However, just because of that,

170
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,440
I cannot give you the answer

171
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,660
you were looking for.

172
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,790
So please, be free.

173
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,700
Meet someone new,

174
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,360
and please find happiness.

175
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:45,360
That is all I wish for you,
Your Excellency.

176
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,310
So,

177
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,040
please take good care of yourself.

178
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,220
In your previous life,

179
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,130
you were His Majesty's person.

180
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,000
So at least in this life,

181
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,480
could you not...

182
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,900
...stay by my side?

183
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,840
That is impossible.

184
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,000
Take Lady Yeon Woo away.

185
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,870
Do you know what you have just done?

186
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,780
Running away
with the king's woman is treason.

187
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,230
Do you intend to charge me
with high treason?

188
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,840
If I wanted you dead,
I could use national law.

189
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,780
Then, what is your purpose?

190
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:20,390
I am giving you the opportunity
to seize the throne.

191
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,340
The sword in your hand is real.

192
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,730
If you behead me right here and now,

193
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,440
you will become the ruler of this country.

194
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,930
Do you think that rising to the throne
will give you everything you want?

195
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,200
If I take the throne, at the least,

196
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,180
I won't be charged with treason.

197
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,080
Then,

198
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,730
kill me.

199
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,230
Why are you hesitating?!

200
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,460
Kill me at once!

201
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,980
Today,

202
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,240
you were the one who didn't take
this opportunity.

203
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,990
So,

204
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,770
don't ever covet it again.

205
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,200
Did you get some rest?

206
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,560
Yes.

207
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,980
Can I ask you one question?

208
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,560
Please ask.

209
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,880
By any chance,

210
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,790
did you not want to come,

211
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,960
but felt forced by me?

212
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,630
If I said I didn't want it,

213
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,300
will you send me away?

214
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,730
My heart is already Your Majesty's.

215
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,730
So why are you anxious?

216
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,480
May I open the door?

217
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,640
Do as you wish.

218
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,900
Open it.

219
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,800
Come closer.

220
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,440
Come a bit closer.

221
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,890
Why are you doing this?

222
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,170
Everyone leave.

223
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,930
Yeon Woo.

224
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

225
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Yeon Woo.

226
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

227
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,300
Yeon Woo, Yeon Woo.

228
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,670
My heart is already Your Majesty's.

229
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,130
So why are you anxious?

230
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,240
Your Majesty.

231
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,800
Where are you headed?

232
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,680
After finishing some work,
I wanted to get some rest,

233
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,490
so I was going to Kang Nyung Palace.

234
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,030
Do you have something to say to me?

235
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,650
Not too long ago,

236
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,820
I heard you were assaulted
when you went out incognito.

237
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,690
You're not hurt, are you?

238
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,960
That is very strange.

239
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,070
The only one who knows about
my disguised encounter are myself,

240
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,820
and those who tried to harm me.

241
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,870
How is it that you know about it?

242
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,280
As a minister, how can I not know about
Your Majesty's matters?

243
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,720
Knowing Your Majesty's every movement,
is part of my job, Sire.

244
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,620
In any event,

245
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,690
thank you for your concern.

246
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,830
Right.

247
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,700
I hear that you enjoy hunting.

248
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,170
Why do you ask about that?

249
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,910
Isn't there military training
coming up soon?

250
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,860
On that day,
I hope to learn hunting from you.

251
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,500
Will you teach me your tricks?

252
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,260
I am not good enough to have any tricks.

253
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,060
It's just that once I decide on my prey,

254
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,130
I follow it until the end
without ever giving up.

255
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,430
If that's a trick, then I guess
you can say that it's my trick.

256
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,270
So you decide on a prey
and pursue it without giving up.

257
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,570
And in the end, you kill it
with extreme violence.

258
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,980
Ah. I will remember that.

259
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,220
What are doing?

260
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,070
I am reading a book.

261
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,830
When I asked you earlier,
weren't you reading then too?

262
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,430
Aren't you bored?

263
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,330
I am not bored.

264
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,740
So, Your Majesty should concentrate
on government affairs.

265
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,210
What book are you reading?

266
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,780
I am reading Han Feizi.

267
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,920
That book is that interesting?

268
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,550
Yes.

269
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,550
It is interesting.

270
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,470
Your Majesty.

271
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,220
That book is so interesting
that you didn't hear me come in?

272
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,720
When did you come in?

273
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,360
We reunite after eight years,
and yet I can't compare with Han Feizi?

274
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,600
Don't tell me you're jealous
of Han Feizi?

275
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,600
Jealous?

276
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,800
I feel dejected that is all.

277
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,740
Why are you dejected?

278
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,950
For the past eight years, I've never let
another woman into my heart.

279
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,360
Do you realize how much willpower
and physical exertion it takes,

280
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,420
to commit to chastity while surrounded
by droves of beautiful ladies?

281
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,790
Does committing to chastity
require physical exertion?

282
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,060
Of course!

283
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,060
How could you possibly understand
the sleepless night of a hot-blooded man?

284
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,430
Exertion is essential!
Extremely essential!

285
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,510
But Your Majesty's words that
you never loved another woman,

286
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,580
are a lie, aren't they?

287
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,800
A lie?

288
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,720
Who are you saying I loved?

289
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,100
Every night Shaman Wol
stayed by your side,

290
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,720
you were attracted to her, weren't you?

291
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,360
That's absurd!

292
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,930
It is true that I was confused for a bit.

293
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,500
But that was…

294
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,100
No, wait a moment.

295
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,640
Wol is you, though.

296
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,310
In any case,

297
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,440
it was not I, but Shaman Wol whom you saw,

298
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,510
so you most certainly gave her your heart.

299
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,920
Why are you laughing?

300
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,260
Are you jealous?

301
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,760
Jealous? No, I'm not.

302
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,740
Why do you keep laughing?

303
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,340
You're jealous of yourself!

304
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,310
It's amusing, isn't it?

305
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,810
I told you I'm not,
so why do you continue?

306
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,810
Anyway, I will continue reading,

307
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,930
So, Your Majesty,
look over your petitions.

308
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,340
You're amusing
for being jealous of yourself,

309
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,610
but I fell in love twice
with the same woman, so I'm no better.

310
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,980
The Heo girl is still alive?

311
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,110
How is that even possible?

312
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,340
The child who died and was buried
eight years ago, how can she be al...

313
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,010
Eight years ago,

314
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,820
why did you trust me so much
and order me to cast the curse?

315
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,890
How would you know who I would curse?

316
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,340
Nok Young, you...

317
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,990
You dared to...

318
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,720
You dared to...

319
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,560
His Majesty probably knows
where they are.

320
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,360
Why do you say that His Majesty
knows where they are?

321
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,960
Shaman Jang, after receiving
His Majesty's order to enter the palace,

322
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,560
and the Heo girl, after arriving
at the sick ward, have not been seen.

323
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,860
What do you think this signifies?

324
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,470
The two are definitely
hidden somewhere by His Majesty.

325
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,220
But, after uncovering the truth,

326
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,940
he has done nothing.

327
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,950
Doesn't this mean that he plans
to cover up what he uncovered?

328
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,920
It is possible that he is waiting
for the right time.

329
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,660
Either that,

330
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,830
or it is possible that he has not yet
learned of the final truth.

331
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,230
Whichever one is true,

332
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,530
we must quickly find those two people,
and kill them.

333
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,570
Even if His Majesty has figured out
what happened eight years ago,

334
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,400
if the two people who could verify
the truth are no longer in this world,

335
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,580
the truth will be buried forever.

336
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,300
Inform His Majesty.

337
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,180
Your Majesty!

338
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:58,990
The Queen Dowager has come!

339
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:08,830
Your Majesty!

340
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,660
-The Queen Dowager...
-Hurry and open the doors.

341
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,680
It's like exercising.

342
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,710
Grandmother, what brings you here?

343
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,110
I came because I have something
to say to you, Your Majesty.

344
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,500
Why didn't you summon me?

345
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,530
Your Majesty.

346
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,900
Yes, Grandmother.

347
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,930
In the past, I saved the life
of Shaman Wol,

348
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,530
who was in contempt of court.
You do remember, don't you?

349
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,700
How can I forget?

350
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,200
I remember.

351
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:29,760
Then, in return,
you promised to grant me one favor.

352
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,670
You remember that as well, don't you?

353
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,710
Why would I forget?

354
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:43,290
Today I have come to ask you that favor.

355
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,580
Tell me what it is.

356
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,920
Find the Seongsucheong's
High Shaman Jang,

357
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,410
and her successor.

358
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,070
And please give them to me.

359
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:08,050
Why are you looking for them through me?

360
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,460
That is because
Your Majesty is hiding them.

361
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,730
What makes you think that?

362
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,560
What reason would I have for hiding...

363
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,200
You are reinvestigating the matter
of eight years ago.

364
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,870
Please stop it.

365
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,840
Let the matter rest.

366
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,910
Eight years ago,
do you remember what I told you?

367
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,280
Do not do anything.

368
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,620
Comply with the rules.

369
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,810
When the former king let matters rest,

370
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,850
it was because there was a good reason.

371
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:00,300
What exactly are you trying to hide?

372
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,160
What else...

373
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,940
I must be hiding what you are looking for.

374
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,680
Why are you hiding it?

375
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,390
It is all for Your Majesty.

376
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,670
To be more precise,

377
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:23,990
it is to protect Your Majesty,
and the people you care for.

378
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,800
If it is people I care for,

379
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,530
who are you referring to?

380
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,940
That is something you would know.

381
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,910
Think about it carefully.

382
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,980
Who does Your Majesty
want to protect the most?

383
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,420
Now,

384
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,330
Will you give me a reply to my request?

385
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,920
Why aren't you answering?

386
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,510
Your words are as good as gold.

387
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,900
You told me yourself.

388
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,660
Of course.

389
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,610
I will grant your request.

390
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,660
But it will take some time to find them.

391
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,640
But if you trust me and wait,

392
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,500
I will let you meet them.

393
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,030
So rest assured.

394
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,620
But, that will be in a court of law.

395
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,840
With witnesses and the victim.

396
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,320
And, you will be the accused.

397
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,470
Brother.

398
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,200
I have an order to reinvestigate
the Crown Princess' death.

399
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,340
Yeon Woo is on the verge of death.

400
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,440
How can you have your son
evade this calamity?

401
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,650
If I can not even protect my sister,

402
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,110
how can I help the Crown Prince?

403
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,470
Yeon Woo.

404
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,150
Who is that, stealing a glance of me?

405
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,000
If you do not show yourself,
I will call someone.

406
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,890
Who are you?

407
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,770
I am your servant. Seol, Young Master.

408
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,580
Seol?

409
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:37,490
Oh! You're the child who attended
to Yeon Woo, aren't you?

410
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,220
Yes. That is correct, Young Master.

411
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:46,260
But, instead of using the front door,
why are you sneaking in like a cat?

412
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:54,290
I just was passing by
and remembered the past…

413
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,540
The time is also late.

414
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,740
That's true.
How have you been all this time?

415
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:06,260
I have met a good master,

416
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,950
and am living well, Young Master.

417
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,920
Since you no longer work for us,
I am no longer your Young Master.

418
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,000
But in my heart,
you will always be the Young Master.

419
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,610
Like when you gave me the name Seol.

420
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,360
Just like then.

421
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,860
What is wrong?

422
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,320
Do you have something you want to tell me?

423
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,670
Yeom, what are you doing there?

424
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,900
Yes, Mother.

425
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,540
The girl who attended to Yeon Woo…

426
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,590
I thought I heard you talking to someone.

427
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,090
Was someone here?

428
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,430
It is nothing.

429
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,500
But, Mother, why did you come out?

430
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,470
Ever since returning
from your father's grave,

431
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,000
the Princess has been sick
for several days already.

432
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:08,310
I think I'll bring her to the palace
tomorrow and have her see the physician.

433
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,710
What do you think, Yeom?

434
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:13,580
Then, I will accompany her.

435
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,150
No.

436
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,020
It has been a long time since
I have seen the Queen Dowager,

437
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,020
so I will go.

438
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,520
Yes, then please do so.

439
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,860
I am on my way to see the Princess.

440
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,030
Will you go with me?

441
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,020
Yes, Mother. I will accompany you.

442
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,180
When the former king let matters rest,

443
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,200
it was because there was a good reason.

444
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,400
It is all for Your Majesty.

445
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,870
To be more precise,

446
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,700
it is to protect Your Majesty,

447
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,190
and the people you care for.

448
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,550
Your Majesty.

449
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,790
Your Majesty.

450
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,800
I'm sorry.

451
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,010
I was thinking.

452
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,600
It is very late.

453
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,660
You should go to sleep.

454
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,090
Then, what about you?

455
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,460
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

456
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,120
Because Your Majesty is unable to sleep.

457
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:51,750
I'm sorry for keeping you confined
in such a small, stuffy room all day...

458
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,710
...I am by your side.

459
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,930
If it is your side,

460
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,790
even if it weren't a secret room,

461
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,220
but hell, I would still not refuse.

462
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,820
Come out.

463
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,180
Let's take advantage of the dark
and go for a walk.

464
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,340
When I last saw you
at the Hidden Moon Pavilion,

465
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,390
why didn't you tell me
that you had regained your memory?

466
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,030
Why did you hide it?

467
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,100
If only you had told me then.

468
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,490
I could not bring myself to interfere.

469
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,950
Your Majesty already has
the Queen by your side.

470
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,260
What is wrong?

471
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,390
Your Highness,
did you have another nightmare?

472
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,410
Isn't it weird?

473
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,340
What are you referring to?

474
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,340
I don't know since when,

475
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,080
but I no longer hear
the cries at the Hidden Moon Pavilion.

476
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,850
That is because the Seongsucheong shamans
are using talismans,

477
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,320
so the spirit has probably disappeared.

478
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,400
No. That's not it.

479
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,600
The owner of Hidden Moon Pavilion...

480
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,970
Gyo Tae Palace's owner is back!

481
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,600
Your Highness.

482
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,710
Heo Yeon Woo, that child,

483
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,910
is somewhere in this palace.

484
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,350
Your Highness,
you must control your feelings.

485
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,010
My father.

486
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,840
Tell my father to get rid
of that child immediately!

487
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,000
No, that's not it.

488
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,190
If my father saw me like this,

489
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,010
he would surely be disappointed.

490
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,070
Court Lady Jo.

491
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,620
Bring the attendant we used as a spy
in the King's Palace.

492
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,820
What?

493
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,960
At this late hour?

494
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,480
What are you waiting for?

495
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,530
I told you to bring her here right now.

496
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,270
When I, who am supposed to be dead,

497
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,380
reappear as a living person,

498
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,250
I know well there will be chaos
for the royal family and the court.

499
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,050
On top of that,

500
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,420
I was foolish for not recognizing
Your Majesty right away.

501
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,260
How could I just boldly tell you
who I was?

502
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,130
What are you talking about?

503
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,640
The misery that you have suffered
is all my fault.

504
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:41,410
When you endured the horror
of great pain and death,

505
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,280
I was powerless to do anything,
so it is my fault.

506
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,970
That is incorrect.

507
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,780
For eight long years,
you have not forgotten me.

508
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,600
I have no regrets.

509
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,630
So,

510
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,270
for the rest of my life,

511
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:05,260
if by any chance Your Majesty forgets me,

512
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,160
I will remember you even more.

513
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,180
And miss you more.

514
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:24,150
I will never forget you.

515
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,470
The people who made you suffer so much...

516
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,090
...will pay for their misdeeds...

517
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,000
...and I shall clear
those who are innocent,

518
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,360
and return everything to where it belongs.

519
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,610
Your Majesty.

520
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,360
What happened in the past,

521
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,250
must be buried in the past.

522
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:55,280
When the former king let matters rest,

523
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,620
it was for a good reason.

524
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,620
"I believe you."

525
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,760
"I believe you will uncover the truth."

526
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,730
Aren't you the one
who comforted me by saying that?

527
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,730
But why?

528
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,800
I do believe in Your Majesty.

529
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,910
But,

530
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,640
I fear the truth will hurt you.

531
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,950
Just being by your side,

532
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,620
there is nothing more I want. So...

533
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:37,790
...do you like being in a room
with no sunlight that much?

534
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,820
I am by the sun...

535
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,290
...so I do not need another light.

536
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,820
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

537
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,120
This is...

538
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,880
This is where politics starts
in this country.

539
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:26,450
Here, I listen to the citizens' matters,

540
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:29,840
and decide what must be done for them.

541
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,350
Why bring someone like me
to a sacred place like this?

542
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,250
The day I first met you,

543
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,330
you taught me about
the unjust laws of this country,

544
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,080
and how the king
must conduct himself with morality.

545
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,560
That was because I was young and naïve.

546
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,130
When you look with the eyes of a child,

547
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:55,750
the entire world can become a problem,

548
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,970
or become the answer.

549
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,230
Your brother,

550
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,710
who was also my teacher,
the Prince Consort,

551
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,790
taught me that in our first lesson.

552
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,750
So, if it was unreasonable
in the eyes of a child,

553
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,560
then clearly there was a problem.

554
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,300
So as the king,
whenever I have to make a decision.

555
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,350
I think, if I were you or my teacher...

556
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,110
...what would you have recommended?

557
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,180
That is what I used to think.

558
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,340
Do you see that?

559
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,660
When I was the Crown Prince,

560
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:04,070
I ordered an artisan to make a hairpin
based on celestial meanings,

561
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,010
and he made one for me.

562
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,500
I wanted to give it to you.

563
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,370
To ask you to be my moon...

564
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:23,860
...as a sign of my love
when I asked you to marry me.

565
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,710
This phoenix hairpin
was originally a pair.

566
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,540
One of them...

567
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,440
...I gave to you.

568
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,040
The remaining one,

569
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,210
I planned to give it to you here...

570
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:04,240
...on the day you became
my Crown Princess.

571
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,130
Your Majesty.

572
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,240
I had someone bring your belongings
at the sick ward here.

573
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,570
Finally...

574
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,300
...the two become one.
