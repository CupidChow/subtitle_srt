1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,270
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,340
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,560
Episode 7

4
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,500
You may return now.

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm barely resisting the temptation
to go with you,

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,510
so please let me see you off at least.

7
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,140
Why are you doing this?

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,840
If, while I'm gone,
strangers come looking for you,

9
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,420
you must avoid them.

10
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,240
Are there any guests
coming to our home today?

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,370
You may never let someone
into your heart...

12
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,320
...nor may you have any relationship
with that person.

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,570
Do you understand?

14
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,230
The boat is coming. The boat!

15
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,160
Did you sleep well?

16
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,640
Despite the rocky journey,
you managed to sleep soundly.

17
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,650
Is it market day today?

18
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,220
Why are there so many people?

19
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,940
What?

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,110
You mean you came without knowing?

21
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,690
Today, at this village,
His Majesty will be visiting.

22
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,310
These people came
to catch a glimpse of His Majesty.

23
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,540
If you came without knowing,
it's your lucky day.

24
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,680
You have good luck. Good luck.

25
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,930
Yeon Woo...

26
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,810
...you are trying to make
His Majesty and I meet, aren't you?

27
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,480
When you arrive there,
please send my regards to the monk.

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,660
Seol, you must take her
and go home immediately.

29
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,310
I'm about to get a scab on my ears.

30
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,120
If you can't trust me that much,

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,480
leave her and take me instead.

32
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,310
Her mouth worries me more
than your obstinacy, that is why.

33
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,800
There's nothing to be envious of.

34
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,010
Since the nagger isn't here,

35
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,990
shall we have a bowl of soup
before we go back?

36
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,760
This is no ordinary tent permit!

37
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,230
The permit you've been waiting for
has finally come.

38
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:46,020
The opportunity to see His Majesty
up close is in this tent permit.

39
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,190
Oh, no you can't.

40
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,760
Watch His Majesty's royal procession
from a comfortable place,

41
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,130
this is an excellent chance.

42
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,180
You cannot.

43
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,890
We really cannot.

44
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,540
Now, let's see.

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,980
Oh, you have an ugly face.

46
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,050
No, we mustn't.
Let's pretend this didn't happen.

47
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,190
Seol...

48
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,220
-Where are you going?
-Forget it.

49
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,050
Take this.

50
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,180
I gave one away.

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,890
Don't worry. Just trust me and...

52
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,330
Hey! There's news that His Majesty

53
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,290
has just reached the entrance
of the village!

54
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,120
-Give me one.
-Give me one.

55
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,770
It seems like we have come close
to the village, so raise the blinds.

56
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,690
The weather is chilly, so I suggest we...

57
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,590
I said to lift it.

58
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,190
Stop.

59
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,100
Set down the palanquin.

60
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,860
Despite the cold,
they have come to see me,

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,840
so how can I disappoint the citizens?

62
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,810
Then, making your expression bright

63
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,180
or showing our people
a benevolent smile...

64
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,800
Was Xi Shi of the State of Yue
a beauty for the ages thanks to a smile?

65
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,770
True beauty cannot be diminished
even by a frown.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,810
Do you think it's easy to be the king
and have my looks?

67
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,010
Do you plan on wasting the day here?
Pick up the pace!

68
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,200
Lift the palanquin.

69
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,500
As we promised, just a glimpse.

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,170
We'll take a glimpse and go.

71
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,540
I said okay.

72
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,860
Yes. Yes. Go in.

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,630
Yes, that way.

74
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,530
We live in the neighbouring village.

75
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,670
My child really wants to see
the procession of His Majesty.

76
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not possible. Go back. Next.

77
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,670
-Officer, just this once.
-This woman!

78
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,520
If you want to see
His Majesty's procession,

79
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,480
at least put one some silk clothes!

80
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,570
Rejected.

81
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,270
Officer, still just this once!

82
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,820
This woman really!

83
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,280
Aren't you being too harsh
to a weak woman?

84
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,480
What?

85
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,150
Poor and low-class people
don't have the right to see His Majesty?

86
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,650
Where is there such a rule?

87
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,190
Listen to this wench...

88
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,770
Who are you?

89
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,520
Let's hear it, who are you?

90
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,830
I'm a shaman.

91
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,130
A lowly shaman

92
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,990
dares to stare and talk back?
I ought to just...

93
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,810
Before I cut off this hand, put it down.

94
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,150
And what is this?

95
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,670
What are you, her pimp?

96
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,910
You look just like a girl...

97
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,550
Why? Do you like making money
off of a shaman that much?

98
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,740
Is it that great?

99
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,960
Do you want me to tell you
the reason your wife left you?

100
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,010
What?

101
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,410
It's exactly because
you tend to hit before you talk.

102
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,070
Whenever you drink, you hit your wife...

103
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,260
...so you deserve that
she ran away with a young man.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,920
Hey!

105
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,180
Your wife cheated on you,
so she left home?

106
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,330
-Didn't she go to her parents' home?
-Who said she cheated!

107
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,260
You shut your mouth!

108
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,560
Whenever you eat,
you burn inside and feel sick, right?

109
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,920
At least drinking eases the pain
ever so slightly,

110
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,430
so you make drinking
your only meal of the day.

111
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,350
But that habit has gotten
to your stomach already,

112
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,250
so if you don't stop drinking
immediately...

113
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,790
...you will perish before your time comes.

114
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,640
At most, you have a year.

115
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,210
You wench!

116
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,280
Let it go.

117
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,960
Nothing good will come
of provoking a shaman.

118
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,920
What if she curses you with her magic?

119
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,150
Hey, you there! Do you want to die?

120
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,990
Stand there! Stand there! Stop!

121
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,280
Quickly, go in.

122
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,600
Milady, how can you pretend
to be a shaman again?

123
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,070
Didn't the master tell you
not to do that again?

124
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,520
I just did what I, a shaman,
is supposed to do,

125
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,970
so what would be the problem?

126
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,880
Pretending to have powers
you do not possess is a fraud!

127
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,130
But, wait.

128
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,470
If you have no powers,
how did you know about his wife?

129
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,050
That's not spiritual powers,
but power of deduction.

130
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,060
What?

131
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Even though it's broad daylight,
he reeked of alcohol.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,240
On top of that,
his nose was red from the alcohol,

133
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,480
so he must be a severe alcoholic.

134
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,790
He was aggressive even though
the situation hardly warranted it,

135
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,260
and from the fact
that he is quick to hit a woman,

136
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,150
you can guess that his drunk habit
is horrid as well.

137
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,560
He probably wasn't any different at home.

138
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,750
But that doesn't necessarily imply
that his wife would leave him.

139
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,100
I saw that a woman has not tended to him.

140
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,010
The holes on his clothes were big,
but not mended.

141
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,350
Most importantly,
when he saw a fine and pretty young man,

142
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,460
he seemed overly sensitive.

143
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,910
A man?

144
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,610
Do you mean me?

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,150
So, his wife positively ran away
with a young man.

146
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,870
Seeing as he is still very angry,
it hasn't been too long.

147
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,790
Then, what was his illness about?

148
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
It's obvious.

149
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,510
He's already an alcoholic,

150
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,360
so how much more would he have drunk
because of his wife?

151
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,870
His mouth had a peculiar smell

152
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,930
so it's proof
that his stomach illness is advanced.

153
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,390
With your power of deduction,
you should open up a fortune teller stand.

154
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,560
But, why were you so severe
with your words,

155
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,960
it wasn't like you.

156
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,590
Whenever there's a problem,
he tries to beat people,

157
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,300
so he brought it upon himself.

158
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,250
Although he is in a pitiful situation,

159
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,170
he has to get a severe scolding
to come to his senses.

160
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,400
Think how much his wife was beaten
to run away in the middle of the night.

161
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,260
Don't run. Stop there!

162
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,080
Stop there. Grab him!

163
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,470
Grab him!

164
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,460
Hold on. Let's talk after you let me go.

165
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,620
Come here.

166
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,640
Hold on.

167
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,470
What a temper!

168
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,990
Let's talk. Talk.

169
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,480
His Majesty is approaching.

170
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,090
I'll see you later.

171
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,250
Let's go.

172
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,670
Stop already and pay your respects.

173
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,970
Milady!

174
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,430
Milady!

175
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,090
Milady! Milady!

176
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,020
Grab them!

177
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,500
Stop!

178
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,320
-Seize him!
-Stop!

179
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,710
Move away!

180
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,900
Seize them!

181
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,870
What is going on?

182
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,170
It seems a woman stood out of the queue
and caused a riot.

183
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,210
-A woman?
-Yes.

184
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,400
In case that there might be ill will
against you, the guards are chasing her.

185
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,390
So I will bring down the curtain.

186
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,200
Seize them!

187
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,410
Seize them!

188
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,720
Quickly!

189
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,730
Quickly, after them!

190
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,760
-Seize them.
-Seize them.

191
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,110
Chase after them.

192
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,600
Chase them!

193
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,480
Milady, are you insane?

194
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,170
How can you stand
and look His Majesty directly in the face?

195
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,370
Seol.

196
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,200
What is it?

197
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,670
Like you and I were chased today...

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,120
...have we been chased like this before?

199
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,180
If we had already experienced this,

200
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,680
do you think we would still be alive?

201
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,480
Then...

202
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,790
...whose memories are these?

203
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,150
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,880
I mistook you for someone else.

205
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,190
What was I expecting?

206
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,300
She's already dead and buried
under the dirt.

207
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,740
Why are you acting like this,
Your Highness?

208
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,400
Is the water's temperature
not to your liking?

209
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,750
Is the fragrance not to your liking?

210
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,160
If that is also not it...

211
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,530
It irritates me.

212
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,530
What?

213
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,290
It really irritates me.

214
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,480
Not you, Hyung Sun.

215
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,610
Then, what is to your dissatisfaction?

216
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,410
Silk clothes.

217
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,610
Silk shoes.

218
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,450
Shiny faces.

219
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,880
What?

220
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,220
Everyone was dressed so elegantly.

221
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,650
You could not see a trace
of a crude person on the streets.

222
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,360
Even the animals we passed by
had glossy coats.

223
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,890
What a peaceful and prosperous nation.

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,210
I am definitely a sage king.

225
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,670
That's because they were just trying
to show Your Majesty the best...

226
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,700
Do you think I came all the way
to Onyang to see that?

227
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,480
Your Highness,
you have come to recuperate.

228
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,410
Try to forget
about government issues for a...

229
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,640
Woon.

230
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,080
At your commands.

231
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,330
I feel much better
after bathing in hot water.

232
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,820
You must be tired after the long journey.

233
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,130
Do you want to join me?

234
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,680
Ginseng!

235
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,260
Go and bring more ginseng and herbs
to put into the tub.

236
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,220
Your Highness, there are already rumours
going around at the palace,

237
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,330
so how can you joke like this?

238
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,380
Rumours?

239
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,530
What rumours?

240
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,030
You keep the Queen far away

241
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,760
and keep Woon close to you,
so you must like men...

242
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,080
Men...

243
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,430
Men among men?

244
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,170
No matter what the rumours are,

245
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,140
please don't joke about Woon
in such a way again.

246
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,770
Then...

247
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,740
...Hyung Sun, do you want to come in?

248
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,380
Herbs...

249
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,690
I will go check if the herbs are ready.

250
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,040
Finally...

251
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,920
...we're alone.

252
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,950
It can't be true. It can't be.

253
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,230
It can't be. I have served His Majesty
for so many years!

254
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,180
Then, did his preference change?

255
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,790
Oh, my.

256
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,400
My heart is pounding, my legs
are trembling. What is the reason?

257
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,830
I don't know what to say.

258
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,280
Do you have to use the restroom?

259
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,390
Why are you as nervous as a pup
who has left its mother?

260
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,010
Your Highness!

261
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,650
Your Majesty.

262
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,000
Prince Yang Myung wishes to see you.

263
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,620
Your Highness.

264
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,910
Your Majesty.

265
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,540
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

266
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,530
What is wrong?

267
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,950
I can hear Hyung Sun's piercing screams
all the way here.

268
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,870
The scene from the procession
and this one...

269
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,500
...are starkly different.

270
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,060
Please give me some money.

271
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,810
Please give me some money.

272
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,790
My Lord, please give me some money.

273
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Please give me some money.

274
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,680
My Lord, please.

275
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,030
I'm sorry, my Lord. I'm sorry.

276
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,690
Where are you going in such a hurry?

277
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,930
My sister is home alone,

278
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,650
so I was taking this to her.

279
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,450
Do you have no parents?

280
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,380
My mother passed away two years ago
because of the plague

281
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,270
and my father was forcibly taken
to work at Boyong Pavilion a month ago.

282
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,990
But I don't know what happened after that.

283
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,330
Are you sure it's the Boyong Pavilion?

284
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,090
What is your father's name?

285
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,020
Talk of Pi Han Dol of Yangigol in Onyang
and everyone will know.

286
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,710
I will find your father
and send him home for sure,

287
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,210
so until then,
take good care of your sister.

288
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,360
Look at you... You don't trust me?

289
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,230
Even though I look like this,
I hold a pretty high position.

290
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,260
Thank you, my Lord. Thank you.

291
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,140
-Your Majesty.
-What is it?

292
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,310
There's a spy.

293
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,710
I know.

294
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,300
He's probably a present
from the Chief Councilor.

295
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,940
Woon.

296
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Yes, Your Highness.

297
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,090
He put in a lot of effort
following us this far...

298
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,650
...so shall we play with him?

299
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,470
He seems to have lost us.

300
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,760
I wonder what he is going to say
to His Excellency.

301
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,440
Are they secretly training troops?

302
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,040
Or maybe gathering followers
for a political ploy?

303
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,730
They're probably dying from anxiety.

304
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,690
I believe it will be better
if we stop our patrolling here.

305
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,700
Yes.

306
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,950
I believe so too.

307
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,220
It's Yeon Woo.

308
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,480
Yeon Woo will come down.

309
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,170
Your Highness!

310
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,390
Your Highness!

311
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,080
If two people are destined to meet,

312
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,980
they will meet eventually.

313
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,960
There is no stronger magic than longing.

314
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,390
Is that why you called me here today
when His Majesty was visiting our village?

315
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,290
His Majesty's illness is serious.

316
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,290
The person who is supposed to protect him
is living another life,

317
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,880
so there is no improvement in his health.

318
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,570
Are you thinking of having the two
fulfil their destinies?

319
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,890
It's not something a person can do.

320
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,540
The heavens control this.

321
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,360
It's a destiny that cannot be averted
even if you tried.

322
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,410
You know that well, don't you?

323
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,650
Their fate has ended once already.

324
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,220
You could not end their longing.

325
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,980
Milady has lost her memories of her past.

326
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,660
So, she harbours no longing in her heart.

327
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,510
Those memories will return one day.

328
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,090
This will lead to bloodshed.

329
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,270
It's an inverse act of fate...

330
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,340
...so the price has to be paid.

331
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,080
She will fall again into a cruel fate.

332
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,770
How can we make her
go through that pain twice?

333
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,990
Milady...

334
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,180
...what are you thinking about?

335
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,800
Seol.

336
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,020
I figured it out.

337
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,650
What?

338
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,660
What did you figure out?

339
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,860
The owner of the memories from before.

340
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,170
Those are his memories.

341
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,900
What?

342
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,570
I was able to sense his memories and pain.

343
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,560
Don't you get it?

344
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,720
I now have spiritual powers.

345
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,060
Now, I have become a real shaman.

346
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,190
Milady.

347
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,050
To say that it was all spiritual power
is a bit...

348
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,990
Where are you going?

349
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,290
The mistress is taking too long,

350
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,810
I have to go out and see.

351
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,410
Let's go together, Milady.

352
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,780
It seems we've lost our way
because of the thick fog.

353
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,870
We've been walking around in circles.

354
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,240
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,010
What do you have to be sorry for?

356
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,080
It's because of my vision that we're lost.

357
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,460
Isn't that the moon?

358
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,310
I have been waiting for you.

359
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,230
Why are you coming only now?

360
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,040
Milady, do you not know
who those people are?

361
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,200
It seems as if
they were taking a private walk,

362
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,690
so let's pretend we don't know.

363
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,160
Then, you brought them here
knowing who they were?

364
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,800
They were obviously lost,
should I have just ignored them?

365
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,610
You were told to avoid strangers
by the mistress.

366
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,230
She never said to chase away people
who needed help.

367
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,470
The alcohol will help melt away the cold.

368
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,980
Because there is only one owner
to this house,

369
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,120
I could not prepare another for you.

370
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,500
Please forgive me.

371
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,180
Though it is a humble home,

372
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,670
please rest before you are on your way.

373
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,100
Who is the original owner of this table?

374
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,270
In the rain...

375
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,540
...who were you waiting for?

376
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,310
Is there...

377
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,960
...someone you are waiting for?

378
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,550
The mistress.

379
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,640
I was waiting for the mistress
who has gone out.

380
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,000
If you have nothing further to ask...

381
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,340
Did you say you were a shaman?

382
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,640
That is correct.

383
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,610
Is this really what a room
of a shaman looks like?

384
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,160
Or do you have unusual hobbies?

385
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,890
Are all the books on the shelves yours?

386
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,410
That is correct.

387
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,360
A shaman who reads the Classics.

388
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,980
It is definitely a noble hobby,

389
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,960
but what would a shaman
read Confucian classics for?

390
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,570
It is just to understand the world
a little better.

391
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,210
That's why I read them.

392
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,640
You read to understand the world better?

393
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,830
Even if you understand the world,
what is it to you?

394
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,460
Although I am just a shaman,

395
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,440
I do not read for personal interests,

396
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,600
but to help others.

397
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,820
Also, by reading the words
of ancient sages,

398
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,670
I try to understand the joys of the world.

399
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,730
I cannot stop.

400
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,430
A noble man does not resent the heavens

401
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,000
and does not blame the people.

402
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,260
You read the Analects?

403
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,320
A farmer does not blame the fields.

404
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,350
A musician does not blame his instruments.

405
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,560
This cannot be.

406
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,960
There's no way
for a dead girl to be alive.

407
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,890
She is just someone who resembles her.

408
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

409
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,570
This is a dream.

410
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,820
It's an illusion.

411
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,530
My dream has become reality
and is deceiving me.

412
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,820
Have a drink as well.

413
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,890
It's all right, so drink.

414
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,880
Didn't you get in the rain as well?

415
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,900
You are really disloyal.

416
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,810
You don't know who I am

417
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,580
or what I may have put into the wine,

418
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,510
so why do you refuse to taste it?

419
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,140
Are you only going
to escort him with your sword?

420
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,570
How did you know?

421
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,840
What are you talking about?

422
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,540
How do you know that
I am the king of this country?

423
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,950
Even if only as a spirit...

424
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,230
...did you want to see His Majesty?

425
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,900
Even though you did not come back
to see me...

426
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,680
...it was good to see you.

427
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
However, in the next life, please...

428
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,530
...look at me first.

429
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,500
Have you met me before?

430
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,640
I am just an ordinary shaman.

431
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,730
There's no way for our paths
to have crossed.

432
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,910
That's a lie.

433
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,120
How could I dare to lie to Your Majesty?

434
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,880
Then, are you really only a shaman?

435
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,530
Ever since being bestowed
spiritual powers when I was little,

436
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,380
I have lived as a shaman.

437
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,100
If you don't call a person bestowed
with spiritual powers a shaman,

438
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,800
then what else would you call her?

439
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,320
Then how did you know
that I was the King of this country?

440
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,670
That's because...

441
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,080
Tell me immediately!

442
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,580
Please forgive me...

443
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,620
...but I saw Your Majesty
earlier on your procession.

444
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,430
Woon.

445
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,380
At your commands.

446
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,080
The rain has stopped.

447
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,790
It is time for us to go back.

448
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,960
What is your name?

449
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,460
I'm sorry, but I do not have a name.

450
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,320
Even if you're a shaman, do you mean
to tell me you have no name?

451
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,710
Because she did not want me
to be bound by fate,

452
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,950
the mistress did not give me a name.

453
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,400
People just call me "lady."

454
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,720
She did not want you to be bound by fate,
so you were not given a name.

455
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,500
This brief encounter is fate as well.

456
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,030
I will name you Wol.

457
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,600
For your warm drink...

458
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,360
...think of that as my repayment.

459
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,840
Wol.

460
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,220
Did you hear?

461
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,460
I now have a name, too.

462
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,360
Your Majesty, how can you do this?

463
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,050
Do you want to see me dead and...

464
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,410
I do not want to see you die,

465
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,180
so there is no need to say
anything anymore.

466
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,530
Is that what you call
protecting His Majesty...

467
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,970
He protected me well...

468
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,730
...which is why I returned safely.

469
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,210
Have you been well all these years?

470
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,000
Why are you here?

471
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,520
After being gone for years...

472
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,640
...you are asking about my well-being?

473
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,380
You are still very good-looking.

474
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,580
Woon, I told you to come here
and sit as well.

475
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,630
Please pay no heed to me.

476
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,000
Just give up.

477
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,570
While working, he is someone
who will not touch a drop of alcohol.

478
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,670
Then,

479
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,390
do you want to make a bet with me?

480
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,290
A bet?

481
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,830
The person who makes Woon drink first
will hear the other's wish.

482
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,280
Did you hear?

483
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,200
Before I get angry, come here and sit.

484
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,180
After I receive gold and treasures
from His Majesty...

485
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,820
...I will give you half.

486
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,820
Look at him.

487
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,390
There is definitely nothing cute
about him.

488
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,960
-Woon.
-At your commands.

489
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,060
Come and drink.

490
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,690
It's an order.

491
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,620
Hyungnim.

492
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,700
Yes, I lost.

493
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,440
I will do anything you ask of me.

494
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,560
Do you still...

495
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,930
...keep that child in your heart?

496
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,760
Please answer me.

497
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,010
Your Majesty.

498
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,910
Didn't you lose the bet?

499
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,400
I am asking for your answer right now.

500
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,720
Even if I still have her in my heart...

501
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,010
...isn't she already dead?

502
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,540
You know how the soul works.

503
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,110
Say you forgot, and you miss her.
Say you miss her, and yet you forget.

504
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,900
I do not want to forget or miss her.

505
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,500
I just remember
that she is not in this world.

506
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,540
That's all I keep in my heart.

507
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,650
Only remember that
she is not in this world.

508
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,940
I see.

509
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,750
While I was out of the palace,
the ministers have worked hard.

510
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,820
Especially our Minister of Finance.

511
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,350
Inadequate as we may be,
in order to lessen Your Majesty's work,

512
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,520
we have spent sleepless nights
handling state matters in your stead.

513
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,020
Well said.

514
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,330
It's inadequate. It is very inadequate.

515
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,860
Why didn't you just sleep?

516
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,580
Especially this part,

517
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,750
about the construction of Boyong Pavilion.

518
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,870
No less than 3000 sacks of charcoal
had already been added to the lot,

519
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,420
and yet you ask the levies for next year
this much in advance?

520
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,410
Do you expect people
to just die for your sake?

521
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,620
Although it may be hard now,

522
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,000
the construction
is such an urgent matter...

523
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,250
What is so urgent about it?

524
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,660
It is a pavilion that the Queen Dowager
really cherishes.

525
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,630
If we were able to match
her birthday next year,

526
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,630
by shortening construction time
as much as possible...

527
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,030
So the birthday present matters more
than the lives of our people?

528
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,120
This matter has already
been permitted by Your Majesty.

529
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,300
I did.

530
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,740
But it wasn't to force hard labour
under the freezing cold upon our people.

531
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,180
"Summon every last one
down to fathers of starving children."

532
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,060
Did I ever give such an order?

533
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,610
But Your Majesty,

534
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,700
the size of the construction is large,
so manpower...

535
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,390
What I'm most curious about...

536
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,890
...is what was all that charcoal used for?

537
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,850
There are more than two hundred people
working on this project,

538
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,630
but where have all those people gone to?

539
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,890
That's what I'm asking.

540
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,170
Before leaving this hall,

541
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,490
compile a list of names
of the construction workers,

542
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,750
the progress of the construction
and funding details

543
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,920
as detailed as possible,
and submit it to me.

544
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,420
After I meticulously review it...

545
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,480
...I will seek who is responsible
tomorrow.

546
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,740
Did you ask for me?

547
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:21,020
How many years has it been
since you have returned to Seongsucheong?

548
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,960
What?

549
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,470
I'm asking how many years it has been

550
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,080
since you have taken over for shaman Jang.

551
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,970
Next year will be my eighth.

552
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,630
In due time, I was considering

553
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,700
making you Head Shaman
of the Seongsucheong.

554
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,550
I will not forget
Your Excellency's generosity.

555
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,010
Whatever order it is, just say the word.

556
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,230
But,

557
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:55,320
it seems like you're not worried
about His Highness's health at all.

558
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,120
I was told that
he is now in good health...

559
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,490
Am I wrong?

560
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,390
That is why I am worried.

561
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,810
When he needs to be healthy, he is ill.

562
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,360
When he needs to be ill, he is healthy.

563
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,350
While the king was away from the palace,

564
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,150
I buried a talisman there.

565
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,740
When you give the order,

566
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,420
you will be able to see immediate effects.

567
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:32,480
Thinking that tomorrow
I will witness his ailments reappear...

568
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,390
...I have already started to fret.

569
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,380
I am just an ordinary shaman.

570
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,850
There's no way for our paths
to have crossed.

571
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,250
Your Majesty, it is Hyung Sun.

572
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,520
Come in.

573
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,140
Your Majesty,

574
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,360
Her Majesty the Queen seeks audience.

575
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,610
Have you already forgotten my order
not to let anyone in?

576
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,770
Your Majesty, please.

577
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,670
Your Majesty!

578
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,990
Let her in.

579
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,440
Escort her in. Quickly.

580
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,380
Welcome, Queen.

581
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,750
Are you well?

582
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,480
As you can see, I am perfectly well.

583
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,520
What brings you here so late?

584
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,870
What did you just say?

585
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,590
I told you to take a royal concubine.

586
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,280
You wish to be a strong monarch,
more than anyone.

587
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,250
A king without a successor

588
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,450
is just the same
as building a home on sand.

589
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,090
Please have an heir
and solidify your legacy.

590
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Queen.

591
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:55,760
I simply am no longer able
to face Their Highnesses.

592
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,730
It does not matter if it's a concubine.

593
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,440
Take a royal concubine and have an heir.

594
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,510
Are you telling the truth?

595
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,910
As the mother of this country,

596
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:13,210
how can I be swayed by personal feelings?

597
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,390
Indeed.

598
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,830
Now I understand why you receive
so much love from everyone.

599
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,600
I didn't see how far-sighted you were.

600
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,670
Because of me, how much
you must have suffered until now?

601
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,310
I'll do as you wish.

602
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,810
Tomorrow at the hall...

603
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,250
...I will talk to the ministers
about a royal concubine.

604
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
Your Majesty.

605
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Queen.

606
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,460
Yes, Sire.

607
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,560
You know...

608
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,370
...I really hate your hypocrisy.

609
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,970
Saying words that you do not mean
to gain sympathy.

610
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,680
I hate your pretense as well.

611
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,580
If you are done talking, go back and rest.

612
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,930
It's very late.

613
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,940
Until when do you plan on keeping
a dead person in your heart?

614
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,010
How can a dead person
capture your heart so much...

615
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,220
...when it should throb
for someone by your side?

616
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,650
Does Your Majesty even see
my affection for you?

617
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,170
How much longer?

618
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,380
How much longer before I have to face
a dead rival for your love?

619
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,510
How much longer does Your Majesty...

620
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,680
...plan to look down on me so much?

621
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,310
Your Majesty!

622
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,460
Your Majesty!

623
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,750
Your Majesty!

624
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:25,870
Your Majesty!

625
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,270
Is anyone out there?

626
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,190
Your Majesty!

627
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,430
Call the physician. Quickly!

628
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,750
-Yes.
-Your Majesty!

629
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,120
Your Majesty!

630
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:51,530
Fortunately, he is stable.

631
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,040
Why is that whenever he is with the Queen
these things occur?

632
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,100
I'm sorry.

633
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,580
Because the Royal Doctor does not know
the cause of the illness,

634
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,240
I was frustrated and without thinking...

635
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,760
If it cannot be cured by a person...

636
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,290
...then we need to entrust it
to the heavens.

637
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,200
When you say the heavens...

638
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,620
We need to bring back Shaman Jang.

639
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,410
The Seongsucheong already
has another state shaman, isn't it?

640
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,610
She is just a temporary head, isn't she?

641
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,310
The fact that the King's health
has gotten to this point

642
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,260
is because she is lacking skills.

643
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,810
In all of Joseon...

644
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,550
...there is no other shaman
who is as powerful as shaman Jang.

645
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:41,560
If it is her, not only will she be able
to cure the King...

646
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,700
...but also dissipate the hatred...

647
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,630
...between His Majesty and the Queen.

648
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,980
Go look for her.

649
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,140
Something about her eyes is bothering me.

650
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,040
Your Majesty.

651
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,510
I'm sure...

652
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:04,910
...she was hiding something from me.

653
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,520
I have to find her,

654
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,390
and confirm with her.

655
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,050
The house is already empty.

656
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,180
Please let it go.

657
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,360
You said you have never seen
that girl before, right?

658
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,660
They look alike.

659
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,840
If she were alive,

660
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,730
she would look exactly like that.

661
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,280
These eyes!

662
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,800
Eyes that are as swollen as chestnuts.

663
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,650
What am I to do with these eyes?

664
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,750
What are you going to do about these eyes?

665
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,960
You did not stop crying
until you fell asleep,

666
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,990
so it's only natural
that they'd be like that.

667
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,010
What were you doing while my eyes
became like this, Court Lady Min?

668
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:35,080
I told you repeatedly to stop,

669
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,360
but it was you
who chose not to listen, Princess.

670
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,840
You should have stopped me.

671
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,550
You should have stopped me even more!

672
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:44,520
You should have stopped me until the end.

673
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,580
I understand.

674
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,960
I committed a crime that deserves death,

675
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,120
so stop looking at this.

676
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,730
It's all over now.

677
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:01,360
What?

678
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,330
If my husband sees this face...

679
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,290
...he will hate it, right?

680
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,900
He will hate me, right?

681
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,880
I will be abandoned, right?

682
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,310
I will be chased out, right?

683
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,880
I will walk in the streets
and get sick and die, right?

684
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:23,660
Princess, your imagination
is out of control.

685
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,340
I never received true love.

686
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,020
I will never get to hold a baby
who resembles my husband.

687
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,060
I will become a pitiful wife who leaves
after guarding this empty room by herself.

688
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:41,940
Please forgive me, husband.

689
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,540
What's wrong, princess?

690
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,450
Why do you keep forgetting
about the date that was set?

691
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,350
Think about it.

692
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,860
As a woman...

693
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,330
...do you think it was easy for her
to bring up sleeping together?

694
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,130
The princess has no eyes but for you,

695
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,140
don't you feel any pity for her?

696
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,640
I'm sorry.

697
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,310
I was reading late at night
and eventually...

698
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,870
How can you be so similar
to your late father?

699
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,850
Perhaps, are you
intentionally avoiding her?

700
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,170
No, I'm not.

701
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:28,370
Then, why do you always
make the princess lonely?

702
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:30,990
The princess is still young...

703
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,530
...and it hasn't been long since
the three years of mourning have passed.

704
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:39,290
That is only because
the Princess' face looks young.

705
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,830
She is already at an age where
she should have a child of her own.

706
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,440
But she is still immature...

707
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,560
She is a woman.

708
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,360
Don't treat her as a younger sister.

709
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,340
You are a married couple.

710
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,120
You are not related as siblings.

711
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,840
For our family...

712
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,420
...she is someone who has done so much.

713
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:07,060
Your father as well,
until the day he died...

714
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,490
...told us to never forget
her kindness to our family.

715
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,630
I will take heed of your advice,

716
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,070
so please do not worry.

717
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,210
Mistress,
I haven't seen Seol since the morning.

718
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,480
I will go out and look for her.

719
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,740
If it's Seol, we know where she will be.

720
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,760
She will come back when it's time,

721
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,090
so don't think
of going out and stay inside.

722
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,010
-Jan Sil.
-What is it?

723
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,670
Take her and go inside...

724
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,170
State Shaman Jang!

725
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,470
Jan Sil, what are you waiting for?

726
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,930
Let us go to the side room.

727
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,890
Mistress, we'll be borrowing
the side room.

728
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:22,070
I had to read directions...

729
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,700
...the astronomy professor
had to read the heavens...

730
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,400
...and after the life science professor
had to fortune tell,

731
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,280
we barely managed to find you.

732
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,050
Do you know how much trouble
it was for us?

733
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,350
Why did you got to such great lengths
to find a nobody like me?

734
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:49,490
We came because of an order
from the Queen Dowager...

735
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:53,300
...concerning your return
to your position at the Seongsucheong.

736
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,160
Isn't the Seongsucheong doing well
with the temporary head shaman?

737
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,950
Doing well, I would not say!

738
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,930
His Majesty's illness is getting worse
as the days go by.

739
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:07,290
As the state shaman, are you just
going to stand on the sidelines?

740
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,210
My skills have already depleted.

741
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:14,570
You are probably turning away
the calling of Heaven.

742
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,560
Recently, the heavens have changed
their course of motion.

743
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,460
Sirius has become dark,
and the moon has become a deep red.

744
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,770
A few days ago, it turned brown.

745
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,630
We urgently need your help.

746
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,090
The Queen Dowager ordered us
to bring you back no matter what.

747
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:36,470
Why else would people forbidden
to leave the palace like us

748
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:40,830
venture out to get you?

749
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:43,450
No matter how many times you tell me,
my answer is the same.

750
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:48,380
I'm disgusted by scholars who try
to eliminate the Seongsucheong...

751
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,950
...I want to rest now.

752
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,760
The girl in the next room...

753
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,940
...is your successor,

754
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,190
the one you registered under your name a
few years ago at the Seongsucheong, right?

755
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,260
I will go see the Queen Dowager
in a few days,

756
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:19,090
and tell her my intentions...

757
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:23,020
...so for today, please go back.

758
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,720
Goodness.

759
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,170
Did she boil a beef tendon and eat it?

760
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:30,160
She is as stubborn as one.

761
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,930
I'm worried about facing
the Queen Dowager with this news.

762
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,740
We can't go back empty-handed
when we have come all the way here.

763
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,900
What?

764
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,170
Hey, you there!

765
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,960
Yes, sir.

766
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,620
If she's not even here...

767
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,020
...where in the world did she go?

768
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,060
Did my spiritual power disappear
in that short time?

769
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,790
Then.

770
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,180
What exactly did I see the other day?

771
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,780
In the past...

772
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,870
...have you met me?

773
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,680
Who are you?

774
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,230
Let's go.

775
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,640
Whose memories are these?
