1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,240
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,340
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,030
Episode 9

4
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,150
Who are you?

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,430
Who would be so daring as to come here?

6
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,470
Speak! Who are you?

7
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,610
Bring in the candles!

8
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,940
What are you doing?

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,450
Bring in the candles
and light up this room immediately!

10
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,520
You...

11
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,830
Why are you here?

12
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,610
No way...

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,860
Nothing happened, right?

14
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,460
Hey, Jan Sil.

15
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,650
Don't you feel anything?

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,370
Darkness is approaching.

17
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,080
Darkness is approaching?

18
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,280
What do you mean by that?

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,790
What darkness is approaching?
What are you trying to say?

20
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,650
You're blocking the light so it's dark.

21
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,240
Whose orders are you following?

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,140
That night we met in Onyang...

23
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,650
...was it something you planned
because he ordered you to?

24
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,290
What did he order you to do?

25
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,470
Did he tell you to seduce me?

26
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,830
If not, then did he tell you
to strangle me with these hands?

27
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,630
If that's not it, did he tell you
to stab me away from prying eyes?

28
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,440
Tell me!

29
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,710
Whose orders are you taking as a spy?!

30
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,900
A spy, you say?

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
That is absurd.

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,650
I am just a human talisman.

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
Human talisman?

34
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,600
Your Majesty. Please repress your anger.

35
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,850
This girl is a Seongsucheong shaman

36
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,120
who was brought here
to protect your health.

37
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,710
She is not a spy.

38
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,500
Only a shaman. Not a spy?

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,860
That's right.

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,810
Just regard her as a talisman
and not human.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Then...

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,390
...she's not even a human...

43
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,450
...and yet she dare
lay a hand on my body?

44
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,690
Tell me!

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,940
The fact that these hands
will not strangle me,

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,870
who can guarantee that?!

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,650
Yo, Your... Your Majesty!

48
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,190
For placing my hands on your body,
I deserve a thousand deaths.

49
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,480
However, please give me a chance
to explain myself.

50
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,440
Explain?

51
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,580
Try, then.

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,190
Generally, even though
the seasons are changing...

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,870
...one must rest in order for the ground
to be covered and flowers to bloom.

54
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,450
And if it's a king who has to carry
the burden of the nation on his shoulders,

55
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,450
how could he not need some respite?

56
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,480
You read the Classics,
so your excuses are great.

57
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,280
Your Majesty's health is the key
to this country's peace and prosperity.

58
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,520
With a weak body, how will you deal
with our people's problems?

59
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,650
So all I wanted to do,

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,900
while Your Majesty was asleep...

61
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,570
...was to help you abate
the weariness of government affairs...

62
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,370
...and the pain in your heart...

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,370
...and rest peacefully.

64
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,710
Did you just say the pain in my heart?

65
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,190
What?

66
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,630
As a shaman, I trust you'll be able
to see everything about a person?

67
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,250
Is that why you dared
to lay your hand on my body?

68
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,630
In order to read my heart?

69
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,420
I'm sorry,

70
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,320
but while you were asleep,
you called out a girl's name.

71
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,290
It carried the weight of all your pain.

72
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,720
And because I wanted to console you...

73
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,090
...I dared to violate the law
and touched Your Majesty.

74
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,700
No. This girl is not Yeon Woo.

75
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,840
Otherwise she wouldn't feign ignorance
after hearing her name.

76
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,360
It's a misunderstanding.
It's an illusion.

77
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,440
Your Majesty.

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,420
I have to struggle free.

79
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,300
Take that girl...

80
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,780
...out of the palace immediately.

81
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,770
-Your Majesty.
-What are you waiting for?

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,710
Did you not hear my order?

83
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,370
Your Majesty...

84
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,240
Your Majesty.

85
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,810
Your Majesty!

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,150
Your Majesty!

87
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,340
You wench!

88
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,700
You dare lay a hand on His Majesty?
Are you out of your mind?

89
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,000
Once you were discovered,

90
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,520
you should have waited quietly
for your punishment.

91
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,940
Who do you think you are
to talk back to him?!

92
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,810
Lock this girl up
in the secret cell immediately.

93
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,780
Yes!

94
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,200
-Milady!
-Stop this.

95
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,660
This girl is a shaman
of the Seongsucheong,

96
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,650
so I'm going to punish her
according to shaman laws.

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,730
How can someone who touched His Majesty
be tried according to shaman laws?

98
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,560
What are you doing? Lock her up!

99
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,400
My Lord!

100
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,350
I am going to inscribe "criminal"
on her forehead and send her away,

101
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,240
so without my permission,
you cannot give her even a drop of water.

102
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes.

103
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,580
Open the door!

104
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,450
Mistress. Mistress!

105
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,760
Open the door!

106
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,000
Open the door please, open the door!

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Seol!

108
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,880
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

109
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,090
Your Majesty!

110
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,690
That's right.

111
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,520
Just regard her
as a talisman and not human.

112
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,030
She's not even a human...

113
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,360
...and yet she dare lay a hand on my body?

114
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,750
It seems like the professor
has caught the shaman, so let's go.

115
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,160
This matter cannot be known by others.

116
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,730
Do you understand?

117
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,470
Yes. Let's go.

118
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,180
Wow! It's been a long time.

119
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,020
If it's not our Professor Na...

120
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,270
Don't be so nervous.

121
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,270
You don't think I'll eat you, right?

122
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,940
Don't you know how dangerous it is
for a member of the Royal Family

123
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,430
to enter the Office of Astronomy?

124
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,520
Of course, I know.
Why wouldn't I know that?

125
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,930
Was there ever a treason plot
that didn't involve the Three Offices?

126
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,150
That is what you're talking about, right?

127
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,540
I'm sorry, but if you are aware of that,

128
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,800
why did you still come here?

129
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,090
First of all, take a look at this.

130
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,190
How is it?
It looks really painful, right?

131
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,580
It might be as painful as you say, but...

132
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,990
Aren't you going to ask me
how this happened?

133
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,550
How did it happen?

134
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,370
I got it chasing a scoundrel
who was trying to harm a certain shaman.

135
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,720
I was busy minding my business
and acting all cool in front of her,

136
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,270
but then this throng of scoundrels
barges in and ruins it all!

137
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,950
And according to these gentlemen,
a certain "Professor"

138
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,770
had taken the shaman.

139
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,120
So...

140
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,250
...I tried to use what's left
of this thing up here.

141
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,620
Professor, you say?

142
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,140
Was he from the Directorate of Medicine?
Or Welfare? Translation?

143
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,570
I doubt it.

144
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,210
Then...

145
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,450
...was it perhaps the Princess's
etiquette professor?

146
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,130
I thought so, but it's not.

147
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,410
Professors of Law
from the Ministry of Punishment

148
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,700
wouldn't have bothered
with such menial tasks...

149
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,940
So that leaves us with just one.

150
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,350
What else? The Office of Astronomy.

151
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,160
Among them one stands out...

152
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,220
...our Professor Na.

153
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,930
That shaman, where is she now?

154
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,330
How would I know the whereabouts
of that shaman?

155
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,700
I received an order to tackle heresy
and send out guards,

156
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,230
and brought in all the shamans and monks
inside the capital for investigation.

157
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,440
And when that happened,
I was disguised as a monk.

158
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,310
So why wasn't I arrested?

159
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,560
That is...

160
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,970
...that wench was guilty
of adultery and foul play,

161
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,980
so we were keen on arresting her.

162
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,690
After arresting her,
where did you imprison her?

163
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,730
Is it Yongsankang?

164
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,030
No, it's not.

165
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,920
She was filled with such evil
that we sent her far away to the south.

166
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,600
Then tell me her registered name!

167
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,940
She did not even register her name
and committed a promiscuous offense,

168
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,300
so that is why we were arresting her.

169
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,840
Prince Yang Myung.

170
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,510
It seems like both of you are quite
in a hurry to get to the King's quarters.

171
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,640
By any chance, did something happen
to His Majesty The King?

172
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,250
Why do you ask that?

173
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,880
Are you hoping that
something does happen to the King?

174
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,860
Your Highness...

175
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,560
You won't find the Royal Concubine here,
so what brings you to these quarters?

176
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,780
Have we already forgotten
the will of the Late King

177
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,340
not to enter these premises?

178
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,260
Why are you acting this way,
Queen Dowager?

179
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,530
He came because he was worried
about His Majesty.

180
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,900
Isn't that right?

181
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,080
Recently, I heard that
villainous people are gathering.

182
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,680
That...

183
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,320
...has nothing to do with me.

184
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,890
Haven't you heard that
when there's smoke there's fire?

185
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,790
They're gathering because
they smell a foul odor from someone.

186
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,060
But, you need to keep something in mind.

187
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,830
As long as I am alive,
it is a fruitless illusion.

188
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,700
Do you understand?

189
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,880
It will never happen.

190
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,420
Let's go, Queen.

191
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,670
Grandmother...

192
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,520
Your vigor isn't what it used to be...

193
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,460
...so it makes me quite upset.

194
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,950
Just now, what did you say?

195
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,880
The flies gathering in front of my house
are not there because of a foul smell.

196
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,860
Isn't it more likely that they're there
because the King doesn't have an heir?

197
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,100
For the King to be safe,

198
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,100
you will have to live until
you're 100 years old.

199
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,270
I am very worried,

200
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,960
because it seems like
I will be so daring as to outlive you.

201
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,770
What great worry will engulf you
in the time that you have left.

202
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,920
For your health and prosperity,

203
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,950
I will come visit you often
and amuse you with childish jests.

204
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,120
If you'll excuse me...

205
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,700
Be well.

206
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,850
Are you feeling well?

207
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,500
As you can see, I am fine. I am well.

208
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,520
That is a relief.

209
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,110
In the middle of the night,
your attendants were frantic,

210
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,070
so I thought your health
had worsened again.

211
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,450
Nothing has happened. Do not worry.

212
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,660
You must become stronger.

213
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,470
So that the treacherous ploy
to make Prince Yang Myung king

214
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,450
will be quelled once and for all.

215
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,320
Why are you acting like this,
Queen Dowager?

216
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,540
Those are men of no virtue.

217
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,380
How could Prince Yang Myung
covet such treacherous acts?

218
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,310
His presence alone is a grievous threat
to His Majesty!

219
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,980
You have to become stronger,
Your Majesty.

220
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,070
You must produce an heir soon.

221
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,710
More importantly, you must
distance yourself from Prince Yang Myung.

222
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,740
That is the only way
you can remain on the throne.

223
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,780
Do you understand?

224
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,780
Prince Yang Myung.

225
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,560
Mother.

226
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,600
What were you so sincerely praying for?

227
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,340
I always pray
for the safety of His Majesty The King.

228
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,110
And I pray for you as well,
so that you can find a beautiful wife.

229
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,480
What is it?

230
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:46,080
Even without any adornment,
your hair is still as beautiful.

231
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,330
Even though I converted to Buddhism,
I still have not vanquished my anguish,

232
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,550
and I haven't been able
to shave my head, yet.

233
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,180
When I finally wash away
all that anguish...

234
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,220
Just...

235
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,370
...keep your hair.

236
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
Who knows?

237
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,450
If His Majesty The King
were to have an unfortunate accident...

238
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,590
...you would become Queen Mother.

239
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,110
Prince Yang Myung.

240
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,850
How can you say such treacherous words?

241
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,330
Don't you know that His Majesty's safety
is also your safety?

242
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,430
How could I not know?

243
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,130
From the day I was born until today...

244
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,370
...isn't that what you've been telling me?

245
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,510
Prince Yang Myung.

246
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,230
A tree tries to remain standing
but as the wind never ceases,

247
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,680
it can't help but be swayed.

248
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,590
Please, let no wind ever make you sway.

249
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,890
Don't waver.

250
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,130
That is the only way
for the King to be comfortable

251
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,140
and for you to be safe.

252
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,260
Prince Yang Myung.

253
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,140
Mother.

254
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,560
Do you believe in reincarnation?

255
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,910
I have emptied my heart.

256
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,480
I have no desire
for power, riches or fame.

257
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,850
I have no greed for any of those things.

258
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,960
I just...

259
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,320
...want one person.

260
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,170
If another life does exist...

261
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,200
...I wish to meet this person again.

262
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,270
I'm afraid that she will not recognize me.

263
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,180
That again, she will not choose me...

264
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,780
...but someone else.

265
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,380
That I might even have met her already...

266
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,130
...but I might have once again lost her.

267
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,650
That is my only concern.

268
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,150
Where do I have to go to find you?

269
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,350
Woon.

270
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,050
Do you also believe that Yang Myung...

271
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,020
...is someone who would do that?

272
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,360
You know Brother very well, so tell me.

273
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,700
Are you questioning his motives?

274
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,450
Is there any reason
why I should doubt him?

275
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,600
Since there are people
who keep trying to sway him.

276
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,610
I'm just worried he might break
under the pressure.

277
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,810
Isn't it laughable?

278
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,480
The throne I sit on.

279
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,010
Having to treat my flesh and blood
as a political foe.

280
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,860
Today this throne, more than ever...

281
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,290
...feels lonesome and heavy.

282
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,960
So all I wanted to do
while Your Majesty was asleep,

283
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,940
was to help you abate
the weariness of government affairs

284
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,930
and the pain in your heart,

285
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,550
and rest peacefully...

286
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,090
-Woon.
-At your commands.

287
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,460
Check the Seongsucheong's
name registers for me.

288
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,190
What is it that you want to confirm?

289
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,530
Also check on the movements
on Councilor Yoon's side.

290
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,050
Do you want me to confirm
that she's a spy?

291
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,620
Or do you want confirmation
that she is not?

292
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,740
Yeon Woo... Yeon Woo.

293
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,920
Yeon Woo!

294
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,830
You mustn't, Yeon Woo! Yeon Woo.

295
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,980
Yeon Woo...

296
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,570
Aigoo, my baby.

297
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,250
My precious baby!

298
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,030
You're alive?

299
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,080
You're alive.

300
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,840
It is cold, but why are you wearing
such thin clothes?

301
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,500
What are you going to do
if you catch a cold?

302
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,360
Didn't it hurt?

303
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,480
Wasn't it difficult?

304
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,850
Weren't you cold?

305
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,680
Weren't you scared?

306
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,860
Please say something.

307
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,140
Mother.

308
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Yes.

309
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,940
Please take care of yourself.

310
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,520
Mother...

311
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,210
Mother...

312
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,390
Are you going to leave Milady like that?
You're the High Shaman, aren't you?

313
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,450
They said they're going to brand her face!

314
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm going to charge in and break the...

315
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,950
Be quiet. I'm gathering my thoughts.

316
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,910
Can you solve anything just by thinking?

317
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,360
Milady, thanks to someone,

318
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,230
cannot breathe well in a small,
confined dark space.

319
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,680
It would be better to go to the King
and tell him the truth.

320
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,010
That the shaman that he's trying to kill
is actually Heo Yeon Woo.

321
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,490
Shut that mouth of yours!

322
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:30,090
Say that nonsense one more time,
and I will tear open your mouth.

323
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,860
I'm trying to find a solution,
so stop disturbing me and get out now!

324
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,170
Brother, it's Yeon Woo.

325
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,990
I see it's time for us to read already.

326
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,390
Let's see. What book did we say
we were going to read today?

327
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,240
Your face has worry written all over it.

328
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,830
Mother.

329
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,460
You were fine for a while,
so why are you acting like this again?

330
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,160
Yeon Woo...

331
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:55,220
Our Yeon Woo, came to see me.

332
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,640
Mother...

333
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,100
It seemed like...

334
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,220
...she had something to say.

335
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,150
She wanted...

336
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,670
...I'm sure of it.

337
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,090
She was trying to tell me something.

338
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,270
That sweet child was worried
about her mother.

339
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,380
And she kept crying.

340
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
Then she left.

341
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,180
That poor child.

342
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,020
Aigoo, my baby.

343
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,600
What is wrong?

344
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,560
Did you prick your finger
with the needle again?

345
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,840
Something feels ominous.

346
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,050
It's not the first time
you pricked your finger,

347
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,380
so what feels ominous?

348
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,470
If I said it's ominous, then it is!

349
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,880
Look at this.

350
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,190
The embroidery I'm stitching
onto his official clothes is bloody.

351
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,740
So, didn't I tell you
to go to sleep tonight,

352
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,880
and continue tomorrow when you're awake?

353
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,650
Wha... what's wrong?

354
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm going to ask Mother to teach me.

355
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,730
Princess, it's already past 10 PM!

356
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,260
Princess! Princess.

357
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,530
Princess.

358
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,030
Prince Consort.

359
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,700
Husband!

360
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,910
Mother!

361
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,440
What happened to Mother, Husband?

362
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm bringing her back from our old home.

363
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,310
You haven't been there for a long time...

364
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,090
Why did you suddenly go back
to the old house?

365
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,800
I'm sorry, but please take care of Mother.

366
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,910
Housekeeper Park!
Bring the key to the old house.

367
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes, sir.

368
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,560
That child why?

369
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,630
That dead child. Why is she in my dreams?

370
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,820
I'm sorry...

371
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,130
...but while you were asleep,
you called out a girl's name.

372
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,600
It carried the weight of all your pain.

373
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,970
And because I wanted to console you...

374
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,910
...I dared to violate the law
of not touching the royal body.

375
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,960
-You're from the palace kitchen?
-That is correct.

376
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,150
This morning, you served me
the same stew again.

377
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,740
That is correct.

378
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,660
Then, do you want me to keep eating
the same stew until I die?

379
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,980
If you serve me stew again...

380
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,970
...you will be punished for your misdeeds.

381
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,700
Why is His Majesty cold again?

382
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,370
We can't ever
serve him stew again, right?

383
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,680
When he smiled, he was so much
more handsome than now.

384
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,850
-Yes.
-Right.

385
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,250
"The stew was very delicious.
I ate it well".

386
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,380
He said that and smiled.

387
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,480
If only I could see
his smile just one more time...

388
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,150
Your Majesty!

389
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,400
Your Majesty, please kill us.

390
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,030
Where do you wenches belong?

391
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,600
Shut those...

392
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,270
That's enough, Court Lady Jo.

393
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,100
His Majesty's complexion
has become brighter,

394
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,270
so what other news is better than this?

395
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,190
I shall forget ever seeing you mention it,
so you needn't worry.

396
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,070
What did you just say, Queen?

397
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,110
It is shameful for me to say this,

398
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,640
but there are rumours driving discord
between His Majesty and I

399
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,600
circulating in the palace.

400
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,140
What rumours?

401
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,330
They say that His Majesty is ill
because of me,

402
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,940
and that his recent improvement

403
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,330
is because he is secretly frequenting
a treacherous woman.

404
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,740
Secretly frequenting a woman, His Majesty?

405
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,440
You know all too well
that he is definitely not the type.

406
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,100
Regardless of whether the rumours
are true or not,

407
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,960
if such slanderous drivel
were to spread outside of the palace,

408
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,810
what would the credulous masses
think of this country's Royal Family?

409
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:49,890
So I beg you to grant me permission
to visit His Majesty when I please.

410
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,730
It is because I am unable
to stay by His Majesty's side

411
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,940
that rumours like these keep spreading.

412
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:01,840
But as both Office of Astronomy
and Seongsucheong assert...

413
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,130
...it is best to keep you two apart
until you share the marital bed.

414
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,910
Then, as his rightful wife.

415
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,320
I have to continue to bear the disgrace?

416
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,150
Just wait a little longer, Queen.

417
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:20,420
Once you share the marital bed,
the rumours will vanish like thin air.

418
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,670
But there is no way of knowing
when His Majesty will fall ill again.

419
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,160
You needn't worry about that.

420
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,100
The Queen Dowager has placed
High Shaman Jang's successor...

421
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,380
...as a talisman in the King's palace.

422
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,320
Did you say a human talisman?

423
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,880
That's correct.

424
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,660
The reason His Majesty has improved
is also thanks to her skills,

425
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,240
so just have a little more faith and wait.

426
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,450
I've heard of unprecedented cold spells
in the north, is that true?

427
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,610
The north has always been a cold place.

428
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Then.

429
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,350
So I suppose that man I mentioned,
Pi Han...

430
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,250
Pi Han Dol.

431
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,390
He wasn't even taken care of, I imagine.

432
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,960
Since it's always cold in there,
people should just freeze to death?

433
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,370
Send relief so the citizens
can counter the cold immediately.

434
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,530
Yes, Your Majesty!

435
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh, I left something out.

436
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,210
Pi...

437
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,750
I was right. It is Pi Han Dol.

438
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,260
Pi...

439
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,420
Please write up a report
about the damages and submit it.

440
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,110
And regarding the Deputy Personnel
Minister's bribery scandal

441
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,700
we discussed at the last meeting,

442
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,590
I heard that you did not execute
the order to return the bribes.

443
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,460
There weren't a lot of items,

444
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,260
so why go through the hassle
of returning every last one of them?

445
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,170
They were embezzled from our people,

446
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,610
they did not give them freely.

447
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,740
What do you think, Minister Yoon?

448
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,410
Your Majesty is correct,
but it wasn't that much.

449
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,510
They were the fruit
of our famished people's hard labour,

450
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,260
so they must be returned in full.

451
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,300
The fancy clothes
that he received as bribes

452
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,090
must be requisited immediately.

453
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,130
We will end the meeting like this.

454
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,430
Oh, right. Finance Minister.

455
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,160
There is something I want to ask you.

456
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,800
Certainly, Sire.

457
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,530
Is the construction
of Boyong Pavilion going as planned?

458
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,280
If you are that worried about it,

459
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,690
how about going to the site yourself
and having a look around?

460
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,060
Oh, that's a really good idea.

461
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,700
But you know,

462
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,400
I may be a little late.

463
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,130
That's what I'm starting to think.

464
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,410
That was just like him playing with us.

465
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,980
Pi, Pi, Pi! Throwing out that syllable
as though he was going to say his name.

466
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,390
He messed around with us.

467
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,600
It definitely seems like
he knows something.

468
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,800
But I don't know why we aren't getting
a response out of him.

469
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,030
Well, it seems like he is planning
on slowly killing us with words.

470
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,540
About the Boyong Pavilion construction,
even if he were to investigate,

471
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,970
he knows he is too late.

472
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,770
Are you suggesting he has given up?

473
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,140
More than giving up.

474
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,980
He is probably waiting
for an opportunity.

475
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,960
Opportunity? What opportunity?

476
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,440
Instead of acting like you know something
and posing all the time,

477
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,680
can't you just tell us all at once?!

478
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,290
Opportunity?
What opportunity are you referring to?

479
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:21,030
It'll likely be the opportunity
to eradicate his opponents.

480
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,010
The Queen requests your presence.

481
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,810
What did you just say?

482
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,980
Did you say that High Shaman Jang
has returned to the Seongsucheong?

483
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,950
Yes.

484
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,150
She is using her successor
as a talisman to ward off evil spirits.

485
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,740
It definitely must be
the Queen Dowager's order.

486
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,870
So seek audience with the Queen Dowager
in my stead and make a request.

487
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,240
A request?

488
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,040
Even though she is a lowly shaman,
ultimately, she is a woman.

489
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,550
She cannot stay by His Majesty's side
and watch over him.

490
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,750
Then, the shaman that was sent
to His Majesty's side has to be removed.

491
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,880
Is that the request I am to make?

492
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,590
However...

493
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,790
...I've been having disturbing dreams
for the past few days...

494
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,940
...not to mention the sudden improvement
in His Majesty's health.

495
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,890
It is making me uneasy.

496
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,830
How can a mother of state such as you...

497
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,400
...be jealous of a lowly shaman?

498
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,650
Even though His Majesty
keeps you far away,

499
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,580
do you think he'll turn
to a lowly shaman?

500
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,490
High Shaman Jang has returned.

501
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,320
That Jang Nok Young...

502
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,930
What brings you all the way here?

503
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,140
When I was in power,
you used to come see me every day...

504
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,580
...but it's getting harder to see you
as the days go by.

505
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
I apologize, Your Highness.

506
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,780
Being a Chief State Councilor
is an exacting task.

507
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,720
I know that well.

508
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,460
After all, was reaching that position
that easy for you...

509
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,010
Who helped you get
into that high position?

510
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,620
You dare show off in front of me?

511
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,800
A toothless tiger still thinks
she is the owner of the forest.

512
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,620
What did the supreme leader
below the throne

513
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,570
want from this old matron?

514
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,580
I heard that you reinstated Shaman Jang
at the Seongsucheong.

515
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,200
And so?

516
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,110
The Seongsucheong has Shaman Kwon.

517
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,260
Was she not a temporary solution?

518
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,160
Her abilities cannot compare
to those of Shaman Jang.

519
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,360
However, wasn't Shaman Jang

520
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,960
deeply involved
in the incident from eight years ago?

521
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,760
If she were to say something...

522
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,650
Shaman Kwon was also deeply involved
in Prince Ui Seong's treason scandal.

523
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,390
If we want to talk about dangerous,
the two are the same.

524
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,430
However...

525
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,530
...that happened a long time ago.

526
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,790
Why, is eight years a short time?

527
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,960
We need Shaman Jang's talent.

528
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,710
In all of Joseon, there is no other
who has her talent,

529
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,480
so how can I get rid of her?

530
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,430
Shaman Kwon...

531
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,770
...has a lot of greed
for power and authority,

532
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,280
so she is easier to control.

533
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,520
But Shaman Jang's mind
is much more difficult to penetrate.

534
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,630
Those who are difficult to control
are dangerous.

535
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,410
The more dangerous she is,
the more I need to keep her by my side.

536
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,920
Your Highness...

537
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,740
What are you afraid of, Councilor Yoon?

538
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,860
It is all in the past anyway.

539
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,360
More importantly...

540
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,300
...the dead do not talk.

541
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,430
She will receive her punishment,
so drag her out!

542
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,770
-Yes!
-Yes!

543
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,220
Shaman Wol,

544
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,210
you were sent to the King's chamber
as a human talisman.

545
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,650
But you ignored your duties.

546
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,800
Instead, she committed a crime
of unfaithfulness to her duty.

547
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,030
Committing this crime is punishable
by His Majesty's law of the land.

548
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,370
May everyone present
witness her punishment

549
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,570
and learn that crime cannot prevail.

550
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,700
Commence.

551
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

552
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,540
Are you positive that her name
is in the Seongsucheong's registry?

553
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,110
-I am.
-What about Councilor Yoon?

554
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,130
It seems as if they do not know
about the shaman's existence.

555
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,330
Please revoke your royal order.

556
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,050
That girl is not a spy.

557
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,710
If anyone should be punished,

558
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,040
it is me, for having witnessed all this
without reacting promptly.

559
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,720
You're taking the girl's side.

560
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,600
That's very much unlike you.

561
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,070
I know.

562
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,880
The dangerous person is not her, but me.

563
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,300
What am I to do, Ari?

564
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,520
If I reveal the truth, she will live,
but she will die soon.

565
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,810
If I let this go on, even if she lives,
it won't be worth living.

566
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,240
What am I to do?

567
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,420
Please answer me, Ari!

568
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,240
Stop!

569
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,990
Stop.

570
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,170
This is a royal command.

571
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,960
Shaman Wol will return to the King's
chambers to finish her duties...

572
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,550
...by royal decree.

573
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,020
-Wol!
-Milady!

574
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,290
Milady, are you all right?

575
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,740
Did you say I've been bewitched?

576
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,200
You say that's why
I need to push her away.

577
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,630
I am bewitched.

578
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,320
However...

579
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,360
...I cannot push her away.

580
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,580
Mistress...

581
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,090
...I'd like to go out...

582
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,960
...for a little while.

583
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,320
In your state,
where do you plan on going?

584
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,250
Just for a while...
Just a little while will be enough.

585
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,990
There is something I must do.

586
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,950
Are you out of your mind?

587
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,980
-After going through all that...
-I know.

588
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,290
That a shaman who serves His Majesty
cannot go out in public as she wishes,

589
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,530
and that I am just a lowly shaman.

590
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:36,940
That a lowly shaman
cannot overstep her boundaries.

591
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,290
This experience taught me all this.

592
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,500
Even though I cannot do anything about
the hardships of being a shaman...

593
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,570
...I want to be sure to clear all the
misunderstanding I had to endure...

594
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,910
...because I was a shaman.

595
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,610
Please give me permission.

596
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,470
It is my first...

597
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,580
...and my last request.

598
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,850
I was able to bring you out
after all that,

599
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,460
but you do not want any ornaments
and refuse clothing material.

600
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,370
Mother, you really do not want anything?

601
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,230
No. I don't.

602
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,290
So don't worry about me.

603
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,330
If there is anything that you need,
please tell me.

604
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,490
If you don't want anything,
then I don't, either.

605
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,310
Oh! I do have one.

606
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,670
The rice paper that Husband uses
is running low.

607
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:55,470
Since we are out, what do you think about
getting him the best quality one?

608
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,900
You are always so considerate
towards your husband...

609
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,480
...I can only be thankful as a mother.

610
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,210
Mother. You smiled just now, right?

611
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,640
You will stop being sad now, right?

612
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,590
Yes. Because of me, you're trying so hard,

613
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:17,560
so I have to cheer up for you.

614
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,840
They say that if you smile,
luck comes to you.

615
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,010
So you must smile often, okay?

616
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:24,660
Yes, I will.

617
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,430
Let's take a trip to the trinket store,
then go to the stationery store.

618
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,130
Yes, Mother.

619
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,490
Seeing that you're taking such care
in choosing the paper,

620
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,380
you must be writing a love letter.

621
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:53,050
It's not a love letter,
but a letter of apology.

622
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:01,510
It's not a letter,
but a letter of apology.

623
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,740
Will you wait for me?

624
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,020
Will you?

625
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,200
Oh? Where are you going
in the middle of choosing?

626
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,630
I will be back in just a little while.

627
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:52,760
Many days have passed since then,
so there's no way he'd still be here.

628
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:00,940
Now that I think about it,
I wasn't able to thank him.

629
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,530
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

630
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:42,660
I came out for an errand and I dropped by
the clothing factory, just in case.

631
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,130
I really didn't expect you to be there.

632
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,070
I'm glad that I am able to thank you
after so long.

633
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,440
That day...

634
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,820
...thank you so much.

635
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:01,960
For not keeping my promise, I am sorry.

636
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,850
There's no need to be thankful.

637
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,230
I wasn't able to save you anyway.

638
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,560
Did you get badly hurt?

639
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:16,190
Because I was raised tough,
this small injury is nothing.

640
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:20,320
But, how come you're not wearing
your monk clothing today?

641
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,300
What?

642
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,210
It seems like you have misunderstood.

643
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,750
I am not a monk. At that time,
I was in a desperate situation

644
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,480
that is why I changed my appearance.

645
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,650
You're really not a monk?

646
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,740
That's right. I am still unmarried

647
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,420
and I can rival the heavens
and earth in freedom.

648
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,910
Of course,
I can register for marriage too.

649
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:57,240
The wound on your face,
how did you get it?

650
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,480
It seems like you have suffered a lot.

651
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,550
If you want to escape again, tell me.

652
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,770
I will help you.

653
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:16,660
Although I am thankful for your words,
I am in a safe place now.

654
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,160
So, you don't have to worry...

655
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,160
If you want to run away
from these troubling circumstances,

656
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,320
if that's the case.

657
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,420
I can throw away my princehood,
the title of Prince Yang Myung...

658
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,310
...wrap you up and run away with you.

659
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,910
Are you, by any chance...

660
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,210
...the King's brother?

661
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,120
That...

662
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,610
...how did you know that?

663
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,700
It is my spiritual power.

664
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,130
Spiritual power?

665
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,570
Yes.

666
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,800
Just now, I saw some of your past.

667
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,390
So it is just your power?

668
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:11,950
Although it may not be enough
to repay you...

669
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:17,190
...may I give you an advice as a shaman?

670
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,150
Go ahead and do it.

671
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,010
Now...

672
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:28,380
...let go of the woman
you have in your heart.

673
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,540
For a new relationship,
empty that place in your heart.

674
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:42,840
Please do not try to smile
to cover up your real feelings.

675
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:50,020
Deceiving yourself and living like that...

676
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,250
...can only bring you suffering,
don't you think?

677
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,040
Your name... Can I ask for your name?

678
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,610
I'm sorry, but I have no...

679
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,420
I will call you Wol.

680
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,960
Wol...

681
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,620
...I am Wol.

682
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,110
Wol?

683
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,110
I must return now.

684
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,260
I am very grateful
for your help that day.

685
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,740
I will pray for you
to meet your soul mate.

686
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,260
Then, goodbye.

687
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,410
Wai... wait!

688
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,960
-Mother, are you okay?
-I am sorry.

689
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,210
-I was in a hurry, so I wasn't careful.
-I'm all right, so you may go.

690
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,740
Thank you.

691
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,600
How can a woman be so clumsy?

692
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,700
Don't you agree, Mother?

693
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,760
-Yang Myung!
-Prince Yang Myung!

694
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,550
What brings the two of you here?

695
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,470
How are you feeling?

696
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:26,390
You disappeared suddenly,
so everyone was very worried.

697
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,710
But Mother, I'm a bit busy.

698
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,450
I will come pay a visit later.

699
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,460
Do you have a lover now, Brother?

700
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,970
Yes, she is. Are you satisfied now?

701
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,390
Looks like she went that way,
so hurry after her.

702
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,560
It must be true, Mother!

703
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,600
I should have looked more closely
to see what kind of maiden she was.

704
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,970
Is she around the age of my Yeon Woo?

705
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,380
You do not have to worry about that.

706
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,380
To tell you the truth,
the Queen Dowager has placed...

707
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,250
...High Shaman Jang's successor
as a talisman in the King's palace.

708
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,150
Your Majesty,
why are you acting like this again?

709
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,430
Get out of my way.
If you block me again...

710
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,850
...I will bite my tongue and die.

711
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,800
Were you surprised?

712
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,600
I did not drink the tea
that the physician made.

713
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,890
I will continue to do so from now on.

714
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,280
So you will have to be responsible
for what you have said.

715
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,050
Didn't you tell me to forget the weariness
of government affairs while I'm asleep?

716
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,270
That is correct.

717
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,210
Didn't you tell me to forget about
the pain in my heart?

718
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,700
That is correct.

719
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,270
I am extremely exhausted right now.

720
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,060
Moreover, the pain in my heart
that I can't bear...

721
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,720
...is completely occupying it.

722
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,620
Therefore, you need to help me
forget about all of it.

723
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,850
You have to put to rest
the pain in my heart.

724
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:28,520
Do you think you can do it?

725
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,530
Answer me. Do you think you can do it?

726
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,690
Please allow me to do so.

727
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:39,700
If Your Majesty permits...

728
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,690
...I will prevent the misfortune and death
that threaten you from harming you.

729
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,960
I will help you solve the problems
and worries that cause you distress.

730
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:56,320
Although I am lacking,

731
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,320
I am the human talisman who has the duty
to protect Your Majesty's royal body.

732
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,010
From the beginning,
one month's time was decided on.

733
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,920
So during that time...

734
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,300
...I will fulfil my duty.

735
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,480
Your Majesty.

736
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:33,610
I will inform His Majesty
that you are here,

737
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,980
so please wait a moment.

738
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,890
-Open the door.
-That... cannot be done.

739
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,030
Lift up...

740
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,810
...your head.

741
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,010
Lift it. That is an order.

742
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,230
It wasn't enough to be afraid
of a dead girl,

743
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:53,000
now I am uneasy
because of a lowly shaman!

744
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,670
There is no way I am not the owner
of those memories, right?

745
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,540
I can't be that person, right?

746
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,690
The person that you are looking for,
I will help you meet her.

747
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,790
I keep having weird memories.

748
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,630
Those memories are confusing me.

749
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,190
Who exactly am I?
