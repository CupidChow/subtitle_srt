1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,070
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,260
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,330
Episode 16

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,370
Then, who was selected
to be the Crown Princess in my place?

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,650
The Personnel Minister's daughter,
who was a companion to the Princess.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,750
Was there another selection process?

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,860
No. I don't know why, but the late King

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,960
named her Crown Princess immediately,
without another selection process.

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,680
I am prepared to give up my position
in the Royal Family and choose that girl.

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,970
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,210
are you prepared to give up your position
as monarch?

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,630
If I were to leave that girl's side
as you wish,

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,430
would Your Majesty be able
to protect her at her side?

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,210
Hyungnim.

15
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,770
When you are unwilling to give up
or lose a single thing,

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,580
what exactly are you capable
of protecting?

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Hyungnim!

18
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,980
Apart from turning that innocent girl
into a criminal and causing her pain,

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,920
what exactly are you saying you can do?

20
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,190
Enough.

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,090
Stop it.

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,260
Your Majesty, can you...

23
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,900
...let go of Yeon Woo?

24
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,490
I...

25
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,380
...can do that.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,490
But Your Majesty...

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,490
...will never be able to do that.

28
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,610
You. You...

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,720
What are you doing here?

30
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,420
I understand that Your Highness
called for me.

31
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,790
Was that not the case?

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,470
You couldn't possibly be...

33
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,280
No. Of course not. That's impossible.

34
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,210
That's impossible.

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,920
Heo Yeon Woo.

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,200
Do I resemble that person that much?

37
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,170
What?

38
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,660
Many people have mistaken me
for the person named Heo Yeon Woo.

39
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,720
However, I'm merely Shaman Wol.

40
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,120
All right.

41
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,690
That's fine.

42
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,000
That's fine, you may go now.

43
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,890
If you would permit me,

44
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,130
may I say one thing before I go?

45
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,340
I have seen the soul of Heo Yeon Woo
at the Hidden Moon Pavilion.

46
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,020
The soul told me...

47
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,660
...that if I should see Your Highness,
the Queen.

48
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,160
I was to tell you to let go
of the fear now.

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,530
That she wishes you would be happy.

50
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,890
That is impossible.

51
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,550
That girl would never say that to me.

52
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,450
Court lady Jo!

53
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,220
Come take this girl away!

54
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,350
-Quickly!
-Yes.

55
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,510
Don't worry about me
and please go tend to her.

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,150
I will quietly slip out of the castle.

57
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,120
If by any chance
you let yourself be seen here.

58
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,890
Then, how could I expect to keep my life?

59
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,670
The look in her eyes was not one
meant for an old friend.

60
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,540
Rather, it was a look of dread.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,240
Why?

62
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,730
Why would that be?

63
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,980
Your Highness!
Why are you acting this way?

64
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,980
It's not so. It's not so!

65
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,980
It's not so.

66
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,620
Are you going to kill Yeon Woo?

67
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,230
Did you say you wanted
to live in the palace?

68
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,390
Did you say you wanted to win the heart
of the Crown Prince?

69
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,430
Then, forget messy emotions
like compassion and guilt.

70
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,970
Remember the humiliation you felt
when they took away what was yours.

71
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,700
Without that sort of determination,

72
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,370
don't ever covet
that position again.

73
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,780
Now, no one will be able to take away
my rightful place.

74
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,480
Right.

75
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,190
That's impossible.

76
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,290
That child definitely died.

77
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,550
I suppose you will start practicing
today for the ceremony.

78
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,680
It may be a lonely
and difficult schedule,

79
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,190
but knowing you, I believe you'll get
through it with cheerful energy.

80
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,140
Were you perhaps weeping
thinking of the family you left?

81
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,220
If that is so, open your window.

82
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,110
Why are you here?

83
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Tell me.

84
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,330
You are supposed to be in the sick ward,

85
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,240
so why are you here?

86
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,090
I was summoned by a royal order
and so I entered the palace.

87
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,230
I was leaving when I lost my way.

88
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,670
No..

89
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,040
..Without even realizing it,
I followed the moonlight here.

90
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm sorry.

91
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,230
It is a place that is precious to you,
so I shall leave now.

92
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,500
Are you feeling all right?

93
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,730
I'm all right.

94
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,320
Is it hard staying there?

95
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,300
It isn't hard.

96
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,310
If you want,

97
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,540
I can have you moved somewhere else.

98
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,420
If you want,

99
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,750
I can send you where no one knows
who you are.

100
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,440
How can you think of using your power
as monarch for personal matters?

101
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,870
Please don't.

102
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,780
If you were to do that, I would never
be able to see Your Majesty.

103
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,610
Then,

104
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,390
are you saying you'll quietly pay
the price for a crime you didn't commit?

105
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,270
How can I claim I committed no crime?

106
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,890
How can I possibly make up
for the crime,

107
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,100
of not knowing Your Majesty
at first glance.

108
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,900
Then, are you saying

109
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,470
you did indeed bewitch
a member of the royal family?

110
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,340
Be firm in your mindset.

111
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,150
You cannot allow pity
to sway your earnest integrity any longer.

112
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,600
Go.

113
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,470
Go and don't ever...

114
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,760
...appear before me again.

115
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,790
Why have you come here?

116
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,760
Because you have not come to see me,
I came to see you.

117
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,030
Don't you think there might be a
reason why I have not come to see you?

118
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,360
Please go back.

119
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,430
Milady.

120
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,810
I have not cleared up my thoughts, yet.

121
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,440
Later...

122
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,510
I shall come to see you later.

123
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,720
His Majesty has summoned me.

124
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,790
Before I go to see His Majesty,

125
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,760
I felt it proper to speak with you first,
and so I came here.

126
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,240
I had no choice but to follow
the Queen Dowager's order at that time.

127
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:52,650
And I, also could not ignore
my friend's dying wish to protect you.

128
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,080
Therefore, I killed you.

129
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,700
And, therefore, I saved you.

130
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,440
Whatever punishment you give me,
I'm prepared to accept it readily.

131
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,510
So...

132
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,410
One thing.

133
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,910
There is one thing I cannot forgive

134
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,320
and completely cannot understand.

135
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,430
Why did you lie to my father?

136
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,800
He was such an virtuous lord
full of integrity.

137
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,950
If I told him the truth,

138
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,670
he would not have complied with a scheme
to deceive the King.

139
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,870
Why didn't you just kill me instead?

140
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,850
-Milady.
-My father...

141
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,720
...was so tormented by the guilt
of killing his daughter,

142
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,690
that he ended his own life.

143
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,590
No.

144
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,130
The moment he gave me
the medicine to drink,

145
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,030
my father had already died.

146
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,040
The medicine that would give back my life
became the poison that took my father's!

147
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,540
Do you understand?

148
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,300
The person you killed was not me,
but my father!

149
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,470
How do you intend to make up

150
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,640
for the eight years of sorrow
my family and His Majesty went through?

151
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,120
Tell me!

152
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,700
What were you thinking,
keeping silent for such a long time?!

153
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,170
Sorcery that harms a human life...

154
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,110
...requires an offering.

155
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,950
In the curse placed upon you,

156
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,220
a maiden with a single intense purpose
was the sacrificial offering.

157
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,820
That maiden, for the sake of fulfilling
her own deep desire,

158
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,020
willingly participated as an offering.

159
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,200
She joined in the prayer for your death.

160
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,570
Was that maiden...

161
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,310
...the Queen?

162
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,960
Then, who?

163
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,800
That night, the Princess came by,
but strangely, she didn't come in.

164
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,310
She just asked about your health and left.

165
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,710
The Princess?

166
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,020
It couldn't be.

167
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,990
It couldn't be.

168
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,560
It was the Princess.

169
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,990
Your father ended his own life.

170
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,860
The sadness of sending off
a child.

171
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,800
Who could understand such sadness?

172
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,340
Which one of you is Tutor Heo's sister?

173
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,610
Is it you?

174
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,810
Is it you?

175
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,010
Who is Tutor Heo's sister?

176
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,260
It is me.

177
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,560
You resemble Tutor Heo,
so you are pretty, as well.

178
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,950
Please get up, Princess.

179
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
How many days has it been?

180
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,280
Your Highness.

181
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,860
Please entreat His Majesty to allow
Tutor Heo to be my husband.

182
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
Please?

183
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,030
Oh my. Do you like Tutor Heo that much?

184
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes.

185
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,810
If I can't be with him, I'll die.

186
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,390
His Majesty will never consent.

187
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,310
What will we do with our poor Princess?

188
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,990
Oh, dear.

189
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,420
Please don't despair, Princess.

190
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,900
It's not true that there's no way
to have Tutor Heo.

191
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,030
What is the way?

192
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:51,330
Then, will you help
this grandmother of yours?

193
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,330
Oh dear. Were you frightened?

194
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,240
Do not worry.

195
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,670
Now you will get what you wanted.

196
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,010
It's over now, so you can relax.

197
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,660
Princess, are you asleep?

198
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,490
No, Husband.

199
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,750
Were you crying?

200
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,990
No.

201
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,030
What brings you here at this hour?

202
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,730
Ever since we returned
from Father's grave,

203
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,330
I heard you haven't been able to get up.

204
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,360
I was worried so I came.

205
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,310
Why are you crying again?

206
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,940
Have I upset you?

207
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,510
No.

208
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,910
I just had a nightmare
that you disappeared.

209
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,590
But since you've come,
I'm just so flooded with relief.

210
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,870
I have a big problem.

211
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,810
Excuse me?

212
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,000
Did something bad happen to you?

213
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,250
I told you that your smiling face
was lovely.

214
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,890
But now, even your tears
look lovely to me,

215
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,570
so it's a big problem, is it not?

216
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,170
Forgive me, Husband.

217
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,700
Forgive you for what?

218
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,740
Everything.

219
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,250
Everything. All of it.

220
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,850
I shall stay by your side all night,
so rest assured.

221
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,430
Are you really going
to stay by my side?

222
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,100
I promise, so sleep comfortably.

223
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,640
Participating in sorcery to assassinate
the Crown Princess is treason.

224
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,180
If the Princess's participation
is discovered,

225
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,150
His Majesty has to convict his own blood.

226
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,220
And her family,
including the Lord Prince Consort,

227
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,220
would become criminals, too.

228
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,120
That is why they used the Princess
for the offering.

229
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,980
Because even if one day,

230
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,870
you or His Majesty
were to find out the whole truth,

231
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,070
they presumed that both of you
would have no choice but to cover it up.

232
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,750
Milady.

233
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,780
Then,

234
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,720
what am I supposed to do?

235
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,190
You must make a choice.

236
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,770
Whether to reveal all of these truths
and go to His Majesty's side,

237
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:12,510
or cover all of it up
and continue to live like this.

238
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,990
Is this the reason why for eight years

239
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,420
you have kept silent?

240
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,190
It is also why
I have come to see you

241
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,300
before I go to meet His Majesty.

242
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,070
I will do everything as you wish.

243
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Really, Prince Yang Myung.

244
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,110
Why are you doing this
to a virtuous subject?

245
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,370
It's a misunderstanding, I tell you!
Really, why are you doing this?

246
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,550
Aigoo, I'm going crazy.

247
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,720
Then, make a choice.

248
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:44,460
One, I will not ask or debate
how much you have pilfered up to now,

249
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,300
and you, while I'm asking nicely,
will send relief rations and supplies.

250
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,760
Two, I take this path to the main hall
and report your corruption to His Majesty.

251
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,310
What are you saying you will report to me?

252
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,340
Your Majesty.

253
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Your Majesty,
it isn't anything important...

254
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,180
Hyungnim, what brings you to the palace?

255
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,750
It's nothing much.

256
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,520
It appears our tax minister is so pressed
with government business

257
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,960
that he's unaware of the horrible state
of the sick wards.

258
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,230
So, I came to inform him
and request supplies.

259
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,760
What do you mean unaware?
That is utterly unjust...

260
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,800
Have you forgotten the King's kin
must refrain from political speech?

261
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,010
That is so! The King's immediate kin
is prohibited...

262
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,510
It was not political speech,
but an earnest appeal for correction.

263
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,380
An appeal for correction?

264
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,380
And what is it that needs to be corrected?

265
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,980
What is the purpose of a sick ward?

266
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,120
As indicated in the characters,

267
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,300
isn't it a place
where people's lives are saved?

268
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:54,880
However, these days the sick wards
are more like death wards.

269
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,000
Relief rations for the poor are pilfered
to line the pockets of corrupt officials.

270
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,010
Those who are to take care
of the sick people of our country

271
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,000
are being summoned to provide
personal care to the noblemen.

272
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,230
Hyungnim, you who travel the countryside
and imagine yourself a street knight,

273
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,950
I didn't realize you had so much interest
in helping the poor.

274
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,420
Your Majesty probably remembers
the words of Liu Bang advisor Li Yiji.

275
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,560
"A king's life depends on the people,"

276
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,690
"and the people's lives depend on food."

277
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,930
I fear that people suffering
from starvation

278
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,570
may lead your nation into crisis.
That is the reason for my admonition.

279
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,750
What you're saying then

280
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,940
is that my inability to govern properly
will lead this nation into crisis.

281
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,240
Is that what you mean?

282
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,990
If you have interpreted my earnest
and sincere words in that way,

283
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,880
I am filled with remorse.

284
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,280
I pray you understand.

285
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,240
The sick ward is to take in the sick,
not to raise rats!

286
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,530
It might make sense if they were sneaking
into grain storerooms of high officials,

287
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,770
but what sort of rats steal
relief ration grains from the sick ward?

288
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,700
Are you this shameless?

289
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,170
Your words go too far.

290
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,110
Please retract your words.

291
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,910
Please retract them.

292
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,060
My words go too far?

293
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,150
Pebbles mixed in with the grains
to meet specified weights,

294
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,290
so that porridge was made
with only half of the allotted grain.

295
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,190
How bad must it be to have caused rumors

296
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,890
that no one lives after eating
the relief porridge?

297
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,530
Is this to say the paupers
in the sick ward should quietly die off?

298
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:39,850
Your Majesty. Originally, sick wards
are operated by taxes paid by shamans.

299
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,200
With the national treasury
being not abundant as it is,

300
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,570
how could we pour the country's finances
in the sick wards?

301
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,510
The Chief Royal Secretary's words
are absolutely in the right.

302
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,280
If we are to provide relief to the poor,
it will require more expenses.

303
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,090
Then, the shaman's taxes must be raised.
And that is yet another problem.

304
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,620
To operate the sick wards

305
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,180
solely on taxes collected
from shamans is unreasonable.

306
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,200
Even if we have to cut the royal family's
finances or officer salaries,

307
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,440
this issue will absolutely be resolved!

308
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,410
Furthermore!

309
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,240
If there was any shameless embezzling
of relief grains,

310
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,210
and if there was corruption or abuse
in the process of providing relief,

311
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,540
it will have to be thoroughly rectified!

312
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,780
You called for me, Your Majesty?

313
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,200
Did you say that Seongsucheong shaman
entered the King's quarters?

314
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,730
That is so.

315
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,170
From what I understand,
ever since the eclipse,

316
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,870
he's been looking for her.

317
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,410
Immediately go to the King's quarters,
and when Shaman Jang comes out,

318
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,650
bring her here directly.

319
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,180
Yes, Your Highness.

320
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,360
Answer this.

321
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,950
Didn't you yourself say that you left
the Seongsucheong for a period of time?

322
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,000
When was that?

323
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,350
It was eight years ago.

324
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,490
Eight years ago.

325
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,390
The year the Crown Princess died.

326
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,910
Was there a particular reason
why you left the Seongsucheong?

327
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,580
At the time,

328
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,950
my divine powers
were not what they were before.

329
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,740
I left to travel in the mountains,

330
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,590
pray, and restore my powers.

331
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,920
Did something happen
to suddenly exhaust your divine powers?

332
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,230
What is it that you wanted to ask me,
Your Majesty?

333
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,220
Answer me.

334
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,770
With sorcery,
is it possible to kill a person?

335
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,100
With sorcery,
you cannot kill a person.

336
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,400
You cannot kill a person.

337
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:14,070
While there are methods
to kill someone with sorcery,

338
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,380
the person who engages
in that sort of sorcery will die, as well.

339
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,190
If black sorcery is used to kill a person,
a price must absolutely be paid.

340
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,820
So, who would stake their own life
to practice that sort of sorcery.

341
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,540
That is why
I say there is no such sorcery.

342
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,910
Is there any trace of a lie
in what you said?

343
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,720
I have only spoken the truth.

344
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,690
If I have ever used sorcery
to kill someone,

345
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,590
I would also be dead.

346
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,670
Therefore, if I am alive like this,

347
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:04,280
wouldn't that also mean that
no one has died from my sorcery?

348
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,920
Please don't say anything to His Majesty.

349
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,860
I don't want to cause him pain again.

350
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,340
The Queen Dowager
is calling for you.

351
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,270
Why were you called
to the King's quarters?

352
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,990
He just summoned me to see who I was,

353
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,960
as he had heard
the High Shaman had changed.

354
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,560
Who do you think you are lying to?!

355
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,930
In the several years he's been crowned,

356
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,570
His Majesty has shown no interest
in the Seongsucheong.

357
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,740
There must have been a reason why
you were secretly summoned.

358
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,710
Actually, he spoke to me
about my successor.

359
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,880
Your successor...

360
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,280
Are you talking about the girl
sent to the sick ward?

361
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
That is so.

362
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,790
Why would he mention her?

363
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,790
He isn't intending to bring her back
by his side?

364
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,130
No. He wants to avoid
disgraceful rumors about her

365
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,170
and has asked me to have the shamans
watch what they say.

366
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,070
He asked you to keep them quiet?

367
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,640
Is that all?

368
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,980
How could I dare lie to you?

369
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,750
Compared to the day your eyes flashed
and you threatened me,

370
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,050
your tone is quite different.

371
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,290
That day, my successor's life
was hanging by a thread.

372
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,560
My eyes were clouded with desperation
and I committed a terrible sin.

373
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,290
I offer up to you my devoted service
for the rest of my days.

374
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,070
So please...
in your boundless magnanimity,

375
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,510
I pray you will forgive me.

376
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,910
In any case,

377
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:26,950
that child must never again
cause any problem for the King.

378
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,240
I shall heed your words.

379
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,360
Are you aware, Your Highness?

380
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,060
The more you try to block them,

381
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,900
the more you are helping these two.

382
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,060
It is such a strange mystery,
is it not?

383
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,680
Shaman Jang had
the Queen Dowager's favor.

384
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,230
And Her Highness wanted to seat someone
from her clan as Crown Princess.

385
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,900
Therefore, she had Shaman Jang
cast a curse on Yeon Woo.

386
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:11,140
If I have ever used sorcery
to kill someone,

387
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,500
I would also be dead.

388
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,300
Therefore, if I am alive like this,

389
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,960
wouldn't that also mean that no one
has died from my sorcery?

390
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,870
You seem to mean that if one
who practiced black sorcery is alive,

391
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,710
the subject must also be alive.

392
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,050
The fact that
after she had lost her breath,

393
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,980
the body was warm for over 2 hours.

394
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,250
She could be alive.

395
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,830
What is the matter with you?

396
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,760
We saved your life, what kind of behavior
is this in response?

397
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,360
Shaman.

398
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,430
Go perform an exorcism or whatever,
just do something.

399
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,990
Kkeut Soon,

400
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,260
have some barley porridge.
You need to get your energy back.

401
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,300
Are you trying to die?

402
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,660
Just tell me. I'll keep your secret.

403
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,610
Why are you trying to die?

404
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:48,220
If I live,
my parents won't be happy anyway.

405
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,990
If I live,
all I'll amount to is a worthless leech.

406
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,910
What are you talking about?

407
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The day you were all but dying,

408
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,110
he carried you on his back
and walked 30 ri.

409
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,240
You're saying that he wouldn't be happy
if his daughter lived?

410
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,420
If I'm gone,
my family has one less mouth to feed.

411
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,390
Then, my mom and dad
won't have to suffer so much.

412
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,630
I know that all too well.

413
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,650
I was young then too,
so I thought that if only I disappeared,

414
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,820
all of my family...

415
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,110
...could go on and have a good life.

416
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,620
That if I just disappeared,
it would be over.

417
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,570
But, if suddenly one day

418
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,380
the daughter you love disappears,

419
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,250
what parent on earth could be all right?

420
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,700
However you can,
you must live on together.

421
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,810
The value in that itself
is plenty and what family means.

422
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,710
Don't ever give in to weak thoughts
of dying and such again.

423
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,560
Please, say it isn't so.

424
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,920
Say that you are not Heo Yeon Woo,
that you are just Shaman Wol.

425
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,450
And so, you have no bond
with His Majesty.

426
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,630
Oh. Lord, when did you come?

427
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,990
I just came.

428
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,070
Lord, I brought them as you instructed.

429
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,570
Good work. Wait just a moment.

430
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,590
Now, now.

431
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,990
Put it here, here.

432
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,360
Aigoo.

433
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,630
Wow, what sort of leaves are these?

434
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,610
I went to complain at the district office,
but the procedures were so complicated!

435
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,780
I'd have died trying to figure it out.

436
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,380
So even though I'm a little embarrassed,

437
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,650
I decided to show off my affluence
a little instead.

438
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,740
What are you looking at like that?

439
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,920
Now that you've seen my affluence,

440
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,170
have you suddenly developed
an interest in me?

441
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,260
I brought something to give you.

442
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,970
This is a book called
"Collection of Types of Treatment".

443
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,580
In a word, a medical encyclopedia.

444
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,440
If you read it, it should be useful
in many ways, so please take it.

445
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,450
As a matter of fact, I was thinking
it would be good to study some medicine.

446
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,850
Would it be all right for me
to accept this?

447
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,590
Didn't I just say
I brought it to give to you?

448
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,550
Well, if you insist on refusing it,
you could just use it to fuel a fire.

449
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,500
I shall accept.

450
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,520
You should have responded
like that earlier.

451
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,110
If you get stuck on anything as you read,
you can ask me about it.

452
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,110
To think that I will be parting
with these clothes I used as disguise...

453
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,490
My tears are clouding my way.

454
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,000
Particularly, this one.

455
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,870
Whenever I wore this out,

456
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,340
the ladies would fall in love with me
at first sight and collapse.

457
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,190
Do you disguise yourself as a woman,
as well?

458
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,690
Ah, that, you can keep if you want.

459
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,660
Seriously?

460
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,460
I can give it to Jan Shil.

461
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,600
You can't do that!

462
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,030
Actually,

463
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,960
there's somewhere
I really want to go with you.

464
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,880
I had it made particularly to match
your facial skin tone.

465
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,410
So, it wouldn't be suitable
for another woman.

466
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,150
Did you say there was somewhere
you want to go with me?

467
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,890
Yes.

468
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:25,610
Can I ask where that is?

469
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:35,040
It is the house of my longtime friend
and my teacher I told you about earlier.

470
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:06,400
If she is alive,
why hasn't she shown herself to me?

471
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:13,280
- Why?
- I was waiting.

472
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,690
Why have you come so late?

473
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,390
I shall name you Wol.

474
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,760
Wol.

475
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,050
Who are you?

476
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,200
Tell me!

477
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,340
What is your true identity?!

478
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,720
I am not the person you want.

479
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,550
In the memories of your past life,
am I...

480
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,260
Am I not there?!

481
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,260
Please, I entreat you.

482
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,940
Please, ask no more questions.

483
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,710
No matter what you ask,

484
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,150
I cannot provide the answer
Your Majesty wants.

485
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,510
Then, why does she pretend
not to know me?

486
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,790
The look in her eyes was definitely
not the look of someone lying.

487
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,980
And on top of that,

488
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,240
it's been confirmed
that Yeon Woo was buried.

489
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,820
It would make no sense.

490
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,420
It's impossible.

491
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,220
But...

492
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,000
You mean His Majesty?

493
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,470
Yes.

494
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,290
Regarding the death of the Crown Princess
eight years ago,

495
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,700
I have received a royal order
to do a secret reinvestigation.

496
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,230
If His Majesty asked you to do that,

497
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,170
does it mean there is some suspicion
around our Yeon Woo's death?

498
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,590
I'm sorry, Lord.

499
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,710
Until I receive an order,

500
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,980
I cannot divulge any information.

501
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,090
There is hardly anybody that remembers
the events from eight years ago,

502
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,390
so I have shamelessly come to you
for help.

503
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,300
Please tell me what you know.

504
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,120
I was sent to my uncle's home at the time
to avoid the illness,

505
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,590
so I only saw her funeral.

506
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,070
I was not able to be by her side
in her last hours.

507
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,250
I'm sorry for asking. Forgive me.

508
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,740
Don't be sorry.

509
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,810
Rather, I am sorry
I can't be of more help.

510
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,870
Farewell, my Lord.

511
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,740
What are you doing, my Lord?

512
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,590
Don't refuse me.

513
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,390
Aigoo.

514
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:14,190
I have a few things to ask you.

515
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,470
Ah, I see.

516
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,580
Is that you, Prince Yang Myung?

517
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,690
Young Master,
the lady's memory has returned.

518
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,690
Now, could we possibly
all live together as before?

519
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,350
Mother, it is Yeom.

520
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,020
What are you doing?

521
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:32,860
I'm sending the clothes we don't
normally wear and grains to the sick ward.

522
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,010
So, I'm just organizing.

523
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,820
This is what you do each year
around this time.

524
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,430
What if I were to go with you this year?

525
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,460
That would be nice.

526
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,790
But this time,
rather than the eastern sick ward,

527
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,520
I'm thinking of going
to the western sick ward.

528
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:58,160
Is it because you are concerned about
that girl who resembles our Yeon Woo?

529
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,710
Even if it's not Yeon Woo,
the girl must have parents, too.

530
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,080
If her parents had seen
their daughter like that,

531
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,680
how heartbroken they would be.

532
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,280
If I see her again,

533
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:29,220
I'd just like to provide
some warm comfort.

534
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,600
But, what brings you here?

535
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,860
I just came.

536
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:49,930
The King has ordered to
secretly re-investigate Yeon Woo's death.

537
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,180
His Majesty?

538
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,150
Everyone was so preoccupied then,

539
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:04,330
and I didn't say much
for fear of upsetting people,

540
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,760
but there is one thing I never mentioned.

541
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,100
Heavens! You are frustrating!

542
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,700
I could die here waiting.

543
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,410
Don't hesitate. Just speak.

544
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,520
I went to the grave the next day,

545
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,530
and maybe some beast dug at it
during the night,

546
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,720
but there were traces of the grave
being dug up all around.

547
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,660
-Traces that the grave was dug up.
-Our poor Miss.

548
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,950
Aigoo! Isn't that Seol?

549
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,880
Shaman Wol is being captured
on suspicion of treason.

550
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,510
You must be mistaken.

551
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,120
Do you know that girl?

552
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,290
Um, well...
I can't be certain, but...

553
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:24,220
Did you just say that
Maiden Yeon Woo's grave had been dug up?

554
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,580
Yes.

555
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,810
But it appears only the attendant
of the family knew of this.

556
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,080
There is also one more strange thing.

557
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,550
Strange thing?

558
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,790
Every place I go in my investigation,
there's a girl that appears.

559
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,690
-A girl?
-Yes.

560
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,600
I saw her outside
of Court Lady No's house last time,

561
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:51,200
and today, I saw her in front
of the Prince Consort's house.

562
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,680
According to the attendant,

563
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:59,410
she seems to be the young lady's slave.

564
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,780
But...

565
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,300
But?

566
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,450
From what I know, that girl
is definitely Shaman Wol's slave.

567
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,810
Hyung Sun.

568
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

569
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,800
Summon the High Shaman
of the Seongsucheong immediately.

570
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,990
Immediately!

571
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,200
Sorcery.

572
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,490
A corpse with a temperature
that doesn't drop.

573
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,840
A rushed funeral without preparing
or shrouding the body.

574
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,280
A dug up grave.

575
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,080
A murder that leaves no trace.

576
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,080
Sorcery again.

577
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,370
The Seongsucheong.
High Shaman Jang.

578
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,130
Moreover, appearing at
every location that's investigated,

579
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,680
is Wol's slave.

580
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,160
Now, all that's left
is confirmation.

581
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,640
You called for me, Your Majesty?

582
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,890
Why are you acting this way,
Your Majesty?

583
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:50,790
What in the world did you see
to make you shake so?

584
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,690
Heo...

585
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,090
Heo Yeon Woo!

586
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,730
The girl is alive.

587
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,300
Mother.

588
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,780
How can...

589
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,400
That child died eight years ago.

590
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,320
How can a child
that has already been buried...

591
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,920
I'm certain it was her.

592
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,540
Close to me,
close to His Majesty.

593
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,750
I never dreamed she had come so close.

594
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:30,260
I'm certain she's going to chase me out
and take my place.

595
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,980
Mother!

596
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,460
Be firm in your resolve.

597
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:41,000
The position was
originally yours to begin with!

598
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,700
You did not take it from her!

599
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:47,430
It's because you think that way
that you keep hallucinating.

600
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,440
It was not a hallucination!

601
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,580
Your Majesty!

602
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,340
Why are you acting this way?!

603
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,580
I know everything!

604
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,250
Father...

605
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:03,490
Father had that child Yeon Woo killed.

606
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,530
To make me Crown Princess,

607
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,360
Father had that child Yeon Woo...

608
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,620
It will be fine
if Your Highness just keeps silent.

609
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,060
Even if that were the case,
even if it were,

610
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,750
you must be all the more silent.

611
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,890
Please trust in your father.

612
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,430
Go! Go!

613
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,240
Your Majesty...

614
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,890
The face that I feel
I've seen before.

615
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:10,030
I have absolutely
never practiced such sorcery.

616
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,060
Whose daughter are you?

617
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,530
I am Director Heo's daughter,
Heo Yeon Woo.

618
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:20,370
Director Heo's daughter,
Heo Yeon Woo?

619
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,180
That child is alive?

620
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,200
What has happened?

621
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,780
It couldn't be.

622
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:32,910
Could it be
the work of High Shaman Jang?

623
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,960
From this moment on, you will answer
in complete honesty all my questions.

624
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:47,350
If you evade answering
or play tricks with words,

625
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,070
you shall not be able
to avoid severe punishment.

626
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,350
Do you understand?

627
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,730
Please ask your questions.

628
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,270
Is Shaman Wol your successor?

629
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,640
That is so.

630
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,740
When did you take her in as such?

631
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,730
It was eight years ago.

632
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:13,040
When a shaman says she is cutting her ties
with her past life,

633
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,940
does it mean she is intentionally
not choosing to remember,

634
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,400
or does it mean she can't?

635
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:28,200
A shaman primarily cuts her ties
with her past life on her own will...

636
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,020
...but occasionally,

637
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,680
a shaman comes back to life
from the torture of death,

638
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,750
and loses the memory of her past life.

639
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,650
I have seen this.

640
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,760
Back to life from the torture of death...

641
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,900
...for example, could
you be talking about...

642
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,200
...the shock and terror
of being trapped in a grave?

643
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,970
And so, what happened to that shaman?

644
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:07,890
Has she regained her memory,

645
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,210
or is she still unaware of who she is?

646
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,320
I will ask you a final question.

647
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,700
That shaman, that shaman's name...

648
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,300
...is it Wol?

649
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,270
Answer me!

650
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,760
Is the shaman named Wol
none other than...

651
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,610
...Heo Yeon Woo,
who died eight years ago?!

652
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,920
Wo do you think you are?!

653
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,400
You are not even a person,

654
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,300
and you dare to put your hands
on the King?

655
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,370
Just because I give you a place
at my side,

656
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,510
do you believe
I've given you my heart, as well?

657
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,240
You are merely a human talisman.
Nothing more, nothing less!

658
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:21,980
Please be firm in your mindset.

659
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,120
Do not allow pity to sway
your earnest integrity any longer.

660
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,450
Don't come near me.

661
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,190
If you cross the line once more,

662
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,690
I will not forgive you.

663
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,490
Go and never appear
before me again.

664
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,230
That shaman's name...

665
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,700
Is the shaman named Wol
none other than

666
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,710
Heo Yeon Woo,
who died eight years ago?!

667
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,920
Yeon Woo.

668
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,840
Don't come near me.

669
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,570
Who are you to...

670
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,910
Who do you think you are?!

671
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:30,080
It's disloyal, hold back, abandon it,
give it up, hide it, don't be swayed!

672
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,580
I shall no longer live
for the sake of others.

673
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,120
Did you say I would be bewitched?

674
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,190
Did you say therefore,
I must shake her off?

675
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,120
I've been bewitched.

676
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,090
But, I cannot shake her off.

677
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:50,100
That I very much,
so very much, loved her.

678
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,100
Because I like you.

679
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:54,500
Because I like you.

680
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,940
The person I'm looking at is you.

681
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:03,210
I couldn't be the person in my dreams,
could I?

682
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:06,050
I couldn't become her, could I?

683
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,060
Who gave you permission to leave?

684
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,290
Who said you have finished
your duty?!

685
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:13,460
Whether it is that child,
or just you,

686
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,670
until I understand
what this feeling is,

687
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,300
do not dare

688
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,260
go far from me.
