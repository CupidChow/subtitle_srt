1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,970
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,560
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historic basis.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,560
Episode 5

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,670
From now on, you will begin training
for the marriage ceremony.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,660
When you bow, make sure
the candle light doesn't flicker.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,630
And you must move your body quietly.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,100
The bow you will make
during the wedding ceremony

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,610
requires you to bend your body
as straight as an arrow.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,880
Make sure you don't lower your head,
so always beware.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,880
Did you sleep well?

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,120
Today, you will probably start
your difficult training.

12
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,430
It will be lonely and hard.

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,350
But Yeon Woo, if it's you,
I know you'll be strong and endure it.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,060
Court Lady Noh is probably
anxious because of you.

15
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,270
It is a letter that the Crown Prince
wanted to pass on to you.

16
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,960
The palace is heavily guarded,
so I cannot see you this instant.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,870
But I'll treasure this moment.

18
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,890
And I'll be waiting.

19
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,520
For the day when you become
my Crown Princess.

20
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,140
Are the preparations all done?

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,390
Yes.

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,660
Did you bring her?

23
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,080
Yes.

24
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,610
Here is the paper with birth characters
and the clothes she wore at home.

25
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,010
So, please start.

26
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,080
Is it finished now?

27
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,730
Yes.

28
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,670
So, when can I expect to hear
from the palace guards?

29
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,670
That is something my ability
cannot control.

30
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,090
Didn't you say that it is a magic
that will cut off her lifeline?

31
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,940
There is no magic that can instantly
cut off a life that heaven has given.

32
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,450
So you're leaving it up to fate?

33
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,540
Don't worry.

34
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,100
She will suffer from
a persistent, unknown illness.

35
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,790
Then, she will die naturally after.

36
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,040
That's true.

37
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,980
If she died suddenly,
there would be suspicion.

38
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,470
This is actually better.

39
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Even if he is the king,

40
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,140
he cannot keep
an ill person in the palace.

41
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,980
As long as there are no palace guards,

42
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,990
that child's life is not
in the hands of God, but ours.

43
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,570
That's actually for the better.

44
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,340
But if she does not die
at an appropriate time...

45
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,760
...you will have
to finish her off yourself.

46
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,990
Oh, dear.

47
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,680
Did that frighten you?

48
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,100
Everything's over now, so please relax.

49
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,530
Don't worry.

50
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,920
Now you will have
everything you want, Princess.

51
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,870
Your Highness!

52
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,340
Crown Princess!

53
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,120
Call for the doctor quickly. Quickly!

54
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,150
Yes.

55
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,110
Your Highness, can you hear me?

56
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,260
Your Highness!

57
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,580
Your Highness!

58
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,040
Your Highness!

59
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,680
May you remove the Princess Successor
from the palace, Your Majesty!

60
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,040
It has been many days since she took ill,
and there is no improvement.

61
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,110
This is definitely an illness
she did not get overnight.

62
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,550
Neither is it an illness that just needs
a few days of treatment.

63
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,630
Though the wedding hasn't been held,
she's no different from a Crown Princess.

64
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,630
We ought to let her stay in the palace
to receive treatment.

65
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,250
Letting a patient stay in the palace
is something that should not be done.

66
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,060
If by any chance the illness
were to spread through the palace,

67
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,480
how would you deal with that misfortune?

68
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,150
What you've said is too much!

69
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,560
Are you saying that the Crown Princess
is causing an epidemic?

70
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,150
It is not a normal sickness.

71
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,420
It is a strange disease
that has never been seen before.

72
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,790
The Crown Princess's illness
is one with no cure!

73
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,170
If she continues to receive treatment,
she will get better.

74
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,410
Your Majesty.

75
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,270
I'm the Minister of Personnel,
Yoon Dae Hyung.

76
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,150
In time to come, the Crown Princess
will bear the royal heir.

77
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,280
It is important that the heir
does not inherit any illness.

78
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,530
How can you treat a sick person
as the country's princess?

79
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,700
Postponing the royal marriage
indefinitely...

80
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,800
...will create political problems
for the country.

81
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
As soon as we can...

82
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,400
...we need to find a reasonable solution.

83
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,250
So.

84
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,070
What is this reasonable solution
you are suggesting?

85
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,470
The Crown Princess who hid her illness
should be removed.

86
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,860
After that, a more appropriate
Crown Princess should be chosen.

87
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,590
Furthermore,

88
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,670
the father who hid his daughter's illness
and listed her for selection...

89
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,320
...and the one who hid
his family's illness

90
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,220
and entered the Sigangwon, Heo Yeom...

91
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,080
...should be held accountable
for their crimes.

92
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,450
Why are you suddenly here
without any notification?

93
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,760
The patient can no longer
stay in the palace.

94
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,540
There is a court order
to remove her quickly.

95
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,090
How can that be so sudden?

96
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,810
Even so, give me some time
to pack her things.

97
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,870
As the illness may be infectious,

98
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,750
we have to burn all things
in this part of the palace.

99
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,820
Don't leave a thing and burn it all.

100
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,770
Can't you get out of my way?

101
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,680
She's my princess!

102
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,180
How dare you turn her out
without my permission?!

103
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,970
-Get out of my way!
-Your Highness.

104
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,590
-Be mindful, your Highness.
-Get out of my w...

105
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,790
Your Highness.

106
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,390
Yeon Woo.

107
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,290
Yeon Woo!

108
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,540
Yeon Woo.

109
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,970
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo!

110
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,700
Yeon Woo.

111
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,100
Yeon Woo!

112
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,060
Yeon Woo!

113
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,820
Yeon Woo.

114
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,930
You're my princess.

115
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,080
Get out of my way.

116
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeon Woo.

117
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,350
-Get out.
-Your Highness.

118
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,330
Yeon Woo.

119
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,800
Yeon Woo.

120
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,750
Yeon Woo.

121
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,890
Yeon Woo.

122
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,250
Yeon Woo.

123
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,240
You'll have to be watchful
of the Crown Prince.

124
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,950
If Director Heo's daughter is removed,

125
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,730
he will definitely not just stand by.

126
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,670
The Crown Prince
does not understand politics yet.

127
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,110
Do you think so?

128
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,060
It is nothing but pure affection.

129
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,440
Even when there were debates
about the selection,

130
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,640
didn't the Crown Prince's
palace stay quiet?

131
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,140
Instead, the Sungkyunkwan scholars
made a move.

132
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,310
The Sungkyunkwan,
which has been quiet all this time,

133
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,090
chose to cry out in protest
during the selection.

134
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,180
Because of them,
His Majesty has gained power.

135
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,210
It is the same for the Sigangwon.

136
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,740
The people that His Majesty
playfully chased out of the Sigangwon...

137
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,340
...were all people recommended
by our side.

138
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,770
In the end, the one who became
the Crown Prince's teacher

139
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,150
was Heo Young Jae's son, Heo Yeom.

140
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,880
It's not that the Crown Prince
does not understand politics.

141
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,590
It's just that before he becomes king...

142
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,470
...he is putting on a naive persona
to camouflage himself.

143
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,040
Tender young stems

144
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,690
have to be pruned at the right time

145
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,870
for them to take on the shape you want,
don't you agree?

146
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,430
Crown Prince.

147
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,340
Grandmother.

148
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,570
Your heart must be aching so much.

149
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,460
Crown Prince.

150
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,430
Yes, Grandmother?

151
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,790
Now...

152
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,180
...please forget about that child.

153
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,570
She was appointed as my Crown Princess.

154
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,440
How can you tell me
to forget her so easily?

155
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,440
You must forget her,

156
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,980
so that the child
and the royal family can be calm.

157
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,110
Grandmother!

158
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,980
Just let it be
and follow what's befitting you.

159
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,180
What's befitting me!

160
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,360
And what would that be?

161
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,300
The orders that I must follow.

162
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,670
Who exactly is the one who set them?

163
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,390
Crown Prince.

164
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,100
What did you gain from moving
the scholars of Sungkyunkwan?

165
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,190
Other than giving the scholars some power,

166
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,550
you have gained nothing, am I not right?

167
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,290
If His Majesty and the Crown Prince
were not greedy for her...

168
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,110
...she could have been a child
who lived a normal life.

169
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,470
If she weren't selected
to be the Crown Princess,

170
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,170
what would have been the problem
in her taking ill?

171
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,900
By receiving her mother's care...

172
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,780
...she could have been comfortable.

173
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:19,150
See, who has received happiness
from your actions?

174
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,930
If that child becomes miserable,

175
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,850
it will be because of you, Crown Prince.

176
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,840
If her brother's wings are bent...

177
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,830
...it will again be because of you,
Crown Prince.

178
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,410
If His Majesty were to lose
his reputation,

179
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,540
that too will be
because of you, Crown Prince.

180
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,510
If the Director Heo's family
were to be eliminated,

181
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,510
that will be all because of you.

182
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,370
It causes more damage
to oppose than to comply.

183
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,290
That's why, for those who have
experienced setbacks,

184
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,330
in order to avoid suffering or breaking...

185
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,350
...follow and comply with the rules.

186
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,840
That's compliance.

187
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,750
So, don't do anything.

188
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,270
Remain quiet.

189
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,790
That way...

190
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,050
...no one will get hurt.

191
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,120
Really, that's very strange.

192
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,160
In my thirty years as a physician,
it's the first time I see this.

193
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,810
There seems to be nothing wrong
with her internal organs,

194
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,500
and she is healthy,
but she has these symptoms.

195
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,420
It's dumbfounding.

196
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,810
Yeon Woo, what's wrong?

197
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,330
Please save this child.

198
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,210
If you can save this child,
I'll do anything.

199
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,310
I'll prescribe this medicine for her,
but don't expect miracles...

200
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,190
How can you say
something so irresponsible?

201
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,460
She's in so much pain.

202
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,780
-You should at least lessen her pain!
-Wife!

203
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,580
How can you act so rudely?

204
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,640
Enough!

205
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,140
Calm down, Mother.

206
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,580
Please save her.

207
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,980
I'm willing to make shoes out
of my hair for you.

208
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,910
If you tell me to sacrifice my life,
I will do it.

209
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,300
So please!

210
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,090
Our Yeon Woo!

211
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,580
Our Yeon Woo!

212
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,260
-Wife!
-Mother!

213
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,320
-Take her to the other room, quickly!
-Mother!

214
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,430
You go with them as well.

215
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,910
How do you do?

216
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,450
Who are you?

217
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,170
I'm Seongsucheong's High Shaman,
Jang Nok Young.

218
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,070
You should be at the palace.

219
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,250
So what brings you here?

220
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,880
A divine energy brought me here.

221
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,860
What do you mean, a divine energy?

222
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,790
I came without anyone's knowledge.

223
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,400
So please don't worry.

224
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,650
May I see the young miss for a moment?

225
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,270
The miss has a mystical illness.

226
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,870
The heavens are helping us.

227
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,300
What perfect timing
for this illness to occur.

228
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,350
Starting tomorrow,
let's start making recommendations.

229
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,040
What about exile to a faraway place?

230
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,230
For a Confucian scholar,

231
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,260
exile is like a picnic.

232
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,890
Did you say a picnic?

233
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,980
There are hundreds of scholars
who follow Heo Young Jae.

234
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,570
Being exiled could give him
the opportunity to gather people.

235
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,310
Although His Majesty would
temporarily lose a trusted confidant...

236
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,330
...the moment he is released
from his exile...

237
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,780
...he will gain great power.

238
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,890
Since we're there, let's go with poison.

239
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,330
There's no need for poison.

240
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,480
When you have wings,

241
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,700
not being able to fly
is the greatest pain of all.

242
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,570
Slowly.

243
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,720
Let's do this slowly.

244
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,680
What if the Crown Princess's illness
were to be suddenly cured?

245
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,830
That child will not return to the palace.

246
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,410
Unless she becomes a ghost.

247
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,000
Or rises from her grave.

248
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,830
Are you going to...

249
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,250
...kill Yeon Woo?

250
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,780
Are you afraid of your father?

251
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,560
Do you feel pity for that child?

252
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,220
Anyway...

253
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,070
...it is that child's fate to die
when the time comes.

254
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,760
Of course if the time is delayed...

255
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,230
...we will have to take things
into our own hands.

256
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,730
Why do you think
I'm telling you the truth?

257
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,660
It's because...

258
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,430
...you need to understand.

259
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,560
Understand?

260
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,690
Do you know what people
were calling your father...

261
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,460
...for a period of time?

262
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,950
A mourner's dog.
The Queen Dowager's hidden knot.

263
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,060
It's an invaluable name,

264
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,070
that I got from a certain member
of the royal blood line.

265
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,180
That humiliation and anger.

266
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,360
I have never once forgotten it!

267
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,460
So, I've paid them back for it.

268
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,300
That's how I have come
to my position now!

269
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,140
Didn't you say you wanted
to live in the palace?

270
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,220
Didn't you say you wanted
to gain the Crown Prince's love?

271
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,450
Then,

272
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,110
rid yourself of any pity or guilt
that you feel!

273
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,530
Instead,

274
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,960
remember the humiliation you feel
when something is stolen from you.

275
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,390
Remember the joy you feel
when you get what you want.

276
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,770
If you don't have that understanding...

277
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,230
...then don't you ever desire
that position again.

278
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,510
An invocatory rite?

279
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,580
If she doesn't accept the spirit world,

280
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,020
her suffering will never end.

281
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,520
That's impossible.

282
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,010
No one in our family has ever suffered
from witchcraft before.

283
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,770
Why does it have to be my child?

284
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,510
I don't know why the gods
have chosen the young miss.

285
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,870
But she refused to accept them,
which is why she has fallen ill.

286
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,850
What will you do?

287
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,070
Will you let her accept
the spiritual world?

288
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,720
Is there no way
to dispel the spirit from her?

289
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,970
There is a solution.

290
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,360
What is it?

291
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,400
But...

292
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,830
...the price is death.

293
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,870
I'll sacrifice my life.

294
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,100
The young miss will have
to sacrifice her own.

295
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,830
Please remove the Crown Princess,
Your Majesty.

296
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,790
Please remove her.

297
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,140
Please choose a new Crown Princess.

298
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,520
Our country needs safekeeping,
Your Majesty.

299
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,420
Yoon Dae Hyung!

300
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,660
Your Highness! Your Highness!

301
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,310
Where do you plan on going?

302
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,920
I'm going to the Palace Hall
to make His Majesty retract his order.

303
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,040
Your Highness, please control yourself.

304
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,860
The consequences will be unthinkable!

305
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,200
Please calm down first.

306
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,760
Calm down.

307
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,230
Your Highness.

308
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,750
Your Highness.

309
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,240
The officials whom Director Heo
had controlled have turned against him.

310
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,440
Is there anyone in this palace who
isn't Yoon Dae Hyung's man?

311
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,180
And, how many more will become his?!

312
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,030
Your Highness, please calm down.

313
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,860
I'm really useless.

314
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,560
Please stop blaming yourself.

315
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,910
The Crown Princess was forced out
back to her home.

316
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,100
Tutor Heo, too...

317
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,000
...has been forbidden
from entering the palace,

318
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,140
just because a family member is sick.

319
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,910
At a time like this...

320
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,540
...Yang Myung isn't here, either.

321
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,570
Now in the palace
I have no one on my side.

322
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,150
Kim Jae Woon is not a person.

323
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,850
He's a sword devil. A sword devil.

324
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,720
Does it make sense for that swordsmanship
to go with that face?

325
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,150
He inherited his looks from his mother,
a courtesan in the city.

326
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,110
And he inherited his swordsmanship
from his father, the governor.

327
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,310
He has perfect antecedents,
don't you agree?

328
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,080
It's such a pity.

329
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,950
If he weren't an illegitimate son,

330
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,740
he would certainly have had
an amazing career.

331
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,030
Your Highness, what brings you
to this place?

332
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,360
I was feeling extremely irritated
all day today,

333
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,380
when I suddenly recalled
the nightmare ball match we had.

334
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,780
I have become even more irritated.

335
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,100
-You.
-Yes, Your Highness.

336
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,550
For some strange reason,
you keep coming into my view.

337
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,200
Were you the highest scorer on that day?

338
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,190
No, I was not.

339
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,170
I am full of desire to win,
but I lack the ability.

340
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,430
Then...

341
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,310
...who was that person?

342
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,590
It was Kim Jae Woon.

343
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
You and you. Both of you.

344
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,180
Come with me.

345
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,270
I didn't see him like that.

346
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,840
His Highness is such a petty person.

347
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,800
That happened so long ago!

348
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,350
They wouldn't be dismissed
because of this issue, would they?

349
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,840
I'm not sure if this will fit you.

350
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,310
Just put this on for now.

351
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,000
You probably know well enough.

352
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,370
But if anything leaks out about this,

353
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,360
your life will be at stake.

354
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,840
Yes.

355
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,410
Yeon Woo.

356
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,220
Yeon Woo.

357
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,390
Yeon Woo.

358
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,490
Yeon Woo.

359
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,530
Can you recognize me?

360
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,450
It doesn't matter.

361
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,100
As long as I can recognize you...

362
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,930
...it's fine.

363
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,100
Yeon Woo.

364
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,100
Are you real?

365
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,480
What do you mean?

366
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,890
You're not an illusion...

367
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,870
...but the real Crown Prince?

368
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,510
I'm not an illusion.

369
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,290
I have really come to see you.

370
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,740
You're foolish, aren't you?

371
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,310
What is this?

372
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,840
It is 'The Moon that Embraces the Sun.'

373
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,310
The King is the sun...

374
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,360
...and the Queen is the moon.

375
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:20,080
This phoenix hairpin symbolizes
the white moon embracing the red sun.

376
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,600
Therefore, I named it
The Moon that Embraces the Sun.

377
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,000
The Moon that Embraces the Sun.

378
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,290
The real Crown Princess in my heart
is only you, Yeon Woo.

379
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:48,490
So, quickly regain your health
and return by my side.

380
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,830
Your Highness.

381
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,820
Tell me.

382
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,460
I am very sorry.

383
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,590
What for?

384
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,230
The first day I met you...

385
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,290
...I wrongly accused you of being a thief.

386
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,530
I am very sorry.

387
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:25,330
I was rude and disrespectful to you.

388
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,840
I am very sorry.

389
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,420
Yes, that is something
worth being sorry for.

390
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,000
It is all my fault.

391
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,440
I do not blame you at all.

392
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,340
So...

393
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,490
...no matter what happens...

394
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,040
...please don't blame yourself.

395
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,290
A gentleman doesn't resent the heavens...

396
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,350
...or bear grudges against the people.

397
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,220
Yes.

398
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,270
Your Highness.

399
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,870
You don't have to keep addressing me.

400
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,810
Tell me.

401
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,320
For me...

402
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,140
...meeting you...

403
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,020
...made me really happy.

404
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,780
You will continue to be happy...

405
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,960
...so don't say such things.

406
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,710
Serving as escort
on a dangerous mission like this...

407
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,250
...it doesn't suit you at all.

408
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,820
Because it happened so suddenly,

409
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,880
I removed the other people.

410
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,400
If anything were to happen
to His Highness...

411
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,620
The whole family
who is with her is not ill,

412
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,800
so how can it only affect His Highness?

413
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,570
When missing someone is an illness,
it becomes an even bigger danger.

414
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,140
Did you know?

415
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,800
His Highness wants you
to escort him as his guard.

416
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:03,160
Did Yeon Woo
inadvertently help him do that?

417
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,080
That child. I think she likes you.

418
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,970
I'm not sure about that.
I think it's a bit different.

419
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,620
She seems really interested
in swordsmanship.

420
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,990
And that sharp swordsmanship of hers...

421
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,090
...certainly reminds of you.

422
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,030
Your name is Kim Jae Woon, right?

423
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,010
Yes.

424
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,240
Yang Myung and Tutor Heo
just call you Woon, right?

425
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,970
That's correct.

426
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,410
Can I also call you Woon?

427
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

428
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,520
Woon.

429
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,010
Thank you.

430
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,280
I wanted to see at least once...

431
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,490
...the place where the Crown Princess
was born and raised.

432
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:28,130
The Crown Princess is suffering so much.

433
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,470
And yet I am unable
to do anything for her.

434
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,570
Your Highness.

435
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,350
I am this country's Crown Prince.

436
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,360
Just because I am
this country's Crown Prince...

437
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,540
...I am useless.

438
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,980
You're just a lonely and sad
Sung Jun Ma Cho.

439
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,340
Following the moon at night.

440
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,340
Following the sun during the day.

441
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,350
The lonely Sung Jun Ma Cho.

442
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,390
But, what is ma cho?

443
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,290
The horse's ma, the grass's cho.

444
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,260
It's a symbolizes a man like me,
who is unruly.

445
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,200
Then, what is Sung Jun Ma Cho?

446
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,520
You could say that he's a man
who is unruly and yet full of innocence.

447
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,820
Let us end it there,
for I'm beginning to feel ashamed.

448
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,170
Is that it?

449
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,480
Yes, that's the marketplace.

450
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,100
Oh, is that so?

451
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,850
Here. Go buy a bowl of soup to eat.

452
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,500
Thank you very much.

453
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,620
All right, shall I try
to sell you off now?

454
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,190
With ten wins in ten fights,
the undefeated legend, Big Grizzly Bear!

455
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,730
You must win! Win!

456
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,720
Big Grizzly Bear wins!

457
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,040
Now, do we have any other challengers?

458
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,680
With the current reward,
the winner can buy a cow!

459
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,360
Are there any other challengers?

460
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,140
Then, will Big Grizzly Bear
become the champion?

461
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,990
Here I am.

462
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,320
Yes.

463
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,960
A new challenger has appeared.

464
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:24,440
Will this challenger be able to defeat
Big Grizzly Bear, the undefeated legend?

465
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,170
Hey, what is your name?

466
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,350
Sung Jun Ma Cho.

467
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,490
Yes.

468
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,370
Sung Jun Skirt!

469
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,260
No.

470
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,570
I am Sung Jun Ma Cho.

471
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,170
Yes, Big Grizzly Bear VS Sung Jun Skirt!

472
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,380
-Give a moment for the sales!
-Place your bets!

473
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,540
All come and place your bets.

474
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,140
Your bets.

475
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,770
Just like between men,

476
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,030
how there's someone
who deserves to be king

477
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,850
and someone who will become subject.

478
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,530
It's the same for women.

479
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You really don't regret the road
that you've chosen, right?

480
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,060
Aigoo, I ought to...

481
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,180
-Innkeeper, bring a cup here.
-Yes.

482
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,550
What is it? Did something happen?

483
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,240
The magistrate is raising taxes again.

484
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,600
What? What the hell?

485
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,420
Without any effort, all that money
goes to the Yoon clan.

486
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,570
It's like this now.

487
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,900
It'll be worse if the Crown Princess
is changed to a member of the Yoon clan.

488
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,480
What's the point of talking?

489
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,370
The Crown Princess was driven
out of the palace due to an illness,

490
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,540
and has been unconscious
these past few days.

491
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,290
Now, they're just waiting for her to die.

492
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,510
The Crown Princess is changing?

493
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,780
What are you talking about?

494
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,870
Who are you?
Why are you acting like this?

495
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,750
They're waiting
for the Crown Princess to die?

496
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,280
What are you talking about?

497
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,880
Stay alive, Yeon Woo.

498
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,870
Please stay alive.

499
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,070
What did you just say?

500
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,070
I'm telling you to go to your uncle
for a while to avoid the illness.

501
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:36,650
Father.

502
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,900
You are this family's eldest son
and the Crown Prince's man.

503
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,880
Yeon Woo is on the verge of death,

504
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,750
so how can you have your son
evade this calamity?

505
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,080
Just go.

506
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,020
I cannot.

507
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,000
At the least, I have to know
what Yeon Woo is suffering from.

508
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,260
It's an illness that the medical experts
cannot understand.

509
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,990
How could you?

510
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,310
I will search all the medical books
in the world.

511
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,750
And I will find it out.

512
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,630
Have you forgotten
that you are His Highness' tutor?

513
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,880
If I can not even protect my sister,
how can I help the Crown Prince?

514
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,700
For someone as educated as you,
how can you be so narrow in thinking?

515
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,460
Who will help
the Crown Prince in the future?

516
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,610
You. You have to help him.

517
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,540
That is the only way you and Yeon Woo...

518
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,820
...can repay the king and me as a father.

519
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,500
Leave.

520
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,580
Seol, I have a favour to ask of you.

521
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,260
Because Yeon Woo is asleep,
I can not bid her farewell.

522
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,880
If Yeon Woo were to look for me,
write me.

523
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,040
You probably don't know how to write.

524
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,440
-Then, send a person to...
-I know how to write.

525
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,630
The Young Miss taught me,

526
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,580
saying that if I know letters,
I can understand the whole world.

527
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,010
Every night, she taught me a little.

528
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,330
Knowing that you, Seol, is by her side,
I feel relieved.

529
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,820
While I am gone, take care of Yeon Woo.

530
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,440
I will count on you, Seol.

531
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,130
Seol.

532
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,190
Go with this person.

533
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,680
He is the one who will take you
to your new owner.

534
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,870
Your Excellency.

535
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,090
She is honest and good.

536
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,060
She's a child my daughter cares for,

537
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,910
so please make sure
she doesn't do hard labour.

538
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,540
Do not worry, Your Excellency.

539
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,760
Have I done something wrong?

540
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,640
That's not it, Seol.

541
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,990
I will fix it.

542
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,630
I will fix it, so please do not sell me
to someone else.

543
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,160
I won't eat as much.

544
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,430
Please let me stay by
the Young Miss's side.

545
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,480
Seol.

546
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,410
I promised the Young Master
that I would take care of her.

547
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,430
So, please...

548
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,190
When she is completely cured...

549
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,450
...I will bring you back.

550
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:43,070
So, please listen to what I say now.

551
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,050
Yeon Woo! Yeon Woo!

552
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,580
Yeon Woo, wake up. Yeon Woo!

553
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,410
Yeon Woo!

554
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,240
Yeon Woo!

555
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:19,370
While she's alive,
there's no way to remove the spirit.

556
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,360
Are you telling me to kill my daughter?

557
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,340
This is the only way
to remove the spirit...

558
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,940
...and to let her go to the underworld
without any pain.

559
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,310
I have to ask you one question.

560
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,600
Please ask.

561
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:11,130
If that child takes the medicine,
will it really end her suffering?

562
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,560
That's correct.

563
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,680
It will remove the spirit that is said
to remain even if you die...

564
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,210
...and she will go
without suffering, is that right?

565
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,200
Yes, I promise you.

566
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,820
Sir, I am committing
a crime worthy of death.

567
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,670
I will spend my life paying for that sin.

568
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,520
My lord, why did you not call me?

569
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,100
I will continue with this,
so go in and rest.

570
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:08,710
I will do it. So, Wife,
you should rest today.

571
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,880
Why should I, when I haven't done a thing?
Give it here.

572
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:17,340
I, too, want to do something
as her father.

573
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,480
At least...

574
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,510
...preparing this medicine for her.

575
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,750
Let me do so.

576
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,270
She has a mystical illness.

577
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,770
Your Highness Crown Prince.

578
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:55,340
I am writing you
with the last of my strengths.

579
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,740
Yeon Woo.

580
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,580
Have you recovered now?

581
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,550
Your Highness.

582
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,990
Do you know why I sent this plant to you?

583
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,930
If it's that...

584
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,390
Didn't you already tell me?

585
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,910
Actually, besides that...

586
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,280
...there's a hidden meaning.

587
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,970
Hidden meaning?

588
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:15,450
I hoped that you would be curious
about what would grow in this pot.

589
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:16,870
That way...

590
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:23,220
...you would have written
a reply asking about it.

591
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,290
Then...

592
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,610
...you were waiting for my reply?

593
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,610
Really, you should have just said so.

594
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,410
I didn't know that
and thought you were just avoiding...

595
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,640
Your Highness.

596
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,180
Yes?

597
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,640
I wish you to be healthy and peaceful.

598
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,620
Yeon Woo?

599
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,890
Wake up.

600
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:50,660
You have to take your medicine, right?

601
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,810
The medicine is very hot...

602
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,010
...even when it has cooled.

603
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,490
Yeon Woo.

604
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,710
I am sorry for many things.

605
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,880
I can only remember
feeling sorry towards you.

606
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,340
Had I known earlier...

607
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,460
...I would have let you read
all the books you wanted.

608
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,240
I would have let you do
whatever you wanted.

609
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:53,200
I thought there was plenty of time.

610
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,020
How foolish.

611
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,440
Father.

612
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,770
Give it to me quickly.

613
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,340
The medicine.

614
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,780
Taking this medicine...

615
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:23,370
...I want to stop being ill.

616
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,360
The medicine...

617
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,250
...is bitter, isn't it?

618
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,170
It's bitter, very much so.

619
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,750
Our dear Yeon Woo.

620
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,570
I'm holding you until you fall asleep.

621
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,150
Yes.

622
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:41,590
I'm happy that your embrace
reminds me of brother's.

623
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,060
Yes.

624
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,580
Sleep well in my arms.

625
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,130
I want to hold this
in my arms when I sleep.

626
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,990
Please let me do so.

627
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,010
Yeon Woo.

628
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,990
Father...

629
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:23,960
...I'm sleepy.

630
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,040
I'll sleep a bit.

631
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,500
Yeon Woo.

632
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,920
I'm sorry, Yeon Woo.

633
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,850
I'll be with you soon.

634
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,150
Yeon Woo.

635
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,830
Yeon Woo! Yeon Woo!

636
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,120
Yeon Woo.

637
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,430
Yeon Woo!

638
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,810
Yeon Woo! Yeon Woo!

639
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,000
Aigoo, my baby!

640
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,410
She peacefully passed away...

641
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,680
...as if she fell asleep...

642
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,640
...in Director Heo's arms.

643
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,000
Her funeral will be simple...

644
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,890
...held today, by her family.

645
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,800
Your Highness.

646
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,200
Your Highness.

647
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,270
Your Highness.

648
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,760
Your Highness.

649
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,520
You must not, Your Highness.

650
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,990
Today, you must stay
in the Eastern Palace.

651
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,780
That is an order from the Queen Palace.

652
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,210
Let me go!

653
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,670
I said let go!

654
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,120
Let go!

655
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:26,610
I have something left to say
to the Crown Princess.

656
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:35,790
I still have something to say
to the Crown Princess.

657
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,880
Let go.

658
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,080
Yeon Woo!

659
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,540
-Yeon Woo!
-Your Highness.

660
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,300
Let go of me.

661
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,690
Your Highness.

662
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,590
Yeon Woo.

663
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:55,110
Yeon Woo!

664
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,460
Let go of me.

665
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,990
I still have something to say.

666
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,460
Yeon Woo.

667
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,400
Your Highness will now become
the Crown Princess of this country.

668
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:32,290
Now, no one will ever be able
to take this title away from me.

669
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,670
While she was on the verge of death,
what were you doing, Your Highness?

670
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,070
Hyungnim!

671
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:42,210
In our next lifetime,
she will definitely be mine.

672
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,260
Yeon Woo, your name means soft rain?

673
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,860
Yes, that's the meaning.

674
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,410
Aren't you curious as to what
she'd look like if she were alive?

675
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,280
Where is this place?

676
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,550
And...

677
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:07,250
...who am I?
