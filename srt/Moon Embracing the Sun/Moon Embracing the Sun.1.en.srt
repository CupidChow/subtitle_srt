1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,140
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,340
All characters and events are
fictitious and have no historic basis.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,540
EPISODE 1

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,950
In the beginning...

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,220
..it is said there were
two suns in the sky...

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,490
...and two moons as well.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,300
And so...

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,860
...it was too hot in the day,

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,130
and too cold at night.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,570
At a time when all creation
had fallen into chaos,

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,900
when all the people in the land
had fallen into distress.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,670
An extraordinary hero appeared.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,580
And shot his arrows to take down
one sun and one moon.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,450
Only then did the world
become a peaceful place.

15
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,730
That's right.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,030
Heroes are needed during troubled times.

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,760
Don't you think, my nephew?

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,600
He still considers the child
of a different mother his brother.

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,410
Our Majesty has given Prince Ui Seong
too much strength and legitimacy.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,730
That's why a group
of conniving individuals,

21
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,650
have formed that reverence
and serve him as a King's Advisor.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,190
But what can we do?

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,930
We can't just wait idly
for a hero to appear, can we?

24
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,330
Forgive me, Your Highness.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,720
I am unable to understand
the profound meaning of your words.

26
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Become a hero.

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,380
Become a loyal subject.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,740
Consider the sincere heart
that cannot bring itself to intercede,

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
and become a worthy subject.

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,450
There is but one sun in the sky.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,950
There is also only one King's throne.

32
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,420
Prince Ui Seong's mere existence alone
threatens the King's throne.

33
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,130
He is a sun that absolutely
must be eliminated.

34
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,710
Prince Ui Seong

35
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,210
Whose orders are you acting under?

36
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,530
What's wrong?

37
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,330
What's the matter?

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,010
Where do you think you're going
in the middle of the night?

39
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,310
Didn't you feel it, too?

40
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,770
It was definitely an assassin.

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,410
Even if you go, it's already too late
to do anything.

42
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,650
Still, I have to go.

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,360
He is...

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,790
...he's in danger!

45
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,730
Ari.

46
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,530
Ari!

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,560
Ari!

48
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,130
Ari!

49
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,140
Stop!

50
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,090
It's been a long time, Prince Ui Seong.

51
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,750
The man who visited my house so often
that he wore down the door sill.

52
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,490
You wanted me to back you up
in your quest for power.

53
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,550
Have you changed your methods now,

54
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,960
or have you found another backer?

55
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,680
I did find one.

56
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,010
I'm thinking of taking on the King
as my backer from here on in.

57
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,250
What was it you said?

58
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,660
That these days the pettiest of men
seem to be coveting power?

59
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,360
Didn't you say that only men of honor
were fit for politics...

60
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,300
...not the likes of petty individuals?

61
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,060
The King is not one to be swayed
by fabricated stories of a treason plot!

62
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,980
Whose words do you think
His Highness will believe?

63
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,880
It's a pity, but...

64
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,700
...you'll have no occasion
to see His Highness again.

65
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,180
Before then...

66
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,700
...I shall send you
on your journey to the heavens.

67
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't be too scared.

68
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,290
Your close friend...

69
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,600
...the Inspector General will be there,
waiting for you.

70
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,620
Why him?

71
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,370
Why in the world him?

72
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,660
All of his admonishing words are aimed
at the maternal side of the family.

73
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,570
So it's not unreasonable that
the Queen Mother would get upset.

74
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,350
It's a good day.

75
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,290
With the moonlight as your companion...

76
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,670
...the road to your grave
won't be all that bad.

77
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Get her!

78
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,720
This belongs to a shaman
from Seongsucheong.

79
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,160
Search the area thoroughly.

80
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,330
If she's alive, kill her.

81
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,570
If she's dead,
you must bring in her body.

82
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,600
Yes!

83
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,470
The State Shaman is here.

84
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,750
Where has Ari gone to?

85
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,380
That...

86
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,700
Ari.

87
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,570
Ari, is it?

88
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,700
Because of the strength
of her divine powers...

89
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,330
...she and another shaman named Nok Young,

90
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,220
are considered to have potential
to be the next State Shaman.

91
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,240
She couldn't have gone very far yet,
as she's injured.

92
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,080
We are combing through
the nearby woods, so in a short while...

93
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,190
Love between royalty and a shaman...

94
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,360
The heavens are helping us.

95
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,070
What do you mean?

96
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,420
Ari, that girl...

97
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,790
She was originally a slave
from Prince Ui Seong's family.

98
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,900
If they had a close relationship,
then people had to have known about it.

99
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,700
Then, isn't it more dangerous?

100
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,320
How so?

101
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,410
Stake one's life purely
for the sake of love,

102
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,360
that is what's in the hearts
of foolish young girls.

103
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,110
That girl who witnessed everything.

104
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,230
It's not unthinkable that she'd venture
into the King's living quarters.

105
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,740
If we don't kill that girl now...

106
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
What if that girl...

107
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,100
...had hoped that the man she loved
would become the owner of the throne?

108
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,510
And what if she had used a talisman
in order to fulfill that hope?

109
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,520
It's possible, isn't it?

110
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,040
However, we need solid evidence
that she had used a talisman.

111
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,720
The State Shaman at Seongsucheong
is one of my people.

112
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,460
How could there be a problem?

113
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,020
Report both of them for treason.

114
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,540
By mandate of His Royal Highness,
all traitors are to be...

115
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,780
Is everything in this letter true?

116
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,450
There seem to have been
internal strife among the traitors.

117
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,230
As Prosecutor General Hong later realized
his wrongdoings, before his death.

118
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,130
It is our belief that he killed Lee Han
and then committed suicide.

119
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,150
I am the one at fault.

120
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,240
Because I was slow
to report their treason,

121
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,960
we lost the chance to punish
the group of traitors.

122
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,290
Please be understanding.

123
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,250
Your Majesty.

124
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,540
The State Shaman from Seongsucheong
has arrived.

125
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,240
State Shaman.

126
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,880
Tell me what you know about that talisman.

127
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,810
This talisman. It...

128
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,180
...it is for the sun's energy
to thrive and flourish.

129
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,690
Are you positive?

130
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,680
Would I dare lie
in the inner palace of the King?

131
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,470
This talisman is definitely meant
to restore power and vitality to the sun.

132
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,670
Tells us whose talisman it is.

133
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,490
A girl named Ari from the Seongsucheong
charmed this talisman.

134
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,110
I am sure that it is hers.

135
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,250
Then where is that shaman "Ari" right now?

136
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,930
She has realized she's been discovered,
and she is currently on the run.

137
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,560
Capture that shaman no matter what.

138
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,670
What's wrong?
Why are you making such a commotion?

139
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,220
There... There is a person over there.

140
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,550
No, a corpse. No, it's a person!

141
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,590
Lower the carriage.

142
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,480
Madam, the baby in your belly
will suffer a scare.

143
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,450
Please go back in the carriage quickly.

144
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,730
How can you expect me to ignore
that a person is dying?

145
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,360
My lord...

146
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,870
Look here. Are you conscious?

147
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,100
My lord, your outrage... I... I will...

148
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,770
This won't do! Get her into the carriage.

149
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,510
Excuse me?! How can we just put
a strange unknown woman in the carriage?

150
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,310
Listen, you will all have to help me!

151
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,460
Stop there.

152
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
Wh.. What's wrong?

153
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,460
We are searching
for a treacherous criminal on the run.

154
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
Open the carriage.

155
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,680
Treacherous criminal?

156
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,630
You can't do that.

157
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,950
How can you look inside the carriage
of a woman of nobility?

158
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,470
Inside... Really.

159
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,830
What is the problem?

160
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,850
Why are we being detained here?

161
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,460
We are looking for a treacherous criminal
who is on the run.

162
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,680
If you could please step down
temporarily from the carriage...

163
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm just on my way home after offering
a prayer for my soon to be born child.

164
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,820
I have difficulties moving right now,

165
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,570
so if you are indeed that suspicious,
follow me to my home.

166
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,350
What are you going to do?

167
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,960
Are you going back with me?

168
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,930
Forgive my rudeness.

169
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,200
Let's go.

170
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,220
Stop there!

171
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,980
You'll have to get out for a moment...

172
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,960
Oh, my goodness!

173
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,350
Ah, blood!

174
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,850
I see blood!

175
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,110
The doctor said for you to be careful
in the last month!

176
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,870
Send us on our way, quickly!

177
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,290
There may really be big trouble
at this rate!

178
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,570
She is the daughter of the Chief Censor.

179
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,660
Will you bear the responsibility
if anything happens?

180
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,090
Move aside!

181
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,940
Step away!

182
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,580
Hurry, let's go! Hurry, move quickly!

183
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,580
Madam, Madam.
Please bear with it a little longer.

184
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,690
Aigoo, Madam!

185
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know how to repay you
for your kindness.

186
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,020
Because of a lowly wretch like me,

187
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,800
you have ruined your beautiful clothes,
and even pretended to be in pain.

188
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,270
I wasn't pretending.

189
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,280
I really thought that I was going to die.

190
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,610
It wasn't me...

191
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,820
...but this child who saved you.

192
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,660
She's lovely like the moon.

193
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,440
Then...

194
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,500
...is this child a girl?

195
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,850
Yes, it's true.

196
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,060
You said that you are a shaman,
and I guess you really are.

197
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,360
I was hoping to have a cute daughter.

198
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,090
Is the baby really a daughter?

199
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,080
That's right.

200
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,770
And she will be born
to a most noble destiny.

201
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,170
What's wrong?

202
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,830
Ah, it's nothing.

203
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,780
I just felt a little dizzy.

204
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,930
Will you really be fine on your own?

205
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,290
Please don't worry, as I'll be fine.

206
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,980
The grace and kindness
you've bestowed upon me today, Madam,

207
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,020
I won't forget, even in death.

208
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,540
Although I may not be a shaman,
I can understand people pretty well.

209
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,570
You are not a bad person.

210
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,870
Madam!

211
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,950
Madam, your daughter,
I'll protect her even if I am dead.

212
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,390
Stop it.

213
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,840
Who was the person that gave you orders?

214
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,110
I don't know anything about that talisman.

215
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,510
If you speak the truth now...

216
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,380
...I will allow you
to at least gather his corpse.

217
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:05,090
How can I tell you who ordered
a talisman I never wrote?

218
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,450
We have solid proof that
you are under orders of the traitors.

219
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,110
Wench, are you going to feign ignorance
to the very end?!

220
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,730
Did you say traitors
from that lowly mouth of yours?

221
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,920
Did you say proof?

222
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,260
If you, who fabricated false evidence,
aren't a traitor,

223
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,270
who are you saying is a traitor?

224
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,340
Have you seen such a brazen wench?

225
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,690
Must we slit your throat
before you tell the truth?!

226
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,120
You filthy jerk!

227
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,460
You must have thought
I was the only one that saw.

228
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,230
You must think it will end
if you just get rid of me.

229
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,140
You're wrong, you filthy jerk.

230
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,780
The heaven's moon was watching you.

231
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,530
That man's blood wasn't the only thing
soaked into your blade that night.

232
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,080
The moonlight seeped in it as well.

233
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,760
Wait and see, you filthy jerk!

234
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,130
There will be a day when your evil deeds
will be revealed under the moonlight!

235
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:06,390
There will be a day when that moonlight
will certainly cut your lifeline!

236
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,690
What are you doing?!

237
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,030
Why aren't you pulling?!

238
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,170
Yes!

239
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Only for half an hour.

240
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,490
If we get caught, it's both our necks.

241
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,760
So come out as quickly as possible.

242
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,430
Ari.

243
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,400
Ari.

244
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,080
Ari.

245
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,780
How...

246
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,150
...how can a person be so foolish?

247
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,050
What did I tell you?

248
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,000
Didn't I tell you there was nothing
you could do even if you went there?

249
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,370
I have never even once wished
that he would take over the throne.

250
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,580
And he never wished that, either.

251
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
I know.

252
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,310
How could I not know
that he was falsely accused?

253
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,860
That's good enough, then.

254
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,870
If you know, that's enough.

255
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,010
Enough? What's enough about it?

256
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,850
I am unable to do anything
even though I know.

257
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,500
I am unable to save my friend
who has been falsely accused.

258
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,180
Please don't cry.

259
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,810
All of this is the will of the gods.

260
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,100
What's the use of gods
at a time like this?!

261
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,830
What's the use of divine power?!

262
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,020
Why don't we relay
the whole truth to the King?

263
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,640
And with you, I'll...

264
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,040
There's a child you must protect
in my stead.

265
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:26,050
Her family will be destroyed
if she gets too close to the sun.

266
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,910
But the child will be born, destined to be
at the sun's side, protecting the sun.

267
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,910
Please make sure that child is safe.

268
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,510
Please protect her.

269
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,060
What... What are you talking about?

270
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,670
You there!

271
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,050
Come out.

272
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,030
Who is the child that I need to protect?

273
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,840
My life ends here.

274
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:00,900
-You live and look after Seongsucheong.
-Who exactly is this child that you...

275
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,360
Look here. Get out quickly.

276
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,710
Ari.

277
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,630
Ari. Ari!

278
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,320
Ari.

279
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,780
Two suns...

280
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,320
...and one moon.

281
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,330
May all three of you be unharmed.

282
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,370
It's true that she's lovely as the moon.

283
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,190
Yeom.

284
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,650
Does your sister look lovely
to your eyes, as well?

285
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,510
Yes, she is very lovely.

286
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,810
Child.

287
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,120
Your name is Yeon Woo.

288
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,550
Heo Yeon Woo.

289
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:14,120
Your father christened you before he left
as an ambassador to the Ming Empire.

290
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,590
Do you like it?

291
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,450
There's a child you must protect
in my stead.

292
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,300
You've come?

293
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,640
The red parasol and folding chair
that were here, where did they go?

294
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,460
Madam, the oil and honey pastries
for the table are missing.

295
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,330
Have you seen the oiled paper
that was here?

296
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,020
Your Highness.

297
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,240
It's about time for you to take part
in your lesson.

298
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,800
You've already delayed quite a bit,

299
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,430
so it would be good for you
to get dressed quickly...

300
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,930
Hidden Moon Pavilion

301
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,940
Yeon Woo.

302
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,940
Yeon Woo.

303
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,690
Why are you not coming out?

304
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,720
Really, doesn't that give you
motion sickness?

305
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,070
Hurry up.

306
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,090
At this rate, we'll miss the moment
when your brother receives his honors.

307
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,380
Minister of Personnel Yoon Dae Hyung

308
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,870
Director Office of
Special Councilors -Heo Young Jae

309
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:41,010
Yeon Woo, look.
Your brother is over there.

310
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,790
Although he is not as good looking
as my son,

311
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,090
Woon is indeed very handsome.

312
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,810
The Woon that you are talking of...

313
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,020
Oh, right. You've never seen him before.

314
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,010
That boy over on that side, he is Woon.

315
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,440
He has been studying under your father
together with Prince Yang Myung.

316
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,240
You do know that those two
are your brother's closest friends, right?

317
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,910
The top literary and military scholars
are your father's students.

318
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,570
Looks like we have to organize
a big celebration this time.

319
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,310
I suppose the storeroom
will be emptied again then.

320
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,010
Apparently, he finished lunch
half an hour ago,

321
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,020
so I am sure he is still in the palace.

322
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,820
If the King were to know about this,

323
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,760
all of us would face severe punishment.

324
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,370
Hurry and move. Hurry.

325
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,420
Yes.

326
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,400
His Majesty The King has arrived.

327
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,440
Kneel all.

328
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,130
Bow your heads.

329
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,400
I can't be burning my skin, after all.

330
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,760
The top literary scholar, Heo Yeom,

331
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,610
and top military scholar, Kim Jae Woon,

332
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,020
please come forward.

333
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,310
Second place literary scholar, Kim Se Min,

334
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,290
and second place military scholar,
Im Byung Wook, please come forward.

335
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,380
Just look at your father.

336
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,770
It's so clearly obvious that he's happy.

337
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,780
Just look at him.

338
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,170
See how the corners
of his mouth are pressed down?

339
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,230
That is your father's expression
when he tries to keep from smiling.

340
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,330
From what I see,
you are not a palace girl.

341
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,740
So why have you come into the palace?

342
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,850
Then what about you, Young Lord,

343
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,160
why were you trying
to climb over the wall?

344
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,340
I am the only one
that's allowed to ask questions.

345
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,460
Are you not going to answer my question?

346
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,180
Do you have no idea that trespassing
in the palace is considered high treason?

347
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:29,890
I am just here to attend my brother's
top literary scholar award ceremony.

348
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,050
How am I to believe that?

349
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,100
It's up to you to believe it or not.

350
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,180
But I don't believe it would be right,

351
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,770
to see someone stealing from the palace
and pretend I never saw a thing.

352
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,020
I am now going to have to call
for the guards.

353
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,510
What do you mean call the guards?

354
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,210
Steal from the palace?

355
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,080
I was just looking for the door to go out.

356
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,100
Actually, my brother
is the top literary scholar.

357
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,990
No...

358
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,470
He's the top military scholar.
I need to see his...

359
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,920
This... This is. Well...

360
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,450
These are the royal gifts my brother
received from the King.

361
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,900
Over here! There is a thief in the palace.

362
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
Here at the Hidden Moon Pavilion.

363
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,440
Who is the fellow?

364
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,420
It's all because of you.

365
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,850
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have had
to run like this and run out of breath.

366
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,550
But why have you continued
to talk down to me?

367
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,430
That's because you are younger than me.
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

368
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,830
How can you be so sure that I am younger?

369
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,660
How old are you anyway?

370
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,900
You just have to subtract two years
from your age.

371
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,880
Then, you're only 11,
isn't that right? So, why...

372
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,330
So, you are 13.

373
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,910
See? I am older than you by two years.

374
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,490
Oh, where are you going?

375
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,820
Just like I told you earlier,
I am going to find the guards.

376
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,860
No, didn't I tell you already?
I'm not a thief.

377
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,920
I am here to watch my brother
who was awarded the top military scholar.

378
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,560
Why is it that you just blame
everyone else

379
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,740
and tell lies
whenever you open your mouth?

380
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,490
The man awarded as top military scholar
is my brother's good friend.

381
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,990
And I hear he has no younger siblings.

382
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,640
Is that so?

383
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,880
That fellow has no younger brother?

384
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,830
Ah, all right.

385
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,470
I'll tell you everything.

386
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,410
What's the point of trying to hide
anything at this point?

387
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,430
The truth is that...

388
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,640
...I wanted to go
and see my older brother.

389
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,610
Are you going to tell me again that
your brother is the top military scholar?

390
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,950
No.

391
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,100
No, he's not.

392
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,710
My older brother...

393
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,000
Though he was born
from a different mother,

394
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,200
to me he is warmer than anyone I know.

395
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,230
Though he excels
in martial arts and literature...

396
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,070
...he is someone who cannot
take the civil service exam.

397
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,140
Though he will be a talented man
and a pillar of the nation...

398
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,860
...he is someone who cannot become
a government official.

399
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,170
Though he loves
and respects his father...

400
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:41,380
...he is someone who cannot receive
his father's love.

401
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,660
Though he is well-loved by many people...

402
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,850
...he is someone who cannot appear
in front of many people.

403
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,700
And...

404
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,840
...the reason why my brother
has to live this way...

405
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,340
...is all because of me.

406
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,760
Perhaps, he is afraid
of my father's eyes upon him.

407
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,600
He hasn't come to visit me in a long time.

408
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,350
Therefore...

409
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,460
...I wanted to go out
and find my brother directly.

410
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,570
Does that explain what you wanted to know?

411
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,730
Why do you blame yourself?

412
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,880
What?

413
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,440
Neither the fact that you were born
a legitimate son,

414
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,730
nor the fact that your brother
was born an illegitimate son,

415
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,590
were decisions you could make yourself.

416
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,910
So then, why are you blaming yourself?

417
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,110
Didn't you say earlier that I just blame
everyone else when I open my mouth?

418
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,780
Didn't you just reproach me for it?

419
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,400
It is said that a man of honor
doesn't resent the heavens...

420
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,430
...nor does he blame people.

421
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,720
You've read the Analects of Confucius?

422
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,860
Furthermore,
farmers don't blame their fields...

423
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,740
...and musicians don't blame
their instruments.

424
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,790
The problem is in one's own self,
and not in whom one faces.

425
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,510
And if your brother is truly
the warm person that you hold dear...

426
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,330
...it's likely that he's not blaming you.

427
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:23,500
And so, don't blame yourself either
and don't blame anyone else.

428
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,810
That vile practice of discriminating
between legitimate and illegitimate sons,

429
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,750
should be resolved by the king.

430
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:40,180
If it blocks the future of men of talent
and sows discord between brothers...

431
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,330
...then shouldn't it be corrected?

432
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,060
Frankly, regarding Joseon law,

433
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,760
there are just too many points
I fail to understand.

434
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,010
Aristocrats and slaves
are all equally people,

435
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,690
and yet there's discrimination.

436
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,100
Father always says,

437
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,590
that for a woman
to be indulging in lectures

438
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,380
is against the law, but...

439
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,580
So what you're saying...

440
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,820
...is that the way the King
has been governing is wrong.

441
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,370
Is that what you mean?

442
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,670
No... it's not like that at all.

443
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,520
Looks like this time,

444
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,620
I should be the one
who goes to the guards.

445
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,690
Please don't.

446
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,940
Then, what should I do?

447
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,040
Then, just pretend you didn't hear
the things I said just now.

448
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,770
And now you know
that I'm not a thief either, right?

449
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,450
No.

450
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,630
Why not?

451
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,090
Then, what's the problem now?

452
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,370
Where did you get those things
that you were carrying on your back?

453
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,030
Those are mine.

454
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,480
All of it is mine!

455
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,470
Are you satisfied now?

456
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,350
They were all rare and expensive things.

457
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:03,080
So how could you possibly own
any such thing?

458
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,440
I have been clement with you,

459
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,260
but now you're crossing the line.

460
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,660
Are you belittling me right now?

461
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,740
I am this nation, Joseon's...

462
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,200
I am this nation, Joseon's...

463
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,980
...palace attendant.

464
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,170
She has already been missing for an hour.

465
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:46,490
She must still be in the palace
as she wasn't seen near the carriage.

466
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,320
Please help me find her.

467
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,030
You must find...

468
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,090
Tell me.

469
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,820
Exactly, how much
is a palace attendant's salary,

470
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,150
to be able to own such expensive things?

471
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,600
Yeon Woo!

472
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,700
Mother.

473
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,500
Oh, my child.

474
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,480
Oh, oh. Stop there.

475
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,000
Just stop there and be still.

476
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,890
Where in the world have you been?

477
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,760
You are not to speak even a word.
Not even a word.

478
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,430
If you open your mouth,
you'll be severely punished.

479
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,180
You there.

480
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,540
I have already admitted my crimes.

481
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,460
I have already confessed
to the guard on my own.

482
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:42,920
Are you satisfied now?

483
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,540
Ah, the things that I stole
are at the Hidden Moon Pavilion,

484
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,750
so let's go there.

485
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,170
Wait a moment, Miss.

486
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,610
Just a moment.

487
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,600
He asked me to deliver this to you.

488
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,190
Who?

489
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,890
He said that you'd know if I said
the Hidden Moon Pavilion's young master.

490
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,500
Ah, you are talking about
the young palace attendant.

491
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,420
But, what's this?

492
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,050
Many are the things that I want to say,

493
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,070
but as I can't talk about them,
it irritates me.

494
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:38,420
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

495
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:42,900
If she is a smart child,

496
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,020
then she should know what I mean by this.

497
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,300
Did he say anything else?

498
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,310
From now on,

499
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,450
tell her she'd better be careful
when traveling the roads at night.

500
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,590
That's what he said.

501
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,110
He is even considering my safety
when traveling at night.

502
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,430
He is indeed not a bad person, after all.

503
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,420
Very well.

504
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,740
What is it outside of this palace
that is enticing you so much?

505
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,380
What are you lacking inside the palace
that you are coveting things outside?

506
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,940
I just want to see Yang Myung,

507
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,020
to be able to discuss scholarly pursuits.

508
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,380
The people with whom you are to discuss
scholarly pursuits are those teachers.

509
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,720
I'm sorry...

510
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:40,190
...but I am not inspired
by any Sigangwon lessons.

511
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,080
What?

512
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,620
With no heated debate...

513
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,370
...how am I to break through
the walls that limit us?

514
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,720
Without doubt and questioning,

515
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,780
how am I to really know this world?

516
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,670
What is impossible in my classroom here...

517
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,650
...is possible in my discussions
with Hyungnim.

518
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,560
So! Is this your excuse for climbing
the palace's walls?

519
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,770
I felt all main roads
were blocked ahead and behind...

520
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,650
...and for just a moment,
I was tempted by a side street.

521
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,510
How have you all been educating
the Crown Prince for him to act like this?

522
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,510
All officers ranked three-jang and below
are to be dismissed.

523
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,230
And until the new Royal Lecturer
is appointed,

524
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,560
a guest from the other offices
will take over the classroom!

525
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,860
The Crown Prince is to study
late into the night every day,

526
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,330
to make up for the time
that he had wasted.

527
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:28,570
And from now on,

528
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,470
he will not be accompanying me
to any rural palaces or royal tombs.

529
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,960
Queen Mother,
the Personnel Minister is here.

530
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,130
Let him in.

531
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,390
You were looking for me?

532
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,310
Welcome.

533
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,760
Isn't that a bonsai?

534
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:10,510
Lately, taking care of these little ones
is rather engaging.

535
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,240
What do you think?

536
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,950
The way the branches wind,

537
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,500
doesn't it look old and elegant?

538
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,930
The magnificent energy it gives off...

539
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,940
...makes me feel like I'm looking
at a towering Pine of Mt Mokmyeok.

540
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,810
Do you know what the bonsai's charm is,
Your Excellency?

541
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,630
Isn't it the opportunity...

542
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,620
...to take a sapling and raise it
into the form of your liking?

543
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,140
That's correct.

544
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,040
But you see, about the bonsai...

545
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,630
...it's really harder than it looks.

546
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,550
Because if you miss the right timing,

547
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,340
it's going to be really hard to shape it
into the form you want.

548
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,460
I heard there was a huge uproar
with the Sigangwon.

549
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,420
Yes, there is going to be
a large reshuffling of the personnel.

550
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,970
I hope that the Crown Prince will be able
to meet a decent teacher this time.

551
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,410
It is a great worry.

552
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,700
What's the responsibility
of the Royal Lecturer, after all?

553
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,320
It's the position that cultivates
the next King, is it not?

554
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,360
I have already taken measures.

555
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,940
For the sake of the Crown Prince
who will be succeeding the throne...

556
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,370
...and for the sake
of the next term of rule...

557
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,780
...there is still much
that our family must do.

558
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,420
In particular...

559
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,100
...your responsibility as
Personnel Minister is extremely important.

560
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:44,110
Your Highness, I beg of you
to consider the Crown Prince's feelings.

561
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,960
With not a single friend to confide in,

562
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,270
the Crown Prince must live a palace life
full of responsibilities and restraints.

563
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,360
Please allow Prince Yang Myung
to come to the palace freely.

564
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,170
Since you have sent Prince Yang Myung
out to live in a separate home

565
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,050
and have prohibited him
from making informal visits to the palace,

566
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,120
the Crown Prince feels even more lonely...

567
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:07,200
He cannot keep his position
by acting like a spoiled child!

568
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,540
All our royal ancestors lived that way
before they stepped up to the throne!

569
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,030
Someone who must embrace
all of the people in the land,

570
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,640
isn't able to suppress
his own self-interest?!

571
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,220
Is that fathomable?!

572
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,690
-But, Your Majesty...
-I am going to rest.

573
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,250
You should retire as well.

574
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,910
Is someone out there? Escort the queen.

575
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:37,230
He has given his royal orders
to bar anyone from entering today.

576
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,630
I am really sorry.

577
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,080
How could it be your fault?

578
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,180
Prince Yang Myung hasn't been coming
to pay his respects to you lately?

579
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,940
I heard that he went for a brief trip
out of the city.

580
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,970
Because His Majesty The King
has eyes as sharp as knives...

581
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,390
...it may make him feel uncomfortable
to visit the palace.

582
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,900
If he would come back,

583
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,820
please tell him to make a trip
to the Queen's quarters to pay respect.

584
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,480
And if he were to drop
by the Crown Prince's quarters on the way,

585
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,890
that would be even better.

586
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,340
Please give me a good price.

587
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,060
I have to buy some gifts for my friends.

588
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,740
I have never seen
a hunter like you before.

589
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,140
Are you a newcomer?

590
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,130
No, I am just visitor passing through.

591
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,650
I just ran out of traveling money,

592
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,300
so I caught a few of these for fun.

593
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,270
Let me take a look.

594
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,190
These are all wild pheasants, right?

595
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,540
Of course.

596
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,470
From deep inside the mountains,

597
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,550
the real wild pheasants
that grew up only drinking dew.

598
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,100
What's that? Dew?

599
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,270
Hey, you fella.

600
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,810
How can wild pheasants live on dew alone?

601
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,500
You are really...

602
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,610
What is that line over there?

603
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,180
Ah! It's an eight year old blind girl

604
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,520
who has so much divining ability.

605
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:01,560
She can tell what you're suffering from
without feeling your pulse.

606
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,450
And also, they are selling
some kind of stone talisman,

607
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,740
that was rumored to be a cure
for all sickness.

608
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,640
They have been lining up like that
in order to buy that medicine.

609
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,160
A cure for all sickness?

610
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,990
Yes, a cure for all sickness.

611
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,390
I had been having trouble deciding
what sort of presents to buy.

612
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:22,170
Then should I get one of those, as well?

613
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,450
Here!

614
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,530
Surpassing even the State Shaman,
Jang Nok Young,

615
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,650
are the divining powers
of this child shaman!

616
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,100
Putting Hua Tuo
and Bian Que out of business,

617
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,680
is the mystical stone
that is able to cure all illnesses.

618
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,040
Limited quantity, we have just 50!

619
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,040
Here, here!

620
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,700
There aren't many left,
so come quickly to get your number tags.

621
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,500
Everyone come quickly to buy them.

622
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,760
Give me one.

623
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,080
There really aren't many left.

624
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,850
It's those people, State Shaman.

625
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,280
Those are the shameless people
who are using children to con others.

626
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,660
And when they starve and abuse a child
to death, they buy another child

627
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,230
and continue with their business.

628
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,370
Sometimes, the children
get sold into prostitution.

629
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,590
I will have to go in
and have a look myself.

630
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,350
Now, the customers
from number 41 to 45, enter!

631
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,340
Please wait for a moment.

632
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,010
You have to go take a number tag first.

633
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,610
I'm sorry, but I'm before you.

634
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:56,170
Two suns in the Joseon sky?

635
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,090
There is an evil energy
piled up on your shoulder...

636
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,010
...so you must be suffering
from shoulder pains, right?

637
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,870
Sugoong, sugoong.

638
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,700
The sugoong fairy says
that a vengeful spirit has stuck to you.

639
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,370
And that he is really a strong fellow.

640
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:26,920
Two suns.

641
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,800
You have to make use
of the second mystical stone.

642
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,700
-That will be 20 nyang.
-Oh my, thank you.

643
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,940
But, what's the reason you are here?

644
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:40,470
Well... As for me...

645
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:49,010
I hurt my leg
when I was hunting for wild boars.

646
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,740
Now then, the next customer please.

647
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,810
A mountain animal's vengeful spirit
has covered your hurt leg...

648
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,290
Oh, I can see rays of lights
coming from you, Ahjussi.

649
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,220
It's a really pretty yellow.

650
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,140
Or is it reddish?

651
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,430
Light?

652
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:33,830
What kind of light?

653
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,650
I am hungry.

654
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,520
Sugoong, sugoong, sugoong, sugoong...

655
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,730
The sugoong fairy
says for that leg ailment of yours,

656
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:51,060
the fourth stone will be enough for you.

657
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,570
Her body is gaunt
and her belly is bloated.

658
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:56,940
And there is some strange sound
coming from her stomach.

659
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,650
This is probably due to stomach
and spleen damage, dehydration,

660
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,150
lack of rest,
and bad blood circulation, right?

661
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,360
Rascal, what do you think
you are trying to do here?

662
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,500
It is clearly malnutrition
caused by starvation and exhaustion.

663
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,350
So do you want to get beaten up
by mystical stone two?

664
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,140
These bruises on her neck.

665
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,740
These wounds.

666
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,600
Just how many hidden wounds are there
that you're trying to cover up?

667
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,680
That's because this wretched girl
gets easily bruised...

668
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,160
That's really strange.

669
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,860
Don't you feel that something is wrong?

670
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,650
Open your eyes.

671
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:46,790
Ah, you wretched little girl!

672
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,520
I am hungry! Hungry!

673
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,850
Hey, aren't you a con-man?

674
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,240
He's a fraud, a fraud!

675
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,610
The money, money.

676
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:15,880
Please call for the constable.

677
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:32,690
Ahjussi, I am feeling dizzy
because you are running too fast.

678
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,920
That's because
you've been starved for too long.

679
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,420
Just hang on for a moment.
I will be taking you to a physician.

680
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,940
And also, I am not an ahjussi, Kiddo!

681
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:55,610
-Come here!
-Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

682
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,070
Ahjussi!

683
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:58,180
I don't want to go!

684
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,820
I don't want to be beaten!

685
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,060
You are not going to be quiet?!

686
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,140
Put that child down at once.

687
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,980
What's this now?

688
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,760
Move aside!

689
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,930
Move! Move!

690
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,910
Go after him! Let's go!

691
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,390
Let that child go, uh?

692
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:26,340
I'll ask some places like the inn
to take in that child and raise her well.

693
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:31,480
Because of you,
our earnings for the day are all gone,

694
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,050
and we can't set foot in this place again.

695
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,450
Now...

696
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,570
Do you realize what sin
you have committed?

697
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,630
I warn you not to make me angry.

698
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,460
It'll get really dangerous if I get angry.

699
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,920
It will be even more dangerous
if I get angry.

700
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,810
You rascal!

701
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,450
I am warning you one more time.

702
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,690
It's really going to get dangerous
for you if you make me angrier.

703
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,150
Did I tell you
that my sword-fighting teacher,

704
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,510
was the top military scholar
from the recent civil exams?

705
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,950
If your sword-fighting teacher
is the top military scholar,

706
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,620
then my father
is His Majesty The King, you punk!

707
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,690
I know His Majesty The King a little.

708
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,470
And he says he never had a son like you!

709
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,210
Your Highness.

710
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,800
I have completed my trip safely
and have returned.

711
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,100
Please forgive me for paying
my respects from outside the palace.

712
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:06,320
Has the Crown Prince been healthy,
as well, during this time?

713
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,450
I am not going to run away...

714
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,000
...so please stop that.

715
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,210
If you were to find out
I am the Crown Prince...

716
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,030
...I suppose you would nag even more.

717
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:17,240
But after all...

718
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,520
...there probably won't be any reason
for you and I to meet again.

719
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,820
Draw, circle, write, square.

720
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,610
If you were to draw it, it's a circle.

721
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,660
If you were to write it,
it'll be a square.

722
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,960
I think I know this.

723
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,940
Rabbit, life, rooster, death?

724
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,150
The rabbit lives but the rooster dies?

725
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,600
What on earth could this be?

726
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,340
Milady, it's Seol!

727
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,780
You are still looking
at that thing, Milady?

728
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,440
Seol.

729
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:12,920
If the rabbit lives but the rooster dies,
what will happen?

730
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,130
Who is going to wake up the people
in the morning if the rooster dies?

731
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,600
You should go to sleep now.

732
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,920
Do you want to be scolded again
by His Excellency?

733
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,180
I thought in the moonlight,
I might see some hidden words.

734
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,890
Who is going to wake up the people
in the morning if the rooster dies?

735
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,750
Morning.

736
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,820
The hour of the rabbit.

737
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:04,310
Rabbit, life, rooster, death.

738
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:06,950
Born during the hour of the rabbit.
Dies at the hour of the rooster?

739
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:13,830
If you were to draw it, it's a circle.

740
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,880
If you were to write it,
it'll be a square.

741
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,570
Rises during the hour of the rabbit
and sets at the hour of the rooster?

742
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,270
Day! The daytime! Sun! Sun...

743
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,540
Are you belittling me right now?

744
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,390
I am this nation, Joseon's...

745
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,830
...Sun.

746
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,740
Could it really be,

747
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,520
that we will be able to meet again?

748
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:49,860
Crown Prince, do you know?

749
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,630
Do you know how relieved I am...

750
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:56,440
...that there is no reason for us
to meet again?

751
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,600
I am really happy to see you again.

752
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,810
Heo Yeon Woo.

753
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:17,090
There is a demon!

754
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:20,530
This is my sister's gift for you.

755
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,660
You will become sick if you keep longing.

756
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:28,230
I don't care if everyone else
becomes the Crown Prince's people,

757
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:30,400
as long as you become mine.

758
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,030
I called you here because I want you
to help read the kids' faces.

759
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,330
Who knows?

760
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:41,630
Among them, there may be
our Crown Prince's future consort.
