1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,470
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,560
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,660
Episode 11

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,720
Do you recognize me?

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,510
Who are you?

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,710
-Arrest him!
-Yes.

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,530
Who are you to dare touch me?

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,940
I am the former king's eldest son,

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,200
Prince Yang Myung.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,240
My Lord.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,110
Can you recognize me?

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,850
We met previously in the...

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,170
Please let go of that hand.

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,660
Quickly, take her.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,100
Wait!

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,570
Let's go.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,360
Wait a minute.

18
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,840
Whose way are you blocking right now?

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,910
This can't be.

20
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,630
This can't be.

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,820
Please go back.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,790
You cannot do this.

23
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,620
What can I not do?

24
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,160
She is only a human talisman
to absorb evil energy.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,580
So how can you have feelings
for a mere piece of paper?

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,660
I'm no better than a piece of paper myself
so I couldn't care less.

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,620
This is a fate that is not destined.

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,160
Who decided that kind of fate?

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,380
As a shaman,
I dare convey the message of the Gods.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,070
That is for me to decide, not the Gods.

31
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,070
Not only you, My Lord,
but that child will be in danger as well.

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,630
Because of you, that child can become
the target of political strife.

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,420
How can you not understand that?

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,180
Do not look for her again.

35
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,000
Do not harbour any feelings for her.

36
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,060
If you care at all for that child...

37
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,000
...you must keep your distance from her.

38
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,150
Answer me now!

39
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,010
I asked where you were born.

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,640
Although I am not sure...

41
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,480
...I heard it was a place
far away from the city.

42
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,340
Then, have you lived your whole life
in Onyang?

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,750
I followed Mistress here and there
and lived in many different places.

44
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,690
Your parents? Siblings? Where are they?

45
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,810
I do not have any.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
The people I have grown up with
are my family.

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,770
Then, are you saying you're an orphan?

48
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,970
Although I may have been in the past...

49
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,450
...as I was abandoned at the same time
I received my divine powers...

50
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,830
...I do not remember now.

51
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,420
Then, you were not an
orphan from the beginning.

52
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,920
Do you remember what kind of people
your parents and siblings were?

53
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,650
A shaman, as she receives
her powers from God,

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,600
must forget about her past and memories.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,680
So, just like all other shamans,
I do not think of...

56
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,170
...nor do I remember my past.

57
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,210
You have to remove
all memories of the past?

58
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,150
Yes, that is correct.

59
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,530
Then, break the seal,
and try to remember the past!

60
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,080
Where were you born and raised?

61
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,460
What was your name
before you became a shaman?

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,380
Your Majesty.

63
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,780
When, where and by whom
were you given your divine powers?

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,190
Looking back at your past, by any chance.

65
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,460
Was I any part of it?

66
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,670
Please, I beg of you to stop.

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,510
I humbly beg of you.

68
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,380
Please stop your questioning.

69
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,580
Regardless of what Your Majesty may ask...

70
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,660
...I cannot give you the answer you seek.

71
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,590
And that's...

72
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,000
...because I'm not the person
Your Majesty is looking for.

73
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,840
Although I do not know
how much I resemble that person,

74
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,040
should you have anything else left to ask,

75
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,280
please ask her directly
and find out what you're looking for.

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,290
Didn't I tell you to leave?

77
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,840
I am sorry, Mistress! Please forgive me.

78
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,640
If you planned to leave,
why come back at all?

79
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,400
Why did you come back in like a thief?

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,030
I do not have anywhere to go, Mistress.

81
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,090
So please, don't chase me out.

82
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,770
I told you not to use your divine powers
for personal reasons.

83
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,900
How...

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,920
...how could you not obey
that one simple thing?

85
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,120
You are no longer a shaman of the King...

86
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,010
...so immediately leave the Seongsucheong!

87
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,110
Is that clear?

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Please forgive me, Mistress.

89
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,730
-Please forgive me!
-Ahjumma.

90
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,150
This is not the first time
that Jan Shil has done this.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Just punish her lightly
and get it over with.

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,370
I felt pity for Brother,
which is why I did it.

93
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,030
At least once...

94
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,410
...at least once,
I wanted to do something for him.

95
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,270
His Majesty has everything,
but Brother...

96
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,560
Wol, are you seeing the King first, too?

97
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,210
You as well
are set on protecting the king.

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Leave this place right now.

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,230
Right now!

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,010
Tell me why.

101
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,060
Why do you keep telling me
to live for other people?

102
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Prince Yang Myung.

103
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
What brings you here at this late hour?

104
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,600
What about you, mother?

105
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,770
What were you doing here?

106
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,380
As always,
I pray for the safety of His Majesty.

107
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,870
Prince Yang Myung.

108
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,350
Just once...

109
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,970
..would it be that hard...

110
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,650
...to say my name before you mention him?

111
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,220
How can you say such disloyal words?

112
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,960
Disloyal. Restrain. Give it up.
Hide it. Don't waver!

113
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,970
Mother, aren't you tired of it?

114
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,960
What is wrong?

115
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,570
Just once.

116
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,800
Just once...

117
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,010
...do as you truly wish.

118
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,980
You can be selfish at least once.

119
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,500
Can't you say that just once?

120
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,520
From now...

121
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,300
...I will no longer live for others.

122
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,530
If I want to laugh, I will laugh.

123
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,390
If I want to be angry, I will be angry.

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,820
I will steal when I want.

125
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,990
That's how I am going to live!

126
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,980
Mistress.

127
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's run away.

128
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,990
Run away with me.

129
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,390
Jan Shil.

130
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,770
If it were up to me,
I would have protected you.

131
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,330
If it were up to me,
I would not have left you like this.

132
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,750
If it were up to me...

133
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,450
Before I tear out your tongue,
keep that mouth shut.

134
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,600
Mistress.

135
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,940
What are you doing?

136
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,810
Quickly drag Jan Shil out.

137
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,130
Yes, State Shaman.

138
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,950
Mistress. Mistress!

139
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,110
Why are you doing this, Mistress?

140
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,410
Should anyone bring Jan Shil
back to the Seongsucheong...

141
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,110
...she will be punished
according to the divine law.

142
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,650
-Is that understood?
-Yes, State Shaman.

143
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,540
Do you want to be chased out as well?

144
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,540
Mistress. No!

145
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,300
Mistress!

146
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,960
Why are you being so mean?

147
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,880
Just like me,
Jan Shil is unable to control her powers.

148
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,520
Even if she did make a mistake...

149
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,580
Stop arguing with me.

150
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,810
If you're done with your work,
go in and rest.

151
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,520
Mistress.

152
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,630
Let her go.

153
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,820
She is teaching her a lesson.

154
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,790
She has to be this harsh
so Jan Shil comes to her senses.

155
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,740
She is a child with nowhere to go.

156
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,530
We cannot let her wander
in this cold weather.

157
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,410
In the end,
she will come crawling back in.

158
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,470
Then Ahjumma Jang will pretend
she can't win and will let her in.

159
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,700
Is this the first time we are dealing
with her leaving the house?

160
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,270
Mistress.

161
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,930
If it is about Jan Shil,
don't waste your breath.

162
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Then...

163
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,490
...I will leave the Seongsucheong as well.

164
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,060
Are you threatening me?

165
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
It is not a threat.

166
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,320
Then, are you serious about
leaving the Seongsucheong?

167
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,620
In the past...

168
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,460
...you said if I wanted to go,
you'd protect me,

169
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,260
so I could run away with Seol.

170
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,060
It's what you said, right?

171
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,660
Why are you bringing it up?

172
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,380
It's just that Seol and Jan Shil...

173
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,290
...not to mention me.

174
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,710
I feel as if the three of us
do not belong here.

175
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,010
That is why I am asking.

176
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,180
How did you come to such a decision?

177
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,090
What made you want to leave?

178
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,370
Mistress, what you said was correct.

179
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,340
My hasty decision
to watch over him was misguided.

180
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,680
I've finally realized...

181
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,710
...that there's nothing I can do
for His Majesty.

182
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,010
I was trying to help His Majesty
lessen his burden,

183
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,430
I was not trying to confuse him.

184
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,420
But instead my presence alone...

185
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,000
...is causing him confusion.

186
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,610
The person he needs...

187
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,780
...is not me.

188
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,650
Leaving his side...

189
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,250
...might help him even more.

190
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,950
Your Majesty. You should take a nap.

191
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,280
You have not slept at all last night so
how will you attend the mourning court?

192
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Although I do not know
how much I resemble that person,

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,460
if there is anything else
you need to ask,

194
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,760
please ask her directly.

195
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,330
How do I ask a child
who has already died?

196
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,110
My father will soon be bringing me
that infusion.

197
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,290
And once I drink it,

198
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,180
I probably will never see you again,
Your Highness.

199
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,090
Once her father brings her the infusion...

200
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,180
...she won't ever see me again?

201
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,520
Woon. What does this mean?

202
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,300
Isn't it suggesting that
she foresaw that she would die soon?

203
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,160
That is what I thought at first.

204
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,870
But when you think about it...

205
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,390
...it's almost as if she meant to say...

206
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,460
...that the infusion her father brought
would kill her.

207
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,030
But Director Heo was renowned
for being a very warm father.

208
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,790
How could he possibly
do that to his daughter...

209
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,780
That is why I think it is strange.

210
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,250
As a matter of fact,
that is not the only strange thing.

211
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,760
She was a healthy Crown Princess.

212
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,090
She suddenly died
with no plausible explanation,

213
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,450
and yet he never investigated her death.

214
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,000
Your Majesty,
what exactly are you suggesting?

215
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,910
If the Crown Princess's death...

216
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,410
...was not because of a simple illness.

217
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,530
Then, that would make
Director Heo guilty,

218
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,350
of having killed his own daughter.

219
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,250
Do you think that the Prince Consort

220
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,130
will know anything about
that last infusion she drank?

221
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,260
He probably wouldn't.

222
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:14,050
He kept blaming himself because
instead of being by his sister's side,

223
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,160
he was at a relative's
after being sent there by Director Heo.

224
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,170
Then again, even if he did know,

225
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,640
asking him would be rather cruel.

226
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,840
What do you mean travel?

227
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,380
That is something I cannot do.

228
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,630
Travel the eastern provinces
and do some sightseeing,

229
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,610
so you'll find time
to sort out your feelings.

230
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,210
There is no hidden meaning.

231
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,330
May I come in?

232
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,920
Yes, please come in mother.

233
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,190
Did you finish packing
your travelling gear?

234
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,300
Yes.

235
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,470
If you leave on this trip,
we won't see each other for about a month.

236
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,320
Yes.

237
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,580
But did you bid farewell to the Princess?

238
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,540
Not yet.

239
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,560
How can you be so inattentive?

240
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,230
She is probably anxiously awaiting you,

241
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,350
so go and comfort her
before she feels any worse.

242
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Yes, mother.

243
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,460
Why are you avoiding me again?

244
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,470
I'm about to leave,

245
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,730
aren't you going to show me your face?

246
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
Can't I go with you?

247
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,670
This is a royal command...

248
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,500
...and the journey will be long and hard,

249
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,390
so it will not be good for you, Princess.

250
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,510
But...

251
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,650
...if you leave me,

252
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,150
we will be apart for so long.

253
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,690
Since I know you are waiting for me,

254
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,980
I will finish my mission
and return as soon as I can.

255
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,080
What is wrong?

256
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,340
I complain every day...

257
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,690
you must have had it with me.

258
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,170
That's not true.

259
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,340
Because of me,
you can't even become a courtier.

260
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,150
You are stuck at home...

261
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,870
...so you resent me, right?

262
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,040
I do not resent you.

263
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,110
Liar.

264
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,170
Princess, you are my family's saviour.

265
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,950
After Yeon Woo left us, you were the one

266
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,280
who brought laughter
back into this desolate house.

267
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,740
For that alone,
I feel nothing but gratitude for you.

268
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,470
Then...

269
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,330
...you will not abandon me?

270
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,530
Why are you saying this again?

271
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,020
Promise me.

272
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,890
Haven't I already handed my life to you?

273
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,050
So what do I have to give you now
to make you satisfied?

274
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,200
No, there's no need.

275
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,640
I will believe you
even if you do not give me anything.

276
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,780
I will believe the promise you made
about not abandoning me

277
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,180
and that of returning quickly.

278
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,390
So, even if I want to cry every night...

279
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,300
...I will restrain
myself and wait for you.

280
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,920
The Prince Consort has left
to go to the eastern provinces.

281
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,080
His Majesty is really something.

282
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,040
If he was going to send anyone
on a trip, it should have been me.

283
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,030
And the eastern provinces, of all places.

284
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,960
The scenery is beautiful.

285
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:55,650
And isn't Jinju renowned
for its wondrous sights and gisaeng?

286
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,830
What a pity.

287
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,320
How will someone as old fashioned
as the Prince Consort

288
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,660
ever understand the true meaning
of all this sweet opulence?

289
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,170
If the Prince Consort was more like you,

290
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,500
we would not be nervous.

291
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,710
It seems as His Majesty
is moving the Prince Consort

292
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,390
to gather the scattered scholars.

293
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,050
Have you prepared what I have asked for?

294
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,220
I will find documents accusing
the Prince Consort of misconduct...

295
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,790
...and report them to the palace.

296
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,220
What?

297
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:38,130
Are you suggesting that you found
traces of misconduct regarding Heo Yeom?

298
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,780
How exactly did you find
such rare evidence?

299
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,560
Fabrication?

300
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,370
His Majesty is as virtuous as they come,

301
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,710
but he tends to get carried away
by that bravado and fervor of his.

302
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:03,290
What better opportunity to tame him down
and show him what politics is all about?

303
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,490
May you revoke your royal command
issued to the Prince Consort, Sire.

304
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,090
They say that rumours spread like wildfire.

305
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,130
They do, indeed.

306
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,580
I thought that the Prince Consort
had already reported for the trip,

307
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,330
so what is the problem?

308
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:22,150
Traditionally, a Prince Consort
was forbidden from engaging in politics.

309
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,810
Petitions are worriedly questioning
what his true motives are.

310
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,080
Please, rescind your royal command.

311
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,200
The Prince Consort has spent
many years quietly at home.

312
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,160
The Princess really felt sorry for him,

313
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,570
so I ordered him on a vacation
to get some fresh air.

314
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,440
If that is so, please order him to travel
to another location.

315
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,910
And why is that?

316
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,520
For the Prince Consort to travel
to the eastern provinces

317
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,690
is an extremely dangerous endeavour.

318
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,830
Why?

319
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,030
By any chance, are you worried
that the Prince Consort

320
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,090
will gather scholars in those provinces...

321
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,300
...and incite a political riot?

322
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,780
We are merely offering
our heartfelt suggestion

323
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,960
with the Prince Consort's safety in mind.

324
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,740
The safety of the Prince Consort?

325
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,920
That of the Prince Consort
might be but a trivial journey,

326
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,870
but for those coveting power,
there will be no better chance than this.

327
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,590
Should they by any chance target him
to gain political power...

328
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,520
The Prince Consort
could become a political target?

329
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,150
Where there are people,
there can be compromises.

330
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,180
They might bandy about
their highfalutin principles,

331
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,280
but eventually, wouldn't they use
this opportunity to question your rule?

332
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,440
If it's born out of patriotic fervor,
I can only accept it.

333
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,440
I think I hear it now.

334
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,830
"He is nothing but a puppet whose throne
is controlled by his council."

335
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,080
That is treason, Your Majesty!

336
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,070
If anyone were to say such a thing,

337
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,740
he must be arrested immediately
and severely punished!

338
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,010
People can say
whatever they want in private.

339
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,150
You do the same
when you're in your private quarters.

340
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,430
Isn't that right?

341
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,520
As if damaging the Prince Consort
weren't enough,

342
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,860
now they are threatening me
with his safety as well.

343
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,480
Your Majesty, what is wrong?

344
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,510
Woon.

345
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,990
It has been a while,
but it is time for us to have some fun.

346
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,150
Why are you doing this again,
Your Majesty?

347
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,150
Since the last time I have come,

348
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,420
why have petitions decreased
instead of increasing as they should?

349
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,640
Because of the adverse weather,

350
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,960
deliveries coming from the provinces
are suffering great delays.

351
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,600
Deliveries have been delayed!

352
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,750
How very plausible.

353
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,110
So how did petitions condemning
the Prince Consort's travels reach us?

354
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,040
Are you telling me
that only rumours are handled quickly?

355
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,150
Your Majesty, that is...

356
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,480
I might have donned this crown
only three years ago...

357
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,190
...but you seem to have handled
even more petitions than your own king.

358
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,730
Sire, to peruse official records,
you know you must notify...

359
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,580
Considering the situation
I find myself in...

360
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,190
...it is no wonder my subjects
deride me this way!

361
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,240
However...

362
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,700
...should my descendants ever see this,
what will they think of me?

363
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,570
Tell me!

364
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,370
What would they think of me?

365
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,510
Your Majesty...

366
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,370
"A passionate but ultimately incompetent
weakling of a king?"

367
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,640
Or maybe
"a puppet manipulated by courtiers?"

368
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,150
Tell me!

369
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,460
These are the annals
that will define my legacy,

370
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,240
so what picture of my rule
will they ever paint?

371
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,000
Your Majesty.

372
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,380
As if covering my eyes and ears
weren't enough,

373
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,710
now you even dare defy me.

374
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,580
And that is no mere blasphemy.

375
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,160
It is treason.

376
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,270
Were you able to find any clues?

377
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,080
No, there's nothing.

378
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,090
It's strange. How can there be nothing?

379
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,010
By looking at the chronicles
from Yeon Woo's death eight years ago,

380
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,630
I thought we would be able to learn
more about the situation.

381
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,420
But it just says that
it was an ordinary death from malady.

382
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,170
But thinking it over,
wasn't that malady of hers too sudden?

383
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,170
And the timing was too coincidental.

384
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,350
If she became ill
before the selection process...

385
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,750
...then Director Heo's family
would not have been implicated.

386
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,670
If she had become ill
after the marriage ceremony...

387
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,210
...she would not have been so cruelly
chased out of the palace.

388
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,290
Your Highness.

389
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,760
Your Highness.

390
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,210
Why...

391
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,980
...did it happen then, of all times?

392
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,090
Why?

393
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,870
What did you just say?

394
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,900
The shaman resembles someone?

395
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,910
Yes, although I am not sure,
that is what I heard.

396
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,610
Tell me in more detail.

397
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,020
His Majesty was furious
and forcibly questioned the shaman.

398
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,720
She answered that she didn't know
how much she resembled that girl,

399
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,080
but she wasn't her,
so if he had any other question,

400
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,580
he should ask her first hand.

401
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,890
CLOSED

402
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,210
Your Majesty, what is wrong?

403
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,360
Court Lady Jo.

404
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,130
Didn't you hear a woman's cry
coming from the Hidden Moon Pavilion?

405
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,040
Is someone inside?

406
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,190
A shaman from the Seongsucheong.

407
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,700
From the Seongsucheong?

408
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,460
As you had commanded...

409
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,190
...I asked the Office of Astronomy
to speed up the marital bed date.

410
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,850
You did? Well done.

411
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,960
Your successor played a big part.

412
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,810
When the consummation matters are settled,

413
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,170
I will greatly reward her.

414
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,570
Actually, I have something to discuss
with you about that matter.

415
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,690
Go ahead.

416
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:16,170
I was thinking of sending the shaman
out of the palace.

417
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,180
It is right before the consummation,
how can we remove the talisman?

418
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,690
That is absurd!

419
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:29,780
His Majesty's health will stabilize
even without the help of a talisman.

420
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:37,060
And if he keeps that talisman by his side,
it could actually have adverse effects.

421
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,740
But if we suddenly ousted that girl...

422
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,310
...and His Majesty's health
were to decline again...

423
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,670
What really matters right now
is improving His Majesty's health...

424
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,450
...and to successfully
get a heir, isn't it?

425
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,550
So, is there another way?

426
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,810
A talisman to protect His Majesty's health

427
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,390
and one to help with consummation
are greatly different.

428
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,300
So from tonight onward,
in order to help with their consummation

429
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,620
I would like to use
a consummation talisman.

430
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,760
A consummation talisman?

431
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,520
Is there such a thing?

432
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,010
It is a talisman in preparation
of the consummation.

433
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,110
I see.

434
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,580
As long as the consummation will succeed,
anything can be done.

435
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,890
Do as you please.

436
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,390
I will adhere to your command,
Your Highness.

437
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,950
You have come, Your Majesty.

438
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,400
I heard from Grandmother
that you have returned.

439
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,610
After your successor entered the palace,

440
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,310
it is said that His Majesty's health
has greatly improved.

441
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,900
I do not deserve your praise.

442
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,400
But that child...

443
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,510
...does she resemble
the late Crown Princess?

444
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,680
Why do you ask that?

445
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,990
Even if you are not curious...

446
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,570
...the palace is a place
where there are no secrets.

447
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,260
His Majesty is not the kind of man
who'd fall head over heels over a woman.

448
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,870
Let alone so easily
let her stay by his side.

449
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Do they really look that much alike?

450
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,960
In my eyes, she is just a plain child.

451
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,740
I would like to meet her myself
and reward her.

452
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,230
When would be a...

453
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,510
Your expression...

454
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,680
...is clouded by concern.

455
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:25,760
Since when have you heard cries
from the Hidden Moon Pavilion?

456
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,430
Please do not worry.

457
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,960
My successor
will soon be leaving the palace.

458
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,910
The date of the consummation
will also be moved up.

459
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,070
Everything will be as you wish.

460
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,210
So you will not need to make any requests
to the Queen Dowager.

461
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,400
I have received permission
from the Queen Dowager.

462
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,370
Starting today, you do not have to enter
the main palace.

463
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,240
You got what you wished for,
and yet you look disappointed.

464
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,080
I am not.

465
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,640
I feel as if I've caused you trouble.

466
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,890
Tomorrow prepare to leave
the palace with Seol.

467
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,860
I will do so.

468
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,220
Who did it come from?

469
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,200
Do I even have to report that?

470
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,180
Wol.

471
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,470
It's me, Jan Shil.

472
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,020
You were worried about me, weren't you?

473
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,160
Thanks to a good person,
I've been doing well.

474
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,180
If I had to describe him...

475
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,600
...he is a very wonderful
and kind person.

476
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,450
He is a man among men.

477
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,310
He is someone who is bold
and free-spirited,

478
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,770
but someone who will flare up
at the mere sight of injustice.

479
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,460
Anyway, thanks to him,

480
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,840
I am staying in a small inn in the city.

481
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,810
So I have a favour to ask.

482
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,520
Can you bring me my clothes?

483
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,280
But you have to keep it a secret
from the mistress.

484
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,750
And do not bring Seol.

485
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,500
She's in cahoots with the mistress,
seeing how she reacted this morning.

486
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,920
I'm sure.

487
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,320
Father must have had a lot of suspicions

488
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,510
and probably ordered
a secret investigation.

489
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,220
There must be a secret record
not held within the annals.

490
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,420
Please be advised
to remove the Princess Successor

491
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,260
from the palace, Your Majesty!

492
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,890
Furthermore, the father
who hid his daughter's illness

493
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,350
and listed her for selection,
Director Heo Young Jae,

494
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,080
and the one who hid his family's illness

495
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,000
and entered the Sigangwon, Heo Yeom,

496
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,540
should be held accountable
for their crimes.

497
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,010
My father will be bringing me
that infusion soon.

498
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,380
But, Father has long passed away,

499
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,380
and the doctor
who treated Yeon Woo at the time

500
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,580
was ordered to take poison
after my father passed.

501
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,560
The director who gave
the mysterious infusion to Yeon Woo

502
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,680
has left this world
because of an illness.

503
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,500
The people who would know anything
about that ordeal are all dead.

504
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,160
There is no one left who is alive.

505
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,700
There is just one person who is alive.

506
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,500
The person who served
the king so closely...

507
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,740
...the previous head of eunuchs.

508
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,010
Woon.

509
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,230
Why did he suddenly ask me
to make a snowman?

510
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,590
Your Majesty, it is Hyung Sun.

511
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,510
As you have ordered,
I have brought the snowman.

512
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,440
Your Majesty!

513
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,020
Your Majesty!

514
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,340
What is wrong?

515
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,240
You know already, so why do you ask?

516
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,620
The house of the former head of eunuchs
is over there, somewhere?

517
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

518
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,320
What?

519
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,930
You are people sent by His Majesty?

520
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,390
Is the owner inside?

521
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,430
Well...

522
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,900
...Master has become ill,

523
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,050
so he left to receive treatment far away.

524
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,790
How disrespectful of him!

525
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,750
His Majesty has urgent matters to discuss
with him, so he sent a notice.

526
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,250
But, tell me. What do you think?

527
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,560
Do you think this treatment
will keep him away for long,

528
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,480
or that he will make his return
right away?

529
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,810
I wouldn't know what to say...

530
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,390
All right.

531
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,230
When your master returns, tell him this.

532
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,210
No matter how hard he tries to hide,
the truth will be revealed.

533
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,800
Though he evaded me for now,

534
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,330
in the future, he will deal
with an even bigger punishment.

535
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,720
And we might leave now
out of gratitude for his years of service,

536
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,680
but if he does not enter the palace
by tomorrow,

537
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,950
it will not be in the palace
that I'll see him, but in prison.

538
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,760
Tell him this on my behalf.

539
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,530
You were fully aware
that he was in the house,

540
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,160
but why did you not meet him?

541
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,260
For eight years, he kept his mouth shut
as if he were dead.

542
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,790
If a loyal servant like him
is avoiding me...

543
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,340
...then father must have ordered him
to hide the truth.

544
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,240
So, if we had forced our way in
to make him talk,

545
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,450
it would have had the opposite effect

546
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,510
and we would not have gained
any information at all.

547
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,120
Today was just a test to see
if my hunch was correct.

548
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,330
May I ask what do you think is happening?

549
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,330
Yeon Woo's death was no simple illness.

550
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,130
Also, the secret records
that father has left behind

551
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,710
actually do exist somewhere.

552
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,940
What would those secret records...

553
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,710
If the death was not illness but murder,

554
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,420
then why did my father hide the truth?

555
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,920
There surely must be a reason
why he concealed that truth.

556
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,600
Don't you think he'll have left traces
of that reason somewhere?

557
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,290
Woon.

558
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,700
My head hurts.

559
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,690
It has been a while
since we have come out,

560
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,410
so let's get some fresh air.

561
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,030
Okay. Come again.

562
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,430
After you finish eating,
return to the Seongsucheong.

563
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,870
-Are you all right?
-Brother.

564
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,570
What if I didn't go back
to the Seongsucheong?

565
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,600
How long are you going to run away
because you are scared?

566
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,880
As I said, just go back
and beg for forgiveness.

567
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,390
Given the situation,
you have no other choice.

568
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,340
Even if I want to apologize,

569
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,790
I probably won't have limbs to beg with.

570
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,990
As soon as I enter,
they will be ripped away from my body.

571
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,700
How can a beautiful lady like you
utter such cruel words?

572
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:21,620
When the mistress says something,
she carries through with it.

573
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,870
Knowing her,
my limbs have little chance of making it.

574
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,290
If you feared so much for your life,

575
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,440
why risk it all just to help me?

576
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,610
Because you were the first.

577
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,610
Because you were the first person...

578
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,510
...to ever risk his life for me.

579
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,530
I don't even remember what
the parents who abandoned me looked like.

580
00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:00,240
But I'll never forget the face
of someone who saved me like you.

581
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,810
Then, we're more or less on the same boat.

582
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,990
So you were abandoned as well,
and will never forget someone's face?

583
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,070
Well...

584
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,100
...something like that.

585
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,020
What kind of person is that,
to never forget her?

586
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,710
A bright and cheerful person.

587
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,710
Just by looking at her,
she put me at ease.

588
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,430
She caused me a lot of pain...

589
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:57,460
...but she also made me very happy.

590
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,420
Then, I called Wol here for no reason.

591
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,570
What did you say just now?

592
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,410
I called Wol here
so that you could meet her.

593
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,300
Why suddenly the paper store, Milady?

594
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,760
Do you plan on writing a letter?

595
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,740
Not a simple letter, but an apology.

596
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,330
Why are you writing an apology
on such expensive paper?

597
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,240
Just meet him in person
and apologize to him.

598
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,270
I'm sorry, Milady.

599
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,240
It'll just be a minute.
I need to go to the blacksmith.

600
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,640
Just a minute!

601
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,510
Please escape.

602
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,550
This is not a destiny
that you can handle.

603
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,280
Don't let there be any more
connection between you two.

604
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,360
Do you know who I am?

605
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,050
Did you hope I had forgotten about you?

606
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,960
Why are you walking so slowly?

607
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,420
Quick, let us go.

608
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,650
Is there a law that states

609
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,700
that you have to go all the way to Jinju
to see the best courtesans?

610
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,070
Is that all?

611
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,280
A spacious racing area,
magnificent lodge,

612
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,080
comfortable drinking habits.

613
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,040
If there was a utopia,
it would probably be this place.

614
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,230
Have you forgotten what political climate
we're in as of late?

615
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,060
And yet you have time to amuse yourself
in this manner, Finance Minister.

616
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,310
If you are so displeased,
you can always leave.

617
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,260
But is drinking all you can do in Jongro?

618
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,840
A new atmosphere can bring forth
a flash of inspiration, so...

619
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,200
Well, let's take a look.

620
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:02,120
Then, I will go ahead and get us a seat.

621
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,000
Follow me.

622
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,120
Why are you out here?

623
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,110
You said you had an errand to run.

624
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,280
I was travelling incognito.

625
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,580
Did I tell you already?

626
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,410
You came alone, without any protection?

627
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,820
Although we don't see him,

628
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,980
Woon is keeping a watchful eye on us
from somewhere.

629
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:46,930
But...

630
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,850
...can a so-called talisman like you
freely roam the streets by day?

631
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,070
What?

632
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,330
No wonder...

633
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,440
....I was wondering why I felt all sore
after waking up in the morning.

634
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,440
Now I know why.

635
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,900
The talisman sits by me
after being exposed to bad air,

636
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,640
so of course I will have a headache.

637
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,480
Are you feeling ill?

638
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,230
I was just joking.

639
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,370
Couldn't you tell I was joking?

640
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,070
That's a relief.

641
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,850
I wouldn't want to interrupt your visit,
so I shall take my leave.

642
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,180
Wait a minute.

643
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,850
Councilor Yoon and his people
are coming this way.

644
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,310
Before we run into them,

645
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,920
we must hurry back to the palace.

646
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:17,780
I understand.

647
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,440
You disrespectful scoundrel!

648
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,780
What are you going to do about this?
What are you going to do?

649
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,810
Do you know how valuable this robe is?

650
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,010
It is made from the finest silk
from the imperial Ming palace.

651
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,260
How will you pay for this?

652
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,490
I am sorry. Please forgive me.

653
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,030
Again he goes.

654
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,220
I hate people who try
to talk their way out of things the most!

655
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,330
Don't use your mouth,
but your body to repay me.

656
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,810
Drag him home and make him chop wood.

657
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,230
-Make him chop a lot of wood.
-Yes.

658
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,480
Please let the child go.

659
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,050
On a busy crowded market street,

660
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,700
it is inevitable for people
to bump into each other.

661
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,780
The child did not do it deliberately,
so please forgive him.

662
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,690
This gown is so precious
that you cannot wash it with water.

663
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,190
That's why I'm making him repay me.

664
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,880
If he cannot pay me,
then I will use him as my servant,

665
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,630
so what exactly is the problem?

666
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,240
It seems as if you a
respectable nobleman...

667
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,070
...you at least have sharp eyes.

668
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,480
I am the Minister of Finance.

669
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,910
Shouldn't someone of such high rank
be more charitable than most?

670
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,990
Listen to you...

671
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,520
...I was going to let you go
because you're pretty,

672
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,800
but how dare you raise your voice at me?

673
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,680
It is the same with your clothes.

674
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,760
As a high-ranking official
of this country,

675
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,370
you ignore the fine materials
made in our country

676
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,890
and only look for silk made by the Ming.

677
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,330
What will commoners think of you?

678
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,060
Say what? I ought to...

679
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,270
What are you doing?
Grab this woman and take her back!

680
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,270
Yes!

681
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,240
Please let me go.

682
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,130
-That brat!
-Please let go.

683
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,550
Catch those people!

684
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,670
Catch them. Catch him!

685
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,240
What is the matter?

686
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,220
His Majesty?

687
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,810
How can you be so reckless?

688
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,860
Did you think that after chastising
the Minister of Finance like that

689
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,470
they would have just left you go
without saying a thing?

690
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:17,200
Then, was I just supposed to stare
at such injustice perpetrated against her?

691
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,250
That child dirtied his garments,

692
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,130
so is it not natural that he would ask
for compensation?

693
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,320
Do you even realize
how expensive Ming silk...

694
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,640
The higher your rank is,
the most frugal you should be.

695
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,700
That is true.

696
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,220
But they are still figures of authority,

697
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,330
should they not prove their status?

698
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:46,570
During the reign of Sejong,
a man named Yo Gwan,

699
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,960
at the time a state councilor,

700
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,690
lived in a thatched house
without even a fence.

701
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,520
So King Sejong who pitied him
made him a wall.

702
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,360
Because he was a government official,
he could not decline the wall,

703
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,640
so he kept his front gates open
all the time.

704
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,410
What do you think were his intentions?

705
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,670
He was being frugal,
so that others would follow his lead.

706
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:17,010
Why is it that you, a shaman,
keep saying things that are true...

707
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,110
...but unpleasant to the ears?

708
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,080
A sharp rock will be hit with a rock...

709
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,330
...so if you continue to live like that,
you won't be able to...

710
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,470
How dare you look away
when I am speaking?

711
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,320
Now. Now. Instead of furtively looking,

712
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,020
come and see the show for yourself.

713
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,930
Or you eyes will become slanted.

714
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,640
It is a popular story
about the first love of a servant girl.

715
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,640
The first seats are available.

716
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:03,770
How about it?

717
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,590
You want to watch, right?

718
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,440
Ehh... You're hesitating too much.

719
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,830
At this rate, you'll lose the seat.

720
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,000
Come with me.

721
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,930
You won't regret it.

722
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,750
Get out of the way. Move. Move.

723
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,660
Here, what do you think?

724
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,830
You'll be able to see well, right?

725
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:29,820
So...

726
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:31,930
...that'll be five nyang.

727
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:35,990
Five nyang.

728
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:43,700
Here you go.

729
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,980
Yes.

730
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,390
Altogether, ten nyang. It's correct.

731
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,960
Then, have a good time.

732
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,610
Although I didn't mean to,

733
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,080
I am indebted to you.

734
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,220
I'll repay you when we enter the palace,

735
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,420
so don't worry.

736
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,870
I am a criminal.

737
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,940
You mustn't do this.

738
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,960
What crime have you committed?

739
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:48,200
I wasn't able to recognize His Majesty,
who is higher than the heavens,

740
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,770
but I fell in love with you.

741
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,670
This was my first crime.

742
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,070
After I knew of your status,
I could not forget about you

743
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,900
and I even entered the palace.

744
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,280
-That is my second crime.
-Move your arm.

745
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,790
Move your head. I can't see.

746
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,750
-I can't see.
-What are you doing?

747
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,420
I can't see.

748
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,830
Do you want to cut all ties with me...

749
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,180
Move your arm!

750
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,540
-How could that be your fault alone?
-How insolent!

751
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,020
Who do you think I am?

752
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,840
So what if you're a nobleman?
You should let us watch the show!

753
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,520
My dear, if only I could,

754
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:27,860
I would give up everything for you.

755
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,090
Even if I rule over of all our people,

756
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:39,390
if I can't have you,

757
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,900
what is the point of being king?

758
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,240
Your Majesty...

759
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,930
...your Majesty, I am sorry.

760
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,080
You find this vulgar tripe entertaining?

761
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,860
Yes, I do.

762
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,910
I will remember you forever.

763
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:03,760
So Your Majesty,
please take care of your health.

764
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,450
I wish you and the Queen
100 years of happiness.

765
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,590
She surely is taking her time.

766
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,790
Did you tell her the directions correctly?

767
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,790
Third...

768
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:20,220
Stop.

769
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,480
Speak no more.

770
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:27,680
Have you met that person?

771
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:37,510
Have you met her?

772
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,510
I wasn't able to meet her.

773
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,550
Why weren't you able to meet her?

774
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:00,660
Why weren't you able to meet her?

775
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:08,370
Because she is no longer alive.

776
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,820
How did that...

777
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,350
It is my fault.

778
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,130
I tried to protect her...

779
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,310
...but I was unable to do so.

780
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,000
There was so much
I wanted to say to her...

781
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,040
...but I was unable to say it.

782
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,720
That is why I am still...

783
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,100
...unable to let her go.

784
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,480
I heard that shamans...

785
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,960
...can communicate with the dead.

786
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,820
Is that true?

787
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,600
That is what I heard.

788
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:19,470
Then will you tell that child
something on my behalf?

789
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,550
What do you want to tell her?

790
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,630
That I really...

791
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,020
...really...

792
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,760
...liked her.

793
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,910
Tonight, I

794
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:35,790
will not be able to protect
Your Majesty's side.

795
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:40,380
I cannot take other people
looking affectionately at you.

796
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,870
Can't it be me?

797
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:47,440
The person that I am looking at is you.

798
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,840
Who said you can leave
the palace at will?

799
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,680
Who did you receive permission from?

800
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:53,440
Who says you completed your work?

801
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,580
I am confused.

802
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,080
Until I figure out
what these feelings are...
