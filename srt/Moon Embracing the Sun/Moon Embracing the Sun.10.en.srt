1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,310
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,910
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,020
Episode 10

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,070
I am extremely exhausted right now.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,960
Moreover, the pain in my heart
that I can't bear...

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,880
...is completely occupying it.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,180
Therefore, you need to help me forget
about all of it.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,750
You have to put to rest
this pain in my heart.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,630
Do you think you can do it?

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,500
Answer me. Do you think you can do it?

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,830
Please allow me to do so.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,450
If Your Majesty permits,

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,430
I will prevent the misfortune and death
that threaten you from harming you.

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,520
Lift your head up.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,750
Lift it.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,020
That is an order.

17
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,570
I came because I was worried about
His Majesty's health.

18
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,160
Do not report this to His Majesty.

19
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,770
-Is anyone outside?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,880
Please give your order.

21
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,590
Call the royal physician.

22
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,560
What?

23
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,220
Is Your Majesty feeling unwell?

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,000
It's not me who is unwell,

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,050
it is that lady.

26
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,760
Your Majesty, that is not possible.

27
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,270
What isn't?

28
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,330
The royal physician
only treats the royal family.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,660
How can he treat a lowly shaman?

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,060
Doesn't she block bad luck
and misfortune for me as a human talisman?

31
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,500
If she is not feeling well,
then it will also have an influence on me.

32
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,880
So this is not for her, but for me.

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,380
Call him immediately.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,780
But Your Majesty...

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
It's a royal command!

36
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,160
Why did you come out?

37
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,060
He ordered everyone to leave the palace.

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,340
What is that?

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,430
While we were searching the shaman,
this came out. Looks like a letter.

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,490
It seems that wicked wench
wrote His Majesty a love letter.

41
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,990
Take a look at it.

42
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,940
Your Majesty.

43
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,020
It was definitely the gaze of a man
looking at a woman.

44
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
You have to put to rest...

45
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,820
...this pain in my heart.

46
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,860
I will prevent the misfortune and death
that threaten you from harming you.

47
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,460
What is this?

48
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,230
This was found
while searching the shaman.

49
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,370
I think that it was meant
for Your Majesty.

50
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,440
If you decline it, I will take it away.

51
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,500
Leave it.

52
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,170
"Need not beauty a weed to prosper."

53
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,910
Wild herbs are not beautiful
but they are useful.

54
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,300
"Need no humanity a shaman to serve."

55
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,550
Although shamans
are not deemed as humans,

56
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,150
we still want to be
Your Majesty's people.

57
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,280
You're not even a human...

58
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,660
...but you dare lay a hand on me?

59
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,900
"Shamans are your subjects and humans too,
so don't neglect us."

60
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,970
It's short and delivers a powerful blow.

61
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,280
It is amazing that a shaman knows
how to write in the learned man's script.

62
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,410
And it's even more amazing that a shaman
is able to write such beautiful words.

63
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,780
Look at these characters, Hyung Sun.

64
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,970
How can you say that
a 13 year old girl wrote this?

65
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,550
I thought she was wise,
but she's foolish, isn't she?

66
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,050
-I...
-I...

67
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,920
-...How can I ever forget you?
-...How can I ever forget you?

68
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,800
Your Majesty.

69
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,910
What is it?

70
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,650
That lady...

71
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,540
...is a shaman.

72
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,810
Who said she isn't?

73
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,780
I served you your whole life.

74
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,050
How could I not understand
what you are thinking?

75
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,670
Please, do not let your heart waver.

76
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,400
So you're suggesting
that I will waver because of a shaman?

77
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,870
That lady...

78
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,180
...is not Yeon Woo.

79
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,790
Similar as they might be,
Lady Yeon Woo is already...

80
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,000
Shut it. Shut your mouth!

81
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Your Majesty.

82
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,790
I can't stand looking at you,
so turn around.

83
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,480
Last night,

84
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,960
the Queen came to the palace and left.

85
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,860
She threw away her pride as a woman...

86
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,770
...and came here with difficulty.
But when she had to turn back,

87
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,680
how do you think the Queen felt?

88
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,110
So please, understand
the Queen's feelings.

89
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,040
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

90
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,530
What is the fuss about?

91
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,170
There is word that His Majesty
is coming to Gyo Tae Palace.

92
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,560
Hurry.

93
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,170
Hurry and bring my accessories over.

94
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,460
-Quickly.
-Yes.

95
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,620
Did you say His Majesty
has gone to Gyo Tae Palace?

96
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,500
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,540
I saw it myself while coming here.

98
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,260
Thus far, the Queen has endured
a lot of heartache.

99
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,220
Her sincerity is what made His Majesty
open his heart to her.

100
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,200
It is truly remarkable.

101
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,440
What?

102
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,480
After receiving the shaman at his palace,
everything is becoming comfortable.

103
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,640
How can it only be thanks to that child?

104
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,680
Could it not be the heavens' way
of paying back all the affection

105
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,140
that Your Highness has shown for him
on a daily basis?

106
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,670
Just by being by his side,
his body has become stronger...

107
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,940
...and she has even managed
to resolve their troubled relationship.

108
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,680
She is indeed worthy of being
Shaman Jang's successor.

109
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,020
I think we should tell
the Office of Astronomy

110
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,640
to pick another auspicious date
for the consummation.

111
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,520
What?

112
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,740
A date has already been set, so why?

113
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,250
Because of His Majesty's refusal, every
time we put effort into picking a date,

114
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,220
it turned out to be a waste of time,
didn't it?

115
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,910
Now, His Majesty's body is strong

116
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,270
and it seems like
their relationship is improving,

117
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,670
so how can we elude this opportunity?

118
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,000
But if we consider the adverse weather
and the busy schedule that is to come,

119
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,760
there probably won't be
many auspicious days left.

120
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,330
The heavens are helping us.

121
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,700
How can we wait one month?

122
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,670
We have to advance the date
as much as we can.

123
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,900
You do not look well.

124
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
Is there a concern you have
that you cannot talk about?

125
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,050
For me...

126
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,160
...besides being concerned
about Your Majesty's well-being,

127
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,570
what else is there to be concerned about?

128
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,480
It is just that I was not able
to sleep well last night.

129
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,740
Last night...

130
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,980
...I heard you came by Gang Nyung Palace.

131
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,490
I apologize.

132
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,320
I know it was wrong, but I was
worried about your health, so I...

133
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,980
What were you trying to monitor?

134
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,000
What?

135
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,150
Monitor?

136
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,750
How can you say such improper...

137
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,310
No matter what you saw or heard...

138
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,700
...there was no one in my bedroom.

139
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,470
If you saw something...

140
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,980
...that was the talisman
that the Office of Astronomy used.

141
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,730
Was it in a month?

142
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,070
What are you referring to?

143
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,260
Our consummation date.

144
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,570
The royal physicians
and the Office of Astronomy...

145
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,880
...have asked for us
to distance ourselves until then...

146
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,790
...and focus on purifying
our body and soul.

147
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,590
Therefore, don't come
to Gang Nyung Palace again.

148
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,790
Is that what you mean?

149
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,060
Looks like you understand.

150
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,800
What exactly are you trying to hide?

151
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,930
What would you be so adamant to hide...

152
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,620
...that you're even concerned about
my presence in your quarters?

153
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,200
Is it love?

154
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,340
A dead girl was not enough.

155
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,680
Are you keeping a lowly shaman
close to your heart now?

156
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,520
Court Lady Jo.

157
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

158
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,140
Among the King's attendants,
see if there is anyone we can use.

159
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,290
What?

160
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,220
Why a secretive attendant?

161
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,090
If you find someone useful...

162
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,990
...tell her to watch the shaman
that is by His Majesty's side every night,

163
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,710
and report everything to me.

164
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
Your Majesty.

165
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,390
Shaman?

166
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,020
Look closely at my face.

167
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,860
The woman who came here
with me last time.

168
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,850
Don't you remember her?

169
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,200
Oh! I do remember.

170
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,240
Because she was so gentle and dignified,
I thought she was aristocratic.

171
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,670
She is a shaman?

172
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,410
Has she come again since then?

173
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,010
She hasn't, if I remember correctly.

174
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,740
All right.

175
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,270
Just hang on a moment.
I will take you to a physician.

176
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,040
And also, I am not an ahjussi, Kiddo!

177
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,290
She was filled with such evil

178
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,500
that we sent her far away to the south.

179
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,210
Although I am thankful
for your consideration,

180
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,250
I am in a safe place now.

181
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,380
She did not even register her name,

182
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
and committed a promiscuous offense.

183
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,970
Isn't it natural we would try
to apprehend her?

184
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,600
I am Wol.

185
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,120
One of the two is lying to me for sure...

186
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,240
...but for what reason would you lie?

187
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Brother!

188
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,840
Brother?

189
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,180
You were alive!

190
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,480
Hold on!

191
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,330
From what I can see,
you shouldn't be a gisaeng...

192
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,040
Not a gisaeng, a shaman.

193
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,640
I am a palace shaman.

194
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,700
A palace shaman?

195
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,080
Don't you remember the mystical stone?

196
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,190
Mystical stone?

197
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,660
Before our knees can touch the ground,
the child who foretold everything?

198
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,700
Wow, you've become a woman already.

199
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,460
I almost didn't recognize you.

200
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,780
Have you been well?

201
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
Since the Mistress took me in,

202
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,240
now I am not a fake, but a real shaman.

203
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,150
That's a relief.

204
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,150
Just now...

205
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,380
...did you say you're a shaman?

206
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,250
Yeah. I belong to the Seongsucheong.

207
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,290
The safest place for a shaman
is inside the capital.

208
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,400
A place where shamans
can freely enter the capital.

209
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,930
Among the Seongsucheong shamans...

210
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,690
...is there a shaman named Wol?

211
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,900
Wol...

212
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,730
I told you to watch your mouth
so many times.

213
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,340
Do I have to sew your mouth shut
before you come to your senses?!

214
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,330
Even if you see, pretend you didn't.

215
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,220
Even if you heard, pretend you didn't.

216
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
I told you not to say a word!

217
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,920
Did I say something?

218
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,240
Moon or sun as they may be,

219
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,240
I dare you to say them again.

220
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,170
I dare you to talk about anything
regarding Milady!

221
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,930
On that day,
your limbs will be torn from your body!

222
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,400
I don't know.

223
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,380
I've never heard that name before.

224
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,820
Don't be like this!
Think about it carefully.

225
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,140
I really don't know.

226
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,450
There is no such name
at the Seongsucheong.

227
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,640
Hey, Jan Shil!

228
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,920
-I'm coming!
-You're not coming?

229
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,120
How long do you plan on chatting?

230
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,480
Brother, if it's in our destiny,
let us meet again.

231
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,240
Hey...

232
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,620
If she's not in the Seongsucheong,
then where is she?

233
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,730
You were excited about leaving the palace,
but why are you acting like this?

234
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,060
I'm sorry, Brother.

235
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,190
I'm really sorry.

236
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,070
Milady.

237
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,720
Milady!

238
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,930
Milady.

239
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,420
What is it?

240
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,040
Did you have that dream again?

241
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,860
You haven't had it for a while.

242
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,070
Why are you having it again?

243
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,420
I know.

244
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,080
This time, weren't you able
to see his face?

245
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,850
This time, I really wanted to see it.

246
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,150
This time I would have been able
to see it.

247
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,490
Milady, are you really that curious
about the face behind the mask?

248
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,020
Every night, you are by
his side, protecting him.

249
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,950
I was taken aback by your letter.

250
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,680
It was more than enough
to show me how much you resented me.

251
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,160
I do not resent you.

252
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,000
You say you do not,

253
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,200
but your words were chastising me.

254
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,070
Am I wrong about what I saw?

255
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,100
A sincere remonstration
and personal feelings of resentment

256
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,110
are two different things.

257
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,660
So you were not resenting me,

258
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,030
but you were indeed chastising me.

259
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,580
All I wanted to say...

260
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,960
...is that just like rocks on the
street side exist for a reason.

261
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,070
I, as a shaman
and one of Your Majesty's subjects,

262
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,570
shall spare no effort in serving you.

263
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,020
So the intent was to chastise a king
for not taking heed of his people...

264
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,100
...not bringing to question
whether I was capable to run this nation.

265
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,480
Should a reader
ignore the writer's intentions

266
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,710
and let his judgment be clouded
by personal whims and prejudice,

267
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,610
then a misunderstanding will arise.

268
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,710
If Your Majesty felt that way,

269
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,380
would there not be a reason?

270
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,450
Now you seem to suggest,

271
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,580
that prejudice clouded my judgment enough
to make me ignore that letter's meaning,

272
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,840
which in itself is a criticism
of my tenure in politics.

273
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,270
I didn't mean that...

274
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,780
I treat you with benevolence
and yet you repay me with this affront.

275
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,320
Have you forgotten
who you are speaking to?

276
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,660
I am this nation, Joseon's...

277
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,280
I am this nation, Joseon's...

278
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,530
Is anyone there?

279
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,890
How may I be of service?

281
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,440
I am exasperated.

282
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,340
I need to go for a walk,
so prepare for it.

283
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,640
The night wind is cold.

284
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,820
How about waiting until tomorrow...

285
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,870
Didn't you hear me say
I was exasperated?!

286
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,910
Hasten with the preparations.

287
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,140
What are you doing?

288
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,530
What?

289
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,220
I recall you saying
you would protect me from evil spirits,

290
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,590
so why aren't you doing your job now?

291
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,930
You are my talisman, so follow me.

292
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,270
Keep me at a distance.

293
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,130
I told you to follow me at a distance!

294
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,310
Woon.

295
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,610
You as well.

296
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,330
You stay where you are.
You are my talisman, aren't you?

297
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,780
Go further back!

298
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,290
Closed.

299
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,050
Let go!

300
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,760
Yeon Woo.

301
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,390
Yeon Woo!

302
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,250
By any chance, was this the place...

303
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,790
...where Your Majesty
buried your memories and sorrow?

304
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,260
Do the tears someone
shed here in the past...

305
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,440
...belong to you, Sire?

306
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,550
What on earth did you see?

307
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,770
Did you see it with your spiritual powers?

308
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,700
I did.

309
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,060
Then, use the same powers to guess.

310
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,300
Guess what?

311
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,040
What do you think I will be doing next?

312
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,090
Today, Hyung Sun
said something very strange to me.

313
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
What do you think about it?

314
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,810
Do you believe
that I can harbor feelings...

315
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,310
...for a lowly shaman like you?

316
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,340
Why are you doing this?

317
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,080
What are you doing? Go after them.

318
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,120
Tell me...

319
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,250
...who are you?

320
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,240
-I am Shaman Wol.
-No!

321
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,670
You are not Wol.

322
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,860
Then, who am I?

323
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,370
I used to live as a nameless shaman...

324
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,790
...until Your Majesty gave me this name.

325
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,990
Do you really...

326
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,090
...not know who I am?

327
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,650
Have you really never met me?

328
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:23,290
Whose traces
are you expecting to find in me?

329
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,180
Who are you seeing, when you look at me?

330
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,950
Yeon Woo...

331
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,110
...is she the one?

332
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,060
What is the reason you allow me
to stay by your side?

333
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,410
Is it because I look like that person?

334
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,900
But...

335
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,880
...I'm not who you're looking for.

336
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,580
Shut it, shut that mouth!

337
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,100
You are crossing the line now.

338
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,880
Does allowing you to be by my side
mean I gave you my heart as well?

339
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,860
You are nothing but a lowly talisman,
no more and no less than that!

340
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
Who are you to dare...

341
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,120
How dare you.

342
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,480
Who do you think you are?

343
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,980
Who would dare... ...confuse me this way?

344
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,040
Stay away from me.

345
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,290
If you cross the line again,
I will not forgive you.

346
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,600
I will be sleeping alone tonight,
so you do not need to follow me in.

347
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,510
Woon.

348
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,380
Without letting her know,
escort her back.

349
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,660
Also, on your way back, there
is somewhere you need to go.

350
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,560
Does allowing you to be by my side
mean I gave you my heart as well?

351
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,070
You are nothing but a lowly talisman,
no more and no less than that!

352
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,340
What are you doing here,
instead of being by His Majesty's side?

353
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,610
Did something happen?

354
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,420
Mistress.

355
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,650
Who exactly...

356
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,450
...am I?

357
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,230
You sensed spiritual powers in me
when I used to wander the streets

358
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,880
after being abandoned by my parents.

359
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,050
That is the reason you took me in,
you said at the time.

360
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,940
And why would you suddenly bring that up?

361
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,700
In the last few days...

362
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,050
...weird memories have kept
creeping up on me.

363
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,620
They are certainly
someone else's memories...

364
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,430
...but they feel so strongly as my own.

365
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,910
So I am confused.

366
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,820
It is but a result of your not being able
to control your spiritual powers yet.

367
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,370
So, do not let
those past memories affect you.

368
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,790
So...

369
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,720
...those memories will never
truly be mine, I suppose?

370
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,670
No matter how much I resemble her...

371
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,140
...I cannot be that person, right?

372
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,910
Who is it?

373
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,660
Prince Yang Myung, you startled me!

374
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,240
That was exactly my purpose.

375
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,630
What? Why do you climb over the wall
every time you come in?

376
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,940
That's...

377
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,020
...I've just gotten used to it
so I prefer it over the front gates.

378
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,410
And besides, we're past the curfew.

379
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,720
It was hard to slip past the patrols!

380
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,580
Come, now. Let's go in and have a drink.

381
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,090
Jae Woon.

382
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,990
What brings you here this late at night?

383
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,350
You startled me.

384
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,790
How can you appear without making a sound?

385
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,660
You didn't climb over the wall like me,
did you?

386
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,190
Given how late it was...

387
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,290
Did you come as a royal messenger,
or as a friend?

388
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,500
His Majesty has ordered
the Prince Consort to enter the palace.

389
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,750
Why did he seek my presence so suddenly?

390
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,200
Well... Unless Your Majesty
allowed you to disclose details,

391
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,050
you certainly wouldn't divulge them.

392
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,770
Since I have relayed the command,
I will be going now.

393
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,070
Already?

394
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,160
I have left my position long enough.

395
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,480
Yeon Woo said it was a birthday present
and made it for me.

396
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,320
Then, this is your sister's handwriting?

397
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,690
That is right.

398
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,760
Her handwriting is extraordinary.

399
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,460
Not just her handwriting,

400
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,730
but her deep understanding
of the Classics of Literature

401
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,010
was enough to pity the fact
that she was born a girl.

402
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,260
More than that,
she was a thoughtful and respectful child.

403
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,430
But, why do you ask that?

404
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,970
It is because her writing caught my eye,
so I asked.

405
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,120
Who sent you?

406
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,940
Why were you watching over
the Prince Consort's residence?

407
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,670
You're...

408
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,190
...Kim Jae Woon finally capitulates
for a woman.

409
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,730
Remarkable, indeed.

410
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,830
It is an unprecedented event.

411
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,310
What do you mean, woman?

412
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,330
It is not like that.

413
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,000
What else do you think it could be?

414
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,030
Anyway, a woman is a woman.

415
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,900
But I've heard that Your Highness
has found a lover as well.

416
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,860
I guess Princess Min Hwa tattled on me.

417
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,090
Is it true, then?

418
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,920
I thought it was a joke,
but I guess it is true.

419
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,420
What kind of person is she?

420
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,980
Well...

421
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,710
What kind of person is she?

422
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,950
To tell you the truth,
I don't know either.

423
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,840
-What?
-Did you know this?

424
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:40,100
Eight years ago, the night before
the Crown Princess selection...

425
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,390
...I climbed over this house's wall.

426
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,800
Will you go with me?

427
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,470
I can throw away my princehood,
the title of Prince Yang Myung,

428
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,760
wrap you up and run away with you.

429
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,500
But...

430
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,930
...do you know what
your sister said to me?

431
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,610
You shouldn't jest like that.

432
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,840
Her sparkling eyes were so firm...

433
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,930
...that I could say no more.

434
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,090
Your Highness.

435
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,870
But you know, if on that day...

436
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,550
...I had not concealed my sincerity
by laughing...

437
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,990
Deceiving yourself and living like that...

438
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,330
...is an awful way of living, isn't it?

439
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,310
...If only I had more courage,
and extended my hand...

440
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,540
...If I had tried just a little harder...

441
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,580
...and asked her to run away with me.

442
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,120
Would that child...

443
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,690
...be by my side?

444
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,280
You haven't gone to bed yet?

445
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,200
Where have you been this late at night?

446
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,190
You got hurt.

447
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,860
How did that happen?

448
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,960
While practicing with my sword,
I cut myself accidentally.

449
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,600
Come here so I can take a look at it.

450
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,020
I said I'm all right.

451
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,730
Only my clothes were cut
and there is no wound.

452
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,910
Where exactly did you go?

453
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,010
I just...

454
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,710
...visited my previous owners' house.

455
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,730
They must have been wonderful people,
for you to visit them after all this time.

456
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,640
Yes.

457
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,860
They were really good people.

458
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,430
They took someone
who was treated like an animal

459
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,500
and gave me warmth
like no other did before.

460
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,030
They gave me a beautiful name, Seol.

461
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,120
That is the kind of person you were,
Milady.

462
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,590
Both of us are aging...

463
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,760
...but in my memory, your sister...

464
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,810
...remains thirteen.

465
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,860
Il Su Bul Toe.

466
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,580
"Once you put down a piece,"

467
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,470
"you cannot ever move
or change its place."

468
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,290
That is what you taught me, right?

469
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,410
A person's heart is the same thing.

470
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,900
Once someone finds a place
in your heart, it won't change.

471
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,470
So regardless of what the results
of the selection might be.

472
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,880
I will never forget the Crown Prince.

473
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,510
Are you a spirit or a person?

474
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,170
You are...

475
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,860
...It is me, Brother.

476
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,810
What are you doing here so late?

477
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,080
I am sorry, Brother.

478
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,480
I was wrong.

479
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,320
Sorry?

480
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,550
For what?

481
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,510
I will help you meet...

482
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,630
...that person you were looking for.

483
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,130
Brother...

484
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,250
...you saved my life,

485
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,530
so I will pay you back, no matter what.

486
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,770
I will do it even if I have to die for it.

487
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,310
I will make sure you meet her.

488
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,740
So don't be in too much pain.

489
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,920
Whose traces
are you expecting to find in me?

490
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,880
Who are you seeing, when you look at me?

491
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,320
Please return to your room.

492
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,680
I am well enough to be alone now.

493
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,300
No, it's all right.

494
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,660
Until you regain your energy,

495
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,950
I will not leave your side.

496
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,030
Thanks to you, Princess,
I am feeling much better.

497
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,900
I will not be sad anymore, so...

498
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:19,970
Mother.

499
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,430
Your Highness is here as well?

500
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:34,150
She was worried I would be lonely, so she
has not left my side since yesterday.

501
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,060
Thank you for being so caring
towards my mother.

502
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,980
We're a married couple,
so there is no need for such words.

503
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,830
Husband, are you going to the palace?

504
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,700
Yes.

505
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,920
I received a royal command last night.

506
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,490
Why are you only telling me now?

507
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,010
If you had told me,
I would have gone with you.

508
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,010
I did not even think of that.

509
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,710
Next time, I will certainly tell you.

510
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,820
I will be going then, Mother.

511
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,050
Beware of not being a nuisance
to His Majesty.

512
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,890
Are you angry because
he's going to the palace alone?

513
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,910
It is not that I am angry.

514
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,080
I feel uneasy.

515
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,410
Uneasy?

516
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,870
What are you uneasy about?

517
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,590
Because if Husband enters the palace...

518
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,070
Teacher!

519
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,300
How long has it been since we last met?

520
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,380
Had I not sought your presence,
how much longer would I have waited?

521
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,140
Your Majesty.

522
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,950
I shall first pay my respects,
so please sit down.

523
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,410
Respects... What respects?

524
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,340
Bring us refreshments.

525
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,680
Also, I will be chatting
with my teacher privately,

526
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,050
so do not let anyone enter
and take your leave.

527
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,830
What do you mean
the Prince Consort has entered the palace?

528
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,760
Is that even proper of him to do so?

529
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,510
He should live his life quietly
and then die.

530
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,030
He has become a Prince Consort,

531
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,340
so how dare he enter the palace
in broad daylight?

532
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,170
That is true.

533
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,770
As the princess' husband, he obviously
cannot participate in politics,

534
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:47,950
but the law states that he may not even
converse about the classics.

535
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,320
It is dangerous.

536
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,100
Because of him I've lost places
in the hearts of many a palace maid.

537
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,890
What do you mean by places?

538
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:02,040
If you had to rank
the most handsome men in the palace,

539
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,330
surely I would come right after Woon,
don't you think?

540
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,950
But if he comes and shakes everything up,

541
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,150
what am I to do?!

542
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,640
Is there even something to be shaken?

543
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:20,170
If this was an expedient by His Majesty
to gather scholars for a political ploy.

544
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:24,760
But Heo Yeom is not the kind of man
who would be able to shake up politics.

545
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,490
Heo Yeom has great symbolic value
for those scholars.

546
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,460
His presence alone could encourage
the scholars to build a united front.

547
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:41,640
He could even muster more influence
than his own father, Director Heo.

548
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,060
Heo Yeom.

549
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,520
Why would a downtrodden man
like him suddenly come to the palace?

550
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,680
What is this?

551
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:02,820
It is the last letter that my sister left.

552
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,370
At first I thought of burying it,
as a long time has passed.

553
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,040
But then I felt that it was my duty
to deliver this letter to whom it belongs.

554
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:15,810
Is this really...

555
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,940
...a letter that Lady Yeon Woo
left for me?

556
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,980
Indeed.

557
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,520
So these are Lady Yeon Woo's...

558
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,410
...final words for me.

559
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,230
While she was alive,

560
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:40,580
Your Majesty was the only one
she ever considered her soulmate.

561
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,340
Should you burn those words
for they belong to a sinner...

562
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,050
...and should you do so yourself.

563
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:55,090
Should you bestow her this honor,
she would find peace in eternal sleep,

564
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,420
and find solace.

565
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,160
So I plead with you...

566
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,560
...to forget my sister once and for all.

567
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,550
Her Majesty the Queen
is now by your side, Sire.

568
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,560
Please do not make the Queen
lonely any longer.

569
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:31,800
If Your Majesty continues living
in the shadow of that child,

570
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,760
I am sure she would never find peace.

571
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,240
My sister and I plead you
with earnest devotion...

572
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,690
...and hope you will accept.

573
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,770
Your Majesty.

574
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,300
All of you...

575
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,470
...keep telling me to forget her.

576
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,540
Your Excellency.

577
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,690
I hope you'll visit the palace
more frequently.

578
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,570
His Majesty might not make it obvious,
but he dearly misses you.

579
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,670
How can a Prince Consort freely roam
these sacred walls?

580
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:37,910
Please, stay by His Majesty's side,
and take good care of him.

581
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,770
It is you, Your Excellency...

582
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,160
...who should have stayed
by His Majesty's side.

583
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,960
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

584
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:39,990
I am writing to you
with the last of my strengths.

585
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,120
My last words might be destroyed...

586
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,870
...or never reach you, for all I know.

587
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,700
But I am still writing to you.

588
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,890
For me,

589
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,970
being able to see Your Highness
before death takes me...

590
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,580
...has filled me with happiness.

591
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,650
So please, stop blaming yourself.

592
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,950
And bury what happened to me
deep in your memories.

593
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,060
My Father shall soon
bring me that infusion.

594
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,430
Drinking it will mean
I might never see you again.

595
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,910
So please, forget about me.

596
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,780
And please be healthy enough
for the both of us.

597
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,060
Become a great king
who looks out for his people.

598
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,340
She was worried about my health.

599
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,850
Up until her very last breath...

600
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,670
...she mustered all the strength
she had left to write me.

601
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,320
But this fool instead...

602
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,730
...this fool...

603
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,250
Your Majesty...

604
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,390
...think of the pain...

605
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,230
...of how lonely she was.

606
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,270
That firm handwriting of hers...

607
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,870
...has become but a trembling jumble.

608
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,040
Hyung Sun.

609
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

610
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,100
Tell the Chief Court Supervisor...

611
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,270
...to bring her belongings.

612
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,420
Yes.

613
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,240
I cannot even remember.

614
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,450
I can't remember what
Yeon Woo's handwriting looked like.

615
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,660
I have to see it.

616
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,680
I have to see again...

617
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,570
...that letter she wrote me.

618
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:35,780
Your wish is my command.

619
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,580
After taking a walk at night,
His Majesty ordered the talisman

620
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,260
not to enter his room.

621
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,060
A walk?

622
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:53,430
They went for a walk together
that late at night?

623
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,940
He's always gone for walks
whenever he wasn't feeling well, so...

624
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,150
Did anything happen after that?

625
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:06,740
Not that I...

626
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,370
...after the Prince Consort visited
this morning,

627
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:14,210
His Majesty seemed very troubled.

628
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,260
He suddenly told a court lady
to bring a box.

629
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,890
-A box?
-Yes.

630
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,160
It looked like an ordinary box,

631
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,870
but the character for rain
was inscribed on the lid.

632
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:34,500
Did you just say rain?

633
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,280
Woon.

634
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,790
Yes, Sire.

635
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,050
Wol.

636
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,980
Bring Wol.

637
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:46,980
Bring Wol here immediately!

638
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,910
Do you...

639
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,040
...recognize me?
