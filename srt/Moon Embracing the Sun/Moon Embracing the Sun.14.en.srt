1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,360
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,060
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,050
Episode 14

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,770
Shaman Wol, although you were cleared
of false charges,

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,140
you have acknowledged using sorcery
to seduce a member of the royal clan.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,820
Therefore, you shall be exiled outside
the capital to the western sick ward,

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
where you shall care
for the sick and the nomads.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,400
In order for you to never use
wicked sorcery again,

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,580
the State Tribunal will watch
your every move.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,210
What do you think?

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,080
Doesn't the tea have a refined scent?

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,820
It does, indeed.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,150
What tea is this?

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,850
Tea made with dried mandarin orange peel.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,020
This tea is not only effective
against colds,

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,140
but also has an intense attribute

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,500
that circulates warmth
throughout the body, I hear.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,300
I have heard that, as well.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,430
Unlike other teas, this tea's effects
are said to become stronger over time.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,110
Doesn't it resemble you, Your Highness?

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,010
So, even though I age,

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,630
my capabilities don't fade.

23
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,110
I know you are just flattering me,
but I admit it's not a bad feeling.

24
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,690
I am not uttering empty words
just to please you.

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,970
Because of your recent efforts...

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,590
...I have been able
to maintain my honor as monarch.

27
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,450
Do you sincerely think that, Your Majesty?

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,870
Yes.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,010
Then, Your Majesty
now owes this grandmother a debt.

30
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,740
Isn't that so?

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,780
Yes.

32
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,560
In the future.

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,530
If there is cause for me
to make a request of Your Majesty...

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,300
...then Your Majesty
must fulfill that request.

35
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,110
Could there be any doubt?

36
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,150
According to the forecast
of the Office of Astronomy,

37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,310
on the first of the month,
there will be a solar eclipse.

38
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,270
This one will be a total eclipse
and will completely obscure the sun.

39
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,410
Thus, we request that you show caution
and take part in an eclipse ceremony.

40
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,410
I have ordered the Office
to prepare the eclipse ceremony.

41
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,160
Traditionally, this sort of phenomenon
of nature has been considered

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,810
an admonition from the heavens
for a grave mistake made by the King.

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,430
Therefore, with modesty, you will need
to denounce your own inadequacies

44
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,490
and restrain your actions with caution.

45
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,840
That is so, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,690
A solar eclipse is considered among
extraordinary natural phenomena.

47
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,330
A vile energy blocks the sun,
while the sun's energy is clouded.

48
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,560
The heavens warned us that your wisdom
and judgment are clouded.

49
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,460
Isn't the mere fact that a crafty shaman
was kept beside him

50
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,790
to be blamed on clouded judgment?

51
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,680
We ask that Your Majesty
humbly accept the Court's counsel.

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,690
Restrain your actions
and continue to do so.

53
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,690
Restrain your actions.

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,360
If a monarch fears nothing,
it shall lead to misgovernment,

55
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,160
and that shall bring forth
calamity and disaster.

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,840
And now that a natural phenomenon
comes to find us,

57
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,500
you must assent
to its proper significance.

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,840
I will give the matter
proper consideration.

59
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,910
Generally, disasters
do not happen for no reason...

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,380
...so this was the result
of my unworthiness.

61
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,350
As such, I shall begin to show
more restraint in my actions.

62
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:27,330
The imprisoned shaman
will be sent out of the province.

63
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,540
However, Prince Yang Myung,
who has sullied the royal family's name,

64
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,720
must be subject
to disciplinary punishment.

65
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,970
His innocence has been established.
Why should he be punished?!

66
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,930
In my opinion,

67
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,740
Prince Yang Myung should be confined
to his home for the time being

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,220
and be cautious in his behavior.

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,770
I believe that is
the proper course of action.

70
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,820
The Ministry of Military Affairs
has already sent over soldiers.

71
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,390
Whose path are you blocking right now?

72
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,220
Do you all truly want to die?!

73
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,360
There is a royal order prohibiting you
from leaving your home.

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,960
Your Majesty,

75
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,080
it's not enough to shackle me
with the title of King's kin

76
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,050
now you must tie up my feet as well?

77
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,650
Did you see His Majesty's face today
at the royal palace?

78
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,040
He was completely subdued like a child
facing a parent with whip in hand.

79
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,000
A phenomenon of nature as cause
for introspection is a long held view,

80
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,880
so how could His Majesty contradict?

81
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,990
However,

82
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,360
knowing full well the implied meaning,
he kept quiet about it.

83
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,390
He must have been churning
with anxiety within.

84
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,290
We must keep pushing forward
with this momentum.

85
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,320
So that he won't throw his weight about
like a wild stallion again.

86
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,810
Why are you smiling so lasciviously?

87
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,290
I dare say a spring breeze
is blowing in my heart.

88
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,300
Spring breeze?

89
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,540
Which gisaeng is it this time?

90
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,790
It's not a gisaeng.

91
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,880
If it's not a gisaeng...

92
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,550
Even smeared and splattered with blood,
how could she be so pretty?

93
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,710
Then, are you talking about
the butcher's daughter?

94
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,480
She's the first girl
that ever spoke defiantly to me.

95
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,520
That haughty
and righteous gleam in her eyes...

96
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,130
I can't forget it.

97
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,230
Isn't there a way I could take her
and keep her at my side?

98
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,290
Your Majesty.

99
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,760
Why have you come to this sordid place?

100
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,760
I came to ask one thing...

101
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,070
...and answer one thing.

102
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,210
Will you answer first?

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,860
Or will you hear my answer first?

104
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,700
Dare I ask Your Majesty
to make your statement first?

105
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,080
I said to you...

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,330
...that until I put my
confusion to rest...

107
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,320
...that until I understand
what it is I feel.

108
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,320
You were not to go far from me.

109
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,610
Do you remember
when I issued such an order?

110
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,160
I remember.

111
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,260
Now.

112
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,640
I want to tell you
that I've found the answer.

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,950
You were correct.

114
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,910
It was not you I was looking at.

115
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,190
I was just seeing...

116
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,090
...that child through you.

117
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,450
Therefore now.

118
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,020
You may go far from me.

119
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,890
I shall follow your order.

120
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,060
Now.

121
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,690
Will you answer?

122
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,900
Please ask your question.

123
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,750
Do you have any final words...

124
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,440
...you'd like to say to me?

125
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,390
I do not have any.

126
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,660
Even if you have words
of bitterness and resentment...

127
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,580
...please say what you like.

128
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,050
Those...

129
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,660
...I do not have, either.

130
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,330
Your Majesty.

131
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,810
She gave me warm words of solace...

132
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,220
...and yet I...

133
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,980
...was unable to leave her
a single word of tenderness.

134
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,140
However, in your own way...

135
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,240
...you have protected her.

136
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,700
I have hurt her so deeply...

137
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,810
...and this...

138
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,130
...can this also...

139
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,670
...be protecting her?

140
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,440
All of this is for me to endure.

141
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,480
I pray...

142
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,620
...I pray you stand firm
in your resolution.

143
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm certain I have seen her somewhere.

144
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm certain.

145
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,970
I have absolutely never practiced
such sorcery.

146
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,180
You bastard!

147
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,140
You must have thought
I was the only one that saw.

148
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,880
You must think it will end
if you just get rid of me.

149
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,820
You're wrong, you bastard.

150
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,340
The heaven's moon was watching you.

151
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,300
That man's blood wasn't the only thing
soaked into your blade that night.

152
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,970
Wait and see, you bastard!

153
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,260
There will be a day when that moonlight
will certainly cut your lifeline!

154
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,490
Why are you acting like that again,
Your Highness?

155
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,520
Do you not hear that strange sound
of a girl crying?

156
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,240
Why do you keep doing this?

157
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,230
Court Lady Park.

158
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,730
Did you just hear something
like the sound of crying?

159
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,330
The sound of crying?

160
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,880
I don't hear anything.

161
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,080
It's Hidden Moon Pavilion.

162
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,090
The sound is certainly coming from there.

163
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,820
The bonds that were severed by people
are being reconnected by the heavens.

164
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,280
After this phenomenon of nature, all
creation will return to its proper place.

165
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,230
And the winds will soon bring blood.

166
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,200
No one...

167
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,070
...will be able to escape it.

168
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,040
As a matter of fact, a man came by...

169
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,630
...asking about the lady.

170
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,490
Oh, dear! Have you been frightened?

171
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,120
Now you will be able to obtain
what you want, Princess.

172
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,700
Princess.

173
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,330
Please wake up.

174
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,320
The Prince Consort...

175
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,460
What about my husband?

176
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,750
Has he been affected by some illness?

177
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,590
That's not the case.

178
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,940
He heard of His Majesty's illness
while traveling

179
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,340
and has suddenly returned.

180
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,560
Where is my husband right now?

181
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,980
After he paid his respects to Madam,
he has gone to his quarters...

182
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,940
What are you doing? You must not.

183
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,670
The Prince Consort
is a dignified gentleman.

184
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,360
Please maintain your dignity...

185
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,910
Oh, my goodness!

186
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,870
Pri... Princess.

187
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,240
You came...

188
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,850
You came back so soon...

189
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,630
Why did you not come and let me see you?

190
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,200
I was going to come and see you
after I had washed.

191
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,240
I missed you very much.

192
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,560
I missed you so very much.

193
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,200
Did you say the sound of crying?

194
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,840
That's right.

195
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,120
Crying, which has been heard
from the closed Hidden Moon Pavilion.

196
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,770
It may be due
to the eclipse coming in a few days.

197
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,780
The eclipse that's been
forecasted for a long time now.

198
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,250
How is that connected
to the strange rumors?

199
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,160
In an eclipse,

200
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,140
the yang energy of the sun is veiled
by the yin energy of the moon.

201
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,030
Thus, the weak-minded begin to feel
a sense of uneasiness.

202
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,110
Is that so?

203
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,340
Has Your Highness
heard the sound of crying, too?

204
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,500
What a ridiculous thing to say!

205
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Am I such a weak-minded person?!

206
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,740
For... forgive me, Your Highness.

207
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,980
Using this strange story as an excuse...

208
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,590
...people are tittering about,
saying things they should dare not.

209
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,090
That must be corrected.

210
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,260
What else could be my intent?

211
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,970
Then, you must make a plan
with the Seongsucheong's High Shaman...

212
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,820
That cannot happen!

213
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,740
Excuse me?

214
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,630
Wh... why...

215
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,740
If the Office of Astronomy
and the Seongsucheong both step in...

216
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,080
...the strange story gains power.

217
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,820
Therefore,

218
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,850
the Hidden Moon Pavilion situation
must be addressed by the Office...

219
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,920
No.

220
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,690
It must be addressed by you...

221
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,100
...alone, in secret.

222
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,320
If... if you insist.

223
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,580
What if we perform a comforting ritual
during the eclipse ceremony?

224
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,350
A comforting ritual?

225
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,700
Then, would the sound of
the crying girl go away?

226
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,600
As the term implies, the ritual
is for comforting the spirit of the dead.

227
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:19,160
The result depends on whether the spirit
is readily comforted or not.

228
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,400
Isn't that
the Seongsucheong's competency?!

229
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,230
Is there no other way?

230
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,890
We... well...

231
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,460
...there is one last resort.

232
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,310
What is that?

233
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,580
Th... Th... that...

234
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,260
Ay, you sure are being a stickler.

235
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,170
You could just look away this once.

236
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,190
Ahjussi, I'm begging.

237
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,980
Just let us see our unni this once.

238
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,640
Seriously. I'm telling you
it's impossible, it's not up to us.

239
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,510
Nothing is impossible!

240
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,100
Seol.

241
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,820
Really, I shouldn't do this.

242
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,510
All right, then just one of you
and make it quick.

243
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,570
Seol, you take Jan Shil
back to the Seongsucheong.

244
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,480
I don't want to. I'm going in.

245
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,880
Go on. Do you not hear me?!

246
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,660
Child.

247
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,100
How do you feel?

248
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,880
Is it bearable?

249
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,130
I'm sorry to have worried you.

250
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,670
Seol and Jan Shil are also very worried
because of me, aren't they?

251
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,360
Who are you worrying about at this moment?

252
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,690
Mistress, are you crying?

253
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,240
A long time ago...

254
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,950
...I had a very close friend.

255
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,540
She was a pitiable and honest friend.

256
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,380
The last time I saw her...

257
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,000
...was right here.

258
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,930
And that friend's last request to me...

259
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,190
...was to take care of you.

260
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,680
To protect you in her place.

261
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,850
To protect you no matter what happened.

262
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,970
She asked me in utmost earnest.

263
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,830
Was she perhaps my mother?

264
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,440
But, I was shortsighted.

265
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,630
I was trying to protect you.

266
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,640
But rather, I put you in more danger.

267
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,090
Mistress, you have always protected me.

268
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,610
You accepted me,
abandoned by my own parents,

269
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,750
raised me, and protected me up to now.

270
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,890
Do you remember?

271
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,140
When I said I didn't want to be a shaman
and was going to kill myself,

272
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,740
that time I made such a ruckus?

273
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,340
It was then that you said to me...

274
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,340
...that if the gods chose me...

275
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,080
...there must be a reason why.

276
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,220
And, whether I felt pain or misery...

277
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,890
...they have given me
the ability to bear it.

278
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,360
Ever since then I've believed this,
that there is no pain without meaning.

279
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,980
The pain I'm feeling right now...

280
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,030
...must have been
brought upon me for a reason.

281
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,480
Mistress.

282
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,250
I knew that wench
would get into some big trouble.

283
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,700
She has some nerve.

284
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,810
How could she have set her sights
on His Majesty's kin?

285
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,090
Still, thanks to that grand family,
she managed to avoid death.

286
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,770
Death would have been better.

287
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,960
Wearing immorality on her chest,
she was exiled to the sick ward.

288
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,040
Could that really be considered living?

289
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,600
Hey!

290
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,750
Say one more word. Just one more.

291
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,600
I am ready to wreak proper havoc today!

292
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,950
Milady, you will be confronted
with yet another heartbreak.

293
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,950
Why are you acting this way, Mistress?

294
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,390
What do you mean "Milady"?

295
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,100
What is it you need to protect
and what is it you need to cast aside?

296
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,000
The only one who knows the answer to that
is you, Milady.

297
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,340
So do not look for answers externally.

298
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,270
Rather, you must find the answers
within yourself.

299
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,090
What are you saying?

300
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,920
Can you explain?

301
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,130
Whatever truth you come
face to face with...

302
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,230
...please keep one thing in mind.

303
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,900
You are stronger than anyone.

304
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,510
Your wisdom will lead you
to the right decision.

305
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,750
The strength of your will shall prevail.

306
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,620
Mistress.

307
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,270
Therefore, just have faith in yourself...

308
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,870
...and follow your instincts.

309
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:51,340
And also, ultimately,
you must not forgive me.

310
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Are you really going
to just leave her like that?

311
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm asking you if you're going
to just give up and leave her!

312
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,110
Lower your voice.

313
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,760
Why should I?

314
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,400
I've trusted you
and did as you directed up to now.

315
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,360
You've told me to keep quiet
to save her life, so I did!

316
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,700
Every time the poor miss
asked about her past,

317
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,730
I lied as naturally as if I were eating.

318
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,870
But, what is this?

319
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,220
The sick ward?!

320
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,800
It's not enough she had to act
as a human talisman,

321
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,850
now she has to go to the lowest
of the low places, the sick ward!

322
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,660
I can't even stay by her side
and protect her anymore!

323
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,940
It is her destiny.

324
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,050
What?

325
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,430
Is it right for you to speak of it
so lightly, as if it didn't matter?!

326
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,970
Even if there is darkness all around...

327
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,080
...if a moon emerges from the darkness,
there is no way to block its light.

328
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,440
Until it can emerge and shine its light
on its own, all we can do is wait.

329
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,600
What does that mean?

330
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,870
Speak in a way I can understand!

331
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:23,060
The truth will be revealed soon.

332
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,950
So, all we can do is await her response.

333
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,180
Everything is in her hands now.

334
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,340
In half an hour,
they are taking her to the sick ward.

335
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,870
Your Majesty.

336
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,370
Why do you call me?

337
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,600
I shall make a snowman.

338
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,550
However, this will be the last time.

339
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,160
When spring comes,
the snow will melt away.

340
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:36,500
But, right now I shall gather only clean,
white snow that has not been tread upon...

341
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:43,420
...and make for you one last snowman.

342
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,890
Tell me right now!

343
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,450
Why did you send away that girl
without my permission?!

344
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,910
I didn't think it was something that
Your Majesty should be subjected to hear.

345
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,200
Shall I call her here myself
and ask her directly?

346
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,350
That...

347
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,420
...His Majesty,
in the middle of the night last night,

348
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,490
said he was taking a walk
and left his bed chambers.

349
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,350
He ordered all to stay

350
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,980
and asked only Swordsman Woon
to accompany him...

351
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
He asked Swordsman Woon to follow him and?

352
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,940
He headed for the Tribunal prison.

353
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,460
He was probably just
going to confirm the prisoners.

354
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,410
So, please do not get angry...

355
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,040
The girl should not have been
allowed to live.

356
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,030
She should not have been allowed to live.

357
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,150
The ph... physician...

358
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,690
Call the physician! Quickly!

359
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,830
The physician!

360
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,510
Where are you hurrying to?

361
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,010
That is...

362
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,890
The Queen...

363
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,880
The Queen...

364
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,840
I told you not to let anyone in!

365
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,400
Give it to me.

366
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,070
Is it only your love that is agonizing?

367
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,480
Is my love insignificant?

368
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,740
Your Majesty was my first love.

369
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,350
Your Majesty knows better than anyone

370
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,530
how it feels to lose someone you love.

371
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,780
So, how can you be so cruel?

372
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,520
A beggar could not be
more wretched than me!

373
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,060
It is too cruel and sad, is it not?

374
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,920
For myself, the Queen,

375
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,840
Hyungnim,

376
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,610
and that child.

377
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,220
Yeon Woo.

378
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,100
Madam. Madam!

379
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,510
Madam, why are you doing this?
Madam, Madam!

380
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,400
-Yeon Woo!
-Please, Madam.

381
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,120
Please move out of the way.

382
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,450
Yeon Woo.

383
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,600
Aigoo. Aigoo. Just a moment, please.

384
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,450
-Oh Madam, please.
-Please move. Please.

385
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,830
Yeon Woo!

386
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,280
Please watch out! Move out of the way!

387
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,420
Oh, Madam! Madam!

388
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,510
Madam.

389
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,890
Please move away.

390
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,770
Madam, Madam.

391
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,980
From here on, follow those people.

392
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,240
Was I not to go to the sick ward?

393
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,190
Take her.

394
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,850
Just a moment.

395
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,820
What?!

396
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,200
Where are you going to take me?

397
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,610
You'll know when we get there.

398
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,740
Are you going to break strict royal law?

399
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,400
I'm abiding by a law
more frightening than royal law.

400
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,430
Follow me!

401
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,520
Did you just say
the prisoner disappeared on the way?

402
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,760
I went to the sick ward as you ordered,

403
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,110
-and that is what I heard.
-Where?

404
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,500
Which direction did they say she went?

405
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:18,230
Well, they must have taken side roads
because people were heckling her so much.

406
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,740
It is presumed that
they then ran into a band of burglars.

407
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,110
My Lord! My Lord!

408
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,810
What are you doing here?

409
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,360
Where are you planning to go?

410
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,360
I have asked why you are here.

411
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,580
Shouldn't you remain cautious still?

412
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,050
Please go back inside.

413
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,140
Have you come as a friend?

414
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,330
Or have you come by royal order?

415
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,050
These days...

416
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,710
...I often hear the crying of this sword.

417
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,720
It may feel stifled
as it wasn't unsheathed for long.

418
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,880
It cries so sorrowfully.

419
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,120
So, I fear I may swing
this sword recklessly and make a mistake.

420
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,590
My skills are not what they once were.

421
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,320
My Lord. If you cross swords with me,

422
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,730
my forgotten swordsmanship
may return to me.

423
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,630
Will you accept?

424
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,250
You are Swordsman Woon
who protects His Majesty.

425
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,530
I suppose you cannot swing your sword
at will without a royal order.

426
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,690
A false wicked act can be more dangerous
than a false virtuous one.

427
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,190
What are you going to do?

428
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,460
Are you going to wait for a royal order?

429
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,940
A sword held out of anger is dangerous.

430
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,660
A sword held out of love
is even more dangerous.

431
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,120
Who is that anger directed at?

432
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,920
If I knew that...

433
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,710
...I probably would not have even
leapt at you like a mad man.

434
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,420
Why can you not consider
what His Majesty is feeling?

435
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,910
Then, why can you not consider...

436
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,810
...what your friend is feeling?

437
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,100
Are you going to report it?

438
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,000
Report what?

439
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,570
Since I brandished a sword at Woon
who came on a royal order...

440
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,060
...I suppose it's tantamount to treason.

441
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,100
Here today...

442
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,750
...neither Swordsman Woon
nor His Majesty's kin stood in this spot.

443
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,520
It was just two long-time friends
that were here.

444
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,300
This is the palace, is it not?

445
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,590
We use a receptacle for the soul.

446
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,090
A receptacle for the soul?

447
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,290
Yes.

448
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,470
Just as the term implies, one receives
the soul with one's entire body.

449
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,760
But it is only possible with one
whose body can take in the gods, a shaman.

450
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,170
A spirit, a soul is taken in by a human?

451
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,290
It is a sort of sacrificial offering.

452
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,950
The person is locked in with the soul
at the place where a grudge is held,

453
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,550
and takes in that grudge into her body.

454
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,390
Is that really possible?

455
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,330
It is.

456
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,680
On top of that,
there will be a total eclipse.

457
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,510
At the point when the moon veils the sun
and the yin energy is strong,

458
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,880
if we bring in a receptacle for the soul
as a sacrificial offering,

459
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,460
the effect will be doubled.

460
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,370
Then, will the sound of crying vanish
from Hidden Moon Pavilion?

461
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,130
It will.

462
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
However...

463
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,510
However?

464
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,450
If a shaman
becomes a receptacle for the soul,

465
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,710
her own soul may be driven out
in order to receive a strange soul,

466
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,550
and grave danger may follow.

467
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,730
Danger?

468
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,230
Could she die?

469
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,670
If the soul's grudge is strong,

470
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:55,010
I have heard eight or nine times
out of ten, the soul embeds itself,

471
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,260
and the shaman either faints
or loses her life.

472
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,380
So, there will likely be no shaman
willing to be the sacrificial offering.

473
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,450
How timely.

474
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,190
A girl that is perfect for this job...

475
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,090
...comes to mind.

476
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,760
You probably know,
that this is a closed building.

477
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,220
There is no use in screaming,

478
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,040
so don't waste your energy
and just quietly carry out your duty.

479
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,610
I will return tomorrow.

480
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,390
Have you taken her there?

481
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,810
Yes, Your Highness.

482
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,840
Did you explain in a way
she could understand?

483
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,780
I told her it was her duty
to comfort the soul at the Pavilion,

484
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,020
so that is what she thinks.

485
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,980
This must never get out.

486
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,470
Particularly, the King must never know.

487
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,530
Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,220
I knew I'd be using her someday
in a big way,

489
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,110
but I didn't know
I'd be using her like this.

490
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,720
If her life is spared, take her
to the sick ward for the time-being.

491
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,590
There will be another need
to use her later.

492
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,210
I will carry out your order.

493
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,610
Even now, at night,

494
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,230
from the Hidden Moon Pavilion
that was used by the Crown Princess,

495
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,270
they say you can hear
the crying of a ghost.

496
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,660
Is that the crying
of the late Maiden Heo?

497
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,420
Why? What would she be so upset about?

498
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,920
Anyhow, after a healthy Crown Princess
died suddenly,

499
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,470
some people conjectured whether
it could have been poisoning or murder.

500
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,780
Inside the palace,
it was a hot topic for a while.

501
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,620
The soul I am to comfort...

502
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,030
...is none other than the girl
so dear to His Majesty?

503
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,990
As you all know,

504
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,240
in the courtyard of the Throne Hall today,
there will be an eclipse ceremony.

505
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,920
Therefore, security must be
taken more sternly than ever.

506
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,630
If you notice anything suspicious,
immediately...

507
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,830
Where is Hong Gyu Tae?

508
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,700
Ah, really!

509
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,490
Where has that
no-good Hong Gyu Tae gone now?

510
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,200
Hey.

511
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,770
Hey.

512
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,710
Hong Gyu Tae.

513
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,890
You derelict.

514
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,320
What are you doing?

515
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:27,930
You derelict.

516
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,110
Have you finally gone mad?

517
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,230
Is that it?

518
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,690
Hyungnim.

519
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,250
Is there a situation where one dies,

520
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,390
but one's temperature doesn't drop?

521
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,080
What?

522
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,560
If you hold a dead person for a long time,

523
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,610
can his temperature be maintained
like a living person?

524
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,500
How can a dead person have
the same temperature as a living person?

525
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,360
That's why I'm asking!

526
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,920
Hypothetically, what if
there were such a situation?

527
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,140
If there were such a situation...

528
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,670
...the person's not dead, yet.

529
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,400
Not dead, yet?

530
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,660
According to the physician that frequented
the late Director Heo's home,

531
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,620
he could not fathom the exact illness,

532
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,400
but that the patient complained
of breathing difficulties and chest pains.

533
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,180
In the Royal Secretariat's records
as well,

534
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,060
it is only referred to
as an unknown illness.

535
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,230
What about the possibility
that she was murdered?

536
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,220
According to the physician,
there were no traces of poison or assault.

537
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,190
No possibility of murder.

538
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,960
Were there any other
particular peculiarity?

539
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,360
Well...

540
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,220
...the fact that
after she had ceased to breathe

541
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,250
the body was warm for over two hours
is extremely peculiar.

542
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,530
The physician at that time was certain
that her pulse was gone.

543
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,760
There was no trace of murder,

544
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,910
but maintained her body temperature.

545
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:02,880
After I probe further into that detail,
I shall report to you.

546
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,000
Your Majesty, it is me, Hyung Sun.

547
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,920
Come in.

548
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,180
Your Majesty,
the eclipse ceremony will begin soon.

549
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,800
So you must hurry
and get properly dressed.

550
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,750
I understand.

551
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,530
You may leave.

552
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,560
Investigate in detail the actions
of those around the late Chief Scholar,

553
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,060
including the actions of each party
inside the palace, and report.

554
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,640
I will carry out your command.

555
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,360
You've come?

556
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,650
Your Majesty,
the professor of astronomy is here.

557
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,930
Are the preparations complete?

558
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,360
Yes.

559
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,910
As the ceremony begins in half an hour,

560
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,310
please come out
to the palace courtyard in 15 minutes.

561
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,230
I shall do so.

562
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,740
What was it that caused you to cry so?

563
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,750
Were you crying because
you longed for His Majesty?

564
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,560
Is there a message...

565
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,380
...you want to relay to His Majesty?

566
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,550
Please tell me.

567
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,090
I shall listen.

568
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,000
I shall cry...

569
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,640
...together with you.

570
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,220
So, whatever the situation is,

571
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,230
please tell me.

572
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:43,030
The sun shall wane.

573
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:46,060
We supplicate...

574
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,480
We pray thee...

575
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:52,290
Merge together, show your will.

576
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,700
The sun shall wane.

577
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,380
We kneel.

578
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,670
The sun shall wane.

579
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,740
We kneel.

580
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:11,210
We pray thee...

581
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,320
Merge together, show your will.

582
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,800
At the sound of the pounding
on the door to the next world...

583
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,530
...the sun and moon shall meet...

584
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,650
...and the bonds severed by people,

585
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,440
will be reconnected by the heavens.

586
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,960
So, after this phenomenon
of the heavens happens,

587
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,000
may all of creation
return to its rightful place.

588
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,420
An illness of an unknown source.

589
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,070
A killing that leaves no trace.

590
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,910
A spell.

591
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,840
The lady...

592
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,200
...has a divination illness from the gods.

593
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,010
Mistress.

594
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,080
Yeon Woo, please get up.

595
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:20,230
It's time to take your medicine.

596
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,770
Yeon Woo?

597
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,110
Yeon Woo!

598
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,410
Yeon Woo, my child! Yeon Woo.

599
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,270
Father.

600
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,250
Mother.

601
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,430
Mother.

602
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,270
Have you...

603
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,100
...ever met me before?

604
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:37,340
Do you really not know me?

605
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,250
You're cutting off
all memories and bonds from the past?

606
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,380
Do you recognize me?

607
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,320
In your previous life, am I...

608
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,310
...Am I not there?

609
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,130
It doesn't matter.

610
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,910
As long as I recognize you, that's enough.

611
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,570
Then, could you relay this to that girl?

612
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,800
That I truly, very much...

613
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,910
...loved her.

614
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:12,870
Sorcery.

615
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,260
If it was black sorcery,
then anything is possible.

616
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:40,970
At long last, she has figured it out.

617
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,530
I suppose another hurting will begin now.

618
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,210
I pray you watch over them.

619
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,240
Hyung Sun.

620
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

621
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,950
Secretly summon the High Shaman
of the Seongsucheong at once.

622
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,610
Excuse me? Why the High Shaman?

623
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,560
What are you doing?
Did I not tell you to summon her at once?!

624
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,020
Yes, I shall carry out your command.

625
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,950
Could it be possible
to kill someone with sorcery?

626
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,290
The High Shaman Jang,

627
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:33,640
whose divine powers
are unmatched in all of Joseon,

628
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,250
can certainly give me the answer.

629
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,850
We shall determine
if she is dead or alive,

630
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,620
and if she is no longer breathing,

631
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,470
then you will have to take her out
the refuse door without anyone knowing.

632
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:58,830
Do you understand?

633
01:01:58,930 --> 01:01:59,820
Yes, sir.

634
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,150
Go check to see if she is dead or alive.

635
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,790
R... r... right.

636
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,090
Did you comfort the soul?

637
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:05,390
Yes.

638
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:13,220
That maiden...

639
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,320
...shall never cry again.

640
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:03,620
Is that true?

641
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,720
Tempted, you said?

642
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,270
And so you want to cast off
those feelings.

643
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,360
Tempted.

644
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,090
However, I cannot cast off
those feelings.

645
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:18,790
That I really, truly loved her.

646
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,240
Because I like you.

647
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,590
It's because I like you.

648
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:27,210
The person I'm looking at
is none other than you.

649
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,290
I can't be that person
in your memories, can I?

650
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,330
I'll never be that person.

651
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:36,940
Who gave you permission to leave?

652
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,970
Who said you had fulfilled your calling?

653
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,860
Until I understand whether it's you,
that girl or whatever I'm feeling.

654
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:46,710
Don't you dare...
