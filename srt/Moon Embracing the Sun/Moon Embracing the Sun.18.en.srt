1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,300
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,030
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,240
Episode 18

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,110
Isn't lying like this
next to each other nice?

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,380
Yes, it is.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,950
Chief Attendant.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,920
Don't you think this is going too far?

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,820
Excuse me, but what is it
that you are speaking of?

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,880
You don't think that I would possibly,

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,430
that I would possibly.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,660
And before marriage at that.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,150
Do you not trust me?

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,080
While I trust
in Your Majesty's sincere intention,

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,860
it is the male instinct
so hidden deep within you for so long,

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,470
that I cannot trust.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,980
But, how can I possibly fall
asleep in this situation?

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,640
Then, will you make a promise?

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,960
A promise?

19
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,250
What sort of promise?

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,480
That under no circumstance,

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,750
none at all, absolutely none,

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,110
will you bow down to your instincts
and lay even a finger on the lady...

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,910
You are absolutely out of line!

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,070
Chief Attendant.

25
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,090
When I think of my eight years of sorrow
while unable to see His Majesty,

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,220
I feel that even seeing him
every day and night would not be enough.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,500
Please allow me, at least in the darkness,

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,110
to look upon his face
to my heart's content.

29
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,890
This subject shall do as you wish,

30
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,110
so fill your heart and look upon him
to your heart's content.

31
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,580
He obeys you more than the King
he's tended for over 20 years.

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,190
Even if it is just purely out of spite
towards my attendant,

33
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,150
I shall not lay a finger on you,
so do not worry.

34
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,630
Do you mean that?

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,280
Certainly.

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,850
A man's word is his bond.

37
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,070
I absolutely...

38
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,090
As I have dared to lay a hand
on your royal body...

39
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,530
...will you send me out?

40
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,150
Surely not.

41
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,970
Will you punish me?

42
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,700
I couldn't possibly.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,870
Your Majesty has not laid a finger on me.

44
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,430
What do you mean our court lady
in the King's chamber is missing?

45
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,850
Whether it's because His Majesty
suspected her or for some other reason,

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,910
they say she had long been transferred
to another building.

47
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,350
But, though I tried to find her,
I couldn't find her anywhere.

48
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,280
That's not all.

49
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,350
Aside from attendants who served the King
since before he was crowned.

50
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,450
He has recently replaced
all of the court ladies in his chamber.

51
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,950
All the court ladies attending
to his chamber?

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,310
Yes, Your Highness. That is what I heard.

53
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,120
It's certain then...

54
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,060
...that he's hiding something
in his quarters.

55
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,180
Excuse me?

56
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,480
What could His Majesty
be hiding in his quarters?

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,230
Princess, you must not run like that.

58
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,540
I'm sorry, Mother.

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,270
I was in such a hurry to share
this joyous news with the Queen Mother.

60
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,090
My heart is as filled with joy as yours,

61
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,650
but you must be very cautious right now.

62
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,020
Didn't the physician
also say that as well?

63
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,840
Yes, Mother.

64
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,030
From now on,

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,470
I shall be cautious, ever so cautious.

66
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,560
Have you been well, Princess?

67
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,640
Yes.

68
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,630
But... who are you?

69
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,800
I am Captain Hong Gyu Tae.

70
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,980
Really?

71
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,500
You appear well suited for your duty,
gallant and brave.

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Please always serve His Majesty
with devotion.

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,890
Yes, I shall heed your words.

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,940
So, did you look into the matter
I asked you to look into?

75
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,920
Yes.

76
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,590
I located the previous attendants
with some difficulty.

77
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,850
However, there wasn't anything
in particular that seemed notable.

78
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,950
-All right.
-However...

79
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,250
However, what?

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,560
...before the late King halted
the investigation,

81
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,940
they said the King
visited Sukyeongjae several times.

82
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,810
Sukyeongjae.

83
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,800
Sukyeongjae was
Princess Min Hwa's quarters.

84
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,310
Yes.

85
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,720
Because the late King
treasured Princess Min Hwa so dearly,

86
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,530
it seems like something
that can be disregarded,

87
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,500
but something about it bothers me
for some reason.

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
What is it that bothers you?

89
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,110
After the late King
visited Sukyeongjae several times,

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,980
he made the current Queen
the Crown Princess,

91
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,400
without calling
for another selection process.

92
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,570
That fact just seems rather...

93
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,810
...that's not all.

94
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,550
I thought you might ask,

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,410
so I secretly spoke with one of
the Princess's court ladies at the time,

96
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,390
and she said the Queen Mother,

97
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,410
at the time often came by Sukyeongjae.

98
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,360
The Queen Dowager?

99
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,320
Yes.

100
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,380
And I looked into the sorcery question
you ordered me to research last time.

101
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,000
There's no need.

102
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,050
I've already looked into it through
the High Shaman of the Seongsucheong.

103
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,970
Ah, you have? Then...

104
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,350
Actually, no.

105
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,990
Since you've already done
the investigation, go ahead and report.

106
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,470
It's nothing much.

107
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,540
Normally in sorcery, a straw effigy
is used when placing a curse,

108
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,790
but occasionally,
a person plays the role of the effigy.

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,400
A person?

110
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,460
As the effigy?

111
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

112
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,940
If someone with a strong desire
or obsession is used as an offering,

113
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,540
they say the power of the curse
more than doubles.

114
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,620
What on earth are you trying to hide?

115
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,680
I suppose I am hiding
what Your Majesty is trying to find.

116
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,860
This is all for your sake, Your Majesty.

117
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,680
To be more specific,

118
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,580
it is to protect Your Majesty
and everyone you hold dear.

119
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,600
When the late King
closed and covered up that case,

120
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,130
it was because
there was sufficient reason to.

121
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,810
Before the late King
halted the investigation,

122
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,300
they said the King
visited Sukyeongjae several times.

123
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,620
When the late King covered up the truth,

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,070
wouldn't there have been
sufficient reason to?

125
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,540
Your Majesty.

126
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,550
...and she said
the Queen Mother at the time

127
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,960
also came by the Sukyeongjae often.

128
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,050
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,220
That's enough.

130
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,950
You may leave.

131
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,790
Yes.

132
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,350
Why? Why would Princess Min Hwa...

133
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,620
...why on earth?

134
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,320
Did you say pregnant?

135
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,040
Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,930
We were just with the physician
who confirmed the Princess's pregnancy.

137
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,360
What a joyous time.

138
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,820
The royal family has had
its fill of depressing events lately.

139
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,570
This is truly joyful, blessed news,
is it not?

140
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,470
She has been melancholic lately,
so I was worried.

141
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,560
But that must have all been
the signs of pregnancy.

142
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,210
Well done, Princess. Very well done.

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,530
But Mother.

144
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,810
Could I perhaps leave the palace earlier?

145
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,920
Why do you ask? Are you not feeling well?

146
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,790
No, it's not that.

147
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,810
I just want to relay this happy news
to my husband as soon as possible.

148
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,360
The Queen Mother will be hurt.

149
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,470
You haven't come to the palace in a while.

150
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,380
Why don't you stay with Her Highness
a little longer, and...

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,970
No, it's fine.

152
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,930
After all, they say a married daughter
is basically a stranger.

153
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,270
Why don't we let the Princess leave,

154
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,270
and you and I can talk
for a little longer.

155
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,840
Please do so, Mother.

156
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,500
Then, I'll be going.

157
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,460
Even if you are in a hurry,
do not forget to greet His Majesty.

158
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,950
Yes, I shall go now.

159
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,920
Crown Prince, I am sorry.

160
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,010
What are you sorry for?

161
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,900
Because of my inadequacies,

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,280
I could not protect that child.

163
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,750
But as you are an intelligent
and clever person,

164
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,790
someday you will understand the meaning
of my words today.

165
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,900
I pray you remember
what I am about to say to you.

166
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,020
Please go ahead and speak.

167
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,830
Please forgive the people
your father has tried to protect...

168
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,880
...and protect them.

169
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,950
Excuse me?

170
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,650
If you absolutely cannot,

171
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,920
then above all,
do not forgive your father.

172
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,890
Forgive me,

173
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,570
but I cannot understand the meaning
of Your Majesty's words.

174
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,680
Crown Prince, the position of King...

175
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,040
...is said to be a lonely one.

176
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,550
In every place in the world lies an enemy,
and anyone can become one.

177
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,280
There are times when you are forced
to align with your enemy.

178
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,990
And sometimes, that enemy...

179
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,590
...can be of your same bloodline.

180
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,800
I plead in earnest...

181
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,080
...that you forgive them...

182
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,480
...even if from your same bloodline.

183
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,720
Who is it that I am to forgive
and protect?

184
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,040
Min Hwa, you...

185
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,510
Brother, I hate you. I hate you!

186
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,330
Why on earth are you acting this way?

187
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,510
You disparaged me. In front of him, even!

188
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,470
I hate you!

189
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,860
What he said is all wrong!

190
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,480
I'm not a spoiled child.
I'm a virtuous lady!

191
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,950
I've even learned almost all
of the 1000 elementary Chinese characters!

192
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Your Majesty.

193
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,940
Your Majesty.

194
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,370
Did you know?

195
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,060
And so...

196
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,630
...is that why you didn't tell me
that you've regained your memory?

197
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,060
Stop this behaviour immediately!

198
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,180
Please rescind your decision
to make Heo Yeom Prince Consort.

199
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,990
Did you not hear me tell you
to stand up on once?!

200
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,780
Blocking a man of talent like Heo Yeom
from government office,

201
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,870
is no different
than sentencing him to death.

202
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,420
How can you compare becoming a member
of the Royal Family with death?!

203
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,520
How can you say it is death
only if you have lost the breath of life?

204
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,660
What?

205
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,100
I shall marry the Personnel Minister's
daughter as instructed.

206
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,550
So please at least rescind your decision
to make Heo Yeom Prince Consort.

207
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,560
You are dismissed.

208
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,750
Before you rescind your decision,
I shall not leave.

209
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,050
Must you suffer the humiliation
of being dragged out by palace guards

210
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,620
before you comprehend my words?

211
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,270
Your Majesty.

212
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,830
Crown Prince, you will follow me!

213
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,650
You fool. Do you know what you just did?

214
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,410
I have only tried to protect Tutor Heo.

215
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,640
Protect?

216
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,380
How many people do you think
will suffer because of your actions today?

217
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,860
By calling attention to the situation
in front of the court officials,

218
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,500
you've made Heo Yeom and his father
their political targets.

219
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,730
That makes two.

220
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,610
By casting suspicion on the Royal Family,
you yourself are included!

221
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,150
That makes three.

222
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,390
The attendants and staff in your quarters
who will suffer censure because of you!

223
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,050
The people of Joseon who will have
to suffer hardship under you!

224
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,050
If you add it all together, that total...

225
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,170
...is more than you can account for
in all of the Joseon world.

226
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,220
You can't even govern
your own emotions...

227
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,200
...who exactly do you
think you can protect?!

228
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,700
Then, are you saying I should
just sit by and witness?

229
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,460
Don't do anything. Don't change anything.

230
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,530
Don't protect anyone!

231
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,940
But just follow someone else's vision,
with no control over it!

232
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,210
Are you saying that is how I should live?

233
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,040
Is that...

234
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,490
...what a King should be?

235
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,960
The more you try to protect them,
the more they will get hurt.

236
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,510
The more you try to obtain the things
you want, the more you will lose.

237
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,110
That is the fate, of the throne upon
which you will sit in the future.

238
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,640
If you must protect someone,
do not let it be discovered.

239
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,950
If you want to obtain something,
abandon another.

240
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,100
You must lose in order to gain,
and you must abandon in order to obtain.

241
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,160
That is politics.

242
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,810
So then, what is it that
Your Majesty has obtained?

243
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,180
What is it that you've gained
and what is it that you've lost?

244
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,790
I lost a faithful subject,
but obtained his safety.

245
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,480
I lost Yang Myung, but I protected you.

246
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,260
I lost the Crown Princess, but I
protected your sister, Min Hwa.

247
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,740
I will not rule that way.

248
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,740
If something is right,

249
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,020
even if I must stake everything,
I will protect it.

250
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,670
If something is wrong,

251
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,920
even if I were to gain everything from it,
I will abandon it.

252
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,230
In my Joseon, that is the way it will be.

253
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
Have you forgotten the pledge
you made that day?

254
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,380
All things in their rightful place.

255
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,900
Have you forgotten that was
what your government was going to be?

256
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,580
Enabling all things and all people
to take their rightful place!

257
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,640
Returning positions held
by those who have no right,

258
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,490
to those that have the right!

259
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,870
As the future monarch,

260
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,930
that is the path you said you must take.
Have you forgotten already?!

261
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,320
Did he tell you where he was going?

262
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,070
No, I do not know.

263
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,880
Your Majesty!

264
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,970
Have you been well?

265
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,250
I'm certain Queen Mother
said you were well,

266
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,060
but why is your face so taut?

267
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,210
Min Hwa.

268
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,490
Yes, Your Majesty?

269
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,360
Did you want Tutor Heo that much?

270
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,960
Excuse me?

271
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,690
So much so that you would do
something so cruel?

272
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,880
So cruel?

273
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,650
What is it you are speaking of?

274
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,810
Tutor Heo's sister!

275
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,880
Excuse me?

276
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,940
I don't understand...

277
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,530
What are you...

278
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,230
Why?

279
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,240
Why did you do that?

280
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,100
Why did you take part in the curse
on the Crown Princess?

281
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,350
Why?!

282
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,120
Please keep this
a secret from my husband, at least.

283
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,580
It is all right if you punish me,

284
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,510
but, my husband...

285
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,550
...please.

286
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,640
Please.

287
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,650
Lift...

288
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,730
...your head.

289
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,590
Lift your head!

290
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,320
Do you...

291
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,920
Do you even realize what it is you did?

292
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,060
With that same look in his eyes...

293
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,470
...in that same voice...

294
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,030
...he said the same words.

295
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,880
The late King said those same words to me.

296
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,980
Please save me, Your Majesty!

297
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,660
Do you even realize what it is you did?

298
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,340
I didn't know!

299
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,430
I had no idea!

300
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,550
The Queen Mother said
that all I had to do was sit there.

301
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,900
She said that if I did that,
I could be married to Tutor Heo.

302
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,050
I didn't know that Yeon Woo
would really die.

303
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,180
Listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say.

304
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,090
No one can know about this.

305
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,180
Until the day you die,
you will have to keep your mouth shut.

306
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,560
Do you understand what I'm saying?

307
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,080
I could only say back then
that I didn't know!

308
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,210
Because, I truly didn't know.

309
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:15,090
It was later,
as I sat in the home she had departed...

310
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,350
...as I watched my husband shed tears
in utter anguish...

311
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,060
It was only then...

312
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,220
...that I realized what it is
that I had done.

313
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,470
The late King committed
an even greater crime.

314
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,480
He committed an unforgivable crime
against Director Heo!

315
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,090
And against me!

316
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,740
And against maiden Yeon Woo!

317
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,170
How do you intend to pay for your crime?!

318
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,180
With what do you intend to pay
for your crime?!

319
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,000
Even if we were to go back to that time...

320
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:08,300
...I would choose my husband.

321
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,830
Even if I have to incur the wrath
of the heavens,

322
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,630
even if I have to die
and fall into the fires of hell...

323
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,550
...I don't regret my decision.

324
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,180
I will punish you.

325
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,130
It is only if I punish you,

326
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,150
that I can make the maternal side clan
who were responsible pay for their crime.

327
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,350
And so...

328
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,890
I will readily accept my punishment.

329
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,180
But...

330
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,440
Please...

331
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,850
Don't punish my husband
and his child in my belly.

332
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,000
I beg you.

333
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,930
What did you just say?

334
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,230
I must go now.

335
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,070
My husband will be waiting.

336
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,210
Princess.

337
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,470
Husband.

338
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,150
What's the matter?

339
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,010
Did you hear bad news from the physician?

340
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,710
Then, what was the result
of your pulse examination?

341
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,710
They say I have your child...

342
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,270
...in my womb.

343
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,600
Really?

344
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,060
I'm sorry.

345
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,280
I should have realized it earlier.
I had no idea.

346
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,320
No, you couldn't have.

347
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,110
I didn't know, either.

348
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,160
However...

349
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,990
However what?

350
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,210
I have something...

351
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,360
...I need to tell you.

352
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,590
I see.

353
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,580
Please tell me.

354
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,400
The truth is...

355
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,670
The truth is...

356
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,690
Is it that you didn't want
to have the child?

357
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:19,040
No, I wanted this so very much.

358
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,670
Thank you.

359
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,700
No.

360
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,430
The words "thank you" are inadequate.

361
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,870
I'm sorry for always only receiving
your graciousness

362
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,830
and not being able
to return it adequately.

363
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,810
Thanks to this blessing you bring,

364
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,380
I think I can now face my father.

365
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,050
I am proud of you.

366
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,560
From now on,
I will love you even more, Princess.

367
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,590
Don't cry.

368
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,040
The child will be startled.

369
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,840
It's a son, I see.

370
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,580
He will be brilliant like his father.

371
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,580
And he will have an extraordinary mind.

372
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,260
His character, too,
will be as refined as silk.

373
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,360
He will be a man of talent,
of utmost importance to the country.

374
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,040
Unni, what's the matter?

375
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,880
Did I say something wrong?

376
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,580
I told you.

377
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,460
Didn't I tell you never to go
to that house again?

378
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,310
Why do you not listen?

379
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,000
My poor young master, what's to be done?

380
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,400
To love the girl who killed his sister...

381
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,840
-How could this happen?
-Shut your mouth.

382
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,960
You shouldn't have told me.

383
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,610
You threatened that
if I didn't tell you everything,

384
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,100
you would charge into the palace hall
and expose everything.

385
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,740
That's why I told you.

386
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,240
Still, you shouldn't have told me.

387
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,030
My poor lady and young master,
what's to be done?

388
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,050
What's to be done?

389
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,060
Your Majesty.

390
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,900
Your Majesty, may I come in?

391
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,820
No.

392
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,570
Do not come in.

393
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,300
I cannot look at you.

394
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:30,360
I vowed I would capture and slaughter
those who did this to you.

395
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,320
But...

396
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,440
...the people who did this to you
were my blood relatives.

397
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,090
Those who ordered your death,
who killed you...

398
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,980
...and who covered up your unjust death,
were all my blood relatives.

399
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,250
How could I bring myself to face you?

400
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,710
You asked me why I didn't tell you

401
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,210
after I regained my memory.

402
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,770
It was precisely this that I feared.

403
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,940
I feared Your Majesty
would be heartbroken...

404
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,410
...and would refuse to see me.

405
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,640
What happened to you...

406
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,900
...is essentially because of me.

407
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,590
If you speak like that...

408
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,030
...then I will resent that I lived.

409
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,330
What is it that you want me to do?

410
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,310
Just...

411
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,120
...cover it up.

412
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,360
If my brother were to find out about this,
he wouldn't be able to endure it.

413
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,880
Don't you feel bitter about
the long years you spent hidden away?

414
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,680
Wasn't the suffering you endured painful?

415
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,980
It is because it was painful...

416
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,440
...that I do not wish to share it
with my brother.

417
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,170
Do you feel pity only for your brother?

418
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,040
Do you feel no pity for me?

419
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:07,200
If you are not my Queen,
it must be another woman that I hold.

420
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,410
Do you feel no pity for me?

421
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,190
Do you feel no pity for yourself?

422
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,370
Did you say the rural Onyang Palace?

423
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,570
Yes.

424
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,490
Though spring is on its way, the air is
still cold both during the night and day.

425
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,030
It will be more comfortable
than here in the palace.

426
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,710
Are you advising me to go to Onyang
truly out of concern for my health?

427
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,690
Or...

428
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:59,240
I am advising you to step down
from politics now,

429
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,360
and rest in comfort.

430
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,210
There is no chance of that, Your Majesty.

431
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,210
There is no one that
can push me out of my position.

432
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,300
Then, make a choice.

433
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,740
You can do as I say and go to Onyang,

434
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,900
or personally appear for interrogation
at the State Tribunal

435
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,380
and accept strict judgement!

436
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,860
Interrogation, you say?

437
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,360
Judgement, you say?

438
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,310
What crime have I committed
that you would say such a thing?

439
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,430
Eight years ago!

440
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,940
The crime of killing the Crown Princess
through sorcery!

441
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,500
Prove it.

442
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,820
Also, the crime of forcing your
granddaughter to participate!

443
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,770
Prove it.

444
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,670
Do not confuse me with my father!!

445
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,910
Your Majesty.

446
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,310
I shall make no exceptions
in convicting crimes for blood relatives.

447
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:03,220
Therefore, let go of everything
now and go to Onyang Palace.

448
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,740
This is the full extent
of the filial consideration I can offer.

449
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,600
What do you have to gain by doing this?

450
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,100
True "justice". That one word.

451
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,850
Why is it that you do not realize
you still need me?

452
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,280
You said going against the tide
was detrimental and unnatural.

453
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:31,410
Therefore, I should just follow the
course of reason. That is what you said.

454
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,510
If your course of reason
is to just follow what has been laid down,

455
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,820
my course of reason
is to right what is wrong.

456
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:45,170
Therefore, I will turn everything
back to the beginning.

457
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,470
Your Majesty cannot do this to me.

458
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,900
I shall not see
Your Highness off tomorrow.

459
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,230
Please be healthy.

460
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,160
Your Majesty!

461
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Do you truly not know
who put you in the throne you sit upon?!

462
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,460
It was me!

463
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,920
I'm saying that this grandmother,
for the sake of Your Majesty,

464
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:38,610
gathered support and got blood on
her hands to ensure your throne!

465
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,450
But Onyang Palace?!

466
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,100
Step down?!

467
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,080
This is preposterous!

468
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,210
You cannot.

469
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,620
You cannot...

470
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,490
Your Highness!

471
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,970
Your Highness! Your Highness.

472
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,260
Your Highness.

473
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,590
Call the physician. Quick!

474
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,930
Your Highness.

475
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,730
Your Highness.

476
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,340
What do you mean Onyang Palace,
all of a sudden?

477
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,190
A visit is a nice way to put it.

478
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,840
He's basically just throwing out
his own grandmother!

479
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,090
That disrespectful ingrate!

480
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,690
Don't you think
this is a declaration of war against us?

481
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,650
There's no doubt.
If the King knows everything,

482
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,710
it's certain that he has drawn his sword.

483
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,890
Shortly, there will be a purging.

484
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,270
Since the King has drawn his sword,

485
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,960
then there's no one among us
who will survive.

486
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,800
What are we to do, Chief Councilor?

487
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,260
If that's the case,
we should strike first.

488
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,020
Strike first?

489
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,140
You know the saying that a monk
will depart if he doesn't like the temple.

490
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,620
But, what reason could there possibly be

491
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,980
that all of those monks must leave
the temple?

492
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,380
All that's needed is to change
the Chief Monk who has different ideas.

493
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,540
Isn't that right?

494
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,770
Will you be going now?

495
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,010
My wound has adequately healed,

496
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,270
what would be the point of staying longer

497
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,320
when I'm not even a Buddhist?

498
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,810
Could we walk together for a bit?

499
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,470
Prince Yang Myung.

500
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,300
Yes.

501
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,750
I know. I will not waver.

502
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,960
I will not veer.

503
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,790
Prince Yang Myung, do as you wish.

504
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,310
Now, from this point on,

505
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,920
do as you wish, as your heart directs.

506
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,400
Live that way.

507
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,720
Do you mean that?

508
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,390
Because I trust you.

509
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,020
Because if it is up to you,
you will always make the right decision.

510
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,720
I trust you.

511
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,320
You trust me.

512
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,440
Do you know how frightening
those words are?

513
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,670
Prince Yang Myung.

514
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,760
This too shall pass.

515
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,450
As time goes by,
just as the seasons change,

516
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,900
the sadness will some day disappear.

517
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:03,420
And another welcome relationship
will emerge.

518
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,020
Whatever life you choose to lead
from this moment on...

519
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,170
...and what decisions
you make in that life,

520
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,580
your mother trusts you.

521
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,220
No matter what decisions I make?

522
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,770
Yes.

523
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:29,040
No matter what decisions you make.

524
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,880
Prince Yang Myung!

525
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,120
Why have you all gathered here
when the weather is so cold?

526
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,290
Please don't jump to any conclusions.

527
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,860
We have just come by
to offer our well-wishes.

528
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,130
Well-wishes in the middle of the night.

529
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,820
In any case, let's go inside
and you can wish me well there.

530
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,390
Because of the ill health of the King,
there is no peace under his government.

531
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,810
The future of this country
seems to be filled with chaos.

532
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,760
It is a big concern.

533
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,950
Besides, not only is there no heir,

534
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,350
but his marriage
has not even been consummated.

535
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,860
So there's even more concern.

536
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,290
Your fears are unnecessarily excessive.

537
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,480
His Majesty is still in his prime years
and shall continue to become healthier.

538
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,670
What exactly are you worried about?

539
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,020
Naturally, he should continue
to become healthy.

540
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,700
We are just saying we should be prepared
in case the unexpected occurs.

541
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,670
Hope for the best
and prepare for the worst?

542
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,070
That sounds good.

543
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,560
Do you not feel bitter and wronged
to be buried away like this?

544
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,230
When in truth, you are a man
that holds capabilities befitting a King.

545
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,370
Is that not so, Prince Yang Myung?

546
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,910
Capabilities befitting a King...

547
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,770
...not only are your remarks
lavishly undeserved but also dangerous.

548
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,120
And so, what is it you want to say?

549
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,170
If there continues to be
no designated successor to the throne,

550
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,790
there will be chaotic disorder
in the anticipation of the next reign.

551
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,540
If something unexpected should happen,
won't it already be too late for action?

552
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:41,490
So then, what should I do?

553
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,480
I mean, when the King is still
in excellent health...

554
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,310
...what should I do about people
discussing our next ruler?

555
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,080
This edge, running along the length
of this sword, isn't it most beautiful?

556
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,940
Yes, it is but...

557
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,480
It would be such a waste,
to sully this precious sword

558
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,750
with the blood of mere gnats.

559
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,720
Whose neck shall I slit first?

560
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,090
If I were to offer up to the King
the necks of a group of traitors,

561
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,900
what sort of compensation
would I be offered?

562
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,460
What do you mean a group of traitors?
When did we...

563
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,580
You have greatly misunderstood,
Prince Yang Myung!

564
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,660
As a warning to the disloyal subjects,

565
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,570
shall I start by slicing off
that treacherous tongue?!

566
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,520
You have distorted my patriotic concern
for the country.

567
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,890
Let's go.

568
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,940
If you ever utter
such reckless remarks again...

569
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,390
...your head and body
shall forever be separated.

570
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,510
I don't believe there is any chance.

571
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,770
I was surprised when he let us in,
wondering if he had changed his mind,

572
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,710
but in actuality,
I almost had my head sliced off.

573
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,050
Of course, if he were persuaded
so easily, it would be boring.

574
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,150
So, is that all?

575
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,420
Well...

576
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,560
Who is the man hidden behind you all?

577
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,200
Go relay this message to him.

578
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,120
Tell him to forget this notion
of sending people to test my response.

579
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,930
If he has something to say,
tell him to come find me personally.

580
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,740
All right. You may leave now.

581
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,410
But, why Prince Yang Myung, of all people?

582
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,040
Prince Yang Myung has had
the King's favor for a very long time.

583
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,130
How can you be so unaware
of something so obvious?

584
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,030
Then, do you know?

585
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,970
Since the dawn of history,

586
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,760
in all that happens,
the important factor is motive.

587
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,220
He went so far as to escape
and run off with the girl,

588
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,120
but ultimately she was
essentially swiped by His Majesty.

589
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,170
In his emotional state, he's liable
to knock down more than just the King.

590
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,160
Then, are you saying he'd go
against the King for a mere girl?

591
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,050
Don't you think it could be dangerous?

592
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,420
Even if they are
currently diametrically opposed,

593
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,940
Prince Yang Myung will not easily
be able to betray the King.

594
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,770
Generally, betrayal emerges
from a close source.

595
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,030
A small crack can cause
an embankment to collapse,

596
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,500
and trivial misunderstanding
can give way to a tragedy.

597
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,550
In any case, when the King
meets his death,

598
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,930
Prince Yang Myung is next
in the order of succession,

599
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,470
so he will obtain the throne anyhow,
won't he?

600
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:12,430
Furthermore, we are talking about
changing the King of a country.

601
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:17,320
If we present someone inferior
to the current King,

602
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,380
we will not be able to justify
overthrowing the King.

603
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,370
But do you think Prince Yang Myung
will easily agree?

604
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,050
We will have to persuade him somehow.

605
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:31,500
Your Majesty.

606
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,870
Are you not curious what's
the ultimate card I have in my hand?

607
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,110
Mother.

608
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,330
Why are your visits to the palace
so frequent?

609
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,870
This is the niece
I mentioned to you earlier.

610
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,340
As the Queen appears to be
rather depressed,

611
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,940
I brought her by
to provide some conversation.

612
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,380
What is your name?

613
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,110
I am Kim Soo Young.

614
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,660
Is this your first visit to the palace?

615
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,510
Yes.

616
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,850
How does it feel now that you're here?

617
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,100
The buildings that stand
layer after layer,

618
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:27,170
feel like soldiers
protecting the King and Queen.

619
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,440
The phrase "palace of layered doors"
seems real to me now.

620
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,930
How lovely it would be to live
in such a wide and beautiful place.

621
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,580
That's the thought that came to mind.

622
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,410
You would like to live in the palace?

623
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,230
Yes.

624
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,080
For a young girl,
you have some lofty ideas.

625
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,250
Then, would you like to have
a look around the palace?

626
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,190
Do you want to have a look
around the palace?

627
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,730
Excuse me?

628
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,750
If you want,
I can make it so you can live there.

629
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,510
Your Majesty.

630
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,740
She's still young,

631
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,550
but she can comprehend a lot
and is very savvy,

632
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,650
so she shall likely provide great comfort
to Your Majesty.

633
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,230
So keep her by your side.

634
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,660
Mother.

635
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,880
Father may abandon me.

636
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,850
What do you mean he would abandon you?

637
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,790
What kind of
utterly groundless remark is that?

638
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,030
No.

639
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,700
Father is completely capable
of something like that.

640
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,330
If he feels I am no longer useful,
even if I am his daughter...

641
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,510
...he will abandon me one day.

642
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:25,170
Then, who on earth are you
saying would take your place?

643
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,050
Court Lady Jo.

644
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,610
You called, Madam?

645
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,590
Take this child and serve her some tea.

646
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,670
Yes.

647
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,280
Even if, as Your Majesty says,

648
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,400
he brings that child into the palace
as an adopted daughter,

649
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,310
it would have to be as a concubine,
wouldn't it?

650
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:19,960
Furthermore, would His Majesty
embrace such a young child?

651
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,930
If someone else was
occupying the throne...

652
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,530
...the situation would
likely be different.

653
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:33,470
What do you mean someone else?

654
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,910
If it is Father's intention...

655
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,330
...it is more than possible.

656
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,150
My Lord.

657
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,010
What is it?

658
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,550
A guest has come to visit you.

659
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,470
Didn't I tell you not to let anyone in?!

660
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,150
But, it is not someone
that I can order about.

661
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:33,320
Prince Yang Myung,
I came to ask for a drink.

662
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:51,130
The pack of rats who came before you
laid the groundwork,

663
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,760
so let's do away with the small talk
and go straight to the main point.

664
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,160
Do you not want
to become the sun yourself?

665
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,520
Chief Councilor, are you truly unaware

666
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,310
of the meaning behind the words
you just blurted out?

667
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,560
How could I speak without even knowing
what my words mean?

668
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,850
Intriguing.

669
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,050
Why me?

670
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,680
What about your many clansmen?

671
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:31,180
What's important is motive
and natural ability.

672
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,830
The motive to want to become King

673
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,230
and the natural ability
to be upheld as King.

674
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,890
A libertine like me, what ability?

675
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:45,370
On top of that,
I have vagabond tendencies.

676
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,180
A stifling Kingship
does not suit my nature.

677
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,160
Therefore, there's really no motive
to speak of, either.

678
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,630
So don't pull me into
your outrageous plot of treason.

679
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,910
How could I not recognize
your Kingly capabilities,

680
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,940
however disguised they may be?

681
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,390
My goodness, then you already knew?

682
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,240
Then you must also know quite well
how I hate to be pulled by a bad headwind.

683
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:15,980
If you withdraw now, I shall not speak
of this incident to His Majesty.

684
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:21,220
Do you intend to live forever
in the shadow of His Majesty?

685
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,930
Even if I were to possess the motive
and natural ability you speak of...

686
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,780
...to dethrone a King,
moral justification is required.

687
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,340
Moral justification can be made.

688
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,540
For example?

689
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,080
Evading the responsibility
of ensuring an heir to the throne,

690
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,390
he allowed the country to be shaken.

691
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,990
That is irresponsible.

692
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:47,260
In a country based on Confucian teachings,

693
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,480
he desired a shaman
and kept her in his bed chamber.

694
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,780
That is shameless.

695
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,550
He abandoned filial piety,
and that is immoral.

696
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,510
Don't you think
this is more than sufficient?

697
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,750
But that shaman
isn't merely a shaman, is she?

698
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,240
The Crown Princess
who died eight years ago and returned.

699
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,270
Referring to her in that manner.

700
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,800
Don't you feel that's rather crass?

701
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,660
Did you already know about that then?

702
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,290
I've known for a long time.

703
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,980
-I have a rather sharp mind, you see.
-Then...

704
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,340
...despite knowing all that,
you attempted to take the King's woman?

705
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,200
Despite knowing
how much of a whim it would be.

706
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:48,980
Well done.

707
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,820
Thanks to you,
I have resolved many questions.

708
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,580
Pardon my impertinence,
but I wonder if my findings

709
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,010
have not given Your Majesty
even more worries.

710
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,210
It was a necessary part
in the process of my realization.

711
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,660
It is proper to reward you
for your meritorious service,

712
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,770
but right now,
there is a more urgent matter.

713
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,710
When you say urgent matter...

714
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,230
Within those confidential orders you will
find a list of tasks you must undertake

715
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,850
and people you must meet.

716
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,650
After you have become
thoroughly familiar with it, destroy it.

717
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,860
I shall carry out your royal order.

718
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,690
As I have declared
a condemnation of their crime,

719
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,720
they will begin their counter attack.

720
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,600
I suppose there will be an onslaught
of slanderous propaganda against me.

721
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,870
My existence has brought on trouble
for Your Majesty.

722
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:58,730
You don't think that
I shall just meekly be taken down, do you?

723
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,060
Just wait and see.

724
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,980
Shortly among the people a very
interesting story will start to spread.

725
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,110
Shall we take a walk?

726
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:35,600
Actually, I have hidden a
gift for you in this place.

727
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,190
I already have everything.

728
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:43,380
How could I want anything else?

729
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,630
It's something I've already prepared,
so why don't you look for it?

730
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,580
For someone who claims
she couldn't want anything else,

731
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,340
you are certainly
searching quite diligently, aren't you?

732
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,970
What on earth is it?

733
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,930
Is it possibly so small
that it is not easily visible?

734
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,710
What do you mean small?!

735
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:39,910
It is not small!

736
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:01,560
You cannot mean...

737
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,640
...that you are giving me
the Hidden Moon Pavilion?

738
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,410
You do certainly think large scale. No.

739
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,660
Then what is it?

740
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,850
What I want to give you...

741
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,880
...cannot be exchanged
for anything in the world.

742
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:28,300
It's unique, unparalleled,
desired by all women,

743
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,580
the only one of its kind.

744
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,870
You cannot mean...

745
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,270
I see you've guessed.

746
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:39,900
That's right.

747
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,240
It's me.

748
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:50,980
What is that laugh about?
Are you saying it's funny?

749
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,430
How could I show such disrespect?

750
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,730
I'm just happy, just so happy.

751
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,330
Didn't you give me your heart?

752
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:22,170
And so, I shall give you my all.

753
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:26,840
Your Majesty.

754
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,570
You haven't already given up, have you?

755
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:34,000
The King is intending to make
that shaman Queen.

756
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:39,870
Don't you remember how differently
the late King treated you two?

757
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,480
How he mistreated you?

758
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,250
Have you forgotten?

759
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:53,640
Chief Councilor.

760
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,100
You are completely off the mark.

761
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,860
Do I appear like someone who would,

762
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,300
purely out of resentment and jealousy...

763
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:07,920
...usurp a seat of power,
like a corrupt political parasite?

764
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:13,220
I have no interest in the throne.

765
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,310
I have no desire to unseat the King.

766
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,180
Wealth, prosperity, reputation,
and power.

767
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,580
I have no need for such things.

768
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,740
If you have so little aspiration,
it's a disappointment.

769
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,160
I have no choice.

770
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,460
If it's a useless card,
all I can do is discard it.

771
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,100
What I want...

772
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:44,080
...is the position of Religious Rites
Master at Jongmyo Royal Ancestral Shrine

773
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,400
and Heo Yeon Woo.

774
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,610
Just those two.
