1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,210
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,200
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,330
Episode 15

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,920
Milady...

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,510
What happened, Milady?

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,690
I heard that you disappeared
on your way to the sick ward.

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,490
I was extremely worried.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,990
I passed out,
so I received treatment somewhere.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,030
What?

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,810
Are you all right now?

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,500
Yes.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,040
But Seol When I was unconscious,

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,030
I remembered events about my past.

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,100
Events from the past?

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,730
Yes, the past.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,320
Before, when I received
the divine spirit...

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,880
...I passed out.

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,150
You remember too, right?

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,150
What?

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,030
I was not there, so I don't really...

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,560
Is that so?

22
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,880
Then, when did you start
following the mistress?

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,750
Was it before I received the divine spirit
or afterwards?

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,130
I told you already.

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,370
I was sold to another owner
and I ran away.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,720
That is when I met Mistress and Milady.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,540
From then on...

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,710
Seol.

29
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,430
Yes?

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,030
Why are you lying to me?

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,890
What?

32
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,760
I clearly saw you.

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,720
When I was being taken out of the grave,
you were there watching me.

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,710
Then, are you telling me
that child was still alive?

35
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,470
That is correct.

36
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,090
Even after receiving an evil spirit
she was still sane and alive.

37
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,710
This is the first time I've seen
a shaman survive.

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,700
That child's divine power
must be extraordinary.

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,690
If it weren't for these events,

40
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,870
she would have been useful by my side.

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,430
It is a waste of her divine power.

42
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,210
So, was she sent to the sick ward?

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,740
Well...

44
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,720
The truth is...

45
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,460
I am sorry, but I have a request.

46
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,640
A request?

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,450
Because I accepted the spirit...

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,210
...it is very angry.

49
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,940
If I do not dispel the anger quickly,
not only I...

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,920
...but everyone who has brought me
to the Hidden Moon Pavilion...

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,700
...will suffer from that anger.

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,580
Then, what is your request?

53
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,660
The spirit in my body...

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,000
...needs some time to release her anger
and calm down.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,460
Please, I ask you to allow me
to stop at the Seongsucheong and pray.

56
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,270
So, you allowed her to go?

57
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,000
The girl who went
into the Hidden Moon Pavilion

58
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,700
and the girl I saw today
were two different people.

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,440
If you provoke a strong shaman,

60
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,700
it will bring disaster
for three generations to one's family.

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,430
But, what will you do if she escapes?

62
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,020
As for that, do not worry.
I have someone following her,

63
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,050
so there will be no problem.

64
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,650
Whatever happens,
to make sure there are no problems,

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,480
you will have to end this well.

66
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,390
I will humbly obey your order.

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,480
I am sorry, Milady.

68
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,850
I do not have time, Seol.

69
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,390
Ask for forgiveness later.

70
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,400
You need to tell me the truth
as you know it.

71
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,800
What did the mistress say?

72
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,400
What exactly did she say

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,440
that you kept your lips sealed from me
for eight years?

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,400
His Excellency and your mother,

75
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,720
in order to save Milady
who had a divine illness,

76
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,270
gave you medicine

77
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,430
and agreed to remove you
from the grave later.

78
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,860
They gave me the medicine to save me?

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,930
Submitting her as a candidate after
having a divine illness is treason...

80
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,900
...so they had no choice
but to hide your illness.

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,340
In order to do that,

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,590
they had no choice but to make you
dead to the world.

83
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,570
Then, Father knew that I was alive?

84
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,990
Yes.

85
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,050
In order to save
his family and reputation,

86
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,870
it was a choice he had to make.

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,420
That's why no one was to know
that you were still alive.

88
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,650
Then, the fact that
I had a divine illness is true.

89
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,510
That is what I thought.

90
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,890
But...

91
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,050
But?

92
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,980
...from what Milady
said and what I felt...

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,820
...it didn't seem like
you had divine powers,

94
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,650
so I asked Jang ahjumma.

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,530
You asked her?

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,400
She said it was because your powers
had not developed yet.

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,770
It's because you could not control
your powers yet.

98
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,510
It's because you lost your memory.

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,480
That's how she answered.

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,030
To my family...

101
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,280
...at least to my family,

102
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,550
you could have told them
I was still alive.

103
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,640
If I did that,
she said your life would be in danger.

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,710
By telling my family,
my life would be in danger?

105
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,240
Yes.

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,500
There were many things that I doubted,
but each time, Ahjumma said,

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,910
"Do not try to understand."

108
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,700
"Knowing less is the way to live."

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,590
"If you want to protect Milady's life,
keep your mouth shut."

110
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,690
I'm sorry, Milady.

111
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,690
Other than keeping my mouth shut,
I could not do anything else.

112
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,250
But Seol...

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,770
...isn't it strange?

114
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,580
What is?

115
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,720
I don't remember
getting the divine spirit.

116
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,320
What?

117
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,820
Mistress did not give me
the divine spirit.

118
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,100
So what...?

119
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,620
If you do not receive the divine spirit,
you cannot be a shaman.

120
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,080
Even so, Mistress still registered me
as a shaman of the Seongsucheong.

121
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,290
On top of that, I was made a talisman
and sent to the king's palace.

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,800
Eight years ago,

123
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,360
the mistress was
the Seongsucheong's state shaman.

124
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,620
The fact that Seongsucheong received
great favor from the Queen Dowager

125
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,060
was a known one.

126
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,750
Isn't it strange?

127
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,320
Why was it that when I became
the Crown Princess,

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,680
I got a divine illness?

129
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,100
Why was it the state shaman
of the Seongsucheong who saved me?

130
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,980
-Yeon Woo.
-What I thought was divine power

131
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,150
turned out to be my memories of the past.

132
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,070
If...

133
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,750
...it wasn't a divine illness.

134
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,180
What exactly was my illness?

135
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,050
Why did the mistress save me?

136
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,020
Did I really have a divine illness?

137
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,770
If we ask Jang ahjumma directly...

138
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,560
No. We can't.

139
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,250
We can't trust anyone right now.

140
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,710
We must not move carelessly.

141
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,980
At least until we know...

142
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,610
...who our enemy is.

143
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,220
Is anyone inside?

144
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,510
What brings His Majesty's attendant
all the way out here?

145
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,510
Is the High Shaman Jang inside?

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,640
The High Shaman left yesterday
for the mountains to pray.

147
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,590
Pray in the mountains?

148
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,290
How many days did she say she will be?

149
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,100
Pray in the mountains...

150
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,710
...she left to pray in the mountains?

151
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,090
Yes.

152
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,910
Since she took a companion,
she said she would be a few days and left.

153
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,680
At such an appropriate time,
she has left the Seongsucheong.

154
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,080
Instead of being a coincidence,
doesn't it seem too suspicious?

155
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,570
What is wrong, Your Majesty?

156
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,250
I need to get some fresh air.

157
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,230
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

158
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,540
I was just going for a walk.

159
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,510
I will prepare some hot tea
at Gyo Tae Palace.

160
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,620
I had some already.

161
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,230
Then, would you like
to take a walk together?

162
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,520
Just a few days ago, it was cold,
but the scent of spring is in the air.

163
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,270
Does Your Majesty think so as well?

164
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,010
Your Majesty.

165
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,860
Your Majesty.

166
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,030
What did you say, Queen?

167
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,470
What is wrong?

168
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,820
I will wait.

169
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,410
For what?

170
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,220
Until Your Majesty looks at me,
I will wait however long it will take.

171
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,140
I will not press you to forget that girl.

172
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,750
I heard that the king is the sun
and the queen is the moon.

173
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,810
Just how the sun
and moon keep their places,

174
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,270
when Your Majesty finally sees me,

175
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,610
no matter where that is, I will be there.

176
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,690
What is this?

177
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,380
It is "The Moon that Embraces the Sun."

178
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,760
The King is the sun
and the Queen is the moon.

179
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,050
This phoenix hairpin
symbolizes the white moon

180
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,430
embracing the red sun.

181
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,960
Therefore, I named it
"The Moon that Embraces the Sun."

182
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,370
The Moon that Embraces the Sun.

183
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,090
The real Crown Princess in my heart
is only you, Yeon Woo.

184
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,630
Milady, I am coming in.

185
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,810
When you dress like this,
you are a beautiful young woman.

186
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,420
You're pretty.

187
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,210
Was I ever a boy?

188
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,330
After you are finished with my request,
come to the sick ward.

189
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,000
-Let's go.
-Yes.

190
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,950
Am I a free man at last?

191
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,780
His Majesty convinced the ministers
to revoke, starting today,

192
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,680
the royal command that forbids
Prince Yang Myung from going out.

193
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,570
Oh, my.

194
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,390
How thankful I am.

195
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,490
Where are you planning to go?

196
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,080
You must not go there.

197
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,520
Where do you think I am going
that you are detaining me?

198
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,590
The sick ward.

199
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,820
Weren't you going there?

200
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,580
As expected, old friends are different.

201
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,240
But, why must I not go?

202
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,860
Because that child is also
His Majesty's person?

203
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,050
Your Excellency.

204
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,060
Heo Yeon Woo.

205
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,140
If it was her, then that may be why.

206
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,080
But, if it is Shaman Wol...

207
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,670
...things are different, aren't they?

208
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,900
His Majesty likes Wol
because she resembles Yeom's sister,

209
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,400
but I'm different.

210
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,400
I...

211
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,070
...I just...

212
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,470
...like Shaman Wol, so...

213
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,300
...doesn't it make sense to regard her
as mine, not His Majesty's?

214
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,790
Isn't that right?

215
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,650
Your Excellency, you are a prince!

216
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,240
That tiresome and useless title.

217
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,330
The freedom to throw it all away
if I wish.

218
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,040
That is the one thing
that His Majesty does not have...

219
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,170
...and only I have.

220
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,240
You still haven't found her?

221
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,420
It is already the fourth day.

222
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,810
Even if she is a criminal,
you should put effort into finding her.

223
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,030
So you're saying,
to find one runaway shaman,

224
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,750
does the whole country
have to search for her?

225
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,920
If a criminal disappeared
while being escorted,

226
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,080
then the Royal Investigation Bureau
should be responsible.

227
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,290
Why are you blaming me who is innocent?

228
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,520
My Lord. My Lord.

229
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,850
What is the problem?

230
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,940
My daughter is dying. Please help me!

231
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,880
Wait quietly until the doctor comes.

232
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,920
It has been a long time
since he has come here, hasn't it?

233
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,880
Please send for another doctor
or my Goot Soon will die!

234
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,920
Another doctor?

235
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,150
If you have money, you can call for one.

236
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,230
A person is dying and what are you doing?

237
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,840
You're paid with state funds,
aren't you embarrassed?!

238
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,340
I let you continue because you're a noble,
but are you going to keep yelling?

239
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,130
If you're done, get out.

240
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,540
Hurry and leave.

241
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,810
Don't bother a person.

242
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,620
I'm already annoyed because
my pension has been cut off.

243
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,160
-It's all right.
-Please give me food.

244
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,380
Are you hungry?

245
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,230
Spare me some food.

246
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,110
Straighten your back.

247
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,910
Are you able to breathe?

248
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,620
This is not just acute gastroenteritis.

249
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
It is dry cholera.

250
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,380
Go and bring ginger in cool salt water.

251
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,220
We must make her throw up
to clear the airway.

252
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,410
-Yes.
-Do you know how to do acupuncture?

253
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,460
Then prepare to treat
the Weizhong meridian.

254
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,510
Yes.

255
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,690
Hold on a little longer.

256
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,480
Soon the pain will...

257
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,870
Hold her. Hold her tightly.

258
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,260
Drink this.

259
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,200
You have to drink this.

260
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,130
What are you doing, instead of helping?

261
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,640
We must make her drink this
no matter what, so pinch her nose.

262
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,060
Goot Soon.

263
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,570
Goot Soon.

264
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,770
You're finally saved.

265
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,910
Goot Soon.

266
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,050
Goot Soon.

267
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,650
Did it come out?

268
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,150
Although I washed the dirty area,
I wasn't able to remove all of it.

269
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,750
When did you learn medical skills?

270
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,650
It's not even medical skills.

271
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,240
Confucian healers like me abound.

272
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,820
In the past, my teacher,
Directed Heo said,

273
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,770
"If you memorize this,
you can save the people of the world,"

274
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,250
so I just read some medical books.

275
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,410
So, my classmates and I
all know basic medical skills.

276
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,210
Your teacher must have been
a very good person.

277
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,970
It is hard to find people like him.

278
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,420
He was a great person.

279
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,560
He was like a father to me,
who didn't know a father's love,

280
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,070
and he was my mental
and literature teacher.

281
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,150
He was my life mentor.

282
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,880
He was strict and lenient.

283
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,100
Not just to me,
a member of the royal family.

284
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,520
But he treated everyone fairly
and sincerely.

285
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,010
Unexpectedly, it was a very busy day.

286
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,360
Today, you helped many people.

287
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm happy to see you again.

288
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,500
Although it must have been hard...

289
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,480
...it must have been
painful beyond words.

290
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,970
Thank you for being alive.

291
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,750
Don't worry.
I won't be coming back again.

292
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,360
I came because I was worried
when I heard you went missing.

293
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,070
Seeing you alive and well...

294
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,220
...and your ugly face.

295
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,070
Now that I saw everything, it's fine.

296
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,470
Then, take good care of yourself.

297
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,230
Just a moment, My Lord.

298
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,700
Just a moment.

299
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,810
Why are you acting like this?

300
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,380
Today, because of you, Sir,
we received a great amount of help.

301
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,860
I'm sorry, but can't you come back
in the future?

302
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,990
Me?

303
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,390
Why?

304
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,720
We are lacking doctors in the sick ward,

305
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,990
and they keep getting called away
for useless things...

306
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,180
But, I am...

307
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,870
Sir.

308
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,960
Oh, man.

309
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,320
Wherever I go, this popularity of mine...

310
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,440
What am I to do?

311
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,840
You're the same.

312
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,490
Your Excellency, Prince Yang Myung,

313
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,970
as expected,
being bright suits you better.

314
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,310
So, was she doing well?

315
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,850
From what I saw, it seemed like it.

316
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,450
What about her body?

317
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,930
Did she recover?

318
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,260
From what I saw,
she seemed to be enduring it well.

319
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,090
What about Hyungnim?

320
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,840
Is he doing well?

321
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,600
Did you not visit his home
before coming back?

322
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,070
No.

323
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,150
Once the house arrest was lifted,
he seemed to be enjoying his freedom.

324
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,300
Woon.

325
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

326
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,940
You are hiding something from me.

327
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,220
You were always bad at lying.

328
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,560
Although you are lying to protect me...

329
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,650
...your eyes betray you.

330
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,620
Hyungnim is together with that girl?

331
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,360
What do you think the Royal Inspector
went to the King's palace?

332
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,230
It wouldn't be for the sake
of befriending him.

333
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,380
This seems suspicious, doesn't it?

334
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,310
If we asked him the reason, obviously,

335
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,030
he'd say that he called him regarding
the death of the former Chief Eunuch.

336
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,830
That is also unusual.

337
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,760
This case should be investigated
by the Ministry of Justice.

338
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,210
But the king,

339
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,640
for who knows what reason, gave that case
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

340
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,000
It wasn't a crime of treason
or crime of the five virtues,

341
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,830
yet, he gave the case
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

342
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,940
So definitely, there must be a secret.

343
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,500
He had questions regarding
the former king's private funds,

344
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,290
so he summoned
the former Chief Eunuch to the palace.

345
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,510
But, before he entered the palace,

346
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,870
he had committed suicide.

347
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,880
It's not even about sovereignty.

348
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,230
If it is about the private property,
it is impossible for anyone to intervene.

349
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,290
Especially if it involves private funds.

350
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,460
So, the investigation goes to
the Royal Investigation Bureau.

351
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,370
Why does Our Majesty have no flaws?

352
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,000
I really cannot refute
anything he has said.

353
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,430
The issue regarding private funds
is probably an excuse.

354
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,380
In reality,

355
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,190
he is probably digging up
the matter from eight years ago.

356
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,270
For the public,

357
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,560
he is pretending to investigate
the suicide case,

358
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,900
but in reality,
he is chasing something else?

359
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,040
We must have a spy follow Hong Gyu Tae.

360
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,120
I apologize, Your Majesty,
but because it happened so long ago,

361
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,250
it is difficult to find people involved
with the case.

362
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,020
If Your Majesty remembers anyone else,
I will go and investigate them.

363
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,850
If it was a curse deadly enough
to kill the Crown Princess,

364
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,620
there must have been
something different from the past.

365
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,660
Court Lady Noh.

366
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,780
What?

367
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,810
Find Court Lady Noh.

368
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,390
She was living at Star Palace at the time,
educating the Crown Princess.

369
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,060
She will definitely know something.

370
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,910
You must find out what happened
the night the Crown Princess fainted.

371
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,660
Furthermore, Prince Consort
who was away travelling has returned.

372
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:53,440
If we left anything out
while investigating her death,

373
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,860
you must find it again.

374
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,060
I will comply with your request.

375
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,160
Your Majesty, it is Woon.

376
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,300
Come in.

377
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,660
There is movement on the ministers' side.

378
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,810
Did you hear?

379
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,840
I did.

380
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,530
You must always be on guard
and be careful.

381
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,360
I am an official at the Justice Court.

382
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,730
Although my skills are not on par
with Swordsman Woon,

383
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,440
I fight well enough to protect myself.

384
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,810
Go find Court Lady Noh
who had taught me etiquette.

385
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,770
She may know something
about what happened to me.

386
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,690
I'm counting on you, Seol.

387
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,450
She was really a smart
and beautiful person.

388
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,750
The day she left the palace,
in front of Star Palace...

389
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,890
...staring at each other with tears,
the two highnesses' figures...

390
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,360
...I still see them.

391
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,170
At that time, was there anything
that was out of the ordinary?

392
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,950
For example, was there a change
in the maids, was the food different,

393
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,810
or did someone pay a visit?

394
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,130
Please tell me everything you remember.

395
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,360
Well, let me see.

396
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,210
There's nothing really that I remember.

397
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,390
Now that I think about it, that night,

398
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,310
Princess came by
to see the Crown Princess.

399
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,550
The Princess did?

400
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,220
The Crown Princess
was the Princess's playmate...

401
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,350
...so I thought she visited
because she was curious about her.

402
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,500
Did she meet with the Crown Princess
before going back?

403
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,630
No, she didn't.

404
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,420
She seemed as though
she had a lot on her mind.

405
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,940
For some reason, she did not go inside.

406
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,310
She inquired about
the Crown Princess's health

407
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,800
and went back immediately.

408
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,130
Oh, let me ask you something.

409
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,650
I'm looking for a court lady who used
to work in the palace in the past.

410
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,020
I heard she lived nearby,
do you know where?

411
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,510
The Court Lady?

412
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,000
She lives at the end of the street.

413
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,170
Over there?

414
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,800
Yes.

415
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,930
Thank you.

416
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,710
Another innocent life was sacrificed.

417
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,410
I must be punished, for being unable
to complete your royal command.

418
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,510
How can it be only your fault?

419
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,930
You, yourself, could have lost your life.

420
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,460
I put everyone into danger,
so it is my fault.

421
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,930
That is not correct, Your Majesty.

422
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,390
Now, even you are in danger.

423
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,300
If you want to give up,
do not hesitate and tell me now.

424
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,380
I will allow it.

425
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,110
I have already given my life
to Your Majesty.

426
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,870
No matter what dangers lie ahead,
I will not stop in the middle of this.

427
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,580
Thank you.

428
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,060
I will never forget your loyalty.

429
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,910
I am humbled by your grace, Your Majesty.

430
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,180
The deeper we dig,
it is true that we are trapped.

431
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,990
But one thing has been proven.

432
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,720
Although it is insubstantial,
there is an enemy that is alive.

433
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,700
Are you coming from the library?

434
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,850
I thought I might find a worthwhile topic
for our gyeongyeon.

435
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,780
I have gone to check.

436
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,450
So, did you find a topic?

437
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,950
Fortunately,
I have found an interesting book.

438
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,220
Interesting book?

439
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,790
I am becoming curious about its content.

440
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,990
Can I hear it?

441
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,290
Since Your Majesty requests it,
I will recite it as I remember it.

442
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,220
The Chinese proverbs "myeong bul sang chal"
and "jik bul gwa gyo"

443
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,700
lead to righteous virtue.

444
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,920
So, if one is intelligent, but does
not look for the fault in others...

445
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,460
...and if one is upstanding,
but does not excessively nitpick...

446
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,530
...it is a beautiful virtue.

447
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,890
What you're saying is
don't investigate and cover it up.

448
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,140
Did you understand, Your Majesty?

449
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,620
It is a great sentence.

450
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,050
But, continuing to cover up one's mistake
without correcting it

451
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,970
cannot be the way of a noble man.

452
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,980
Rather, being cautious
of small-minded elitists

453
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,200
that counsel you to dismiss the truth
and observe reality without action...

454
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,900
...that is the way of a noble man.

455
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:48,840
However, if one does not consider
the consequences

456
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,770
and only acts vigorously and childishly,
political chaos will ensue.

457
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,550
Who will take responsibility for that?

458
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,050
Separate vigour and childishness,
it's a warning, isn't it?

459
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,470
Making this a topic for administration
to discuss with young scholars

460
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,160
will be extremely appropriate.

461
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,170
Tonight, I will make an official statement
about it to the administration.

462
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,720
I am humbled by your grace, Your Majesty.

463
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,770
May Your Majesty uphold the virtues
of a noble man.

464
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,290
Please do not forget my humble wish.

465
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,360
If you do not stop here,
you will be in danger.

466
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,260
The Princess did?

467
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,400
Yes.

468
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,060
Do you by any chance remember anything?

469
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,220
Well...

470
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,950
You, Shaman.

471
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,440
Go to the pharmacy
and fetch some medicine.

472
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,470
Yes.

473
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:11,160
If you dare flirt or act frivolously there
and disgrace us,

474
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,550
I won't forgive you.

475
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,130
Understand?

476
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,980
I will go, so Milady, you stay here.

477
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,990
No.

478
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,240
You have to go somewhere with me.

479
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,440
Father.

480
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,980
It is me, Yeon Woo.

481
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,930
Director Heo's daughter,
would you like to offer an answer?

482
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,450
I feel that
compared to any maiden in this world,

483
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:49,290
my daughter is
the most kind-hearted and wise.

484
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,550
I'm happy that your embrace
reminds me of Brother's.

485
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,590
Sleep well in my arms.

486
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,860
Father.

487
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,850
Father.

488
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,730
Are you alright?

489
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,790
Yes, Husband.

490
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,680
Because the journey is rugged,

491
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,630
it would have been better
if you stayed home.

492
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,020
I am the one who insisted on coming.

493
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,880
We are going to see Father,

494
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,540
so this much is no trouble at all.

495
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,810
Princess, you are someone who
can teach me many things.

496
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,160
What?

497
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,270
I am?

498
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,140
You are always bright,

499
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,060
so you have the gift
of making everyone around happy.

500
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,440
Thank you.

501
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,110
There you go again.

502
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,610
Saying thank you
is not necessary between husband and wife.

503
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,760
Instead of me, give your arm to Mother.

504
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:40,780
Not long ago,
after returning from the physician's,

505
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,040
she has been depressed.

506
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,600
It seems as if someone else was here.

507
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,100
The smell of incense
is still lingering in the air,

508
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,880
so it doesn't seem like
it was too long ago.

509
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,260
Could it have been Brother Yang Myung
who was here?

510
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,370
Yeom.

511
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,230
Yes, Mother.

512
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,770
Your father did not die
because of a disease.

513
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,840
What?

514
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,060
Then...

515
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,210
Your father...

516
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,790
...committed suicide.

517
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:33,180
After sending Yeon Woo like that...

518
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,360
...he was always in agony.

519
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,620
He said he killed Yeon Woo
and kept blaming himself.

520
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,430
He was a great deal of pain.

521
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,900
Yeom, after you married the Princess...

522
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,340
...it was as if he had
fulfilled his duties.

523
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,640
He suffered from a lingering disease...

524
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:15,540
...and then he killed himself.

525
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,920
He sent his child to heaven before him...

526
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,900
His heart was slowly rotting away.

527
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,310
That feeling.

528
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,700
Who would understand it?

529
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,690
Your Excellency, are you well?

530
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,560
Not too long ago...

531
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,420
...I saw a young woman who looked
just like our Yeon Woo.

532
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,650
It couldn't be her, right?

533
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,620
She was being shunned by everyone.

534
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,300
She had spit and rocks thrown at her.

535
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,590
Our Yeon Woo
is not suffering a life like that, right?

536
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,390
Please tell me she isn't.

537
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:23,860
Tell me our Yeon Woo
is in that place with you...

538
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:30,660
...resting peacefully and well.

539
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,710
Your Excellency.

540
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,470
Milady.

541
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,920
It's all because of me.

542
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,320
It's my fault...

543
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,330
...that Father died.

544
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,720
Milady!

545
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,590
I was too young then,
so I thought if I died...

546
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,860
...I could save everyone.

547
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:47,840
Instead, if I had said I wanted to
live or I had begged him to save me...

548
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,040
Milady, tell them that you're alive now.

549
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,540
In the very least, at least to Madam.

550
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,980
Seol, you did not either.

551
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:08,000
You said it was to protect me
and my family.

552
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,500
I will also do the same.

553
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,220
Behind my death,
there is definitely secret.

554
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,350
There is a possibility that
my family and His Majesty...

555
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,870
...will all be in danger.

556
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,180
Until the whole truth is uncovered.

557
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,650
Heo Yeon Woo...

558
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,140
...must remain a dead person.

559
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,920
Aren't you shamans from the Seongsucheong?

560
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,780
What is the reason
you have entered the palace?

561
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,650
We heard that cries of a ghost
was heard at the Hidden Moon Pavilion,

562
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,480
so the Queen Dowager ordered us
to enter and place a talisman there.

563
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:13,600
All right.

564
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,190
You are working hard.

565
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,740
Hold on.

566
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,980
Wait.

567
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,070
Why are you here?

568
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,140
Excuse me?

569
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,040
You should be in the sick ward,
but why are you here?

570
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,790
It isn't I who was sent to the sick ward,
but the shaman receptacle of misfortune.

571
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,120
Then, you're saying you're not her?

572
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,750
Yes. I entered the King's Palace
as a talisman for consummation,

573
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:08,300
and the shaman receptacle Wol
is at the sick ward.

574
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,640
What?

575
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,830
Wol...

576
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,470
Court Lady Jo.

577
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,670
Yes, Your Highness.

578
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,210
Send someone to the sick ward immediately.

579
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,400
Find the shaman named Wol
and bring her before me.

580
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:54,180
This matter, no one must know about it.

581
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,220
Yes, Your Highness.

582
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,920
Since you caught my team's grasshopper,
I have no choice but to make you my enemy.

583
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,760
We are playing hit the grasshopper
but you caught our team's grasshopper.

584
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,130
From now on, you are our enemy.

585
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,600
You really do not understand
what I am saying.

586
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,070
I'm telling you to join the other team
and get ready to hit.

587
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,240
-Unni.
-Nuna.

588
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,710
Now, let's start.

589
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,710
Quickly. Quickly.

590
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,840
Quickly!

591
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,950
Quickly.

592
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,020
Count.

593
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,710
One,

594
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,890
two, three.

595
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,960
Wait!

596
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,710
Why are you cheating?

597
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,080
I did no such thing.

598
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,380
Lie after you've grown up more.

599
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,120
-Hand it over.
-Why?

600
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,240
All right, let's switch.

601
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:06,580
My Lord, why are you doing this?

602
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,400
My Lord, why are you doing this?

603
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,970
Your posture when you hold the stick
is unsteady,

604
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,640
I thought you were going to fall
so I held you.

605
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,940
I had no other intentions,
so stop being surprised now.

606
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,740
Your Majesty.

607
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,820
Do not say anything.

608
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,460
Not a thing.

609
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,160
Good bye.

610
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,210
Let's go home.

611
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,540
Are you all right now?

612
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,870
What?

613
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,740
What were you thinking about earlier
that made you look so gloomy?

614
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,360
Then, is that why you called me over?

615
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:50,300
After playing
with those innocent children,

616
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,640
all of the world's anxiety and worries...

617
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,910
...can be brushed aside.

618
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:03,130
Thanks to you, I feel much better.

619
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:08,070
It's not because you played with someone
as magnanimous and cool like me?

620
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,570
Isn't better that you are a shaman?

621
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,970
I can stay by your side
and see your smiling face.

622
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,560
Tomorrow, with this one,
should I play hopscotch?

623
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,070
Give it to me.

624
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,390
Why?

625
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,200
Do you plan on practising beforehand?

626
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,530
No.

627
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,670
It is too pretty to play hopscotch with.

628
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:49,620
I plan to use it as Hye Woo Suk,
so it can do the worrying for me.

629
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,750
Is that so?

630
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,810
That is not a bad idea either.

631
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:55,820
Then this rock...

632
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,370
...is a gift from me.

633
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,670
Shaman, I thought I told
you to fetch the medicine.

634
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,350
Where were you all this time?

635
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,730
I will be in soon.

636
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,530
Thank you for the gift.

637
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,520
Have a safe trip home.

638
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,810
Welcome back, High Shaman.

639
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:47,200
While I was away, did anything happen?

640
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,360
As soon as you come back,

641
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,710
there was a royal command for you
to go to the King's Palace.

642
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,930
After tonight's cleansing ritual,

643
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,410
I will enter the palace tomorrow.

644
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,910
Mistress! Mistress!

645
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:12,940
Seol is dressed like a woman.

646
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,280
Father,

647
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,970
until I find out the truth
about everything,

648
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:56,530
my worries and sadness
will temporarily be buried here.

649
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,410
Every step that your daughter takes
from now on,

650
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,390
Father, please watch over me.

651
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,320
Are you the shaman named Wol?

652
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:22,390
That is correct, but who are you?

653
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,630
The Queen wants to see you.

654
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:40,650
I plan to use it as Hye Woo Suk,
so it can do the worrying for me.

655
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,230
What concern do you have
that you aren't able to sleep?

656
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,310
This rock is called "Hye Woo Suk,"
as it worries for you.

657
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:53,410
Hye Woo Suk?

658
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,900
Thanks for your concern, but...

659
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,330
Hyungnim.

660
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,880
Why are you so...

661
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,470
...reckless?

662
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,820
Reckless? What are you referring to?

663
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,590
The sick ward.

664
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,010
I heard you go there often.

665
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,540
Oh.

666
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,320
It's not that I go often. I go every day.

667
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,080
The woman I love is in
a difficult situation.

668
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,200
As a man, how can I stand by
pretending nothing has happened?

669
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,610
Hyungnim, you...

670
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,360
I told you already.

671
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,100
I do not care about my title
as a member of the royal family.

672
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:45,020
I am prepared to throw it away
at any time.

673
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,090
Have you forgotten?

674
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:53,480
Will you defy the royal order
to stay away from her...

675
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,340
-Your Majesty!
-Hyungnim!

676
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,300
Your Majesty, the Queen.

677
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,900
Shaman Wol is here.

678
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,420
Pay your respects to Her Majesty,
the Queen.
