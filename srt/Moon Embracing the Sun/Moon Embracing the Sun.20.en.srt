1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,540
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,580
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,620
Final Episode

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,590
I shall give His Majesty's
neck to you, my Lord.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,390
Are you saying I am to slit
His Majesty's throat personally?

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,270
You must exhibit at least
that much passion

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,230
to rouse fighting spirit
among the soldiers.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,830
So only if I hold a sword
stained with the blood of my brother

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,630
will you accept me as King.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,500
Originally, wasn't this Joseon nation
founded upon the bloodshed between kin?

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,590
It is a good opportunity for me personally
to solidify our resolution,

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,440
so it is not a bad proposition.

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,990
I shall gladly accept.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,170
Kill him!

15
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,880
Just as the Zhou
accepted the will of the heavens

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,900
and took down the Shang King,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,740
we shall also accept heavens' command
and dethrone the immoral King!

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,190
Slit the deposed King's throat!

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,470
What are you hesitating for?!
Slit my throat!

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,140
It is you, Hyungnim,
who have passed up your chance today.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,020
So do not ever wish
for another opportunity.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,790
No. I shall have another opportunity.

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,880
Namely, at the scene of revolt.

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,110
Aren't you just testing me
to see how I will react

25
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,380
when an insurrection strikes you?

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,060
Tell me!

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,190
What exactly is Your Majesty planning?

28
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,710
What are you hesitating for, my Lord?!

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,570
He is a tyrant that has gone against
the will of the heavens!

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,060
Condemn him for his crimes
and slit his throat!

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,550
I'm thinking of going on a hunt.

32
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,150
Those who orchestrated
that child's death,

33
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,360
those who used that death
to fulfil their greed,

34
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,810
those who sacrificed the lives
of the innocent,

35
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,660
the Royal Court officials
that serve their self-interests

36
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,800
more than this land and its people...

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,680
...shall all be taken down
in a single sweep.

38
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,430
They are not the sort of people
that will sit quietly and let that happen.

39
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,590
I realize that.

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,240
If I do not give up the idea
of convicting them,

41
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,280
they will plan an insurrection.

42
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,740
And shortly, they will approach you.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,510
So then, what is it
that you want from me?

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,140
I need a record of all their names.

45
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,360
If they are not eliminated...

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,260
...Yeon Woo will have to live
the rest of her life in danger.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,270
And this country will march
toward its ruin.

48
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,930
What instils in you such trust in me
that you would speak such perilous words?

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,040
Just now, I placed my life in your hands.

50
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,140
A revolt is different.

51
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,820
Naturally, the choice is yours.

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,250
Attack!

53
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,160
They are the King's soldiers!

54
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,620
And now the hunt begins!

55
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,850
Charge forward!

56
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,570
The man who takes the lives
of the King and Prince Yang Myung

57
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,700
will be awarded for meritorious service!

58
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,680
Your Majesty! It's Court Lady Jo!

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,450
Your Majesty!
It's a revolt! You must go...

60
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,500
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,590
Father.

62
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,200
Must blood be shed, after all?

63
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,670
Though it is uncertain
who will be victorious...

64
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,410
...my stepping down as Queen

65
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,180
is one thing that is certain, I suppose.

66
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,460
From the day I first saw Your Majesty,

67
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,210
I have only ever wanted one thing.

68
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,440
Solely Your Majesty's heart.

69
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,550
And so, I shall die still a Queen...

70
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,630
...and still as Your Majesty's woman.

71
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,400
Dispose of Prince Yang Myung
and take the record of names!

72
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,310
I am holding the record of names with me,

73
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,130
so if you can kill me, come and take it.

74
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,660
Your Majesty!

75
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,820
Hyungnim!

76
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,320
Your Majesty,

77
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,810
please forgive your subject's
foolish decision.

78
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,030
There can only one sun in the heavens.

79
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,780
There will no longer be disorder
because of me.

80
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,240
Hyungnim.

81
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,570
Hyungnim!

82
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,380
Brother.

83
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:27,630
To have the opportunity to be held
in your arms...

84
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,070
...it's a good feeling.

85
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,260
Why?

86
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,690
Why in the world...

87
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,970
These days...

88
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,650
...acting like a debauched libertine
is tiresome...

89
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,430
...and no longer entertaining.

90
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,470
If there is something I regret,

91
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,790
it is that I haven't seen
Yeom for so long.

92
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,010
Oh, dear.

93
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,560
Why...

94
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,480
Why shed tears over something like this?

95
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,070
Do not cry.

96
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,730
I am all right.

97
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,780
As you ordered, it is the record
of names of the insurgents.

98
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,050
All right.

99
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,790
I understand, so please do not move.

100
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,900
The physician will be here shortly.

101
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,270
So, until then...

102
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,560
At one time...

103
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,970
...I resented Your Majesty
for having everything.

104
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,730
And so, I once also coveted your position.

105
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,240
However, as a price to pay
in exchange for the throne...

106
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,430
...my friends and my brother...

107
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
...were far too important to me.

108
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,700
Hyungnim.

109
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,880
I pray that...

110
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,560
...you become a strong monarch...

111
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,470
...and together with her...

112
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,610
...protect the people of this country.

113
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,200
Your loyal subject...

114
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,840
...shall watch over you...

115
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,650
...from the other world.

116
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,110
Father, I am coming to you
as nothing but your son.

117
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,340
And when we meet
in that place as father and son,

118
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,850
you will finally embrace me
with your smile.

119
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,060
But my poor mother that
I will leave behind, along with...

120
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,000
Are you going somewhere?

121
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,620
I came by to have a look at your face
before I leave.

122
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,470
What a homely face.

123
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,810
I have seen my fill so I'm fine now.

124
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,990
Hyungnim.

125
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,720
Hyungnim.

126
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,250
Hyung... Hyungnim.

127
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,070
Hyungnim. Hyungnim!

128
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,940
Hyungnim!

129
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,650
Hyungnim, open your eyes.

130
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,730
My order was just the record of names.

131
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,800
I never ordered you to die!

132
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,570
Hyungnim.

133
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,690
Hyungnim...

134
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,080
Hyungnim, open your eyes.

135
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,310
It's an order.

136
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,520
Will you defy a royal order?!

137
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,030
Hyungnim.

138
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,160
Hyungnim...

139
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,700
Hyungnim.

140
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,480
Hyungnim!

141
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,960
In case we were followed,
I circled around the long way,

142
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,710
so it took quite a long time.

143
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,690
We have arrived,
so you can come out now, Milady.

144
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,370
Where are we?

145
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,610
His Majesty ordered
that we bring you here.

146
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,250
You've suffered a long journey,
so please go on inside.

147
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,560
Mo... Mother.

148
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,150
Yeon Woo...

149
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Are you...

150
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,530
...Are you really Yeon Woo?

151
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,850
Really Yeon Woo?

152
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,630
Mother.

153
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,120
Aigoo, my baby!

154
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,700
You were alive!

155
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,540
You were truly alive!

156
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,950
Mother.

157
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,920
Is this a dream or is it real?

158
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,440
How...

159
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,040
...how could this have happened?

160
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,060
I didn't know I'd see you again, and...

161
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,290
Mother.

162
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,520
Brother.

163
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,170
Oh! Aigoo, my baby!

164
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,450
You should take Mother inside.

165
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:41,170
I once saw a peasant girl
that looked like you.

166
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,220
I don't know what crime she committed,

167
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,310
but as I watched the people...

168
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,190
...throw rocks at the girl.

169
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,430
How my heart crumbled.

170
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,670
You can talk of others later.

171
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,980
Right now, please rest.

172
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,340
No.

173
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,460
How can I leave you...

174
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,680
...and go to sleep?

175
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:29,280
What if, while I'm asleep,
you disappear again?

176
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,060
That won't happen.

177
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,190
Without your permission,
I will not go anywhere.

178
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,760
I don't know what is going on.

179
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,800
The Princess who stayed by my side...

180
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,920
...these eight years in your place

181
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,840
was involved in your death?

182
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,310
I cannot believe what I have heard.

183
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,120
Did Brother tell you?

184
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,120
He told me she committed a grave crime.

185
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,910
She carries our bloodline in her belly...

186
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,340
...and yet, he acts with such cruelty.

187
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,220
Brother.

188
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,990
Are you really not going to look at me?

189
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,660
If you blame
and torture yourself like this...

190
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,180
...I have no choice but to regret
having survived.

191
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,380
Do you want me to think that way?

192
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:51,790
I have committed
such a grave crime against you.

193
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,980
How can you say
you've committed a crime against me?

194
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,740
You have done nothing wrong.

195
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,140
Everything happened because of me.

196
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,970
Because of me, all of this...

197
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,340
Do not speak like that.

198
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
Just, praise me.

199
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,580
Say that I did well to survive.

200
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,390
Yeon Woo.

201
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,710
Thank you.

202
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,480
For being alive.

203
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,740
I thank you, too.

204
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,980
For being alive like this.

205
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,090
I told you, whether it's porridge or rice,
I am not eating.

206
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,180
Court Lady Min, why...

207
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,960
Why do you refuse to eat?

208
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,850
How can I bring myself to eat?

209
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:42,770
So then, do you intend to die
with the baby that you carry?

210
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,720
Would you like me to die?

211
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,410
No.

212
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,580
I would like you to live.

213
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,420
Liar! That's not possible!

214
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,290
I tried to kill you!
How can you want me to live?!

215
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,040
You tried to kill me...

216
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,590
...but as you can see, I'm still alive.

217
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,700
I resented you enough to want you dead,
but because you lived...

218
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,810
...my mother was able to smile again...

219
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,660
...and my brother gained a child.

220
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,220
How dare you spout such hypocrisy?

221
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,050
I'd rather you shout
that I should die at once.

222
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,970
Grab my neck.

223
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,750
Then, I can fall prostrated
and beg for your forgiveness!

224
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,540
Is it my forgiveness what you need?

225
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,580
Yes, I will forgive you.

226
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,170
For the sake of my brother and His Majesty
who suffered pain because of you.

227
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,550
For the sake of those two
who plead forgiveness in your place,

228
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,240
and who are paying
for your crime in your place,

229
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,140
I shall willingly forgive you.

230
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,060
So, live.

231
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,920
Live and personally plead for forgiveness.

232
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,550
Personally pay for your crime,
and atone for your misdeeds.

233
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,200
Not His Majesty, not my brother...

234
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,100
...but you personally.

235
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,860
For surviving, for being alive...

236
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,270
...I can only thank you.

237
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,470
I pray you will...

238
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,470
...allow me to say the
same to you one day.

239
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,180
Prince Yang Myung.

240
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,730
Please open your eyes.

241
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,040
Prince Yang Myung.

242
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,740
Please stop with this prank,
and open your eyes.

243
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,450
Who has lied to me?

244
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,740
Do you not see this smile?

245
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,090
Do you not see he is still alive?

246
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,330
Prince Yang Myung. Please get up.

247
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,910
Why do you pull such pranks?

248
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,000
You must not do this.

249
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,800
You are scaring your mother.

250
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,030
Prince Yang Myung.
Open your eyes, Prince Yang Myung!

251
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,780
Please get up, Prince Yang Myung!

252
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,100
Prince Yang Myung!

253
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,140
Oh dear, oh dear.

254
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,590
So there are times
when even the mighty Woon looks tired.

255
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,300
Prince Yang Myung.

256
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,320
Could it be that you already miss me?

257
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,230
Does it make you happy,
leaving us like that?

258
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,250
Why wouldn't I be?

259
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,390
I no longer have
to bother with false laughter,

260
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,800
I no longer have to force myself to drink
when I don't enjoy it that much,

261
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,650
I no longer have to be a threat
to His Majesty,

262
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,920
and more than anything,

263
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,450
I can gaze upon that girl
to my heart's content.

264
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,110
How can I not be happy?

265
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,580
May I ask just one question?

266
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,490
Of course.

267
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,090
Do you still think of me as a friend?

268
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,950
A friend, you say.

269
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,430
Friend is a good word
no matter when you hear it.

270
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,840
Please answer.

271
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,700
Have you come to me as a friend?

272
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,530
Of course.

273
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,300
You have been so up to now,

274
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,910
and you shall always be my friend.

275
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,650
Your Majesty!

276
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,300
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

277
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,730
Your Majesty!

278
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,490
Your Majesty...

279
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,690
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

280
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,670
Your Majesty!

281
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,210
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

282
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,260
Your Majesty!

283
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,890
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

284
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,370
Your Majesty!

285
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,080
Your Majesty...

286
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,320
Due to recent tragic events,
the entire country has fallen into chaos.

287
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,280
So more than anything we must put
the people's anxieties to rest,

288
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,780
and focus our efforts
on dealing with the aftermath.

289
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,230
Going forward,
we must ensure the safety of our country

290
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,930
and to follow through
with our national policies.

291
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,580
There is wisdom in your words,
Your Majesty.

292
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,110
Furthermore, the sacrifice of all those
who lost their lives in this tragedy...

293
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,470
...shan't be forgotten.

294
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,040
As written in the Gongyang Zhuan,

295
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,010
"If a punishment does not fit the crime,"

296
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,100
"there is no way to discipline those
that commit wicked acts."

297
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,940
Therefore, we will thoroughly judge
between right and wrong,

298
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,310
and the innocent that have been imprisoned
will be released,

299
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,590
while those who have committed crimes...

300
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,140
...will serve a punishment
befitting their crimes.

301
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,220
Hence,

302
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,750
Princess Min Hwa's participation
in the sorcery on the Crown Princess

303
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,340
has caused her to give up her title
and be sentenced to slavery.

304
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,240
Her sentence will begin
after she gives birth.

305
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,850
After the child is born,

306
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,300
she will be expelled from the capital
and become a provincial slave.

307
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,430
As for Prince Consort Heo Yeom,

308
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,590
whose crime is his marriage
to criminal Princess Min Hwa,

309
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,670
I hereby order his marriage dissolved.

310
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,400
He shall relinquish his title
and all property associated with it.

311
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,750
Hence, he shall be demoted to the rank
he held before the marriage

312
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,560
and suspended
as an inactive ranking official.

313
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,800
-High Shaman.
-High Shaman.

314
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,180
For the crime of black sorcery,
High Shaman Jang Nok Young

315
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,500
should be accordingly sentenced
to be beheaded.

316
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,140
However, in consideration
of having spared the Crown Princess,

317
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,330
the decision will be discussed
after the memorial ceremony.

318
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,760
As you were previously informed,

319
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,020
we shall be holding a memorial ceremony,
so make preparations.

320
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,670
I shall be performing the ritual
by myself this time,

321
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,090
so there's no need for anything intricate.

322
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,280
I want to go with you.

323
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,080
You stay at the Seongsucheong.

324
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,250
You should stay, at least,
and protect this place.

325
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,750
I don't want to stay on my own.

326
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,320
Seol is gone.

327
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,680
And from now on seeing Wol
will be increasingly difficult.

328
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,060
Brother Yang Myung
has also departed this world.

329
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,030
If you're no longer here either...

330
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,190
Please don't go, Mistress.

331
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,470
Don't go and abandon me.

332
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
Seol...

333
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,990
...and Queen Dowager,

334
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,440
...Your Majesty The Queen,

335
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,740
Prince Yang Myung,

336
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,430
Director Heo.

337
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:00,080
I shall escort you all.

338
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,860
Heavens, I pledge the life left in
my sinful being as a sacrifice.

339
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,260
So I pray you cleanse this land
of all vengeful spirits.

340
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,990
I shall lock this land's demons
in my body,

341
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,480
and travel the path to the other world,

342
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,330
so for these poor souls

343
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,100
release their bitterness,
and allow them to sleep in peace.

344
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,150
As fortune would have it,

345
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,680
in my heavens now remains one sun
that embraces hope and one moon.

346
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,160
I pray you shine your glorious light
on all in this land...

347
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,420
...and fill them.

348
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,930
I pray you wash away the pain,

349
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,480
and may you all find happiness.

350
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,530
Mistress.

351
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,560
That's enough. You may all step out.

352
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,100
Forgive my impudence,
but before the hours between seven and...

353
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,420
I have asked you to leave, have I not?!

354
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,860
Then, your clothing...

355
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,510
Where are you about to put your hands?

356
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,950
Even the Queen
has not yet touched my body!

357
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,920
I shall be attended to by the Queen,
so you may all leave.

358
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,970
They have all left,
so please lift your head now.

359
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,610
Who are you?

360
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,060
Tell me.

361
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,560
What is your true identity?

362
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,020
I am...

363
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,330
...Your Majesty's woman
and a citizen of this country...

364
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,590
...Heo Yeon Woo.

365
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,380
Where are you going?

366
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,450
You can't catch me now!

367
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,560
Stop!

368
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,680
Brother.

369
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,290
Yes, Your Majesty?

370
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,350
Is there something you want to say to me?

371
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,590
Princess Min Hwa.

372
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,960
Has been released.

373
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,950
As she has paid the price for her crime,
His Majesty has sanctioned it.

374
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,350
And Court lady Min who stayed with her
has passed away recently.

375
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,980
If it is because
you feel remorseful towards me...

376
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,780
...you don't need to anymore.

377
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,110
It's not that.

378
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,480
More than anything, don't you think...

379
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,620
...a young child needs his mother?

380
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,260
Are you all right?

381
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,460
Our little Prince is always a strong one.

383
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,570
Your Majesty!

384
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,850
Prince.

385
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,830
You must have been happy today
with Eui visiting.

386
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,580
-Did you have fun playing?
-Yes, it was very enjoyable.

387
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,740
Woon, teach me to use the sword.

388
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,800
Look at you. Do you like Swordsman Woon
more than your own father?

389
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,980
Did you enjoy
a rare brother and sister afternoon?

390
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,320
And the lonely Prince was so happy
to have Eui's company.

392
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:12,100
It was so nice to see.

393
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,750
Eui, why didn't you go with the Prince?

394
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:20,130
I prefer books over swords.

395
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,570
How is it you are so like your father?

396
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,760
So dignified at such a young age.
He is just like you, Teacher.

397
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,910
Because all I know of are books,
it has turned out that way.

398
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,700
Seeing that our Prince
has a hearty, grand demeanor,

399
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,570
I think he resembles Yang Myung.

400
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,190
And there's his love for Woon, too.

401
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,720
As siblings generally take after each
other, he also resembles Your Majesty.

402
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,400
-Eui.
-Yes, Father.

403
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,910
Do you miss your mother?

404
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,040
Why do you ask that?

405
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:17,520
Earlier, you looked upon the Queen
and the Prince with envy, did you not?

406
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,080
Was I mistaken?

407
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,700
It's all right. You can speak frankly.

408
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,640
Are you the Queen's brother?

409
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,510
Yes, I am. Why do you ask?

410
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,300
Do you know Seol?

411
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,020
How do you know Seol?

412
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:03,170
Seol asks the same thing every day.

413
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,800
Always, "Is he happy?"

414
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,740
"Is the young master happy?"

415
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,770
"He must be happy".

416
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,470
She just repeats this every day.

417
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,620
Are you happy?

418
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,710
For agreeing to the release
of Princess Min Hwa...

419
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,190
...I can only thank you.

420
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,840
It is not something
you need to be grateful for.

421
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,080
After you refused several times...

422
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:04,060
...and I continued to make the request,
did that, perhaps, upset you?

423
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,550
I know your requests for Min Hwa's release
was for my sake and your brother's.

424
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,970
How could I be angry?

425
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,630
Rather, it's something
I should be grateful for.

426
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,690
-Your Majesty.
-Yes, please speak.

427
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,980
Actually, to express my gratitude...

428
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,750
...I have hidden a gift for Your Majesty
somewhere in this room.

429
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,350
A gift...

430
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,450
Yes.

431
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,860
I have many things to read today,
so I must go.

432
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,150
But you can read
the appeals here, as well.

433
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,770
Ah, that's right.

434
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,540
It's an appeal
I must review in my quarters.

435
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,340
Please sleep well, My Queen.

436
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:11,480
That's strange.
When he comes to the Queen's quarters,

437
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,950
he never thinks of leaving
until the Chief Attendant comes for him.

438
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,720
-What do you think is going on?
-You're right.

439
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,080
The King and Queen have enjoyed
nothing but conjugal harmony up to now.

440
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,240
Do you think he's already bored with her?

441
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:29,950
You don't think he has another woman
hidden in his quarters, do you?

442
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,570
It couldn't be!

443
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,900
Are you ready?

444
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,010
Yes.

445
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,730
Then, come out.

446
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:18,370
She is a gayageum master, Shin Jong Yeon.

447
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,660
There isn't much time
before the Queen's birthday.

448
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,550
So If I'm to show my skills with pride
before the Queen,

449
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,420
you will need to give me
intensive training.

450
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,380
I shall do everything in my power.

451
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,690
As I tend to learn most things quickly,
it should not be difficult.

452
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,300
What is wrong with this instrument?!

453
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,780
Bring me a different one at once!

454
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,080
Then, let me check it for you.

455
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,080
There is absolutely nothing wrong
with the instrument.

456
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,500
When did you learn
how to play the gayageum?

457
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,260
I didn't specifically learn separately.

458
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,150
I just watched over your shoulder
as you had your lessons,

459
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,170
and when I was bored...

460
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,330
...I just practised a bit.

461
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,980
W... when you were bored?

462
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,670
Turn around and stand
so I can't see your face.

463
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:45,870
His Majesty has freed me from slavery.

464
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,220
But I had nowhere to go.

465
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,110
For one final time...

466
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:05,010
...I wanted to see you.

467
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,060
I wanted to see you so much...

468
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,740
...I was just going to look
from a distance and leave.

469
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,610
Mother?

470
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,870
I won't ever come again.

471
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,440
I won't even hide and look.

472
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,620
So...

473
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,320
...please forgive me this once.

474
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,480
I didn't think...

475
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,040
...you would forgive me.

476
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
I was not going to forgive you.

477
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,760
Punishing myself that way...

478
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,370
...I intended not to forgive you.

479
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,720
But now, I want to be happy.

480
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,290
For our Eui's sake, and for the sake
of a poor girl who even in death...

481
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,410
...wishes for someone else's happiness.

482
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:46,390
Did you carry out my order as commanded?

483
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,830
Yes. According to the Queen's wishes,

484
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,430
instead of putting on a birthday banquet,

485
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,400
the expenses were sent
to the sick ward for relief funds.

486
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,080
Right. Well done.

487
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,600
How are the conditions in the sick ward?

488
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,090
As the Queen is providing a role model,

489
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,290
many of the officials' wives
are collecting funds for...

490
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,160
Your Majesty?

491
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,170
Your Majesty.

492
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:21,990
Is there something you are fretting over?

493
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,850
It's nothing.

494
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,320
Your Majesty. It's Court Lady Choi.

495
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,500
Enter.

496
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,720
Your Majesty, there is a royal order
for you to head to Hidden Moon Pavilion.

497
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,110
The Hidden Moon Pavilion?

498
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,120
Please sit here, Your Majesty.

499
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,030
Felicitations on your birthday.

500
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,820
For your birthday,
I've prepared a performance.

501
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:46,220
My skills are inadequate,
but I hope you enjoy it.

502
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,450
Are you all right?

503
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,530
Focus only on me. Only on me.

504
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,240
As my gift was so unsatisfactory,
were you disappointed?

505
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,560
No. It was amusing.

506
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,170
I didn't prepare it to be amusing.

507
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:16,260
Then, I shall give you something else.

508
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,160
Perhaps, will there be petals
falling from the roof?

509
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,430
Hyung Sun has gotten too old
to be climbing on the roof now.

510
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,630
Then, perhaps,
will fireworks explode in the skies?

511
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,330
How could I possibly waste
the nation's funds to win a woman's heart?

512
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,530
However...

513
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,560
...I'll give you something better instead.

514
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,270
Yeon Woo, Yeon Woo...

515
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,970
Yeon Woo, I have truly come to find you.

516
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:19,750
Did you not give me your heart?

517
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,060
From now on,

518
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,550
I shall protect you at your side.

519
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:26,890
It's fine if everyone becomes
one of the Crown Prince's people.

520
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,950
Heo Yeon Woo, as long as you alone say
you'll be mine.

521
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:33,470
Come close. Come closer.

522
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,400
Finally now, the two of us become one.

523
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,670
Did you ask me to forget you?
Do you want me to forget you?

524
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,460
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

525
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,750
Though I tried to forget,
I cannot forget you.
