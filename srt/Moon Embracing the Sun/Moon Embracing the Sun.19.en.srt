1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,210
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,670
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,650
Episode 19

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,800
But...

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,860
Yes?

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,120
I gave myself to you.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,730
Is there anything coming to me in return?

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,400
Well, it's just that
I do not have anything to give.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,100
Is there perhaps
something in particular you want?

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,030
That...

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,070
I kind of want to do that.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,440
I'm not sure
I know what you are referring to...

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,660
What I mean is...

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,700
You know, that.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,060
What you were doing
at the sick ward with Hyungnim...

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,800
...with sticks about this long.

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,820
If we are successful
in overthrowing the King,

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,670
you will hold both in your hands.

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,820
But, I find something unconvincing.

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,080
What is it?

21
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,650
It's not so difficult for me
to give up my role as a libertine.

22
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,770
But, your role as King's father-in-law
cannot possibly be easy to give up.

23
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,180
I have no intention
of giving up that position.

24
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,180
It is my understanding
that you have only one daughter.

25
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,190
If necessary, at any time,
another can appear.

26
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,400
For the first time,
I feel sorry for the Queen.

27
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,770
You're willing to cast aside a daughter,
yet you won't betray me?

28
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,220
How are you going to assure me of that?

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,750
Are you testing me?

30
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,320
You tested me first, so I'm left
with no choice but to test you as well.

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,340
No agreement is without stakes
and interests.

32
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,390
I've shown you my hand,
now it is your turn to show me yours.

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,270
Being rewarded for your service
in this restoration is a given.

34
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,920
So, what else is there?

35
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,140
The restoration of our previously held
power of veto.

36
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,070
Power of veto, you say?

37
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,970
That is quite an effective strategy
to keep the King in check.

38
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,670
Let me consider it.

39
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,860
However, the Heo Yeon Woo
matter isn't acceptable.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,680
If a dethroned King's woman is made Queen,

41
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,450
there will be backlash
from the Confucian scholars.

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,730
Treasured objects
can be hidden away and enjoyed.

43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,340
Wouldn't that be better?

44
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,660
If one wants special privileges
from the King,

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,940
he should agree to certain conditions.

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,250
Fine.

47
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,310
I shall align myself with you,
Chief Councilor.

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,030
You'd like to live in the palace?

49
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,720
Then, would you like
to take a look around?

50
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,800
Father.

51
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,260
Are you truly intending to cast aside
His Majesty and me?

52
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,360
No. No!

53
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,640
Your Majesty.

54
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,280
Where are you going at this late hour?

55
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,440
His Majesty is in danger.

56
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,480
I have to tell him he's in danger.

57
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,660
Your Majesty!

58
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,140
-What does that say?
-That's what I want to know!

59
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,590
This side says
His Majesty kept a shaman at his side.

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,540
And that side says

61
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,810
the Yoo clan quietly eliminated
the Crown Princess long ago.

62
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,110
So, which side is the truth?

63
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,310
For some reason, this one bothers me more.

64
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,390
But, the story's going around that
the Crown Princess that died

65
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,290
has returned, well and alive,
eight years later.

66
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,730
Shut up, you fool!

67
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,520
Even stories have their limits.

68
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,500
How can a dead person come back to life?!

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,890
Still, I'd like it if that were true.

70
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,170
That maternal clan is an annoying mess
with their all or nothing dealings.

71
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,650
If that dead Crown Princess
came back to life

72
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,540
and flipped over this dog's life of ours
like she were flipping over a game board,

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,080
how great would that be?!

74
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,350
So, the story is...

75
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,500
That shaman isn't really a shaman,
but the dead Crown Princess.

76
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,380
Then what?!

77
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,770
Then the current Queen
has been sitting in someone else's place

78
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,360
and acting as Queen for all these years?!

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,090
Why that...

80
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,600
...what kind of travesty...

81
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,490
The person who posted the notice,
obviously,

82
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,060
but also all those who recklessly chatter
with their treacherous tongues

83
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,410
should be captured
and justifiably punished!

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,130
That is so.

85
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,020
The fact that Maiden Heo
died of illness is self-evident.

86
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,050
The undercurrent of gossip
conjecturing that she was assassinated

87
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,430
is the act of treacherous plotters

88
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,190
to besmirch the royal family
and this country, undoubtedly.

89
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,760
The Chief Royal Secretary's words
are absolutely in the right.

90
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,910
The root sources
must be immediately eradicated

91
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,600
and shown how strict our laws are.

92
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,150
I have fully grasped your earnestness.

93
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,490
However...

94
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,210
...none of you seem very concerned
about the posted notices regarding me.

95
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,320
I feel a little disappointed.

96
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,170
It was written that the King was wrapped
in the skirt of a strange shaman.

97
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,820
Slanderous rumors are running rampant,
accusing me of neglecting state affairs.

98
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,150
Why are you all watching the fire
from the opposite bank of the river?

99
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,450
Are you, perhaps, saying
that you agree with such accusations?

100
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,200
What an utterly unjust thing to say...

101
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,840
Or if not, were you directly trying
to manipulate public opinion?

102
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,490
Oh dear. Are you all right?

103
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,230
I just said that in jest.

104
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,860
I saw that child in the palace, Father.

105
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,230
Are you bringing that up again?

106
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,330
Did you call me in here to listen
to your self-indulgent whining?

107
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,600
It's not self-indulgent whining.

108
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
And it wasn't a hallucination.

109
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,790
I am certain that child is in the palace.

110
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,220
Whether that child is alive or dead,
regardless of where she is...

111
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,220
...it doesn't matter at all anymore.

112
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,210
What do you mean
it doesn't matter at all anymore?

113
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,240
What on earth are you scheming, Father?

114
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,490
I'm sorry, but your subject
has some urgent matters to attend to.

115
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,560
So, I shall leave now.

116
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,390
If His Majesty and my father
both intend to cast me aside...

117
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,170
...I have no choice
but to protect this position myself.

118
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,520
Court Lady Jo.

119
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,320
Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,410
Immediately go and bring me shaman Kwon

121
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,080
who was once temporary
High Shaman of the Seongsucheong.

122
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,920
Excuse me?

123
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,000
Why do you want to see her?

124
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,510
If I tell you to bring her, you bring her.
Why do you talk so much?

125
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,700
I shall carry out your command.

126
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,960
I had no choice but to follow
the Queen Dowager's orders.

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,800
And I also could not ignore my friend's
dying wish to protect you.

128
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,540
These days, you are rather
unreserved, are you not?

129
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,640
I see that you are now just openly
inspecting my face.

130
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,860
Your Majesty.

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,910
What is it?

132
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:57,350
Forgive me, but dare I make an entreaty?

133
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,790
Did you say an entreaty?

134
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,470
Speak, I shall comply
with whatever you ask.

135
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,830
I'd like to see...

136
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,570
...the mistress.

137
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,350
She is the person
who drove you to the brink of death.

138
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,120
Why do you ask to see a criminal?

139
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,660
However, she is also the
person who saved my life.

140
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,770
How grateful you must be.

141
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,100
So then, are you saying
you shall consider her your savior?

142
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,100
Every time I look upon your face,
I feel grateful...

143
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,950
...that I'm alive.

144
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,860
The reason I can sit here and
look upon your face, in any case...

145
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,610
...is because the mistress
saved my life, is it not?

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,060
She will not be able to avoid
being convicted for her crimes,

147
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,760
but before then,
I'd need to see her at least once

148
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,010
and reconcile my feelings and attachments
developed over eight years.

149
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,070
Please grant me permission.

150
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,600
Why have you called
for your lowly subject?

151
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,390
Have you ever seen
Shaman Jang's successor?

152
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,240
Yes, I have seen her.

153
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,170
Then, with your divine powers,

154
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,970
can you perform
black sorcery on that girl?

155
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,620
Answer me.

156
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
Can you perform black sorcery?

157
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,000
That isn't completely impossible.

158
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,490
But there are a number of conditions.

159
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,640
Conditions?

160
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,010
We must be certain of the girl's location,

161
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,230
and it cannot be too far away.

162
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,940
And if she were in the palace,
would it be possible?

163
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,770
It is impossible
to get rid of her immediately,

164
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,320
but we can curse her with pain
as was done to His Majesty before.

165
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,010
Then you were responsible
for that incident?

166
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,280
I've committed a sin worthy of death.

167
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,310
But, I was only following the orders
of the Chief Councilor!

168
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,760
Father...

169
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,190
Never mind.

170
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,690
That is in the past,
and I shall not reproach you for it.

171
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,890
However, if it is impossible to kill her.

172
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,860
You will need to give her
the most unbearable pain possible.

173
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,000
I shall put all of my power into it.

174
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,050
However...

175
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,730
However?

176
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,210
A curse that creates such deathly pain
requires a powerful offering.

177
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,210
If a pure virgin with an intense desire
is provided as an offering...

178
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,530
...it can even bring about death
shortly afterwards.

179
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,330
If an offering is made...

180
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
...it can even bring about death, you say.

181
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,620
It's blood.

182
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,650
Are you Jang Nok Young?

183
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,790
Yes, I am.

184
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,250
Are you going somewhere?

185
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,400
While I'm gone,

186
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,070
don't even think of stepping out
into the northern district.

187
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,780
Are Seol and Jan Shil well?

188
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,690
Yes, they are doing well.

189
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,220
And you, Mistress, have you been well?

190
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,760
How can you address
this lowly subject as Mistress?

191
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,650
You told me in the prison...

192
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,170
...that you had
a very close friend long ago.

193
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,710
And that her final request
was that you should look after me.

194
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,920
That is so.

195
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,290
Who was she to me?

196
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,620
All I know is...

197
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,770
...that before you were even born,

198
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,620
she formed a connection with your mother
due to your mother's act of kindness.

199
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,990
Did you say my mother's act of kindness?

200
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,930
Yes, that is so.

201
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,470
Ultimately, the person who saved your life

202
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,350
was not I nor my friend,

203
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,120
but your mother.

204
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:51,220
I believe that
you were trying to protect me.

205
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,880
I have not completely forgiven you yet,
but I do understand.

206
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,110
Because after I knew,
even I remained silent.

207
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,490
It's just that...

208
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,080
...before it's too late.

209
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,000
There is one thing
that I just really wanted to say to you.

210
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,150
Thank you.

211
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,610
For saving my life, thank you.

212
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,480
For taking me in, for raising me,

213
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,020
for protecting me.

214
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,290
Thank you.

215
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,290
For being a mother to me...

216
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,380
...for the last eight years.

217
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,660
Thank you.

218
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,670
Have you prepared
an offering as I described?

219
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,280
Where did you put her?

220
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,600
I, myself, shall be the offering.

221
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,990
This evening, a curse will be directed
at the King's quarters.

222
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,250
It's not a curse
directed at His Majesty, is it?

223
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,720
No, it is not.

224
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,800
That curse will be directed at you, Miss.

225
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,000
If there is any chance that His Majesty
will be endangered because of me...

226
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,830
I will block it.

227
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,080
I will stake my life and block it.

228
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,170
Evil energy,

229
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,700
back to the owner of the talisman
you shall return!

230
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,250
I suppose you think
you've done nothing wrong.

231
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,660
I suppose you think you are just a victim.

232
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,980
But you are wrong.

233
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,660
The crime of remaining silent
even when you knew the truth.

234
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,800
The crime of abetting a death.

235
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,210
The crime of coveting a position
that isn't yours!

236
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,870
Deceiving the King,

237
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,340
and the crime of casting aside
the final chance of repentance like this!

238
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,710
Those are precisely your crimes.

239
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,670
That's not so!

240
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,040
Court lady Jo! Court lady Jo!

241
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,440
Get her out of here, quickly.

242
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,550
Quickly!

243
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,820
I suppose you think
you've done nothing wrong.

244
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,250
I suppose you think
you are just a victim.

245
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,740
-But you are wrong.
-Are you going to kill Yeon Woo?

246
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,630
The crime of remaining silent
even when you knew the truth.

247
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,390
The crime of abetting a death.

248
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,900
The crime of coveting a position
that isn't yours!

249
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,680
Deceiving the King,

250
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,270
and casting aside the final chance
of repentance like this!

251
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,750
Those are precisely your crimes.

252
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,090
Must you go, Mother?

253
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,150
I told you I want to go and pray
for the Princess's pregnancy.

254
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,760
And while I stay
at the temple for a few days,

255
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,700
I think I shall pray also for Yeon Woo's
easy passage into eternity.

256
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,260
Mother.

257
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,990
It's just that before
a new life is born...

258
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,300
...I want to peacefully send off
those who have departed.

259
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,110
If I continue to hang onto
our Yeon Woo's shadow,

260
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,040
I feel it will be a worry
to the expecting Princess.

261
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,510
When I was pregnant with our Yeon Woo.

262
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,240
Your father was in Ming China
as an envoy.

263
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,090
Even though I knew he had no choice,

264
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,200
for some reason, I was still disappointed.

265
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:37,300
So, Yeom, please stay beside the
Princess and look after her well.

266
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,990
I shall.

267
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,800
My Lord.

268
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,060
What is it?

269
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,310
Have you, by chance, heard that rumor?

270
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,250
What rumor are you speaking of?

271
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,710
That is...

272
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,340
...about the late Miss Yeon Woo...

273
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,870
What about our Yeon Woo?

274
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,180
A strange rumor
is going around these days.

275
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,380
It is that...

276
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,150
...the rumor is that the lady's death
eight years ago...

277
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,110
...was the deed of the late King's
maternal clan.

278
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,710
What are you talking about?

279
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,460
That's not all.

280
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,480
There's another rumor
that the lady may be alive.

281
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,330
As it was,

282
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,170
there was something from eight years ago
that was bothering me.

283
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,320
What do you mean bothering you?

284
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,530
I already told that other lord
who was asking questions,

285
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,140
but the day after the lady's funeral,
I had gone to the grave,

286
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,210
and there were signs
that it had been dug up.

287
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,200
What?

288
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,760
And so that maiden Madam saw
may truly be Miss Yeon Woo...

289
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,050
My Lord, are you all right?

290
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,820
Isn't this a letter?

291
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
Who on earth would...

292
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,010
Prince Consort.

293
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,600
Are you aware that your sister's death
was not due to illness?

294
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:39,300
Are you aware that eight years ago,
Princess Minhwa, who wanted to have you,

295
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,560
participated in the black sorcery
that killed your sister?

296
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,880
Furthermore,

297
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:50,380
are you aware that the late King
was the one who covered up her death?

298
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:57,090
But, do you have a wife?

299
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,710
I am still unmarried.

300
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,500
Then, what about a betrothal?

301
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,090
Do you have a betrothed?

302
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,550
Forgive me, Husband.

303
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,240
Forgive you for what?

304
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,650
Everything.

305
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,100
All of it.

306
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,390
Husband.

307
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,080
The peace you've enjoyed over the years

308
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,170
was but a sand castle
built on top of your sister's corpse.

309
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,680
So what do you plan to do?

310
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,550
Husband, why don't you come and sit?
Why do you stand there like that?

311
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,650
I was making a jacket for the baby.

312
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,420
It is so small.
Isn't it cute in its miniature form?

313
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,140
I shall truly...

314
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,610
...raise this child well.

315
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:25,490
Just like you, a clever and handsome boy.

316
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,360
Did you want to have me?

317
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,310
Excuse me?

318
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,680
What part of me...

319
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,010
...did you want to have?

320
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,840
And so now...

321
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,290
...what part of me do you have?

322
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,770
What part of me...

323
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,080
...did you want to have so badly?

324
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,040
If it's not true,
insist to the very end that it's not true.

325
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,390
Say that I'm wrong.

326
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,570
That I'm foolish and have misunderstood.

327
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,370
Forgive me.

328
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,320
Husband.

329
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,970
Please forgive me!

330
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,700
How?

331
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,830
How?!

332
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,860
All those years...

333
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,080
...you deceived me,
you deceived my mother...

334
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,810
...my sister!

335
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,390
I was going to tell you.

336
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,060
I was going to tell you...

337
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,580
...but after I saw how happy
you were about the news of the baby,

338
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,510
I couldn't...
I just couldn't form the words.

339
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,280
The moment I said anything,
I feared your child...

340
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,690
...would also then become a criminal.

341
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,680
It would be the child of the
Princess that killed my sister.

342
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,500
But, I am but a criminal myself.

343
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,050
Because of me, you killed my sister.

344
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,430
So, I am a criminal as well.

345
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,010
And not knowing that...

346
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,360
...I loved you...

347
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,720
...I am a criminal as well.

348
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,810
In reward for killing my sister,
I've been living in comfort.

349
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,830
I am a bigger criminal!

350
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,550
No!

351
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,320
I'm the criminal!

352
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,270
You and the baby have committed no crime.

353
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,700
You can reproach me, badmouth me,

354
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,550
but please don't blame yourself.

355
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,150
Please don't...

356
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,900
...turn your back on your child.

357
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,670
By now, the Prince Consort
probably knows everything, right?

358
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,970
When you think about it,

359
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,390
you can never know
what's going on inside a female.

360
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,620
The princess, who seemed so innocent,
doing something so immensely evil.

361
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,860
Who could have even imagined?

362
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,010
Now that he knows the truth,

363
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,810
with his character,
he won't just sit and let it be.

364
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,820
He might just take his own life
to make up for his sins.

365
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,070
How nice it would be
if he would do that for us,

366
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,170
but if he were to appeal to the King,
he may eke out a living.

367
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,320
If that's the case,
we have no choice but to eliminate him.

368
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,320
Who is out there?

369
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,990
Seol.

370
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,360
I will take care of this, so Young Master,
you should go inside.

371
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,970
I cannot do that.

372
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,430
How could I let a girl...

373
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,460
Seol. Seol!

374
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,590
Wake up. Seol! Seol!

375
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,190
Seol. Seol.

376
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,210
Seol.

377
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,680
Wake up, will you?

378
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,870
Seol!

379
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,500
Miss Yeon Woo...

380
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,710
...is alive.

381
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,380
While you were gone...

382
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,850
...you asked me...

383
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,200
...to protect her, didn't you?

384
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,750
I'm sorry.

385
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,180
I wanted to...

386
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,680
...protect her to the end...

387
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:51,120
...but forgive me for leaving like this,
Young Master.

388
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,410
Stop saying such things.

389
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,930
Seol, to think...

390
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,390
...that you were always
by our Yeon Woo's side.

391
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,820
How grateful I am for that.

392
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,800
I placed too great a burden...

393
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,810
...on such a small frame.

394
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,490
Please don't say you're sorry.

395
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:26,590
When I first came to your home,
instead of "you wench..."

396
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,060
...I was given the name Seol.

397
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,940
You gave me my name, Young Master.

398
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,390
From that day until this moment...

399
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,870
...even though I knew I shouldn't...

400
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,730
...I held you, precious Young Master...

401
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,820
...in my lowliest of lowly hearts.

402
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:08,540
I have always been sorry for doing so.

403
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,890
Forgive me.

404
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,890
What do you mean you are sorry?

405
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,540
What do you mean forgive you?

406
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,910
What am I to do?

407
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,170
What on earth am I anyway?!

408
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,820
That you would throw your life away?

409
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,670
Young Master, it is due to
you that I became a person,

410
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,200
that I became a woman,
and that I became Seol.

411
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,800
Though it has been a short life,
right now,

412
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,950
I'm happier than any
other woman in this world.

413
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,780
So, Young Master...

414
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,910
...please, be happy too.

415
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,770
Seol. Seol!

416
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,410
Seol!

417
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,350
Seol.

418
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,990
Seol!

419
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,350
Seol!

420
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,190
Mistress.

421
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,540
I think that Seol...

422
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,240
...might have died.

423
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,430
She keeps telling me to be well.

424
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,240
And she says to thank you as well.

425
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,180
She says she is happy...

426
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,640
...so we should be happy and live well.

427
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,970
You wretched girl.

428
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,790
At long last, you hold your flame
against your heart as you go.

429
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,600
So, are you happy now?

430
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,150
Yes, I'm happy.

431
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,920
For a slave girl's fate, it was a
pretty good life, don't you think?

432
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,790
I've taken the Princess
and the Prince Consort...

433
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,920
...to a safe place for the time being.

434
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,840
I see I was a step late.

435
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,780
Were there any innocent people
that were sacrificed?

436
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:29,300
The girl named Seol
had to sacrifice her life.

437
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,560
In order to protect the Prince Consort,

438
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,090
it appears she faced off
against the killers alone.

439
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,250
Send someone to Onyang Palace.

440
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,770
The Queen Dowager is in danger.

441
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,150
Yoon Dae Hyung, you jerk!

442
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,750
How dare you...

443
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,940
Your Majesty.

444
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,250
Did you come to get your grandmother?

445
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,020
Come now, come and...

446
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,380
Your Majesty.

447
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,900
Your Majesty, all of it...

448
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,010
...was for your sake.

449
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:10,770
How can you not recognize
your grandmother's true intentions?

450
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,120
Your Majesty!

451
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,790
No!

452
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,570
No, you cannot...

453
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,300
No!

454
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,530
No, you cannot...

455
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,670
Truly, you cannot do this...

456
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,510
Eight years ago!

457
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,230
The crime of killing
the Crown Princess through sorcery!

458
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,410
Also, the crime of having your
granddaughter participate in it!

459
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,890
Why do you think
I've been silent for this long?!

460
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,120
I couldn't exonerate Prince Ui Seong
even when I later found out the truth...

461
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,150
For whom do you think I kept quiet?!

462
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,450
I have fulfilled my filial duty
in keeping silent for 13 years.

463
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,100
So do not desire anything more.

464
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,590
Now that we've eliminated the old fox,
who could possibly stop us?

465
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,630
However, public sentiment
is becoming a grave matter.

466
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,800
Because of this talk of restoration,
commotion among the people is growing.

467
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,640
Even the Confucian scholars
have started to become suspicious.

468
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,570
At this rate, even if the insurrection is
successful, we may lose public support.

469
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,860
Then, I suppose
we must move up the insurrection.

470
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,940
When you say move up the insurrection,
do you have some alternative plan?

471
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,510
Before strange rumors
start to cloud our moral justification,

472
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm saying let's make it happen.

473
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,670
If public sentiment is against us,

474
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,010
then dethroning the King is nothing more
than the bloodshed of power.

475
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,610
Thankfully, I have the capacity
to move public sentiment...

476
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,520
When you say public sentiment...

477
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,500
Have you not heard of my reputation
in connection with the sick ward?

478
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,730
The Confucian healer who doesn't regard
a patient's social ranking.

479
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,830
This is why people
need to collect good deeds.

480
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,940
Who knew that situation
would become so useful?

481
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,240
If we are successful
in overthrowing the King,

482
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,500
it will probably
be recorded in history like this.

483
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,930
"Blinded by desire for a poor shaman,
disregarding affairs of the state,"

484
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,510
"the shameless knave
who tyrannized this country."

485
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:04,730
"Was deposed by the appearance
of a new King on the side of the people."

486
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,810
Tonight, I shall expect a proper meeting.

487
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,930
It is all right to cry
as much as you want.

488
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,500
I...

489
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,430
...don't even have the right to cry.

490
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,680
That child constantly, invariably,
protected me at my side.

491
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,100
But, I wasn't able to protect her.

492
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,710
Was she someone very dear to you?

493
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,240
She was a companion, my family...

494
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,630
No... she was more than that.

495
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,170
I suppose she would have been.

496
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,480
To have given up her life for her master.

497
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:28,970
I just can't understand
why she or my brother...

498
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,640
...had to be in danger.

499
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,390
What on earth is power anyway?

500
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,180
What constitutes
a justifiable greater cause?

501
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,220
Why do innocent people
have to shed their blood?

502
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,190
Just as you have lost someone dear to you.

503
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,500
I have lost an innocent citizen.

504
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,540
Therefore, I will not stop.

505
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,420
So that innocent lives will
never again be sacrificed.

506
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,360
I will stop this repeating cycle
of vile treachery.

507
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,510
I will stop it at all cost.

508
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,870
There are quite a few familiar faces.

509
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,190
Why do you laugh?

510
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,920
I just find it amusing.

511
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,580
Who would have ever thought

512
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,740
that this infamous libertine
could dare dream of coming into power?

513
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,020
What kind of unfounded remark is that?

514
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,790
All of us gathered here
all believe the rightful ruler

515
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,400
is undoubtedly Prince Yang Myung.

516
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,560
Enough of that.

517
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,020
So, when is the insurrection?

518
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,980
In my opinion, I am considering
the upcoming hunting ceremony.

519
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,020
Hunting ceremony?

520
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,960
That sounds good.

521
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,090
However...

522
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,650
...the insurrection will not take place
at the hunting grounds.

523
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,700
It will take place in the palace.

524
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,000
So the palace
will become the hunting grounds?

525
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,260
Only, the prey...

526
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,820
...will be the King, I suppose.

527
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,130
Yang Myung

528
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:54,990
What is this?

529
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,880
Those who believe in me and intend to
go forward with me, write your name.

530
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,610
Although right now
it is only a blank book,

531
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,840
one day in the future,
when I am seated on the throne,

532
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,370
for the meritorious subjects
who orchestrated the change in power.

533
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
This will become a record
of their contribution.

534
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:44,320
Yoon Dae Hyung

535
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,520
Is the planning
for tomorrow's ceremony going smoothly?

536
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:14,470
We have marked the boundaries
of the hunting ground.

538
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,370
And we have taken measures
to prohibit shooting

539
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,940
and wood cutting in the area.

540
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,910
Perhaps because it has been a long time
since the last ceremony,

541
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,690
I am greatly looking forward to it.

542
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,910
There will also be a jester
to stimulate the entertainment.

543
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,790
So there will be no shortage of merriment.

544
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,190
But the purpose of a hunting ceremony...

545
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,880
...is not necessarily
just for merriment, is it?

546
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,760
In addition to being
a military tactics exercise,

547
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,260
this ceremony will particularly serve

548
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,220
to establish solidarity between
the city and the outer villages.

549
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,600
Do not fail to note this.

550
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,500
We shall keep it in mind.

551
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:51,840
Furthermore,

552
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,910
who will become the hunter
and who will become the hunted?

553
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,410
It will be a one-round showdown
to determine the answer.

554
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,020
Ah, Minister of Military Affairs.

555
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,550
How many capital guards?

556
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:08,320
As you have ordered a reduction in volume,

557
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,230
200 will participate.

558
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,630
How many capital guards
will be mobilized that day?

559
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,230
His Majesty has ordered
a reduction to 200.

560
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,980
I've added 100 to that,
so 300 will head to the hunting ground.

561
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:27,300
Then, the palace and the capital garrison
will be weakened.

562
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,690
On that day,

563
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,290
His Majesty will head to Jongmyo
for the initiation ceremony.

564
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,920
As dictated by my status of royal family,
I will follow behind.

565
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,290
That is the moment we must aim for.

566
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,170
The moment the palace gates open
to let out the group headed for Jongmyo.

567
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,070
The Minister of Military Affairs
will lead the charge to the palace.

568
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,070
So, the soldiers
will be assembled at dawn,

569
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,040
and I will take them
to the hunting grounds first.

570
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,180
Earlier, I was concerned that
you might be on the verge of ill will,

571
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,550
but it seems the ceremony
will be an enjoyable event after all.

572
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,820
All of you, please feel free to exhibit
the hunting skills you have honed.

573
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,590
Particularly, I look forward
to your performance, Chief Councilor.

574
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,790
Undoubtedly.

575
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,400
I will make certain
you are not disappointed.

576
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,050
Please prepare yourself to go out.

577
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,590
Where am I going?

578
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:49,510
There will be a hunting ceremony tomorrow.

579
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,300
I have heard.

580
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,430
It isn't very far away,

581
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,700
but I shall not
be able to return immediately.

582
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,530
So, I think it would be good

583
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,570
if you temporarily stayed somewhere else
where it was safe.

584
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,480
Must I?

585
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,050
What are you going to do alone
in these chambers?

586
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:17,440
It bothers me to leave you here alone,
so please won't you do as I ask?

587
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,720
I shall.

588
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,160
Wherever you are,

589
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,780
as long as Your Majesty
is safe and healthy,

590
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,460
there is nothing more I can wish for.

591
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,040
Whatever it may be,

592
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,140
if you can fulfill your objective,

593
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,040
there is nothing more I can hope for.

594
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,210
I pray

595
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,210
that you will fulfill your objective.

596
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
I shall.

597
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,950
I pray

598
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,700
you return safely.

599
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,190
I shall.

600
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,830
Absolutely.

601
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,680
See?

602
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,700
What did I say?

603
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,900
That moon.

604
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,140
Did I not say that
it would follow me wherever I went?

605
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,940
Let me ask you one thing.

606
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,590
Have you come by royal order,

607
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,370
or is it as a friend.

608
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,900
I've come as a friend.

609
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,870
A friend, you say.

610
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,290
Friend is a really nice word.

611
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,800
Let me ask you one thing.

612
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,300
You've already asked one thing.

613
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,740
Your attempts at humor are dismal.

614
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,360
Then, let me ask you one more thing.

615
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,110
Please go ahead and ask.

616
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:29,220
Do you still consider me a friend?

617
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,710
I have considered you so up to now,

618
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,590
and I will continue to in the future.

619
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:38,590
Then,

620
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,770
whatever decision I may make,

621
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,460
whatever I may do,

622
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,710
will you remain my friend to the end?

623
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,480
Why do you ask that?

624
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,020
No,

625
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,180
I don't need you to answer.

626
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,580
Regardless of your answer,

627
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,350
my decision will not change.

628
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,990
Just...

629
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,470
how is it that we have ended up like this?

630
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,730
I find myself wondering.

631
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:56,420
The royal family and high officials
are prepared and waiting.

632
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:01,530
It is now time to leave for Jongmyo.

633
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,980
All right. I understand.

634
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:06,930
Your Majesty.

635
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,020
It has been an honor

636
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,090
to have been able to serve you.

637
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,660
Why do you speak
as if you were about to die?

638
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,350
I pray...

639
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,240
...you stay safe and healthy.

640
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,340
Do not worry.

641
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,950
I have not lived
enduring these long years for nothing.

642
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,010
Woon.

643
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,550
Are you prepared?

644
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,520
If my liege commands, I always am.

645
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:07,070
His Majesty, the King, approaches!

646
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,670
Now, the time has come.

647
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:29,940
Soon, everything shall return
to its rightful place.

648
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:07,470
His Majesty coming to the courtyard
will be your signal,

649
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,330
after which the palace gates will open.

650
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,780
As His Majesty leads the procession...

651
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,390
...and heads towards Jongmyo,
at that very moment...

652
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,770
...the insurrection begins.

653
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,310
Move out!

654
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,350
As dictated by my status
of royal family, I will follow behind.

655
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,900
That is the moment we must aim for.

656
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,360
The moment the palace gates open
to let out the entourage.

657
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,150
Though the sun lives in the heavens,

658
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:09,420
the heavens have abandoned the sun!

659
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,510
So, I have come to inform you that the
will of the heavens have shifted...

660
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,920
...and a revolution is in motion.
