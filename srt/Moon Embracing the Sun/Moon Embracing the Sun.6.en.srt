1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,960
This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,000
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historical basis.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,530
Episode 6

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,090
In the Chief Scholar's arms,
as though she were falling asleep...

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,300
Your Highness.

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,260
You cannot, Your Highness.

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,330
The Queen Mother has ordered
that you stay in the East Palace all day.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,840
Let go. Let go.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,140
Let go, I say.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,370
Let go!

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,190
They say the King is the sun
and the Queen is the moon.

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,250
This Phoenix hairpin holds
a white moon embracing a crimson sun.

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,310
So I've named it,
"The Moon that Embraces the Sun."

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,830
Yeon Woo!

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,700
Let go.

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,200
I still have things to tell her.

17
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,490
Yeon Woo!

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,680
-Yeon Woo!
-Mother.

19
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,390
-My child!
-Mother.

20
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,700
My child!

21
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,100
My child!

22
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,450
Mother. Please get up.

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,560
Yeon Woo! My child.

24
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,340
You've come home.

25
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,470
You've come.

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,190
You'll be moving in the Crown Princess's
quarters shortly. Be prepared.

27
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,840
Crown Princess's quarters?

28
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,360
Then, is our Bo Kyung
going to be the Crown Princess?

29
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,790
Has she died?

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,630
Did you kill her?

31
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,360
She departed this world today.

32
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,870
Did you say you wanted
to win the Crown Prince's heart?

33
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,680
Then, from this moment on...

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,570
...forget petty emotions
like compassion and guilt.

35
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,170
Remember the humiliation you felt
when what was yours was taken away.

36
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,810
Without that sort of determination,
don't ever covet that position again.

37
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,280
The Crown Princess.

38
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,660
Everything is my fault.

39
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,800
It is not your fault, Your Highness.

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,430
Whatever may happen...

41
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,970
...do not blame yourself.

42
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,220
Hyungnim.

43
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,380
How is my teacher doing?

44
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,420
That child...

45
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,620
Were you there to see
the Crown Princess off...

46
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,250
...when she departed?

47
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,820
Why do you want to know that?

48
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,930
What did you do for her that gives you
the right to ask about her final moments?

49
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,210
Hyungnim.

50
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,710
When she was chased out
of the palace like a criminal,

51
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,670
what did you do, Your Highness?

52
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,370
When she was wavering
between life and death, what did you do?

53
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,770
Please stop.

54
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,940
When she was buried in the cold earth,
what did you do?

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,650
When her father and brother
are on the brink of banishment,

56
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,770
-what are you doing?!
-Hyungnim!

57
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,510
You have everything, have you not?!

58
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,750
His Majesty's devotion, the loyalty
of Director Heo whom I revere...

59
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,660
...the friendship of Tutor Heo, who's like
a blood brother to me. Have you not?

60
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,500
Couldn't even one...

61
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,700
...just one of those things be mine?

62
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,550
Hyungnim.

63
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,630
To me, she was the one and only.

64
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,370
The one and only I earnestly wanted.

65
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,360
Couldn't you have allowed me just one?

66
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,300
If it were me, I would have protected her.

67
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,950
I would have staked my everything,
my life, to protect her.

68
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,310
Your Highness failed to protect her.

69
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,060
In the next life, she will become mine.

70
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,200
In the next life, I will absolutely...

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
...protect her.

72
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,320
You have put forth much effort.

73
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,410
It made me uneasy that
she continued to live for some time,

74
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,760
but I see your skills
were not falsely glorified.

75
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,210
I will use my power
to safeguard the Seongsucheong,

76
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,530
so do not worry.

77
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,470
Forgive me, Your Highness,
but I have an entreaty to make.

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,310
Do you? Go ahead and speak.

79
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,780
I would like to leave
the Seongsucheong for a while.

80
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,420
Leave the Seongsucheong?

81
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,850
By nature, using the black arts
with someone's life is taboo.

82
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,390
This recent ritual has weakened my body
and divine power.

83
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,470
So I'd like to wander about
in the mountains and streams,

84
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,250
and cleanse my body and mind.

85
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,160
However, there is no one
who has your level of divine power...

86
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,490
...so it would be difficult for us.

87
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,750
But in the event something goes wrong,
my presence could spoil your plan.

88
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,900
Then, will you be returning?

89
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,800
Could there be any question?

90
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,030
You must hurry.
The drug will wear off soon.

91
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,950
Who's there?!

92
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,530
Father!

93
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,400
Mother!

94
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,790
Brother!

95
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,830
Your Highness. Your Highness!

96
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,320
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo!

97
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,850
Yeon Woo, sit up.
The medicine is very hot.

98
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,460
Run away. Run away.

99
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,750
Yeon Woo!

100
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,180
Who are you?

101
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,680
Me? Jan Shil.

102
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,250
Jan Shil?

103
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,180
Oh, right. Mistress! Mistress!

104
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,370
Milady!

105
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,590
Are you feeling clear headed now?

106
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,440
Who are you?

107
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,590
And who are you?

108
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,090
Where am I?

109
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
And...

110
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,300
...who am I?

111
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,410
Your lot in life is quite pitiable.

112
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,050
I suppose you'll be living
as that lady's shadow forever.

113
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,650
When snowflakes get too close to flames,
they melt and disappear.

114
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,620
So don't ever get too close.

115
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,520
Young lady...

116
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,280
..you are a shaman.

117
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,210
You were receiving an invocation rite
when you fainted,

118
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,210
and you've finally woken up today.

119
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,320
Because you hosted
such a powerful spirit inside you,

120
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,840
it appears the shock
has made you lose your memory.

121
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,500
From this moment on,
think of me as your spiritual mother...

122
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,550
What about my family?

123
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,070
My family...

124
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,690
...where are they?

125
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,230
I do not know.

126
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,070
You were wandering the streets,
and in your eyes,

127
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,310
I found an uncommon mystical spirit.

128
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,540
So I merely performed an invocation rite.

129
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,870
Was I...

130
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,190
...abandoned?

131
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,290
Did my family realize
I had a mystical spirit and abandoned me?

132
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,770
You are now already a shaman.

133
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,130
It's best you forget
the connections in your past.

134
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,300
It could also be that
the gods have taken your memory

135
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,100
to cut your ties with the past
and lead you to live as a shaman.

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,550
It must be their will.

137
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,760
Your Highness.

138
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,830
You must have suffered
such an ordeal in these recent days.

139
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,420
An ordeal?

140
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,370
It is our fault, not being cautious enough
in the selection of the Crown Princess.

141
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,510
Life, age, illness, and death
are up to the Heavens. What can men do?

142
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,240
Since you put it so kindly, I do not know
what to do with myself or where to go.

143
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,780
In all of Heaven and Earth,
how could there not exist a place for you?

144
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,230
And well, if you're looking for a place...

145
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,460
...I suppose you'll secure one, even if
by yanking out whoever is already there.

146
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,320
Yeon Woo!

147
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,020
They have decided on an exile location.

148
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,970
Though we have become criminals,

149
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,460
this is the appropriate price we must pay.

150
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,830
You must not resent His Majesty.

151
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,170
How could I harbor such thoughts?

152
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,870
However, I worry about
the Crown Prince left alone.

153
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,870
Though your body is a
great distance away...

154
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,160
...never forget that you are
the Crown Prince's loyal subject.

155
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,280
Until the day you return to his side,

156
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,340
you must not become inattentive
in your scholarly pursuits.

157
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,570
I will take your words to heart.

158
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,290
My Lord, you may need
to come out for a moment.

159
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,920
What is it?

160
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,360
Well, it's that Madam is again...

161
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,120
Eat this, too.
It is the pumpkin you like.

162
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,040
Wife.

163
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,230
Where have you been wandering,
leaving home like that?

164
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,410
Wife!

165
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Are you all right?

166
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,920
I will pack food and clothes
for you to take, so let's go out.

167
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,530
-Wife.
-Yeon Woo.

168
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,100
-How long are you going to...
- Where are you going?

169
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,930
Stop. That's enough, please!

170
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,500
Our Yeon Woo is dead.

171
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,620
She is dead!

172
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,870
Our Yeon Woo...

173
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,140
Aigoo, my baby.

174
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,560
Yeon Woo!

175
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,270
You've come. I was worried.

176
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,450
What about the children?

177
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,430
Come out.

178
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,600
Mistress! Mistress!

179
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,070
Hurry, hurry.

180
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,500
Hurry. Hurry, hurry.

181
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,830
We must hurry.

182
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,930
Please, get in the boat.

183
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,300
What is it?
Are you still not feeling well?

184
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,240
It's not that.

185
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,520
My family who abandoned me may be nearby.

186
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,860
If I depart,
I fear I may never see them again.

187
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,020
We must hurry.

188
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,070
Please, get in the boat.

189
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,610
I'm sorry to trouble you.

190
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,480
Please come and see me
whenever you need help.

191
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,620
Are you going back
to the Office of Rituals?

192
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,860
The leave of absence
His Majesty granted me has ended,

193
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,650
so I suppose I will need to return.

194
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,820
When are you intending
to return to the Seongsucheong?

195
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,050
How could I dare to return as High Shaman?

196
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,720
Don't speak such nonsense.

197
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,370
You still have obligations
to the royal family and the people.

198
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,660
Are you not coming?

199
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,710
I must be going now.

200
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,910
Please, be well.

201
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,420
Be careful.

202
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,620
As long as you are with the lady,
one cannot say you are safe.

203
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,340
Farewell!

204
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,240
Please be well, Milady!

205
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,780
Next time we meet,
please show me your smiling face!

206
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,520
With the moon hidden, I suppose
this country's darkness will deepen.

207
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,910
But a moon veils itself and sets,
then rises yet again.

208
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,470
There will come a day,
when she will find her true face.

209
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,820
I pray you stay safe until that day.

210
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,420
Why are you looking at me like that?

211
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,600
Why do you keep calling me "Milady"?

212
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,610
Excuse me?

213
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,990
That...

214
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,550
Because you're the Moon.

215
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,230
Moon?

216
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,880
Because you hosted such a powerful spirit,
everyone addresses you with respect.

217
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,630
Right. You said I was a shaman.

218
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,770
Was this it, Ari?

219
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,010
"Yi In Gong."

220
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,800
"Mu (Mudang, shaman)"

221
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,050
What's the matter?

222
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,030
Why are you crying?

223
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,670
It's nothing. Nothing.

224
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,360
Don't cry.

225
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,800
Don't cry.

226
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,680
Whether she recovers her place as Queen
or continues her life as a shaman,

227
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,120
it is now in her hands.

228
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,140
Oh, my goodness!

229
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,240
It's as if an angel
had descended from the heavens!

230
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,020
There have been many complications
leading up to this wedding,

231
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,610
but you are now becoming
this country's Crown Princess.

232
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,880
Mother.

233
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,110
When you enter the palace,
you must remember this.

234
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,120
The Crown Princess
was originally rightfully your title.

235
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,380
You are not a substitute.
You've regained your rightful place.

236
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,530
So, no matter what happens,
be firm in your mindset.

237
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,770
I will take that to heart.

238
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,410
You must not show any weakness.

239
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,270
I shall not show any weakness.

240
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,170
Now, no one will be able
to set their sights on your position.

241
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:16,750
Now, no one will be able
to take it away from me.

242
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,410
Your Highness shall place
the wild goose and bow twice.

243
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,090
Do not worry.

244
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,670
Now, you will be able to obtain
what you want.

245
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,000
As the light dims by the clouds

246
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,170
The memories that are as cold
as the raindrops

247
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,440
That are pounding down the window

248
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,720
Are grabbing onto my heart

249
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:39,190
Sunk in the longing
that gets heavier as time passes

250
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:45,330
Can I travel back in time

251
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:52,830
If you would only hold me
as you did before

252
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,580
Then I would be all right

253
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,720
Draw the bead screen aside.

254
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,910
Your Highness, for the Crown Princess
to get into the palanquin...

255
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,220
Your name, Yeon Woo...
Does it mean a gentle rain?

256
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,570
Yes. It does.

257
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,350
Then, I suppose it could also mean
a misty rain.

258
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,990
That's a pretty name.

259
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,970
Your Majesty. You will get sick.

260
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,280
Please return to your quarters.

261
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,780
Shall I call for hot tea to be prepared?

262
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,290
-Or perhaps, warm spirits?
-Hyung Sun.

263
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

264
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,600
You always...

265
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,170
...talk too much.

266
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,320
-But it will soon be time for the session.
-Have all courtiers gather outside.

267
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,350
Why outside?

268
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,720
The day is lovely, is it not?

269
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,920
This calls for a game of gyeokgu.

270
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,190
-Big hit!
-It's a big hit.

271
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,560
Your Majesty's swing sense sends the ball
so high, it's like it pierces the sky!

272
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,570
As could your flattery and adulation.

273
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,540
I believe it's your turn,
Finance Minister.

274
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,890
Truly excellent skills.

275
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,300
You must have been busy.

276
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,690
-When did you develop such prowess?
-I wouldn't call it prowess.

277
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,540
It's just this hole happens to be
a wee bit bigger than the others.

278
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,020
Then, I suppose you would know
where the biggest hole in the palace lies.

279
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,010
How could I know that?

280
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,500
Then, let me lead the way.

281
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,360
Your Majesty, you must not.

282
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,730
People forced into slave labor,
with no proper food or clothing,

283
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,510
are enduring the harshest depths
of winter under a single dog hide.

284
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,150
It appears that, one by one,
people are freezing to death.

285
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,340
Local magistrate loans landowners money
to pay taxes at usurious interest rates,

286
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,450
and when they can't pay, he takes land
and daughters as concubines?

287
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,960
Oh! And it says
he's taken twenty concubines!

288
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
He enjoys more benefits than me.

289
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,670
I can see why he was reported.

290
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,970
And this is a call for the impeachment
of Yoon Su Il of the Personnel Ministry

291
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,720
for accepting bribes for
government office appointments.

292
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,840
Yoon Su Il...

293
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,410
Isn't he your cousin?

294
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,270
It's false incrimination, Your Majesty!

295
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,170
He embezzled relief rations
from the poor.

296
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,200
He privately requisitioned the people
to put up a monument to himself.

297
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,820
He stole and occupied the people's land.

298
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,220
Enslavement, double and triple tortures,
gross abuse of power...

299
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,720
How can one read this
without shedding tears?

300
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,160
And yet...

301
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,770
Why were these petitions
not delivered to the King?

302
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,640
After reviewing them,
we were eventually going to...

303
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,140
Do you not see the dates
the petitions were recorded?

304
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,210
These petitions are over a month old.

305
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,880
It's just that they were
such trivial matters that we thought...

306
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,050
Who says that the content
of these documents was trivial?

307
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,410
And have I ever issued an order for you
to judge the suffering of our people?!

308
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,450
Do you understand now?

309
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,210
This is the biggest
hole inside the palace.

310
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,000
The Royal Secretariat!

311
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,070
The biggest hole that obstructs
the communication

312
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,240
between the people and their king!

313
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,260
He's gotten used to that crown,
all right.

314
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,940
It seems as if it was yesterday
when the Queen Dowager was regent.

315
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,230
But he already appears to be baring
his claws over every little matter.

316
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,400
We were worried hearing he was unwell,
but those claims seem to be unfounded.

317
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:35,180
Today, he wasn't just well,
he was brimming with youthful vigor.

318
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,520
Vigor ought to be conserved
and used in the marital bed.

319
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,590
Why waste it on matters
that don't concern him?

320
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,450
Conjecture as it may be, his reason
for rejecting the queen's marital bed

321
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,750
was most likely a false illness
all this time...

322
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,330
It is not a false illness.

323
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,730
Though he desperately tried to hide it, he
couldn't hide the sickly look on his face.

324
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,920
Then, why don't we send him
far away to recuperate,

325
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,150
and we can kindly offer to take over
the stressful affairs of the state.

326
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,680
Do you not know His Majesty?

327
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,620
Just a moment ago, he took the petitions
with him so he can read them all night.

328
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,470
Even I would leave a cat with a fish
before I'd leave you with the palace.

329
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,900
Are you through?!

330
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,290
It's not a bad idea.

331
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,390
You see?!

332
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,330
They disregard me because I was appointed
without completing the civil exam,

333
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,130
but as you can see,
I'm not so thick-headed.

334
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,530
Moreover...

335
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:45,620
...it's a good opportunity to handle
the Boyong Tomb repair case in secret.

336
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:54,000
Even a dog you raised can become vicious
if he is leashed too tightly.

337
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,810
He must be unleashed occasionally
to ensure he remains obedient.

338
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,360
What did you just say?

339
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,670
A flood of appeals demanding
a royal concubine?

340
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:18,010
I've put in a word at the Secretariat,
so it is not widely known.

341
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,300
But it won't be long
before His Majesty finds out.

342
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,690
If by some chance he were receptive...

343
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,340
...and if that royal concubine
were to bear the first Prince...

344
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,000
That cannot be!

345
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,840
The first Prince must absolutely
be borne by the Queen.

346
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:42,220
However, he has refused the marital bed
with the Queen with one excuse or another

347
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
for a very long time already.

348
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,120
At this rate, the birth of a Prince
becomes a remote possibility.

349
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,880
Why is it his illness strikes without fail
when he is to share the marital bed?

350
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,550
Forgive me for saying this...

351
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:02,630
...but Prince Yang Myung has a crowd
of supporters aligned with him.

352
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,390
What did you just say?

353
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:10,720
If by chance, the king were to pass away
without leaving an heir...

354
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,130
Watch what you say, Chief Councilor!
His Majesty is in good health!

355
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,760
Then, we must show the whole country
that he is in good health.

356
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,630
Even after showing signs of good health,
why do you think he keeps falling ill?

357
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,450
Don't you think it's overexertion
due to the affairs of state?

358
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,670
So then, do you have a solution?

359
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,080
We must allow him to shed
the affairs of state temporarily.

360
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,780
Though I am but a lowly subject...

361
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,310
...I should take care
of the affairs of state in his absence.

362
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,000
However, do you think
His Majesty will agree so easily?

363
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,990
No.

364
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,030
You must step in, of course.

365
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,810
Aren't you the only one in this palace
who can bend his stubborn will?

366
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,310
Travel to the outlying palaces?

367
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

368
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:18,690
That ill health of yours seems to
always keep you from your marital bed.

369
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,030
Why not put aside the stressful affairs
of state and take care of your health?

370
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,630
If I flinch over the most minor pain,

371
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,300
you immediately discuss
the subject of an heir.

372
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,740
Are you worried about my health
or about what may happen after I die?

373
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,210
I just cannot know.

374
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,860
How could you say such a thing?

375
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,710
Then, would you come with me?

376
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,550
Ah, that's right. I completely forgot.

377
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,740
When the King is away, the Queen's father
becomes the guardian of the palace

378
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,770
and takes over
palace responsibilities, is that right?

379
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,410
It's such a good chance to handle matters
as you see fit without the king,

380
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,440
so I suppose you'd choose to stay
rather than join me at the hot springs.

381
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,180
Isn't that so, Chief Councilor?

382
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,460
Your Majesty, the Queen Dowager
requests an audience.

383
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,200
Oh my. There are so many
who seek me today.

384
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,460
I believe she'll be saying
something very similar to what you said.

385
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,450
What are your thoughts?

386
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,020
You've come, Your Majesty.

387
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,050
Your Majesty, this is an earnest entreaty
from your grandmother.

388
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,860
Please take temporary respite
in the rural palace and recover.

389
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,140
Forgive me. The affairs of the state
have stacked up, making it impossible.

390
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,320
You can delay the affairs of the state
for the moment,

391
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,210
but you cannot delay
bearing a Prince any longer.

392
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,880
Royal processions
are a waste of resources and state funds.

393
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,160
This is for your health, Your Majesty.

394
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,790
The fortune of a country and its people
depend on your health.

395
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,130
And that is why
I do not skip visits with the physician.

396
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,230
I am not seriously ill,
so please don't worry.

397
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,970
Then, why is a Prince so late in coming?

398
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,710
Forgive me.

399
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,720
Because of my inadequate virtue
and lack of devotion,

400
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,110
I have caused much worry.

401
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,840
How could that be solely your fault?

402
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,850
You spend days alone due to His Majesty's
poor health, isn't it?

403
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,800
That is not so.

404
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,340
It is my fault for being unable
to provide proper support for His Majesty.

405
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,240
Oh dear. My heart aches for you, Queen.

406
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,930
Your Majesty, I'm certain you must know
that to neglect your health

407
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,960
and fail to produce an heir
is a dereliction of a monarch's duty, no?

408
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,950
However, isn't that
the providence of the heavens?

409
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,580
You must make an effort.

410
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,590
With regards to the state,
you have the Chief Councilor,

411
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,890
and you have me,
who recently served as regent.

412
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,570
Entrusting the state affairs to relatives
is also a dereliction of duty, is it not?

413
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,500
Your Majesty.

414
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,640
What you just said,
to whom was that directed?

415
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,640
It wasn't directed at anyone.
It was merely a general statement.

416
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,750
If Your Majesty gives this grandmother's
earnest request such a cold reception.

417
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,080
I have no choice.

418
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,480
Court Lady Park!

419
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,490
Do not bring me any food from today on!

420
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,810
Your Highness!

421
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,920
When His Majesty completely disregards
my sincere intentions,

422
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,990
what is the point of living on
as a useless old woman?

423
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,720
Beginning today, I shall quit eating
and just count the days until I die.

424
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,330
Your Highness, why are you doing this?

425
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,750
Please shed your anger.

426
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,430
Your Highness, you mustn't do this.
Please retract your order.

427
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,890
Please consider the Queen Dowager's
sincerity, Your Majesty.

428
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,620
The late King always showed
great filial piety for her.

429
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,850
A royal visit to the rural palaces
is not a simple matter.

430
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,010
You could reduce the scale, could you not?

431
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,180
-However, Your Highness...
-By falling ill,

432
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,960
you have already caused her much anxiety.

433
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,610
How can you show
even more lack of filial duty?

434
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,880
Your Majesty, may I enter?

435
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,380
You may enter.

436
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,730
Your Majesty,
you are needed outside momentarily.

437
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:24,290
-What is it?
-It's... the qu... queen...

438
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,450
The queen...

439
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,560
I pray you shed your anger, Your Highness.

440
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,450
All of this is my fault for not being able
to provide proper support for His Majesty.

441
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,210
Please punish me instead,
and withdraw your intention to starve!

442
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,320
Please get up, Queen.

443
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,650
Your Majesty.

444
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,650
The day is cold. Please get up.

445
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,900
Until Her Highness retracts her orders
and agrees to eat...

446
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,940
...I shall not get up.

447
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,910
I shall ask for forgiveness
and travel to the rural palaces.

448
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,940
So please get up now.

449
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,640
Your Majesty.

450
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,050
The Queen Dowager makes her moves inside.

451
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,220
And the Chief Councilor
makes his moves on the outside.

452
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,940
You must be happy
to have such strong backing.

453
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,200
Do you remember what I told you
when I visited your family?

454
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,180
If you've forgotten,
let me tell you again.

455
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,700
Since you and your clan
will obtain everything you wanted...

456
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,190
...don't go so far
as to hope for my heart, as well.

457
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,660
As it will never be yours.

458
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,970
Could it be possible
that you still cannot forget her?

459
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,670
She is dead. Do you understand?

460
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,880
She is not the master
of these chambers. I am your Queen.

461
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,230
Your Highness. The Princess has come.

462
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,330
Send her in.

463
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,860
Have you been well, Your Highness?

464
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,750
Welcome, Princess. What brings you here?

465
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,650
When I saw the Queen Mother,
she suggested I come to comfort you.

466
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,890
But, I understand you performed
a repentant entreaty for punishment.

467
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,570
Well, because of my lack of virtue,
I have not conceived a prince.

468
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,080
So it was appropriate
to plead for forgiveness.

469
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,140
But it's probably not a lack of virtue.

470
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,050
It's more likely a lack of affection.

471
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,590
Excuse me?

472
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,410
Virtue has no effect
between a man and a woman.

473
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,360
It would have to be affection over virtue.

474
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,240
The reason Brother doesn't come
to the Queen's quarters

475
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,260
is probably because
he holds no affection for you...

476
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,050
But, what is it
that brought you to the palace today?

477
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,830
Excuse me?

478
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:42,750
Actually, the Meteorological Office
has come up with prime dates...

479
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,170
...for me and my husband
to share the marital bed.

480
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,960
Ah, I must be going now.

481
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:55,480
If my husband does not have me
in his sight, he gets very restless.

482
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,590
Be well, Your Highness.

483
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,110
Please close the door.

484
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,830
What's the matter?
Did you leave something behind?

485
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:53,670
Do you think I'm someone
who's always leaving things behind?

486
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,490
Yes, I do.

487
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,990
Husband! It is your wife.

488
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,630
Why do you not answer?

489
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,860
Then, I shall enter!

490
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,550
Husband.

491
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,630
How is it you have stopped studying
to lie down?

492
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,170
You laid out the blankets as if
you knew the reason I would come.

493
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,910
Actually, I went to visit
the Queen Mother today.

494
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:29,120
And she had obtained dates
for our marital bed

495
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:32,060
from the Meteorological Office.

496
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,400
It's more likely that you begged
and pleaded her to obtain them.

497
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,840
Why are you so startled?

498
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,360
What are you doing here, my Lord?

499
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,440
I dropped by the book store
and brought back some books.

500
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:54,210
Then, with whom
is the Princess talking right now?

501
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,240
As you can see,
today happens to be an auspicious day.

502
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,290
And since the blankets
have already been laid,

503
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,660
and also since they say
strike the iron in one blow...

504
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,700
It's not in one blow,
it's strike the iron while it's hot.

505
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,080
Who are you?

506
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,080
Your brother.

507
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,710
Prince Yang Myung!

508
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,500
Give that to me!

509
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,270
Give that back to me now!

510
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,580
Min Hwa, you must have added
these three dates.

511
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,020
How did you...

512
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:35,400
If someone couldn't notice
such clumsy forgery,

513
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,560
wouldn't he be a fool?

514
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,000
Brother!

515
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,860
You're not fighting, are you?

516
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,400
Fight, nonsense.

517
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,460
How could I fight with a woman
that would strike iron in one blow?

518
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,630
Brother, you're hateful.

519
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,240
Aigoo.

520
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:39,010
That is your penalty
for betraying my love for you.

521
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,490
How did I end up
with my sister as a rival?

522
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,020
Why do you always do this?

523
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,790
Huh? What did I do?

524
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,580
Whenever you come, you provoke her.

525
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,560
Haven't I already told you?
It's a rival's jealousy.

526
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,400
She irks me.

527
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,570
How does the Princess irk you so?

528
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,030
She made you into a Prince Consort,
did she not?

529
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,110
Lord.

530
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:16,150
The late King never hid his desire for you
to be one of the present King's officials.

531
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,220
Why, then, would he clip the wings
of a rare man of such talent?

532
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:26,880
I resent both the late King
and Princess Min Hwa.

533
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,680
Please don't speak like that.

534
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:33,110
And if I don't speak like that,
shall I speak more vaguely, indirectly?

535
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,740
The Princess is a saviour to my family.

536
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,640
The reason our family was not destroyed,
that I sit here safe, isn't it all...

537
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,120
...due to the graciousness
of the Princess in accepting me?

538
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,580
Graciousness, what nonsense.

539
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,360
Your ambitious dreams, your aspirations,
they've all been rendered futile.

540
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,310
What is it?

541
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,900
A cute thieving cat
has gone off with my shoes.

542
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,910
Excuse me?

543
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,060
What trouble.

544
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,480
Then, what about
wearing my shoes temporarily?

545
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,700
It's all right.

546
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:31,100
For a wanderer,
an extra pair of shoes is essential.

547
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,460
Then, were you travelling yet again?

548
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,000
A tiresome horde of flies
keep gathering outside my home.

549
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:46,450
I understand His Majesty's health
has not improved.

550
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,870
Please, look away.

551
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,090
Are you not curious?

552
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,570
About what?

553
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,870
If she were alive...

554
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,970
...what would she look like?

555
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,690
My Lord.

556
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,410
You and I age continuously.

557
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,340
But in my memories...

558
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,320
...your sister remains 13.

559
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,090
What are you thinking about so deeply?

560
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,630
I was thinking about you.

561
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,590
Are you not going to go to the Palace?

562
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,760
Did Yeom instigate this questioning?

563
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,980
No.

564
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,760
I just feel that he's waiting for you.

565
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,910
Who are you saying is waiting for me?

566
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,950
His Majesty.

567
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:13,410
After I hurt him so,
do you think he would be waiting for me?

568
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,650
He is waiting.

569
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,630
You are always speaking
only of His Majesty.

570
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,290
Inside the Palace,
with no one to confide in...

571
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,600
...how lonely he must be.

572
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,210
He has Woon by his side.

573
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,530
Prince Yang Myung...

574
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:43,490
...please protect him.

575
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,920
Please, Prince Yang Myung...

576
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
...protect His Majesty.

577
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,140
The owner has been...

578
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,980
Prince Yang Myung.

579
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,880
Prince Yang Myung!

580
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,380
Why are you running?

581
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,400
-Prince Yang Myung!
-Prince Yang Myung!

582
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,390
Prince Yang Myung!

583
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,120
-Prince Yang Myung!
-Prince Yang Myung!

584
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,410
Prince Yang Myung!

585
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,230
-Prince Yang Myung!
-Prince Yang Myung!

586
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,060
Are you satisfied now?

587
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,690
This is the way...

588
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,280
...I protect His Majesty.

589
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:26,980
Your Highness, everything is my fault.

590
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,990
It is not your fault, Your Highness.

591
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,000
Whatever may happen...

592
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,400
...do not blame yourself.

593
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,440
If that child becomes miserable,
it's because of you.

594
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:48,890
When she was buried in the cold earth,
what did you do?

595
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,070
That is, indeed that is also,
all of it is because of you.

596
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,410
If it were me,
I would have protected her.

597
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:04,740
I would have staked my everything,
my life, to protect her.

598
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,350
Your Highness failed to protect her.

599
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,440
Failed to protect her.
Failed to protect her!

600
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,660
Did you have the same dream?

601
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,230
Is that you, Woon?

602
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

603
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,240
Let's go outside.
I think I need to get some air.

604
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,990
Closed

605
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,070
Woon.

606
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,790
Please speak.

607
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,400
Do you know why this is called
the Hidden Moon Pavilion?

608
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,800
Because it uses the characters
eun for "hidden."

609
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,100
And dal for "moon?"

610
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,510
It's a bit like that.

611
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,010
But that's not completely correct.

612
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,880
Is there a hidden meaning?

613
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:32,680
When the late King
first constructed this building...

614
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,550
...he felt that the moon reflected
in the pond was so beautiful

615
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,770
that he wanted to save it forever.

616
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,920
Even on nights the moon didn't appear,
he hoped to pull it out.

617
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,800
Therefore, he named this building
Hidden Moon Pavilion.

618
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,520
So that it may hide the moon
reflected in the pond.

619
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,220
And on nights with no moon, it may quietly
pull the moon out onto the pond's surface.

620
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,210
That is the precise meaning
behind this place.

621
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,580
I will remember it.

622
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:14,030
I also hid a moon here once
a long time ago.

623
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:22,100
So that I could pull it out
whenever I longed for it.

624
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,670
Look there.

625
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:31,640
Though the Sun and the Moon
cannot be together in one sky...

626
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,800
...at least in this pond,
they are together.

627
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,070
Mistress! Mistress!

628
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,110
What are you doing all the way here?

629
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,370
The Chief Taoist Priest sent a letter.

630
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,490
Light some candles, Jan Shil.

631
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:39,220
You haven't lit any of the candles, yet?

632
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:49,290
The flow of heaven and earth
is changing. It feels like it is time.

633
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,440
I will be there in four days.
Let's meet briefly.

634
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,910
Child, go on back now.
