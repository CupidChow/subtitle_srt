1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,830
This drama is set in the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,050
Characters and events are fictitious
and have no historic basis.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,550
Episode 2

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,210
Ghost. Ghost. It's a ghost!

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,150
Quickly. Quickly remove that thing.

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,650
Your Highness.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,670
Perhaps, we can meet again?

8
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,810
He wouldn't have sent an assassin,
would he?

9
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,160
Hye Woo Suk?

10
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,590
What concern do you have
that you aren't able to sleep?

11
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,920
Tell your concerns to this rock.

12
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,360
This rock is called "Hye Woo Suk,"
as it worries for you.

13
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,770
This rock takes away your problems
and brings solutions,

14
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,480
so sleep comfortably now.

15
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,670
It's a souvenir from my trip.

16
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,490
He came again?

17
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,070
This man is really!

18
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,160
Haven't I made myself clear to him?

19
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,660
As expected, Jae Woon,
your skills are amazing.

20
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,940
I guess I have no talent in weaponry.

21
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,840
Looking at what state I'm in
after years of training.

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,460
Are you OK, Young Master?

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,960
Can't you stop calling me "young master?"

24
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,500
I've told you many times,
but you're stubborn as well.

25
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,600
Anyway, Prince Yang Myung is late.

26
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,130
From the promised time,
he is already an hour late.

27
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,820
When Prince Yang Myung was here,
this backyard was always noisy.

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,230
Since there are only you and me,
it seems a bit empty.

29
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,080
Had I known that
you would have missed me this much,

30
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,000
I would have ended my journey
and returned sooner.

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,280
Prince Yang Myung!

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,090
My love, Heo Yeom!

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,150
Congratulations on passing
the civil service examinations.

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,870
Prince Yang Myung.

35
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,720
Kim Jae Woon!

36
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,840
You are not amiable at all.

37
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,190
Jae Woon,
I will just half congratulate you.

38
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,490
Did you enjoy your trip?

39
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,070
I did, as a matter fact.

40
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,640
I brought back precious tofu
for my precious friends,

41
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,080
so how about we drink in the moonlight?

42
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,030
Let's go.

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,690
Now, let's drink.

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,230
Since you're running late, I thought
you were going to stay away longer.

45
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,910
I was late because
I was looking at an important person.

46
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,080
Forgive me. I have found someone
I care for more than you.

47
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,240
Have you found a lover
while you were gone?

48
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,120
You haven't ever said anything
about someone...

49
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,960
You didn't by any chance
climb over a wall again, did you?

50
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,240
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,610
How can I, with my prince status,
climb into a woman's house?

52
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,840
Especially when it's the wall
of your precious younger sister...

53
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,390
Even though my sister is young,

54
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,450
men and women
of different families must be separated.

55
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,700
On top of that, weren't you found
by the child and received a scolding?

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,340
After going through that,
how could you...

57
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,570
I know. I know. I know.

58
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,720
I know very well, so please stop.

59
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,050
You're so uptight.

60
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,020
If you showed her to me when I asked,

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,400
I wouldn't have gone through
that embarrassing situation.

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,820
Whenever your sister's name comes up,

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,310
your face turns sour
and your voice becomes lower.

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,650
Prince Yang Myung!

65
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,650
Did you just laugh?
Yeom! You saw it too, right?

66
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,740
This ice man laughed!
It's a once in a lifetime event.

67
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,750
-Don't you agree?
-If you climb that wall again,

68
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm not going to stand by and do nothing.

69
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,380
I said I understood.

70
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,050
More importantly,
I have special presents for you two.

71
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,490
These are charms
to help you start your official career.

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Have you heard of the mystic rocks?

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,690
Whenever you look at it, think of me,

74
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,390
and always carry it with you.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,050
It may be a bit heavy to carry it on me.

76
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,770
Oh, is that so?

77
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,980
If that second one is too big...

78
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,500
....then I'll give you the fourth one.

79
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,390
Then, are you guys now becoming
the Crown Prince's men, too?

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,940
What's wrong with the mood here?

81
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,860
Come. Once you enter the palace,
we won't have many chances to meet,

82
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,980
so enjoy yourselves tonight.

83
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,540
Here.

84
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,740
This is the newly edited list
for the ministry officials.

85
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,200
This is the the list of candidates?

86
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,550
Yes.

87
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,240
They have been chosen for Sigangwon.

88
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,300
After great deliberation
from the grand masters.

89
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,500
These are
the most outstanding candidates.

90
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,760
King Seongjo

91
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,550
Your Highness, as you have ordered,

92
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,470
I've learned more about
the junior officials.

93
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,820
All right. Who were the ones chosen?

94
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,720
Though I do not know who the king chose,

95
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,160
I brought the list
of top three candidates...

96
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,890
...through great pain.

97
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,090
Firstly, the Ethics final candidates are,

98
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,970
-Yoon Sung Chul, Yoon Dae Ho...
-Yoon Sung Chul, Yoon Dae Ho,

99
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,250
Kim Ki Joo.

100
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,890
The Crown Prince's teachers,
Park Ji Hong, Yoon Pil Won, Jung Min.

101
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,380
Literature candidates, Yoon Si Wan,
Choi Byung Eun, Choi Chi Soo.

102
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,680
You knew already?

103
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,500
Do you think that's new information?

104
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,290
Aigoo...

105
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,020
It seems like Grandmother
used some of her resources.

106
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,060
No, the one who worked hard
is probably Yoon Dae Hyung.

107
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,590
So, is that the only thing
you have learned?

108
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,870
Today will be the first day of class
with your new literature tutor...

109
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,840
...but I do not know very well who is...

110
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,030
Whether it's one person or the other,
they're all likely men seeking power.

111
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,620
-Old farts.
-Then perhaps...

112
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,210
Are you saying that
you're going to make him lose again...

113
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,750
For someone
who can't participate in politics yet,

114
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,450
how can I have that kind of right?

115
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,560
Then...

116
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
I only have one choice.

117
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,190
Exercise my veto power.

118
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,230
Yo, Yo... Your Highness!

119
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:18,750
Well then, shall we go test how long
the new teacher is going to last?

120
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,190
Your Highness...

121
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,630
How long do you think
he will endure this time?

122
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,890
I bet my hair pin that he will quit
and lose the election within a month.

123
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,450
Let's go.

124
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,780
Oh! Oh my.

125
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,960
Yo... Your Highness,
the new literature tutor is here.

126
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,660
I've been assigned to your tutorage,
my name is Shin Heo Yeom.

127
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,830
I have been bestowed the honor
of meeting Your Highness.

128
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,780
Are you going to be at Sigangwon
with the Crown Prince?

129
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,680
Then, he's going to be
the Crown Prince's teacher?

130
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,520
Since he received the royal command
to be literature candidate at Sigangwon,

131
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,630
isn't that obvious?

132
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,060
Yeon Woo, are you OK?

133
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm OK.

134
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,450
I was thinking about something else.

135
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,310
What were you thinking?

136
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,690
You read hard books easily,

137
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,200
but look at your embroidery.

138
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,870
He probably won't know
that I am his sister, right?

139
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,420
Why are you saying such an obvious thing?

140
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,460
What?

141
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,360
Oh, never mind.

142
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,270
I am here to watch my brother
be awarded as the top literary scholar.

143
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,700
Your Highness.

144
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,420
Please pay your respects to your teacher.

145
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,650
How old are you?

146
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,250
Two years have passed
since I started my scholarly path.

147
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,760
Then, you're just 17?

148
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,080
That's correct.

149
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,700
Your Highness,
please pay your respects...

150
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,000
For such a young age...

151
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,790
...you must have a strong supporter.

152
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,660
Heo Yeom? Did you say Heo Yeom?

153
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,870
Out of all the Sigangwon positions,

154
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,910
you couldn't put one
of our own people in that position

155
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,900
and you gave up the position
to someone who is still so young?!

156
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,310
Are you unaware
of how important that position is,

157
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,990
of have you forgotten about
what I said like wind passing?

158
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,330
That Heo Yeom fellow...

159
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,490
...won't be able to control
the Crown Prince's temper.

160
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,350
In a short time, he'll walk out on his...

161
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,710
Oh, I'm so frustrated!

162
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,680
Who are we talking about here?

163
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,070
He is the son of the Director
of the Office of Special Councilors,

164
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,850
one of His Majesty's closest subjects.

165
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,820
Do you still not understand
what that means?

166
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,460
Don't you realize,

167
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,720
that with these personnel decisions
he's trying to oust all royal relatives

168
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,350
from positions of power?

169
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,270
The king is already trying
to create his own political fellowship!

170
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,410
Bulsojishin.

171
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,500
"Treat knowledge as a deity,"

172
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,250
"then make it your servant
to help you become king."

173
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,020
"It shall turn into a deity
that is not only a teacher but a friend."

174
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,520
Nice.

175
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,030
Very nice.

176
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,970
Seventeen! He is seventeen?

177
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,440
What does Father take me for,
assigning me to such a novice?

178
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,340
Your Highness, I finally have
information about Heo Yeom.

179
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,720
He placed first
in the literature examination.

180
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,090
Be quiet!

181
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,580
The information that you bring
is always behind.

182
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,730
I'm positive this time.

183
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,770
His popularity and fame were amazing
since he was a Sungkyunkwan scholar.

184
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,880
If you wanted looks, he has the looks.
If it was knowledge, he has it.

185
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,650
If it was personality,
his was the best, as well.

186
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,260
He is the perfect classical scholar
who does no wrong.

187
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,840
Is there a seat available?

188
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,130
-Over here. Sit here.
-Sit here.

189
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,030
Seniors at Sungkyunkwan were a given.

190
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,340
The students viewed
him sacredly and highly.

191
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,810
Men and women of all ages,
regardless of one's position,

192
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,520
were all attracted to his charm.

193
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,000
He was known as
the fascination of the scholars.

194
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,550
Are you Heo Yeom whom Eun Hyang
from the brothel likes?

195
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,840
I ought to...

196
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,800
As soon as people saw him.

197
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,260
...become friends with you.

198
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,650
They were charmed
by his looks and personality,

199
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,400
so they asked if they could be friends.

200
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,030
Not only that! Literature, politics,
history, philosophy, and mathematics.

201
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,650
There isn't a subject
he doesn't have an interest in.

202
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,720
Basically, to express with
thought provoking Chinese characters,

203
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,520
he's a genius who said
that studying was the easiest for him!

204
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,840
Shut it! Shut it! Shut your mouth!

205
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,640
I don't want to see you,
so for the time being turn around.

206
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,830
Brother, it's Yeon Woo.

207
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,770
Oh, yes. Come in.

208
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,270
I see it's time for us to read already.

209
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,950
Let's see. What book did we say
we were going to read today?

210
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,620
"Was it The Great Historian"
or "New Accounts of the World?"

211
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,270
Your face has concern written all over it.

212
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,220
Does it look like that to you?

213
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,450
Did something happen to you
today at the palace?

214
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,580
Or perhaps,

215
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,340
has the Crown Prince
been giving you a hard time?

216
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,750
No, it's not that.

217
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,230
I think I have received
a hard task from the Crown Prince.

218
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,030
What is it? Please tell me.

219
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,800
I will help you.

220
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,780
Will you really help me?

221
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,790
I think the Crown Prince
has a big misunderstanding about me.

222
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,940
I don't know how to open up his heart.

223
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,080
Misunderstanding?

224
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm sure it's not only
because of a misunderstanding.

225
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,430
Do you think he'll feel comfortable
having a young man as his teacher?

226
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,120
It's not because of you.

227
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,850
Actually...

228
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,090
It might be because of me.

229
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,300
My... I made you worry for no reason.

230
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,550
Don't worry.

231
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,100
If something gets tangled,
then we will untangle it somehow.

232
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,770
-Brother.
-Yes.

233
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,000
Brother...

234
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,940
...you want to win over
the Crown Prince's heart, right?

235
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,740
Do you have a way to do so?

236
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,070
I will end today's class here.

237
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,030
You're really a shameless person.

238
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,230
You're not teaching me a thing,
and yet you're being paid.

239
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,450
You're really shameless.

240
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,470
It seemed as if you were
not ready for class yet, Your Highness.

241
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,170
It's probably that
you're not ready to teach me, yet.

242
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,970
Then instead of our class today...

243
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,940
...may I dare to give you a riddle?

244
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,150
Did you say a riddle?

245
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,330
Yes.

246
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,880
If you are able to answer the riddle,
I will give up my position.

247
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,620
However, if by any chance,
you are not able to answer it...

248
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,760
If I can't?

249
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,230
Please respect me as your teacher
and show me you want to learn.

250
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,400
So you want to make a deal.

251
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,560
Fine. Let's hear.

252
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,540
Since you agreed, I will dare ask you.

253
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,730
It is something that can light up
the darkness in a moment.

254
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,280
It is something that can bring
the light into darkness in a moment.

255
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,250
What is it?

256
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,390
Isn't that so simple?

257
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,420
It won't be that simple.

258
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,260
That's what you think.

259
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,240
I will look forward to hearing
the answer at our next class.

260
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,570
At the same time...

261
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,860
...there won't be a reason
for me to see you again.

262
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,500
Those are eunuchs
from the Crown Prince's palace, right?

263
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,430
But, why are they taking all the books
from the library to Crown Prince's palace?

264
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,010
The queen is waiting for you, Princess.

265
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,660
Princess! Didn't you say
you were going to visit Her Majesty?

266
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,720
Brother,

267
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,360
after listening to father's scolding,
have you decided to study harder?

268
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,510
When do you plan
on reading all these books?

269
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,930
Min Hwa, since I don't have time
to play with you,

270
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,520
don't distract me and go back.

271
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,180
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

272
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,350
Why are you standing like that?

273
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,240
The reason I am standing like this
is because of the Crown Prince's order.

274
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,190
His Highness is trying to solve
a Sigangwon assignment he received.

275
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,680
Assignment? What is the assignment?

276
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,560
I told you to go away.

277
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,860
Please tell me what the assignment was.

278
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,960
Something that makes
the world light in an instant,

279
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,100
and also makes
the world dark in an instant.

280
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,290
That's what the assignment was.

281
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,320
Isn't that the eyelids?

282
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,080
Look.

283
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,800
If you close your eyes like this,
the entire world becomes dark.

284
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,240
If you open your eyes like this,
the entire world becomes light, right?

285
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,790
Look at the way you think.

286
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,210
You're so superficial.

287
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,100
This is why I don't talk to you.

288
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,540
You're distracting my studies.
Go back now.

289
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,150
The answer is a monarch's politics.

290
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,590
As written in the "Doctrine of Means,"

291
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,410
"Let the states of equilibrium
and harmony exist in perfection,"

292
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,220
"and a happy order will prevail
throughout heaven and earth,"

293
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,290
"and all things will be nourished
and flourish."

294
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,650
Your Majesty...

295
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,930
So, the monarch will rule
with sincerity and kindness.

296
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,060
If there is continuous harmony,
then all creations will be happy.

297
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,480
In other words, the citizens' lives
will become brighter.

298
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,940
In the opposite case,
their future would become darker.

299
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,700
So the answer is obviously
a monarch's politics, is it not?

300
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm sorry.

301
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,150
But it is different
from the answer that I have.

302
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,680
What did you say just now?

303
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,110
It is not the answer?

304
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,750
No, it is not.

305
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,500
Then, what is the answer?

306
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,180
The answer is...

307
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,000
...eyelids.

308
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,450
Are you joking around with me?

309
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,620
If you do not like the answer...

310
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,900
...then does it become a joke?

311
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,840
What? What did you say?

312
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,470
If the answer cannot be found
in the scriptures,

313
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,210
does it become a lowly idea?

314
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:49,290
Then, what seemed like child's play
is really the answer?

315
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,960
When you look at it
from the eyes of a child...

316
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,370
...the entire world can become a problem,

317
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,190
and the entire world
can become the answer.

318
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,050
There are two important things
for learning.

319
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,390
One is that you have to lose
the arrogance of knowing everything,

320
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,420
and the other is answering questions
out of pride and bias.

321
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,670
That pride and bias...

322
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,630
...is making Your Highness's eyes,
heart, and everything dark.

323
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,100
You need to realize that.

324
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,010
I apologize, Your Majesty.

325
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,440
A monarch's politics, you said?

326
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,850
That is absolutely correct.

327
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,940
But, having your eyelids closed tightly,

328
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,250
how are you going to observe
the citizens' well-being?

329
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,390
How are you going to become king?

330
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,990
First...

331
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,420
...please correct your attitude
towards learning.

332
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,010
Is anyone outside?

333
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,760
Yes, Your Highness.

334
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,920
Yes, Your Highness.

335
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,980
Please give your order.

336
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,160
Tell the kitchen
to have refreshments ready.

337
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,270
What?

338
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,080
Why refreshments?

339
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,410
After my lesson,

340
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,670
I want to chat
with my tutor and apologize.

341
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,680
What?

342
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,980
Then...

343
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,250
...Your Highness!

344
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,320
Today, I will learn about literature
and show my respect for my tutor,

345
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,400
doing my best to learn.

346
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,510
So please forget my past behavior,
and accept my greeting.

347
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,070
It seems like the Crown Prince
has finally met a good teacher.

348
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,130
Hence, my brother,

349
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,170
that amazing Crown Prince,

350
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,230
surrendered to the literature tutor?

351
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,680
Princess, your laughter is too loud.

352
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,400
Please lower your voice. Please.

353
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,610
That tutor is a special person.

354
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,860
I have to see him.

355
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,900
I'm going to give him an award.

356
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,770
Princess, don't tell me you plan
on seeing a man outside your family?

357
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:12,610
And I'm going to tell him
that I answered that hard riddle, too!

358
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,670
Princess. Princess!

359
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,590
Princess! Aigoo, Princess!

360
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,140
Princess!

361
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,870
Princess. Princess.

362
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,470
Princ...

363
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,210
There is something I am curious about.

364
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,440
Please ask.

365
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,700
If I had actually answered correctly,

366
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,050
were you planning
on giving up your position?

367
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,870
Do you think I wasn't prepared
to do something like that?

368
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,120
I only viewed you as a pedant,
but you're stronger than you seem.

369
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,140
Actually, my younger sister
gave me the strength.

370
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,500
If you act like a tongue inside his mouth,
what isn't there that you cannot do?

371
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,990
So even though the Crown Prince's
attitude for learning is reckless,

372
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,300
you'll just need to give him
excellent grades.

373
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,300
There was such an easy solution.

374
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,280
But how long will that gratitude go,

375
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,290
since you didn't gain his heart sincerely.

376
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,030
What is the point in that?

377
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,650
That is also true.

378
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,160
The road to being
a treacherous subject is easy,

379
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,610
and the road to being
a loyal subject is hard,

380
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:18,050
but shouldn't you think about
what's better for the Crown Prince first?

381
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,930
Be a disloyal subject
and gain his hypocritical heart,

382
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,280
or be a loyal subject and gain
the chance of earning his trust.

383
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,680
Is that what you mean?

384
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,390
The Crown Prince is a wise man.

385
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,930
Though he has
a misunderstanding about you,

386
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,140
he will realize your loyalty eventually.

387
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,300
So please be strong.

388
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,990
She is quite a smart person.

389
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,870
How old is your sister?

390
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,580
She is 13.

391
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,830
Thirteen?

392
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,750
Then, you discuss your worries
with your younger sister?

393
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,620
Your Highness, the tea is getting cold.

394
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,340
Drink it before
the smell and taste dissipate.

395
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,740
Oh, right.

396
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,510
Tutor Heo, please have some as well.

397
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:19,120
Then, the person
who scolded me today is not you,

398
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,020
but your sister.

399
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,390
I guess you could say that...

400
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,250
Then, the person who has the right
to eat this precious taffy,

401
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,200
is also your sister, right?

402
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,460
-What?
-Hyung Sun.

403
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,960
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,720
Wrap this black taffy.

405
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,930
I have to present this to my hidden tutor,

406
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,370
not Tutor Heo
who is in front of me right now.

407
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,010
-Hyung Sun.
-Yes, Your Highness.

408
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,820
Can you believe that a 13 year old
said such wise things?

409
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,120
If it is Tutor Heo's sister,
then I think it would be possible.

410
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,510
Tutor Heo became
a top literary scholar at 17...

411
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,080
What did you just say?

412
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,500
Tutor Heo won a first place
at the state examinations?

413
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,830
When? When did he?

414
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,010
This past examination...

415
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,030
I am just here to attend my brother's
top literary scholar award ceremony.

416
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,830
Why are you telling me that now?!

417
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,740
Why now?

418
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,260
When I tried to tell you last time,
you told me: "Shut your mouth."

419
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,490
"I can't trust
the information you bring me."

420
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,470
"Shut your mouth immediately."

421
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,290
The Crown Prince did?

422
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,520
Yes. He said it was a present
for his tutor and gave it to me.

423
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,990
Shouldn't it belong to you, then?

424
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,560
Why me?

425
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,750
Well...

426
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,500
It's because I told him that you gave me
the strength to lecture him.

427
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,530
What?!

428
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,610
A... And?

429
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,680
He said the real teacher was you, not me,
and took care to give this to you.

430
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,930
He didn't say anything else?

431
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,260
Well, nothing in particular...

432
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,190
He asked if the riddle
was your idea, as well.

433
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,330
Riddle?!

434
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,560
Yes.

435
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,230
I actually gave His Highness a riddle.

436
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,620
Oh, yes.

437
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,290
But, why do you seem
so unsettled since earlier?

438
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,340
What?

439
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,610
Oh... It's nothing.

440
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,550
Did you solve the riddle that I gave you?

441
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,520
Are you really...

442
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,770
...the Crown Prince?

443
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,020
Well...

444
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,980
What do you think?

445
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,350
I... wish that you weren't.

446
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,300
Why don't you try one?

447
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,330
How is it?

448
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,710
It's sweet.

449
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,770
The fact that you gave this to me...

450
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,020
...does that mean you have forgiven me?

451
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,080
If not...

452
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,790
...are you trying to scare me?

453
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,720
Please tell me what you mean.

454
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,000
He cannot neglect his ministers like this!

455
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,000
Who are the ones
who protected the king in the past?

456
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,240
Who should he be thankful
for being able to reign right now?

457
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,570
All of this is because of the Queen Mother

458
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,500
and you, the Minister of Personnel,
isn't it?

459
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,040
Every year, we hold a unity meeting
for the ministers,

460
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,120
who have done meritorious service
for the king,

461
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,770
but how can he exclude
the ministers from this?

462
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,480
If he went according to tradition,

463
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,220
then the Minister of Personnel
would already be Chief State Councilor.

464
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,820
Heo Young Jae...

465
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,080
...we have to get rid of him first.

466
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,660
Ever since he became Director,
the Three Offices have united,

467
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,130
and the King's advisors
started voicing their grievances.

468
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,060
They send appeals to the King daily,
renounce his distinguished relatives,

469
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,380
so it is not unthinkable that
His Majesty's devotion would sway.

470
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,570
That's true.

471
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,490
Appointing Heo's son as the new tutor,

472
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,360
was his way of giving him
even more influence, was it not?

473
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,570
If we don't do something
to take care of him...

474
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,810
If we did that...

475
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,350
...we would only soil
our hands with blood.

476
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,480
Then, is there another solution?

477
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,690
When they gain one position...

478
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,250
...another will become useless.

479
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,660
What's the point of rushing?

480
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,890
-You're back, Father.
-Why did you drink so much?

481
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,880
Tell the servants to make
honey water and bring it to him.

482
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,140
-Yes.
-Let us go. Aigoo!

483
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,670
You...

484
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,400
Do you want to go see the palace?

485
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,410
What?

486
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,770
If you want,

487
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,610
I can have you live there.

488
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,830
Queen's father.

489
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,490
The father of the queen.

490
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,880
Why do you need
a letter paper suddenly, Young Miss?

491
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,940
-Do you plan on writing a letter?
-Not a simple letter,

492
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,360
-but an apology.
-What?

493
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,940
Why are you writing an apology
on such expensive paper?

494
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,000
You can just see him and apologize
until your hands become raw.

495
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,030
It's because he's not a person
I can see whenever I please.

496
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,160
Well, is the person His Majesty
or the Crown Prince?

497
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,390
Just apologize or get hit a few times.

498
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,680
I don't care if I am
physically punished...

499
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,670
...but I'm afraid that something
may happen to my brother.

500
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,850
I'm sorry, Milady.

501
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,600
I'll just be a minute.
I want to go to the blacksmith.

502
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,880
Just a minute!

503
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,150
Have the two of you
really done something wrong?

504
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,030
Milady, Milady.

505
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,110
Where do you keep your eyes?!

506
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,880
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

507
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,480
Are you all right, Milady?

508
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,360
Where are you touching
with your dirty hands?

509
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,480
It's fine, Nanny.
It's not like she did it on purpose.

510
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,430
You seem like you're in a hurry.

511
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,290
I'm fine, so get along.

512
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,320
Thank you. Milady, thank you!

513
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,050
Oh yes. Here you go. Goodbye.

514
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,760
We're here to pick up the hair piece
that we ordered the other day.

515
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,460
Yes, hold on a moment.

516
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,160
-What's wrong, Nanny?
-The purse...

517
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,580
Milady, wait a moment.

518
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,530
It's dangerous, so go over there.

519
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,740
Ahjussi, even with things like that,

520
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,040
don't you make weapons?
The ones that fighters use!

521
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,500
Why are you doing this?

522
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,130
Do you really not know why?

523
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,680
-Hand over the purse.
-What purse?

524
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,760
Do you think I wouldn't know?

525
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,760
You bumped into the miss and pretended
to dust her off and stole the purse!

526
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,370
I didn't steal it.

527
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,550
Have you ever seen
such a treacherous wretch before?

528
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,280
Will you hand it over
if you have thief written on your face?

529
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,860
Where is it? Where did you hide it?

530
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,110
I didn't steal it!

531
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,240
-I didn't do it!
-Stop it, Nanny.

532
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,000
Milady.

533
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,610
There are a lot of people watching,
how can you act so irrationally?

534
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,670
Please believe me, Milady.
I didn't steal it.

535
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,330
All right.
You're saying you're innocent, right?

536
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,460
Yes.

537
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,300
Then...

538
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,280
Prove it.

539
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,900
That you're not a thief.

540
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,870
Enough looking at the flowered paper.

541
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:03,510
Why should you put
a flower pattern on an apology?

542
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,170
If I were you, for the king...

543
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,570
Get this one down here,
with the four gracious plants.

544
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,460
I said it's not the King,
so why do you keep saying that?

545
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,640
Then, is it the Crown Prince?

546
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,330
Oh, it must be the Crown Prince then.

547
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,240
Then it's even better.

548
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,150
I am the Crown Prince's brother.

549
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,630
The Crown Prince's tastes, let's see.

550
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,620
But...

551
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,830
...what did you do wrong
that you're writing an apology?

552
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,780
Wow!

553
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,740
This is a greenhouse, isn't it?

554
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,500
Oh, you know!

555
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,960
I've only seen them in books.
It's my first time seeing it, actually.

556
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,860
That lattice window is made
with oil based paper.

557
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,850
It's to let in the sun
and block out the wind, right?

558
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,570
Is this yours?

559
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,400
Among my kinsmen, there's a man
who is obsessed with vegetation.

560
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,430
Since he can't obtain a government office,

561
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:56,140
he was sulking about and wasted his money
to make this greenhouse.

562
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,430
The reason why my brother
has to live like that is because of me.

563
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,640
I don't know if he's worried
about my father,

564
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,910
but it's been a long time
since he has come to see me.

565
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,400
Thanks to that man,
I use this place once in a while.

566
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,880
It's the perfect place
to dry wet clothes, right?

567
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,890
Prince Yang Myung,

568
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,420
I've heard it's been a long time
since you've gone to the palace.

569
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,870
Here, what do you think of this?

570
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:32,990
This chrysanthemum is the one flower
that the King likes,

571
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,650
so at every event it is always included.

572
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,970
If this is it, won't it be better
than a letter of apology?

573
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,910
What kind of a person is the king?

574
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,110
I'm curious about
what kind of a person he is.

575
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,450
Um, well...

576
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,400
What kind of a person should I say he is?

577
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:03,310
The King is a man whose face
is bright like the stars.

578
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,530
He always contemplates about what
he has to do for citizens and officials.

579
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,480
Zengzi's "The Great Learning".

580
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,980
How arrogant of you!

581
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,770
You're nothing but
an illegitimate prince,

582
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,260
and yet study The Great Learning,

583
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,530
which for ages has prepared
kings to rule over their subjects?

584
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:30,970
Though he is severe, he is a free person.

585
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,450
Oh, my Crown Prince has come.

586
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,780
I heard that you finished
your literature studies quickly.

587
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,400
For the teachers and tutors
who taught the Crown Prince well.

588
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,250
I will give a big reward.

589
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,520
Well, anyway, he's an amazing person.

590
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:08,010
Are you not going to the palace?

591
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,610
I heard that you haven't been there
since your return from your journey.

592
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,110
Did you hear from Yeom?

593
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:20,580
No. I just think he's waiting for you.

594
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,790
Who is waiting for me?

595
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,010
The Crown Pri...

596
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,470
No. I mean,

597
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,230
The King is waiting,
and the Crown Prince, as well.

598
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,110
They are busy people. Do you think
they'll have time to wait for me?

599
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,350
They are waiting for you.

600
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,120
For someone who writes poetry,
do you not know what longing is?

601
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,060
When we miss so dearly it hurts,
it becomes longing.

602
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,760
Why then do you think...

603
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:52,910
...the Crown Prince
tried to climb over a wall?

604
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:55,880
Then...

605
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,980
...when I scale your wall in the dark,
you must understand.

606
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,810
This and that are two different...

607
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,280
How are they different?

608
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,410
An... Anyway.

609
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,620
Go pay your respects
and greet them a day sooner.

610
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,160
I'm being serious.
Why are you laughing at me?

611
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,580
It's been a long time...

612
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,150
...since you've stared at me in the face
and talked to me for a long time.

613
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,320
Thank you for your warning...

614
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,780
...but you should worry about yourself.

615
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,440
Tell me who your master is!

616
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,280
That way I can get
the money that you stole!

617
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,600
Why can't you tell me who your master is?

618
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,010
You and your master
are working together, right?

619
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,890
You wretch!

620
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,120
Before I hand you over
to the police, talk!

621
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,630
You wretch!

622
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,490
Then why didn't you watch
where you were going?

623
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,260
I'll make you open your mouth.

624
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,830
If you thought you'd be safe
after soiling my favorite clothes...

625
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,950
...you're sorely mistaken.

626
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,930
-Did you say stealing?
-Yes.

627
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,560
Of all people, she touched
the Minister of Personnel's belongings.

628
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,270
She was going to be dragged to the court

629
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,290
and have thief engraved in her face,

630
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:49,680
but the young miss barely ended it
and took her to their house.

631
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,590
You wretch.

632
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,660
-Bring the straw mat!
-Yes.

633
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,400
Seol!

634
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,970
Milady.

635
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,550
Are you OK? Are you all right?

636
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,530
What are you doing?

637
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,540
Even if she did do something wrong,
how can you do this to a person...

638
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,950
What is the commotion about?

639
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,570
Excuse me.

640
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,950
I am the Chief Scholar's daughter,
Heo Yeon Woo.

641
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,270
I heard that my maid stole your purse.

642
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,330
I think that there's a mistake here.

643
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,050
What do you think you're doing?
I told you to find out the truth.

644
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,290
-Who told you to punish her like this?
-But...

645
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,570
You said to beat her
to the brink of death earlier, Milady.

646
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,080
I'm sorry, Milady.

647
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,220
You told me to send her back
but my anger did not subside, so...

648
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,340
You're apologizing to the wrong person!

649
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,010
I'm sorry.

650
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,650
No matter how much I asked,
she wouldn't say whose maid she was.

651
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,220
The ignorant servants did this
without knowing, so please forgive us.

652
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,820
It's hard to control those
who work for us.

653
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:31,460
However, her habit of stealing
is not being fixed.

654
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,380
So before she becomes a bigger thief...

655
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,250
...I think it'll be a good idea
to sell her.

656
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,620
In any case, for the money you lost,

657
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,710
-I'll send someone to reimburse...
-There's no need for that.

658
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:49,640
Since we hurt your belongings as well,
let us forget this even happened.

659
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,490
Milady.

660
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,250
This child is not a thing
that you buy and sell,

661
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:58,780
but my friend and my family.

662
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,370
What?

663
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:05,140
For me, though there is no division
between the nobles and the commoners,

664
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,960
I believe that there is a division
in personal affairs.

665
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:11,960
Though I do not know how much money
you have lost today...

666
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,040
...do you think it'll amount to the
suffering that this child received today?

667
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,270
What did you say?

668
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,620
So, as I understand
that you're sending her back,

669
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,010
then I will take her home.

670
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,770
Let's go, Seol.

671
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,960
Are you all right?

672
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,120
What kind of girl...

673
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,210
This is my sister's present
for sending her the black taffy.

674
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,580
It looks like it's a plant,
but what did she plant?

675
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,700
I'm not sure of that, either.

676
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,360
It looks like it's a seed
that she got from a greenhouse.

677
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,980
She said if you grow it on a heated floor,
it will have the effects of a greenhouse.

678
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,960
-Then, shall we start cla...
-Tutor Heo,

679
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,520
-what kind of person is your sister?
-What?

680
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,140
She listens to your problems
and gives solutions,

681
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,350
so it's obvious that she's a wise girl.

682
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,130
Exactly, what kind of person is she?

683
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,810
Your Highness,
it's time for your lectures.

684
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,170
It's because your brother-sister
relationship is special, so I am envious.

685
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,560
Every night, I read a book with my sister

686
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,300
and there are a lot of opportunities
for us to discuss many things, so...

687
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,190
You read books with your sister?

688
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,520
Yes, that's correct.

689
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:04,500
Since she was young, she enjoyed
reading books more than my seniors,

690
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,780
so I have a lot to learn
from her, as well.

691
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:11,060
She's the complete opposite
of my sister, Princess Min Hwa.

692
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:16,900
That child only knows the alphabet
and she is such a crybaby!

693
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,470
Min Hwa...

694
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,000
-Look at the way you look.
-Brother, I hate you!

695
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,540
What are you doing right now?

696
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,920
-Why are you doing this?
-You're saying bad things about me.

697
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:42,010
And in front of him!
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you!

698
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:51,230
The Crown Prince is lying to you.
I'm no crybaby, but a pure-hearted lady.

699
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,210
I've nearly finished
memorizing the alphabet.

700
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,660
I understand.

701
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,110
I understand your words perfectly...

702
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,110
...so please stop crying now.

703
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,390
If you continue,
your beautiful face will become ruined.

704
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:11,830
I'm beautiful?

705
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,230
What?

706
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,840
Am I really beautiful?

707
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,570
Milady! Princess! Take her away now.

708
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,060
Look at this handwriting, Hyung Sun.

709
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,610
How can you say that
a 13 year old girl wrote this?

710
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,190
It's amazing that there's a girl
who knows Chinese characters,

711
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,200
but this girl's handwriting
is amazing, as well.

712
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,720
But, what is the content like?

713
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,190
This is Yi Gyu Bo's verse.

714
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,620
A monk who lived in the mountains...

715
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,110
...wanted to have the moonlight.

716
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:03,170
So he gathered the moonlight in a bottle.

717
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,960
He went back
to the temple and realized...

718
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,480
...that when the bottle was emptied,

719
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,280
the moonlight was gone.

720
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,340
A bottled up moonlight...

721
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,870
...is impossible to have.

722
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,800
What is the point of remembering
a maiden's mistake?

723
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,040
Please forget about what happened
at the Hidden Moon Pavilion.

724
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:33,970
I'm repenting.

725
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,630
It seems like she has already solved
the riddle I have given her.

726
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,190
Forget?

727
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,430
I thought she was wise,
but she's foolish, isn't she?

728
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,170
How can I forget about you?

729
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,950
Princess. Princess!

730
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,350
Father!

731
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,640
It's Princess Min Hwa.

732
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,200
Father,
are you in good health today, as well?

733
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,280
Now that I have seen
my Princess Min Hwa...

734
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,030
...any illness I may have had is all gone!

735
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,480
Then why has my princess
come all the way to the Palace Hall?

736
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,300
Father, I want to learn to read, as well.

737
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,560
Oh! My Princess has become interested
in learning words?

738
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,850
Yes! I want to learn
from the Crown Prince's tutor, as well.

739
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,910
Are you referring to Tutor Heo?

740
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,490
Yes.

741
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,300
You can't.

742
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:11,720
Why is it impossible?

743
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,570
He is the Crown Prince's teacher.

744
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,610
-Learning from his teacher...
-I don't like that!

745
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,960
I will learn from Tutor Heo!

746
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,650
Didn't I say no?

747
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,080
There are some things you can have
and others that you cannot.

748
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,290
Please kill me.

749
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,470
A book boy?

750
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,800
Yes, Your Highness.

751
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:56,770
Just as a book boy was used
to prepare a future Crown Prince...

752
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,940
...prepare one for the princess as well

753
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,630
by choosing a daughter of the ministers.

754
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,130
How about choosing out of the daughters,

755
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:12,210
one who is personable and smart?

756
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,960
Normally, only the Crown Prince
had someone to accompany him.

757
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,600
Although this has never been done before,

758
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:22,300
for the Princess's learning,
it may not be a bad idea.

759
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,960
Then, is there a lady
you would recommend?

760
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,800
When considering age and morality,

761
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,160
the Minister of Personnel's daughter
is worth recommending.

762
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,520
The Minister of Personnel's daughter,
that's good.

763
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,790
What about bringing in
Director Heo's daughter as well?

764
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,790
The Princess's book girl?

765
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,460
Yes.

766
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:09,580
Every three days,
you will accompany the princess

767
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,330
and listen to the Queen's teachings
with her.

768
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,360
Do you want to try?

769
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,530
Entering the palace?

770
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:17,660
You don't want to?

771
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,470
That's not it.

772
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,120
If it's not something you want, tell me.

773
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,910
I will tell His Majesty.

774
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,950
Why aren't you sleeping?

775
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:54,860
Why? Yeon Woo does not want
to be a book girl?

776
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:57,630
She said she would.

777
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,840
Then why?

778
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:06,870
The palace is a place where you have
to be cautious of every step you take.

779
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,260
To bring two of our children into a place
like that doesn't make me comfortable.

780
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:20,950
She's just going to become
the Princess's companion.

781
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:27,510
If there are no hidden causes,
then nothing can be done.

782
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:32,770
Are you saying there's a hidden reason
for being a book girl?

783
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,150
You're just over-thinking.

784
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,930
She's a young girl
who doesn't know politics.

785
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:45,910
I'm uneasy about this.

786
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,330
Very uneasy.

787
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,070
Our Yeon Woo was born with a noble fate.

788
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:01,190
Someone once said
that she'll risk her life for hers.

789
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,790
Who said that?

790
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,920
Someone said that, so don't worry.

791
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,790
You should go in and sleep.

792
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,890
Ari, have you been well?

793
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:49,920
I'm sorry I couldn't visit often.

794
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,040
My life end here.

795
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,150
You have to live and protect
that child in my stead.

796
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,540
Tell me, Ari.

797
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:11,020
Who is the child that I have to protect?

798
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,450
Princess Min Hwa is still childish,
so I am worried.

799
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,550
Don't worry.

800
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:28,660
Once she spends time with the ministers'
daughters, she will start to mature.

801
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:37,550
Queen Mother, Seongsucheong's
shaman has arrived at the palace.

802
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:40,680
Oh, is that so?
It seems like she hurried here.

803
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,200
If it's Seongsucheong's shaman,

804
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,140
then are you imploring on an ivy to bring
good fortune to your family?

805
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,030
I had her come to look at the children's
physiognomy to choose the book girls.

806
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,140
Why the book girls' physiognomy?

807
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:05,080
In any case, aren't they children
we're bringing into the palace?

808
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:09,020
Cautious. You must be cautious.

809
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,780
Who knows?

810
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,870
If amongst the two, there might be one
who will become the Crown Prince's wife.

811
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,350
What?

812
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:23,470
From now on,
you will have a lot of responsibilities.

813
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:42,990
If she goes near the sun,
she will face disaster.

814
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,630
She is a child whose fate forces her
to stand by the sun's side.

815
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,990
Please protect her
and make sure she is safe.

816
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,590
There are two moons.

817
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:48,010
Two moons... Two suns...

818
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,950
What kind of joke is faith playing?

819
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,750
Can it be that I can see her again?

820
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,160
Please escape.

821
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,590
This isn't a fate
that the young miss can handle.

822
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,090
Don't let there be any more connection
between you two.

823
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,700
Do you know who I am?

824
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:07,730
You are this country's...

825
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,170
Crown Prince,

826
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,600
Lee Hwon.
