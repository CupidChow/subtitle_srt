(Episode 10)

18
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,800
Su Yu, it is your school uniform for tomorrow.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,480
I've washed it. I'll put it here.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,512
Okay.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,300
I asked your dad to buy you a cell phone.

22
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,120
I saw all your classmates have one.

23
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,860
I-I don't need it.

24
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,199
The school doesn't allow it.

25
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:57,959
You should use it.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,512
I see you've been using your phone
for a long time.

27
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:02,119
It's time for a change.

28
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,560
Why don't you need it?

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,239
If it weren't for Wu Bi
having a phone yesterday,

30
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,720
we wouldn't have been able to contact you.

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,639
You were looking for me last night?

32
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,880
I thought you hadn't noticed.

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,839
How could we not look for you

34
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,880
when a living person like you disappears?

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,919
Your dad and I were so worried.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
Alright, just take it and use it.

37
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,568
Thank you, auntie.

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,180
Su Yu, please organize these documents

39
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,160
from your classmates
and see if anyone's missing.

(Student Information Form)

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm your brother. You're my little brother.

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,720
We're not redundant to each other.

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,619
So I was moved for nothing.

44
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,800
All this fuss just to take advantage of me.

45
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,520
XY plus Y.

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,639

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,559
Little brother, you're working so hard.

48
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,568
What did you call me?

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,560
This is the birth date
on my household registration permit.

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,160
It was registered late.

51
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,320
Stop it, just call me brother.

52
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,759
Well, I have to go to the bathroom.

53
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,640
Don't try to escape.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,880
Just call me brother.

55
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,679
Don't pretend to be my relative.

56
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,759
Do I know you? Get out of the way.

57
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,759
Right, left.

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,500
Left, right, left.

59
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,840
Brother, don't touch mine.

60
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,848
I'm punching myself.

61
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,559
Look, look at my move.

62
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,359
Su, Su, come in here.

63
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,799
I'll be there.

64
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,079
There's something I want to talk to you.

65
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,104
Go ahead.

66
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,000
Isn't the lease of my little room up

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,159
on the 10th of next month?

68
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,820
I don't need to rent it anymore after that.

69
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,679
We'll save several hundred a month.

70
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,500
I was thinking

71
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,620
if we rent out this house,

72
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,200
and add the two sums of money together,

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,480
we could rent a bigger one.

74
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,679
It's not that I think this house is cramped.

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,120
I mainly consider the two kids.

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
Look at Su Yu.

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
He's a teenager now.

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,799
He definitely needs his own room, right?

79
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,000
Duo is not small either.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
She can't always sleep with us.

81
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,799
Su Yu is going to be a senior next year.

82
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,760
Duo is so naughty
and the house isn't soundproof.

83
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,679
What if she affects him?

84
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,080
Women are meticulous in life indeed.

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,860
We two men

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,239
never thought about this.

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,640
We have to think about it.

88
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,080
I've thought it all through.

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,620
Starting tomorrow,

90
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,080
I'll run the stall earlier

91
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,140
and clock off later.

92
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,559
Earn a bit more.

93
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,440
You're already so tired.

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,679
Don't bother.

95
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,040
I'll work part-time every night from now on.

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll do some gig jobs on weekends.

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
That will do.

98
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,519
Fine.

99
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,320
Then let's both work hard together.

100
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,440
Anyway, we'll just have to
struggle this one year.

101
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,399
Next year, when Su Yu gets into college,

102
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,040
we can move back.
By then, we won't be so tight.

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,959
Okay, I'll listen to you.

104
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:16,544
(Beijing Riyue Weiming Senior High School)

105
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,816
Su Yu.

106
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,976
Stop.

107
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,480
I heard your dad got married.

108
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,840
So what?

109
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,940
Why can you accept your dad's second marriage,

110
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,399
but not accept mine?

111
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,519
What I don't accept is not your marriage,

112
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,632
but you.

113
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,119
Your house is so small.

114
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,520
That woman even brings a daughter.

115
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,239
How can four people
squeeze into those two small rooms?

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,860
You should move over and live with Mom.

117
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,420
I could take good care of you then.

118
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,600
It's impossible for him to move over

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
and live with you.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
Wu Bi.

121
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,000
What I meant was not what you thought.

122
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,600
You've been away for so long, so I…

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,879
What I mean is

124
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,760
he can't move in with you.

125
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,239
He has to live with me.

126
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,119
What's going on?

127
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,959
What nonsense were you talking about?

128
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,239
I didn't talk any nonsense.

129
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,420
Isn't your house partitioned?

130
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,300
I rented the next house.

131
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,359
It's two rooms in total.

132
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,720
You can move over and live with me.

133
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,279
Why would you rent a small flat,

134
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,380
instead of living in
your own luxurious three-bedroom apartment?

135
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,020
I've lived in worse before.

136
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,160
The small room I rented before
was even shabbier.

137
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,540
You rented it before to cover a lie.

138
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,640
What's your motive now?

139
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,080
To be closer to the school and your house.

140
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,208
It's more convenient to mooch off you.

141
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,420
Right, I've been freeloading all day.

142
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,640
I'd feel guilty

143
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,839
if I don't free up a room.

144
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,239
Don't bother.
Just mooch off less in the future.

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,559
That's not fair.

146
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,879
As you know, your dad just got married.

147
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,780
We're now a blended family.

148
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,040
So, we should take care of each other.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,380
What does the marriage with Ms. Zhou
have to do with you?

150
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,019
If there's a blended family,
it involves me and Duo.

151
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,040
You're not even

152
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,279
remotely related.

153
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,519
Who was the one
that forced me to call you "Brother" yesterday?

154
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,080
You're the one who jumped to conclusions,

155
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
and now you're turning your back on me?

156
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,839
Brother, Brother, wait for me, Brother.

157
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,400
Wu Bi, come pick up the stuff.

158
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,832
Coming.

159
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,239
I didn't expect

160
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,639
that I help you move but to my own home.

161
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,280
Uncle, do you still charge for this move?

162
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,359
How can I charge you?

163
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,519
You've brought Su Yu over.

164
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,259
I don't have to rent a big house anymore.

165
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,080
I'll cover all the meals from now on.

166
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,919
Uncle, I know you well, right?

167
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,088
Well, you see…

168
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
What are you talking about? Look so gloating.

169
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,848
Nothing much.

170
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,080
There's a big box outside. Come help me.

171
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,128
Okay.

172
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,879
Uncle, I'll put it here, okay?

173
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,200
Okay, put it here.

174
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,256
I'll go now, uncle.

175
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,159
Daddy, look at this little statue.
It's so cute.

176
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,699
You can't touch Brother Wu Bi's things
without his permission.

177
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:41,799
It's a piece of art.

178
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,599
Why does it look so familiar?

179
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,960
Dad, do we have a pair of pliers at home?

180
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Yes, yes, we do.

181
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,919
We have everything except money.

182
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,200
Dinner's ready!

183
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,440
So handsome.

184
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,200
Look.

185
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,480
What's wrong?

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,000
How's my hairstyle? Is it good?

187
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,448
Handsome, handsome, handsome.

188
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm sorry. The pen slipped.

189
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,100
The school has stipulated

190
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,680
students are not allowed to perm their hair.

191
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,744
And you dare to do it?

192
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,359
Sir, it's a one-time thing.

193
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,520
It'll be gone after one wash.

194
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,379
Go, now, go wash it.

195
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,880
Sir, well,

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,559
I need a special solution to wash it.

197
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,780
Can I wash it when I get home?

198
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,720
Fine, call your parents

199
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,080
and ask them to bring the solution over.

200
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
No, no, no.

201
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,679
Sir, my parents have gone back to the Northeast
and there's no one at home.

202
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,880
Then go find a hair salon
and get your hair straightened.

203
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,880
Sir, my hair just got softened
when it was permed.

204
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,320
If it softens again, it will all break.

205
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,280
Then cut it.

206
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,440
Cut it? How much should I cut?

207
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,620
Cut until there are no curls left.

208
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,579
Sir, my hair has been permed
right to the roots.

209
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,000
Wherever I cut, there will be curls.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,119
Then shave it.

211
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,540
Sir, what's the purpose
of you asking me to shave it?

212
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,860
Why do you think?

213
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,440
Look at your hair.

214
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,559
You're the most conspicuous
in the whole school now.

215
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,220
Sir, don't you think

216
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,320
that baldness is more conspicuous
than curly hair?

217
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:20,864
Fine.

218
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:21,919
So you permed a hair

219
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,599
that even the teacher can't help with, right?

220
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
There is even a girl
who dares to perm her hair.

221
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
Here comes Mao Chong.

222
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,479
Why is it her again? She's like a bad penny.

223
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:48,640
Let's go.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
A few days ago it was a couple wear,

225
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,719
and today it's a couple hairstyle.
Quite high-profile, huh?

226
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,000
Get lost.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,176
Alright.

228
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,119
I'll go shave it now.

229
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,880
What are you doing?

230
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,248
Do it yourself.

231
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,620
It will take long if I do it myself.

232
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not like you have to cook.

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,239
What are you in such a hurry for?

234
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,479
I have no idea now.

235
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,880
Come here. I'll teach you.

236
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,599
Look,

237
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,520
first draw an auxiliary line here.

238
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,880
Then, this side is--

239
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,640
Who is it?

240
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,616
Help me answer it.

241
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Hello.

242
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,896
I'm Wu Bi.

243
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,239
Su Yu is doing his homework. What's up?

244
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,119
If there's nothing else,
why are you calling? Bye.

245
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,280
How's that?

246
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,239
From now on, answer these calls for me.

247
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,736
Come on.

248
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,912
Where's Su Yu?

249
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,460
Su Yu will have a speech in a few days

250
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,479
and he's writing his script now.

251
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,060
Don't stand here. Go rest in your room.

252
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,239
Never mind. I want to learn from you.

253
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,559
Learn what? Learn to cook?

254
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,200
What does a boy like you
need to learn to cook for?

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,599
I want to learn it

256
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,039
and cook for the person I love.

257
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,599
She's really lucky then.

258
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,039
These kids nowadays know everything.

259
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,620
Found you.

260
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,872
Alright.

261
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,340
Now it's your turn to hide.

262
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,359
I'll close my eyes and count to ten.

263
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,039
Tell me when you're done.

264
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,840
One.

265
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,980
Two.

266
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,479
Three.

267
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,960
Four.

268
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,300
Five.

269
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,580
Six.

270
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,760
Seven.

271
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,920
Eight.

272
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,220
Nine.

273
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Ten.

274
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,680
Are you done?

275
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,760
Yes.

276
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,500
Duo, why aren't you coming in to eat yet?

277
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,839
We're all waiting for you.

278
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,439
I'm playing hide and seek with Xiaowu.

279
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,319
I have to find him.

280
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,280
Then hurry up.

281
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,560
Has Xiaowu already gone home?

282
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,319
Alright, I admit defeat. Come out.

283
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,139
It's so late now.

284
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:50,720
Xiaowu must have gone home for dinner.

285
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,000
Only you, still waiting here foolishly.

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,940
No way. He would never break his promise.

287
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,359
Xiaowu, are you still there?

288
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,599
If you're there, answer me.

289
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,599
Who's that so late?

290
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,360
Are those two kids from next door?

291
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,239
When have they ever knocked on the door?

292
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,420
Xiaowu's mom.

293
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,480
Where's Xiaowu?

294
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,740
He hasn't come home?

295
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,640
No. I thought

296
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,880
he was having dinner at your house,

297
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,079
so I come late to pick him up.

298
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,304
What?

299
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,560
I'm hidden!

300
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,176
Am I hearing things?

301
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,479
I'm hidden!

302
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
What's going on?

303
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,719
Just moved in and it's haunted.

304
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,200
What happened?

305
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,224
There's someone.

306
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Wake up.

307
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,520
Little brother.

308
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Cowardly little brother.

309
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,199
Call it again, call it again.

310
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,719
Stop it, stop it, I'm going to shower.

311
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:50,688
Hello?

312
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,280
Who is that?

313
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,576
He is showering.

314
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,260
I told you he is showering.

315
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,640
How can he answer the phone while showering?

316
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,280
Why are there so many girls
throwing themselves at Su Yu?

317
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,219
He already has someone he likes.

318
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,400
Stop disturbing him.

319
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,079
Please, I really miss him.

320
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,239
I heard there's a basketball court
in the nearby park.

321
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,352
Would you like go play it?

322
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,780
Sure, but we don't
have a basketball at my house.

323
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,800
Did you bring one?

324
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,240
I didn't bring one either.

325
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,479
What about buying one?

326
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,839
No need. Han Bokuang has one.

327
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,904
I'll go borrow it.

328
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,984
Where does he live?

329
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,160
Next door to the left.

330
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,820
Okay, I'll go.

331
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,899
Dry your hair quickly.

332
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,000
Don't get sick.

333
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:53,984
Don't go to his house like…

334
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:17,888
You…

335
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
Uncle, hello, I'm Han Bokuang's classmate.

336
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,719
Well, B-Bokuang.

337
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,592
Someone needs you.

338
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:35,280
W-What brings you here?

339
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
I came to borrow a basketball from you.

340
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,239
Okay, wait for me.

341
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,384
Here.

342
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:45,472
I'm leaving.

343
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,992
Bokuang,

344
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,740
look at him.

345
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,760
How manly this young man is.

346
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,439
You should learn from him.

347
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,580
Dad, how can I compare with him?

348
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,199
Last time our class
had a wrestling match with their class.

349
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:10,439
He alone wrestled with our whole class.

350
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,520
Why can't you be his rival?

351
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,920
Listen, like father, like son.

352
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,800
I've been raising you

353
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,239
as a real man since you were a child.

354
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,319
You, come here.

355
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,376
What for?

356
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:26,496
Climb the wall.

357
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Up.

358
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,900
Dad, I can't get over it.

359
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,160
You can't get over it. You can't…

360
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,520
T-Try it.

361
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,192
Bokuang,

362
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,040
just keep practicing.

363
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,880
As you're so tall, if you can't climb it,

364
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,199
that's just unreasonable.

365
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,800
When I was a kid,

366
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,800
your grandpa told me
that with my height, I could be a pilot.

367
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,920
I believed him, but I didn't grow tall at all.

368
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,400
Don't stop, don't stop.

369
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,720
Up.

370
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,439
You're so tall
and you can't even jump over this.

371
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,319
It's just that I'm old.

372
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,359
I tell you.

373
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,920
Thirty years younger,

374
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,640
and I would be able to flip over it
without stepping on anything.

375
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,384
Oh, shit.

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,056
Dad,

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm out of strength.

378
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,640
Son, forget it.

379
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,040
I am long past my prime.

380
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,816
Hubby,

381
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,520
you've been overseas for business
for over two months.

382
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,120
How are things going with the branch office?

383
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,000
Still negotiating. It's a bit tricky.

384
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,279
Take good care of yourself.

385
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,760
Okay, you too, take care.

386
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:37,760
Oh, do you know where Wu Bi is living now?

387
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
He's living in International Trade Apartments.

388
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,896
What's up?

389
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,680
I just think he's still a kid

390
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,359
and I'm not very at ease with him living alone.

391
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,440
I want to go over and cook for him.

392
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,820
And clean up a bit.

393
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,279
I've asked the maid to make a key.

394
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,400
You can go over anytime.

395
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,319
Okay. What does Wu Bi like to eat?

396
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:06,752
Wu Bi.

397
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,496
Wu Bi.

398
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,239
Where on earth did this kid go?

399
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,719
So many sets of papers for a weekend.

400
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,359
How can I finish them all?

401
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,920
There's plenty of time.

402
00:27:40,096 --> 00:27:41,184
What?

403
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,616
Do it yourself.

404
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,640
I just want to check the progress.

405
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
This is the progress.

406
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,680
You've done
three sets of math papers in an hour.

407
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,920
These are all set to be done
in 120 minutes separately.

408
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:06,976
I…

409
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,704
Bend over here.

410
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:19,380
What for?

411
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,079
Just do what I say.

412
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,472
Have a rest.

413
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,920
Isn't there a pillow there?

414
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,959
Why don't you lie on the pillow to rest?

415
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,160
This pillow isn't as soft as you are, is it?

416
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,280
Look at your silly face.

417
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:12,243
♫ You said you would ♫

418
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,652
♫ Protect me ♫

419
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:19,471
♫ And no matter how dangerous ♫

420
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:21,952
♫ You wouldn't leave ♫

421
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,659
Is it time for me to lay down for a while?

422
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:27,680
Not allowed.

423
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,620
Why not?

424
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,120
I've let you lie down for so long.

425
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,300
Why not let me lie down?

426
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,079
That's because you were happy to let me lie.

427
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,160
Wait until you catch up with my progress.

428
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:39,104
Don't move.

429
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:44,064
♫ And trying everything with me ♫

430
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,008
♫ Good or bad, it doesn't matter ♫

431
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:51,168
♫ As long as we're by each other's side ♫

432
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:54,718
♫ Thank you for never holding back ♫

433
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:58,167
♫ Even if it means giving your all to me ♫

434
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:01,760
♫ You've done enough ♫

435
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,368
♫ This time I'll guard you in return ♫

436
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:22,304
♫ It's not because I am cold ♫

437
00:30:23,776 --> 00:30:26,016
♫ Nor intend to hide from you ♫

438
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:29,888
♫ It's just because I am not expressive ♫

439
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,640
♫ So, I have to keep silent ♫

440
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,768
♫ I know you are not only ♫

441
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:40,896
♫ The most important person in my life ♫

442
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:46,272
♫ But also my family ♫

443
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:51,136
♫ Thank you
for accompanying me on this journey ♫

444
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,570
♫ And trying everything with me ♫

445
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,016
♫ Good or bad, it doesn't matter ♫

446
00:30:58,016 --> 00:31:01,760
♫ As long as we're by each other's side ♫

447
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,255
♫ Thank you for never holding back ♫

448
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,200
Hello?

449
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,000
Hold on.

450
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,768
♫ This time I'll guard you in return ♫

451
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,536
So early?

452
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,640
My brother came back from abroad
and asked me to pick him up at the airport.

453
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:41,120
Your biological one?
Never heard you mention him.

454
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,760
My cousin.

455
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,359
He lives abroad.

456
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,840
We seldom met.

457
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,380
He returned for business this time

458
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,719
and visited his family by the way.

459
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:51,800
He might leave in a few days.

460
00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:53,960
Take care.

461
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,000
Go sleep.

462
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:33,282
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

463
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:40,042
♫ You're such a beautiful flower ♫

464
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:46,914
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

465
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,602
♫ You're the summer I can't bear to part with ♫

466
00:32:56,628 --> 00:33:00,760
♫ You always have so many ideas ♫

467
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:07,778
♫ Occasionally, you're not so obedient ♫

468
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,562
♫ But it's you who bring the worries ♫

469
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:21,749
♫ That make a complete family ♫

470
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:25,378
♫ From today, every minute and second ♫

471
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:29,218
♫ Will be the treasure of my life ♫

472
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,226
♫ Because with you by my side ♫

473
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:35,042
♫ Everything becomes beautiful ♫

474
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,042
♫ From today, every moment and instant ♫

475
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:42,946
♫ Will be the happiest time in life ♫

476
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:48,194
♫ No matter where you are, home will be ♫

477
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:52,450
♫ In that place ♫

478

♫ In that place ♫
