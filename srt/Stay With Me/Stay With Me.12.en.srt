(Stay With Me)

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,346
(Episode 12)

18
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,880
What are you doing?

19
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:48,928
Su Yu.

20
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,400
Today's situation was just a misunderstanding.

21
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,000
Those two security guards got it wrong.

22
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,839
Why did you send someone to watch me?

23
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,000
Su Yu, listen to me.

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,720
I was really doing this for your own good.

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,639
I still remember what you said that night.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,800
I don't want you to make the same mistake.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,952
You have to go?

28
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,440
How can I stay here in this state?

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,759
What would my dad say if he saw me?

30
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,919
Then where are you going?

31
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,160
Where I'm going is none of your business.

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,399
You're not going to find her, are you?

33
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, I'm going to find her.

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,919
Can you let go?

35
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,520
Are you telling the truth?

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,919
Whether what I said is true or false,

37
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,160
don't you know?

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,848
Let go.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,039
Let go.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,888
Let go!

41
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,440
How have you been lately?

42
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
So-so, how about you?

43
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm okay.

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Come here, come here.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,056
Sit here.

46
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:42,840
Let me introduce you.

47
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,679
This is my girlfriend, Ye Wanying.

48
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,399
You've always wanted to meet her, right?

49
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,559
This is my cousin, Wu Bi.

50
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,480
Hello.

51
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,799
I'm going to the restroom.

52
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,640
Me too.

53
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,540
Isn't Su Yu with you?

54
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,160
No, I haven't been able
to contact him these days.

55
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,200
Where did Su Yu go?

56
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,160
What does it matter to you where Su Yu went?

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,339
I beg you.

58
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,160
Can you not tell Su Yu

59
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,360
about me and your brother?

60
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,080
I didn't expose you and Su Yu today.

61
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,900
I've already given you a face.

62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,096
What?

63
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,320
You're not afraid my brother will know,

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,860
but you're afraid Su Yu will know?

65
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,879
My brother is just playing with me.

66
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,600
He's not short of girlfriends.

67
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,959
I beg you.

68
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,640
Can you not tell him?

69
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,480
I can,

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,040
but you have to promise me one condition.

71
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:02,760
What is it?

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,440
Stop harassing Su Yu.

73
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,416
Why?

74
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,360
Come.

75
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
Let me tell you why.

76
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,839
Su Yu is mine.

77
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,600
Why did it take you so long?

78
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,000
The restroom was crowded.

79
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,399
Have some fruit.

80
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,860
Why did your brother leave so early?

81
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,120
Aren't they on winter break?

82
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,140
I don't know.

83
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,280
He's always so secretive.

84
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
I don't care about the mess
between you and my brother.

85
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,820
But if you dare to hurt Su Yu,

86
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,320
I'll never let you go.

87
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,960
Uncle, Uncle,

88
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,060
Where's Su Yu?

89
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,540
Didn't you go together
to that military winter camp?

90
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,959
Why did only you come back?

91
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,119
He asked me back to get something.

92
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,976
Then go get it.

93
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,839
Uncle,

94
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,600
can I borrow your phone to make a call?

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
I didn't find the thing he asked me to find.

96
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,072
I'm in a hurry to go out
and I didn't bring my phone.

97
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:40,160
Here.

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,180
Su,

99
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,079
is the home gas tank running out of gas?

100
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,220
No.

101
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,280
Come and see.

102
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,480
Dad, what's the matter?

103
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,000
Sure enough, he blacklisted my number.

104
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,360
Hello, Dad, what's wrong?

105
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,440
Why aren't you talking?

106
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:01,824
Su Yu.

107
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,159
Hello, Uncle Zhang.

108
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,320
I have a call record here.

109
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,200
Can you help me check
the specific location of it?

110
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,900
It is a bit troublesome.

111
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,460
We need a professional operator.

112
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,400
The ones on duty today can't handle it.

113
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,200
Uncle Zhang, please help me.

114
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:43,859
I'll give it a try,

115
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,740
but it won't be that fast. Can you wait?

116
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,760
No problem. As long as you can find it.

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,768
Okay.

118
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,039
It's been days already.

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,159
I can go back now, right?

120
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,799
If my dad asks about the wounds on my face,

121
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,719
just tell him I accidentally bumped it
while doing a task, okay?

122
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,760
Wu Bi

123
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,359
wouldn't have come so soon, would he?

124
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,592
Come in now.

125
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:02,816
Have some hot water.

126
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,320
How did you find this place?

127
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
I've been looking for you for several days,

128
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
searching for your news everywhere.

129
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,320
Then I searched all the internet cafes

130
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,880
and hotels nearby.

131
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,700
I finally found this place.

132
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,840
I thought you were hiding from me.

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,359
Stop crying. It's not because of you.

134
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,640
You can tell me if you dislike me.

135
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,719
Don't hide from me, okay?

136
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,799
Do you know how worried I was about you?

137
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,864
Stop crying.

138
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,320
My hiding here
really has nothing to do with you.

139
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,320
Is it because you have a wound on your face

140
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,080
and you're afraid to go home
and worry your family?

141
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,856
Don't bring it up.

142
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,320
I'll warm a towel for you
and put it on your face.

143
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
It's so cold.

144
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,039
Wait for you to warm up a bit

145
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,080
and I'll take you home.

146
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,000
The heating here is not very warm.

147
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,339
Su Yu, touch my forehead.

148
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,760
Am I having a fever?

149
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,272
Seems like you're a bit warm.

150
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,840
What about taking you to the hospital?

151
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,919
No.

152
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,919
You know I hate hospitals the most.

153
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,419
And now it's past midnight.

154
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:03,799
The hospitals are definitely closed.

155
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:05,728
No worries.

156
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,119
I'll feel better
after sleeping under the covers.

157
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,559
But, well, you…

158
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,900
It snowed heavily today.

159
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,640
I've been out since morning
and it hasn't stopped.

160
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,664
I looked for you everywhere.

161
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,119
I probably caught a cold.

162
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,640
Where are you going?

163
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,488
I'm going to buy medicine for you.

164
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,200
Don't go.

165
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm scared alone.

166
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,440
Don't worry, I won't leave.

167
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I'll stay by your side.

168
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,080
Wait until your fever goes down.

169
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,940
Why don't you go to the front desk
and ask for another blanket?

170
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,039
You should also sleep for a while.

171
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,220
No need. It's already past two.

172
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,719
Hang on a bit more and it'll be dawn.

173
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,360
Sleep now.

174
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:02,267
♫ You said you would ♫

175
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,119
What exactly has changed?

176
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:09,312
♫ And no matter how dangerous ♫

177
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:11,744
♫ You wouldn't leave ♫

178
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,728
Madam, I want to ask about someone.

179
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,752
Who?

180
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,359
His name is Su Yu.
He's a little shorter than me.

181
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,028
♫ You wouldn't leave me behind ♫

182
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:30,208
♫ Thank you for accompanying me
on this journey ♫

183
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
It's past three.

184
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
He's probably asleep.

205
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Seems like the fever is gone.

206
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,080
I'll go down and buy some breakfast.

207
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,320
Finally found you.

208
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Quick, pack your things and go home.

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,280
Uncle is still waiting for you at home.

210
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,320
Alright, I know I was wrong.

211
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,559
Forgive me for the sake
of waiting for you all night.

212
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,296
Su Yu.

213
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,719
Why did you let someone else in?

214
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,380
She had a fever
and stayed here temporarily last night.

215
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,640
It was too late. The clinic was closed.

216
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,640
And there was heavy snow outside.

217
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,760
I didn't feel safe letting her walk alone.

218
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,599
Wu Bi, you--

219
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,800
I only found out
where you were staying at twelve last night.

220
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,280
By the time I found this place,
it was already past three.

221
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,040
I didn't dare to knock on the door
for fear of disturbing your rest.

222
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,736
And then,

223
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
you show me this.

224
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,072
Wu Bi, you--

225
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,119
Good for you.

226
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,119
Are you feeling better? I'll take you home.

227
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,520
Su Yu, there's something

228
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
I don't know if I should tell you.

229
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:58,496
Ho ahead.

230
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm afraid if I do,

231
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,280
it will affect your relationship
with your classmate.

232
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,839
Are you talking about Wu Bi?

233
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,176
Yes.

234
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,976
What happened to him?

235
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
He…

236
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,439
He likes me.

237
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,576
What did you say?

238
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,360
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

239
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,199
It's just that he didn't want me to tell you.

240
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,160
Actually, the first time we met,

241
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,839
he asked for my contact information.

242
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,359
He has been contacting me in private.

243
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,900
A few days ago, you disappeared, right?

244
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,620
I was anxious because I couldn't find you.

245
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,000
Then he asked me to go to the bar.

246
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,320
He lied to me that you were there.

247
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
I was so anxious that I went.

248
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,700
But when I got there,

249
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,239
I found that you weren't there at all.

250
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,060
Everything I said is true.

251
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,920
Apart from him, his cousin was also there.

252
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
His cousin is named Mo Yi, right?

253
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:09,479
Look, I took a picture that night.

254
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,880
Wu Bi threatened me in the bar.

255
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,800
He asked me not to get involved with you.

256
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,239
Or else he will get tough with me.

257
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,119
I'm so scared, Su Yu.

258
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,620
I'm afraid he'll come to me again.

259
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,199
If he tells you anything,

260
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,460
you must not believe him.

261
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,960
He's just trying to defame me

262
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,040
to make you give up.

263
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,840
You can't be with her.

264
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,040
You're overthinking.

265
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,380
We weren't together before.

266
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,599
How could we possibly be now?

267
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:08,704
Why are you

268
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,599
so afraid of me being with her?

269
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,680
Am I?

270
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,359
I-I just think she's not a good person.

271
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,199
Actually, the reason
why those two security guards

272
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,400
beat you up that day at the coffee shop

273
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,380
was also my fault.

274
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,880
I felt guilty.

275
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,400
So I didn't dare to tell you.

276
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,180
Ever since we met at the bar that day,

277
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,179
I haven't contacted Wu Bi again.

278
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,659
He's been looking for me.

279
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:41,119
He even sent people to follow me.

280
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:42,800
Then he tracked me

281
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,519
here.

282
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,479
So, he came over in the middle of the night
with heavy snow

283
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,599
was actually to find you.

284
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,960
Ms. Zhang, you are hanging the lanterns?

285
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,040
Wow, you bought so many.

286
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Pork, huh?

287
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,920
Su, how're the New Year's preparations going?

288
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,060
Mr. Cui,

289
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,920
you sure have bought enough.

290
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,519
Yes, the apples are quite cheap.

291
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,560
Ms. Zhu, are you putting up the couplets?

292
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,719
What do you think?

293
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,719
The writing's not bad.

294
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,959
Su, you've bought quite a lot.

295
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,280
It's okay, not as much as yours.

296
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,032
Look, you bought a lot.

297
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,040
Buy some more later.

298
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,080
Alright.

299
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,719
Su, have you peeled the potatoes?

300
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,079
Those green beans need to be sorted too.

301
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,839
The meat you bought is quite fresh.

302
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,599
What are you waiting for?

303
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:06,479
I feel like
my son's been acting strange lately.

304
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,800
What do you mean your son?

305
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
Our son.

306
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,839
What's wrong with him?

307
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,220
I feel like he's been moody.

308
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,920
And he's always lost in thought.

309
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,960
Yeah.

310
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,719
I think Su Yu

311
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,040
might be in an early relationship.

312
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,239
He's 17. It's not really "early" anymore.

313
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
When I was seventeen,

314
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,920
I was already dating Su Yu's mother.

315
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,920
Can you compare then to now?

316
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,079
The social pressure on kids these days is huge.

317
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,420
I've heard

318
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,779
the second year of high school
is the most critical year.

319
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:48,020
A moment of distraction

320
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,040
could be disastrous.

321
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,400
I trust my son.

322
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,380
But listen to me,

323
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,360
a few days ago
I saw a little girl looking for Su Yu.

324
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,779
They left together

325
00:22:58,779 --> 00:22:59,920
from the entrance of the alley.

326
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,016
Is she pretty?

327
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,239
Quite pretty.

328
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,339
Why are you asking this?

329
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:08,416
No reason.

330
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Anything wrong?

331
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,339
I wanted to explain what happened

332
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:58,760
that day at the guest house.

333
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,960
Explain to me?

334
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,136
Is it necessary?

335
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,159
Because I promised you.

336
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,760
I was afraid you would think
I didn't keep my word.

337
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,280
So I wanted to clarify.

338
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,199
Actually, I did have a fever that night.

339
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,640
It was late and there were no hospitals nearby.

340
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,040
So I stayed at the guest house.

341
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,560
Su Yu did take care of me all night,

342
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,959
but we didn't do anything.

343
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,340
You were so feverish
you ended up at where he stayed

344
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,060
and dare to mention your promise to me.

345
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,140
I didn't go looking for him on purpose.

346
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,599
I promised you
I wouldn't disturb him and I meant it.

347
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,639
It just happened to be a coincidence that day.

348
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,040
I had a cold
and went to the clinic to get medicine.

349
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,640
He was also there to change his medication.

350
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,359
You also saw

351
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,599
his injured face.

352
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,540
Later, when it snowed
and we couldn't get a taxi,

353
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,719
he told me his guest house was nearby

354
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,800
and let me go in.

355
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
All right, the food is ready.

356
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,359
Okay, Su Yu!

357
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,319
Serve the meal.

358
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,959
Su Yu, come here now. I'm scared.

359
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,680
Dad, aunt, you eat first. I'm going out.

360
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Wait.

361
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,080
Why is he leaving when we're about to eat?

362
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,599
Look at the kid.

363
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,719
So I went.

364
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,660
Alright, alright, are you done?

365
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,880
I'm not interested in this.

366
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,319
Do you have anything else? If not, I'm leaving.

367
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,192
Wait a minute.

368
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:33,632
What are you doing?

369
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,020
I think something got into my eye.

370
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,079
Can you help me check?

371
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,512
What are you doing?

372
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,000
I really didn't expect you
to be this kind of person.

373
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,620
I didn't expect you to be this blind.

374
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,800
Su Yu, let's go.

375
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,760
You should apply for a performance arts course.

376
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,119
Not winning an Oscar for best actress

377
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,719
would be a waste of your acting skills.

378
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,880
What are you talking about?

379
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,280
Sister-in-law, that's it.

380
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,160
It's not enough for you
to monopolize one of my brothers.

381
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,280
You even want to mess with two?

382
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,359
What do you mean?

383
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,472
What do I mean?

384
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,120
She, your ex-girlfriend,

385
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,920
is my cousin's girlfriend.

386
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,599
No, he's lying.

387
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,000
It was him who kept pestering me

388
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,139
and didn't want you to know.

389
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,800
You've seen the photos from the bar last time.

390
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,440
How could I possibly lie to you?

391
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,920
Su Yu, you believe me, right?

392
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
You really like her?

393
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,040
Like her my foot.

394
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,180
You believe what she says?

395
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,600
She's clearly trying to sow discord.

396
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,800
I am asking you, do you like her or not?

397
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,784
What are you doing?

398
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,359
When are you going back?

399
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,959
You used to actively ask me
to go back to China.

400
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,479
But why are you urging me
to go abroad every day this time?

401
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,160
I'm just asking casually.

402
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,560
I was planning to stay here with you
for the New Year.

403
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,760
Let's see the situation with the branch office.

404
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,160
Your father definitely can't come back
before the New Year,

405
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:13,760
so I don't want you
to spend the New Year alone.

406
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Even when he's here,
I spend the New Year alone.

407
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,904
Besides,

408
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,959
my girlfriend wants to
spend the New Year in China too.

409
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:26,280
She feels that spending the New Year abroad
lacks the festive atmosphere.

410
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,219
She has already immigrated.

411
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,319
What festive atmosphere does she want?

412
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,959
Somehow I feel

413
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,239
you don't seem to like my girlfriend very much.

414
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Not just a bit.

415
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,920
I really don't.

416
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,176
Why?

417
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Alright.

418
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,040
If you don't like her,

419
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,959
then I'll change to another one.

420
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,979
You don't care that much?

421
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:07,640
Anyway, there are plenty of people who like me.

422
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,479
What if she wants to change you?

423
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,040
That's not possible.

424
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:15,820
Why?

425
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,719
Even if it's something I don't want,

426
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,800
if someone else wants to take it,

427
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,199
there's only one outcome.

428
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,488
What is it?

429
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,319
Death.

430
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,000
Well, forget it. I'll stop the topic.

431
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,359
I can't let Su Yu get into trouble.

432
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,680
Of course, except for you.

433
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,439
Then, change to another one.

434
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,220
What do you mean?

435
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,439
She's been pestering me.

436
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,880
Does Wu Bi really like Ye Wanying?

437
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,160
If he doesn't like her,

438
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,920
why did he treat her that way that day?

439
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,239
If he likes her,

440
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,520
with Wu Bi's temperament,

441
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,280
he shouldn't be afraid to admit it.

442
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,976
So annoying.

443
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,160
I'll do some exercise books to pass the time.

444
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:08,239
It's just one morning,
but why have I finished them all?

445
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:22,319
Come on, let me take a look.

446
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,560
Not bad.

447
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,640
Of course.

448
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,400
My classmates always want to
play it and give me theirs in return.

449
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm reluctant to give it to them.

450
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,040
The cheap guns they bought

451
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,119
can't compare to mine.

452
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,520
It is quite expensive, isn't it?

453
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,400
I don't know. Brother Wu Bi bought it for me.

454
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,000
Brother Wu Bi also bought me
a lot of nice things.

455
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
They're all stored in the side room.

456
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,119
I can't bear to unpack them.

457
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,540
I have to wait for my classmates to come
and then unpack them.

458
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,760
At that time, they will still be new.

459
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,839
I'm telling you,

460
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,400
don't secretly unpack them.

461
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,479
Why hasn't Brother Wu Bi come recently?

462
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,479
He's spending the New Year with his own family.

463
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:18,000
When is he coming back?

464
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,240
Do you like him so much?

465
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,520
Because we sympathize with each other.

466
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,320
Sympathize with each other?

467
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,419
We are both tormented by love.

468
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,560
The last time we talked for a long time,

469
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,379
Brother Wu Bi talked about his inner suffering.

470
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:35,700
I also discovered my own inner suffering.

471
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,040
Brother Wu Bi said we are people
who feel each other.

472
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,680
Later I thought about it,

473
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,000
he was right.

474
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
What the hell is it?

475
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,520
He even talked about this with a child.

476
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,280
Only Wu Bi would do such a thing.

477
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,840
Then tell me,

478
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,500
what is your inner suffering?

479
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,000
I like a boy in our class.

480
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,599
He seems to like me too,

481
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,640
but he always denies it.

482
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,839
Have you experienced the sweetness
after the bitterness?

483
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,800
What does that mean?

484
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,420
Right, you're only eight.

485
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,600
You don't understand so many idioms.

486
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
I just want to ask you

487
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,620
did the boy finally admit it?

488
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,079
I forgot. I've liked several already.

489
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:53,730
