<i>[Episode 21]</i>

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,160
Little brat,

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,184
I…

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,239
If you dare, don't come in.

21
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,919
You can come in whenever you admit defeat.

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,639
<i>No, I have to go in.</i>

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,559
<i>Otherwise, he'll eat
the whole pot of spicy hot pot.</i>

24
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,048
Su Yu.

25
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,080
Uncle, what brings you here?

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,240
I came to see you guys.

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,519
Go, let's go in.

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,759
Wu Bi, open the door.

29
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,679
Can't hold it anymore, huh?

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,528
Wu Bi.

31
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:31,839
You…

32
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,320
You little rascal.

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,199
Dad, welcome.

34
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,579
You're eating.

35
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,720
Yeah,

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,479
why don't you join us?

37
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,800
My dad doesn't like this kind of food.

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,639
Never mind. Help me get the utensils.

39
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,160
It looks average but smells good.

40
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,920
Which one made it?

41
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,488
He did.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,560
Then, I'll try.

43
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,000
<i>The last two meatballs.</i>

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,919
It tastes really good. Delicious.

45
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,880
I've made so much progress in my studies,

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,000
and you didn't praise me,

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,379
but today I made a spicy hot pot,

48
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,639
and look how happy you are.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,620
It is rare for me to be able to

50
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,752
enjoy a meal made by you.

51
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,439
<i>He took one,</i>

52
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,720
<i>which means we have to strive for the last one.</i>

53
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,359
Uncle, I'll do it myself.

54
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,320
- It's nothing.
- It's okay. Don't be polite.

55
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,799
What is this?

56
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,359
Even keep it from me?

57
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,256
Well…

58
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,008
Lip balm.

59
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,559
Even a boy uses such a thing?

60
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,519
Well, it's very moisturizing.

61
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,799
Here, Dad, have a try.

62
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,608
It's moisturizing, right?

63
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,976
Indeed.

64
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,559
Alright, Dad. Let me do it.

65
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,359
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

66
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,559
Luckily it's a brand in English.

67
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
Hello?

68
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
<i>Fly over and help me with something.</i>

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
As I don't know anything, how can I help you?

70
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,640
Just do some simple tasks.

71
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,399
You have so many employees,
but why do you need me?

72
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,280
It is a bit tricky.

73
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,119
I don't want anyone
outside of the family to interfere.

74
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
I haven't even applied for a visa yet.

75
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,780
The school will start soon when I get it.

76
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,480
I'll find someone to help you expedite it.

77
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm not going.

78
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:34,320
If you don't come, I'll take back the shop.

79
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,079
What's wrong?

80
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,096
My brother.

81
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,920
He insists on me going abroad to help him.

82
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,712
Then, go.

83
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,840
If I go, what about you?

84
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,940
Duo is not here.

85
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,260
You'll be alone at home.

86
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,600
I have limbs,

87
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
so what's wrong with being alone?

88
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,799
I can't survive without you?

89
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,579
It's not you that can't survive without me.

90
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,888
It's I…

91
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:07,872
I…

92
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,480
Wait, I know it now.

93
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,119
Have you been hoping that I'll leave?

94
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,160
Do you think I'm annoying?

95
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,200
What are you talking about?

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,096
Come here. Come here!

97
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:25,119
You…

98
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,279
- Let's talk.
- What are you doing?

99
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,000
- Come here.
- Let go.

100
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
Things are almost done.

101
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,919
Then why did you ask me to come?

102
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,280
I have too many chores here.

103
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,120
I need someone to help me with them.

104
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,739
Don't you have an assistant?

105
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:05,280
I know nothing about your business.

106
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,479
What can I help you with?

107
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,280
Isn't this a waste of my time?

108
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,159
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

109
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
What business do you have?

110
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,020
Go to class? Do homework?

111
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,719
This is a matter of life and death.

112
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:19,080
If you're not careful,
you might never see me again.

113
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,599
Does my uncle know about this?

114
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,599
I haven't told him yet.

115
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,000
The old man is easily angered.

116
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,760
If I can suppress this by myself,

117
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,880
I'd rather not alarm him.

118
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,840
What's the next step? What's the plan?

119
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,440
This matter is not serious
but not insignificant either.

120
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,599
I plan to go back to China
to lay low for a while.

121
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,272
You're going back to the country?

122
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,160
For how long?

123
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,400
Not sure yet.

124
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,320
But it won't be short, anyway.

125
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,799
If you're going to stay for a year or so,

126
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,000
how can you keep it from my uncle?

127
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,760
It's okay.

128
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,280
If I can handle it as soon as possible,

129
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,600
I'll take it as a vacation.

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,640
If it takes a while,

131
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,640
I'll lie to him

132
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,060
that the branch has taken on a project,

133
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,320
that needs to be done in the country.

134
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,200
What did you bring me here to help you with?

135
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,760
I have to get all the paperwork done

136
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,799
before I can safely return to China.

137
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:26,080
Now there's a backlog of work at the branch,

138
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,119
and I have to complete them as scheduled.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,020
How long will it take?

140
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,239
Of course, the sooner the better.

141
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,599
You're in a hurry, but I'm even more.

142
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,640
Every extra moment now
will bring an extra bit of danger.

143
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,539
But I have to deal with everything.

144
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:42,679
If there're a few omissions,

145
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,239
it might cause even bigger trouble.

146
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,280
So we need to be quick and steady.

147
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,080
Alright, stop talking.

148
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,039
Just tell me what to do.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,048
Give me your phone.

150
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,280
What for?

151
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,376
Give it to me.

152
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,592
Give it to me.

153
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,296
What are you doing?

154
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,719
I need to eliminate all communication devices.

155
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,599
Your phone's
anti-eavesdropping system is too weak.

156
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,496
From now on,

157
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,119
we can use only one dedicated phone.

158
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,420
Apart from necessary calls,

159
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,840
you're not allowed to touch it at any time.

160
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,840
For the absolute safety of me,

161
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,479
sacrifice yourself for a while.

162
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,200
I can't sacrifice.

163
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,280
No one can't live without their phone.

164
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,320
Having your phone now

165
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,599
brings no benefit to you or me.

166
00:11:59,104 --> 00:12:00,119
Taking your phone

167
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,919
will only greatly reduce your work efficiency,

168
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,599
and delay our task completion.

169
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,599
If you want to leave here soon,

170
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,359
cut off all contact with the outside world,

171
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,599
and do your work for me steadily.

172
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,719
There is so much homework
in the third year of high school.

173
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:30,200
How can I survive this in the future?

174
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,859
I think it's pretty good this way.

175
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:34,000
Or I will have nothing to do.

176
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,180
Why has Wu Bi been absent?

177
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,239
Where did he go?

178
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:43,760
He went abroad.

179
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,039
Went abroad?

180
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,560
He went abroad to study?

181
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,608
No.

182
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,520
His relative is there and needs some help.

183
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
What's matter so important

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,840
that he even skips school?

185
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,472
How would I know?

186
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,500
Did he say when he's coming back?

187
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,239
Whatever.

188
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,104
None of my business.

189
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,479
He left so suddenly. Does he…

190
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,479
What's wrong with you? Did you catch a cold?

191
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,799
It's fine. I just got chills
from sleeping these days.

192
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,919
Su Yu, it's your turn to clean today.

193
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,980
Remember to clean the blackboard.

194
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,080
I know.

195
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,239
Why are you cleaning for him?

196
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,960
He's been coughing these days.

197
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,000
<i>Is the plot going to torture us?</i>

198
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,359
<i>[Grade 3, Class 3]</i>

199
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,479
Alright, dismissed.

200
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,520
What's the plan for the weekend?

201
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,799
What else can I do except for doing homework?

202
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,560
Then why don't we
go to the amusement park together?

203
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,599
I haven't been there yet.

204
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,280
You don't even join me
when the school hunk invites you.

205
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,039
Do you know how many girls

206
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,679
are in line wanting to play with me?

207
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,840
Alright, I'll show respect.

208
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,019
Brother Wu Bi has been gone for almost a month.

209
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:05,599
When can he come back?

210
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,799
He was originally coming back last weekend,

211
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,440
but then he ran into a super hurricane,

212
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,359
and all flights were canceled.

213
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,719
Brother Wu Bi is not here,

214
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,960
and Mom is still taking care of Grandma.

215
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,819
Grandma's condition is getting worse and worse.

216
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:26,859
I don't know when Mom can come back.

217
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,159
Brother, I miss Mom.

218
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,880
I'll take you to
the amusement park this weekend, okay?

219
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,679
I'm too sad now.

220
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,760
I'm not in the mood to play at all.

221
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,799
Brother Mao Chong will go as well.

222
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,280
Brother Mao Chong?
The one who sits next to you,

223
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,479
and we met at the dessert shop last time?

224
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,239
I'll go. I want to go.

225
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,120
Weren't you just feeling sad
and missing your mom?

226
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,180
No, no, no, I need to pull myself together.

227
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,479
My happiness is my mom's greatest wish.

228
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,960
Have you been to that amusement park before?

229
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,840
You grew up in Beijing,

230
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,119
but you've never been to an amusement park?

231
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,840
Not to mention an amusement park,

232
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,280
I've never even been outside the fifth ring.

233
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,880
No way.

234
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,320
You've never been out of Beijing?

235
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,039
I have. I have.

236
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,840
We can talk about it.

237
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,000
Your sister is really cute.

238
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,119
<i>[Bus station, Duobao Hutong]</i>

239
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,800
You need to transfer, right?

240
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,376
Yes.

241
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,319
It seems like the last one has already left.

242
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,839
What about the subway?

243
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,860
My house is far away from the subway station.

244
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,800
If I take the subway,
I need to walk a long way.

245
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,500
I told you to get on the bus
as soon as we left the amusement park,

246
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,520
but you insisted on
wandering about and eating BBQ.

247
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,779
Now we're out of money.

248
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:24,800
What do we do?

249
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,199
Why don't you stay at my place?

250
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:29,740
Don't talk nonsense.

251
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not talking nonsense.
Brother Wu Bi is not home anyway.

252
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,740
Let him stay in Brother Wu Bi's room.

253
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,660
His room is a mess.

254
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,719
It's okay, it's okay.

255
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,400
I-I don't mind.

256
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,720
Let's go.

257
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,728
This is Wu Bi's room.

258
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,359
You can sleep here tonight.

259
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,040
Do you usually stay here too?

260
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,864
Occasionally.

261
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,528
Where is your room?

262
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,128
Next door.

263
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,560
Then why don't I go to your room?

264
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,240
Why? Are you afraid
Wu Bi will make a fuss with you?

265
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,520
No, I…

266
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,980
I'm scared of being alone.

267
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,719
But you usually sleep alone, don't you?

268
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,659
That's at home.

269
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:38,959
T-This is unfamiliar here.

270
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:41,899
Alright.

271
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:42,912
Let's go.

272
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:54,976
Yu.

273
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,632
You know,

274
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,239
at school, those girls

275
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,980
always say I'm the school hunk.

276
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,599
But I think you're more handsome than me.

277
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,500
How could that be?

278
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,319
It's true. The first time I saw you,
I was shocked.

279
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,960
Look.

280
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,279
From head to toe, the aura you exude

281
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,280
is different for real.

282
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,800
Don't you think

283
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,599
Wu Bi is more handsome?

284
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:22,560
I don't think he's as handsome as you.

285
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,359
Who do you think is more handsome, me or Wu Bi?

286
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,240
You didn't look at me all this time

287
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,520
and wait for me to say
you're handsome, did you?

288
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
No, no, no. Give me an objective evaluation.

289
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:42,760
Never mind, I know the answer.

290
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,139
I'm not objective.

291
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:46,720
I've known you both too long.

292
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
I can't tell the difference in looks.

293
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,040
You're pretty objective when you evaluate me.

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,479
But you're pretty subjective
when you evaluate him.

295
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,439
What do you mean?

296
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,839
Don't you think your attitude toward Wu Bi

297
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,680
is a bit different from that toward others?

298
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,416
What's different?

299
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,479
You treat others well,

300
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,640
but when it comes to him, you are…

301
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,736
He…

302
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:07,802
Close your eyes and I will tell you.

303
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,762
Hurry up, we're going to be late for school.

304
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,874
Wait for me.

305
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,002
Don't tell me

306
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:07,002
you've been out for a long time
just to buy these things.

307
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,201
Yeah, it was exhausting.

308
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:10,902
Didn't I tell you to come back earlier?

309
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:12,522
I couldn't buy them all
if I came back earlier.

310
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:17,321
Why did you buy so much stuff?

311
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,922
It's a hassle to check in and do the paperwork.

312
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:19,922
It's troublesome.

313
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,441
I don't care. These are all gifts,

314
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,481
and I have to take them all back.

315
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:30,162
Who did you buy all these things for?

316
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:32,481
For Su Yu and Duo.

317
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,642
Have you lost your mind?

318
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:37,601
I'm telling you clearly
that you can't take these things.

319
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:38,642
Leave them all here.

320
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:41,441
I must take them.

321
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:47,321
Fine, if you want to bring something,

322
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,562
choose a few small items.

323
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:52,522
The customs will stop you
if you carry so many things.

324
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,622
Since I've bought them,

325
00:22:57,622 --> 00:22:58,802
I have to take them all.

326
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:00,162
I can't leave a single one.

327
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,842
Where are you going?

328
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,961
There are more.

329
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,141
Have you noticed

330
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:27,862
that Su Yu and Mao Chong
have been particularly close recently?

331
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:31,081
Yes. Mao Chong has been interacting less
with girls lately.

332
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,522
I can't even find any gossip.

333
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,481
There's no gossip between him and girls
but between him and boys.

334
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:37,210
What do you mean?

335
00:23:37,754 --> 00:23:39,282
Ever since the last sports meeting,

336
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:41,841
everyone has been shipping
Mao Chong and Han Bokuang.

337
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:44,642
But recently, Mao Chong has suddenly iced
Han Bokuang out.

338
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:46,762
There is even an essay on the school forum.

339
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:47,842
What essay?

340
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:49,322
The title is

341
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:51,002
"My most trusted buddy

342
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:52,601
stole my boyfriend."

343
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:10,081
When will Wu Bi be back?

344
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:13,081
If you hadn't mentioned him,
I would have completely forgotten about him.

345
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:20,481
<i>Su Yu, I'm at the airport.</i>

346
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:29,201
Hot guy, what are you doing here?

347
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:34,142
He just told me he forgot about Wu Bi,

348
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:36,002
and the moment he received the call,
he disappeared.

349
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:37,661
Why did I have to listen to his voice?

350
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:39,122
Why did I have to hear
what he said on the phone?

351
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:41,882
Because your ears work well.

352
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:20,762
Did you bring everything?

353
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:21,946
Yes.

354
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,042
You really know you should come back, huh?

355
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,868
<i>♫ I'll wait here foolishly for you ♫</i>

356
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,740
<i>♫ No matter if a sudden storm comes ♫</i>

357
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,164
<i>♫ I'll have everything ready here ♫</i>

358
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:47,036
<i>♫ Just waiting for your word ♫</i>

359
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:50,396
<i>♫ I'll guard you silently here ♫</i>

360
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:54,332
<i>♫ I fear even my breath will disturb you ♫</i>

361
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:59,164
<i>♫ Maybe this is the meaning of family ♫</i>

362
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,578
<i>♫ How beautiful ♫</i>

363
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:15,516
<i>♫ Did we agree
we would stay together forever? ♫</i>

364
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:21,816
<i>♫ No matter what, it will be true ♫</i>

365
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:30,044
<i>♫ Did we agree
we would have endless stories? ♫</i>

366
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,380
<i>♫ About you ♫</i>

367
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,922
<i>♫ About our family ♫</i>

368
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:39,122
I missed you so much.

369
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:45,841
Go cough somewhere else.

370
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:53,922
I have to go home with Su Yu.

371
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:55,841
You'd better go back with your brother.

372
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,222
Your brother hasn't been home for so long.

373
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,682
You should at least help him settle in.

374
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,762
He doesn't need my help.

375
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:04,570
Right, Brother?

376
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:11,241
I-I have a friend coming over.

377
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:14,874
Let's go.

378
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:22,042
What are you looking at?

379
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:26,822
Why did your handsome brother
come back with you?

380
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:28,721
Leave out that "handsome" before "brother".

381
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:43,922
Look,

382
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,841
this is the electronic smartwatch
I brought back for you.

383
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:47,682
Look, I also have one.

384
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:53,542
Why doesn't it show the time?

385
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,201
Because you haven't pressed it yet.

386
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,642
Do I have to set the time myself?

387
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:08,002
No, no, no, this is not for telling time.

388
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:09,542
It is used to record time.

389
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,702
How does it work?

390
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:13,141
Starting from now,

391
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:16,021
the time on our watches
will start recording simultaneously

392
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:19,062
how long we have been together.

393
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:21,381
How long can it record?

394
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:22,882
As long as you remember to charge it,

395
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:24,026
it can be as long as you want.

396
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:27,601
Isn't this just a stopwatch
that can be standby for so long?

397
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,341
It's not the same.

398
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,442
this one can connect your mind.

399
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:32,862
As soon as you press it,

400
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:33,902
mine will ring,

401
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:36,442
and I will know
that you are missing me at this moment.

402
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:37,922
If the power goes out on her side,

403
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:39,922
the time on my side will also pause.

404
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:42,162
In this way, our time is the same.

405
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,162
Why didn't you prepare one for me?

406
00:28:45,162 --> 00:28:46,842
We are together every day,

407
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:48,321
so it's unnecessary, isn't it?

408
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:50,862
But for this little girl,

409
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,942
when she gets to
junior high school and high school,

410
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:54,201
she will meet more and more people.

411
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,802
Who knows if she will still remember us?

412
00:28:57,081 --> 00:28:59,882
I will definitely not let this watch stop.

413
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:14,874
Where's the dry towel?

414
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:16,602
It's hanging in my room.

415
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:49,402
What are you doing?

416
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:52,442
What do you think am I doing?

417
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,106
Get out of here.

418
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,242
On what grounds are you telling me to get out?

419
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:01,082
Let go of me.

420
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:05,306
Get lost!

421
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,154
Get out of the way.

422
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:24,826
We had an argument.

423
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,721
We're just comparing to see

424
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,201
who's more thick-skinned.

425
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:36,561
In my memory,
you've always been mature for your age.

426
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:39,321
How come you're suddenly
acting like a three-year-old?

427
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,682
What are you doing here?

428
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:46,042
I heard from your dad that you can cook now,

429
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:47,802
and you're pretty good at it.

430
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:50,081
So, I came to have a taste.

431
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:53,498
Right.

432
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:56,090
It's mealtime.

433
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,142
Let's go to your place.

434
00:30:58,142 --> 00:30:59,302
Why go to my place?

435
00:30:59,302 --> 00:31:00,561
To cook for you.

436
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,386
Can't you cook here?

437
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:08,122
If we cook here, it's for three people.

438
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:11,762
If we go to your place,
only the two of us will enjoy it!

439
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,721
What are you doing?

440
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:43,422
Cook for you.

441
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:44,642
Didn't I agree today?

442
00:31:47,402 --> 00:31:49,361
Where were you earlier? It's so late now.

443
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,202
Hello, uncle.

444
00:32:13,202 --> 00:32:14,642
Why did you call?

445
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:16,410
<i>You're not asleep yet?</i>

446
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:18,502
I was about to sleep.

447
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,622
If not for your darling son making a fuss,

448
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:22,081
I would be asleep by now.

449
00:32:23,882 --> 00:32:24,961
<i>Then I won't go.</i>

450
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,682
Wait, you're coming over?

451
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,762
<i>Ever since you came back, I've been busy.</i>

452
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:32,601
<i>I finally got some free time today,</i>

453
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:33,842
<i>and I planned to visit you.</i>

454
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:35,042
<i>Since you're going to sleep,</i>

455
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:36,662
<i>I'll come another day.</i>

456
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:39,542
Uncle, it's okay if I sleep late.

457
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,662
Wu Bi is here too. Please come.

458
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:43,441
<i>Alright. He's at your place too.</i>

459
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,361
<i>Okay, I'm coming right away.</i>

460
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,682
<i>You should come quickly and see your good son.</i>

461
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:06,490
Your dad is coming over in a while.

462
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,501
I need to go home.

463
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,922
Wait, you're leaving this early?

464
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,034
He's looking for me.

465
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:14,321
I thought you could at least hold out
until tomorrow morning.

466
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:16,441
You two were just angry at each other.

467
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,034
What kind of charm did he use
to summon you back in an instant?

468
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,130
(Kong's space)

469
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:40,282
He's gone mad.

470
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:42,841
Definitely mad.

471
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,201
If this continues,
he'll squander all the family wealth.

472
