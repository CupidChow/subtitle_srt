(Stay With Me)

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,346
(Episode 11)

18
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,879
If it weren't for you,

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,900
I wouldn't come here at all.

20
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,400
This is your future family business.

21
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,040
To hell with the family business.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,660
I don't want any of it, you can have it all.

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,880
Little brat.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,519
You're only three years older than me.

25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,639
But when I was still studying,

26
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,019
I started getting involved in
the overseas branch.

27
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,840
You should start learning early too.

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,199
The experience gained from work

29
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,479
is much more practical than from books.

30
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,792
Didn't my dad

31
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,720
come back with you?

32
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,680
He won't be able to come back for a while.

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,060
I returned to China early

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,679
to assist him here.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,840
We haven't seen each other
for more than a year, right?

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,039
You've grown quite a bit.

37
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:41,960
Yeah. I've just grown taller, not wiser.

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,920
You know you're not wiser too.

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,399
Even moved out due to a quarrel with your dad.

40
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,960
Can a woman
who can handle your dad be ordinary?

41
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,279
Aren't you afraid she'll usurp your position?

42
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,119
Let her do it. I don't care.

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,759
Who are you living with now?

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,559
With that woman's son.

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,700
Right, it's my stepmother's biological son,
named Su Yu.

46
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll introduce him to you later.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,280
We have a great relationship.

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,439
I'm telling you

49
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,720
I've never met anyone as smart as him.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,479
We studied these days, right?

51
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,544
Hold on.

52
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,880
I say you're not only heartless

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,280
but also brainless.

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
You leave your own home behind

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,600
and live with someone else's son.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,020
It's not what you think.

57
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,360
He's not close to his mother

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,760
and his father has remarried.

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,320
He and I are in the same boat.

60
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,559
We're a real blended family.

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,439
What kind of blended family is it?

62
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,839
I've never heard of it.

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,399
You wouldn't have been brainwashed, would you?

64
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,479
It seems that not only is his mother powerful,

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,160
her son is not simple either.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
I can't reason with you.

67
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,520
You'll know when you meet him.

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,759
Yes, I really need to meet him.

69
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,759
Aren't you coming back with your girlfriend?

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,552
Where is she?

71
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:19,040
She was in a hurry to leave
as soon as the plane landed.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,799
I don't know who she rushed to see.

73
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,160
Isn't that Ye Wanying?

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,240
It should be.

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
Didn't she go abroad?

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,640
Yeah, I heard she's settled down abroad.

77
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,079
Could you do me a favor
and call Su Yu out for me?

78
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,320
Okay.

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,480
Su Yu, Su Yu,

80
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,519
a beautiful lady is looking for you.

81
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,504
Someone needs you outside.

82
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:15,480
Why did you come back?

83
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,440
Why can't I come back?

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
Is he your friend?

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,640
Why don't you introduce him to me?

86
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,384
His name is Wu Bi.

87
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,320
Hello, I'm Ye Wanying.

88
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,128
I have to go.

89
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,559
We will review

90
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,440
the content of Unit Three.

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,480
In this lesson, we will review the third unit.

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Open your books and turn to page 67.

93
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,440
She is indeed beautiful.

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,860
No wonder Su Yu still craves for her.

95
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,279
Let's read the first question.

96
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Never should a man stay in a closed-door room.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,379
You should explore the universe.

98
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,559
Have dinner together tomorrow night.

99
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,760
How man copes with

100
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,799
the immense changing.

101
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,860
This sentence means

102
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,660
no one should be isolated

103
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,400
but should face the world

104
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,239
to explore how people deal with

105
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,160
the rapidly changing situation.

106
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:35,980
This sentence is an English proverb.

107
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,879
And it is also the focus of our lesson.

108
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,399
The key content of this chapter
will be on the test.

109
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,440
Who is Ye Wanying?

110
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,472
Her?

111
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,720
Oh, the prettiest girl in our school before.

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,860
And then?

113
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,960
She went abroad.

114
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,140
In another country.

115
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,700
Her dad and my dad are friends.

116
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,520
That she was able to enter the school abroad

117
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,839
was due to my connections.

118
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,560
So isn't she just using you?

119
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,640
So calculating.

120
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,059
It's just a matter of mutual benefit.

121
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,900
So it is the key point of this chapter.

122
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,600
And over the years, it's been popular
in the college entrance examination.

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
When you go home,

124
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
you must read today's content thoroughly,

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,239
and memorize it.

126
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,160
Brother,

127
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,060
what's the name of your girlfriend?

128
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,160
Ye Wanying. Why?

129
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,744
Nothing.

130
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,160
You…

131
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,240
Let's have dinner together.

132
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,740
I'll take a rain check.
As you've been on the plane for so long,

133
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,060
you'd better go back and rest.

134
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm not tired. I'm still excited
about returning to China.

135
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,620
Isn't it inappropriate to invite him alone?

136
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,799
Take me along.

137
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,064
I also like beautiful women.

138
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:05,119
Okay.

139
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go together then.

140
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,799
Why are you encouraging her
to have dinner together?

141
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,900
Su Yu, look at that vineyard.

142
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,040
Do you remember?

143
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,920
We picked grapes together then.

144
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,180
The grape trellis was too high

145
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,220
and I couldn't reach it.

146
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,980
So you carried me on your shoulders.

147
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,080
We picked and ate

148
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,479
and almost vomited from eating too much.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,359
I think you must be eager.

150
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,340
Are you back in the country to visit relatives?

151
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,368
No.

152
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,384
Then?

153
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,624
To visit you.

154
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
W-What's wrong?

155
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,640
It's nothing. I like to drink this way.

156
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,520
Although we've only met once,

157
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,000
I always feel very familiar with you.

158
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,039
It feels like I've seen you before.

159
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,119
Nonsense. I'm Mo Yi's cousin.
How can I not be familiar?

160
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,119
Su Yu, have you missed me in the year I left?

161
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,840
What? Well, with my classmate here,

162
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
it's not good to talk about this.

163
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:00,639
What's the big deal?

164
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,180
At our age,

165
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,080
we can date freely in foreign countries.

166
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,719
Then did you date abroad?

167
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,359
How is it possible?

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,880
My heart has always been in China.

169
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,808
Waitress.

170
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,600
How may I help you?

171
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,799
Add a portion of pork kidneys.

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,080
Why did you order this?

173
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,359
What teasing.
Eat some kidneys to cover the taste.

174
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,408
Duo,

175
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,232
why are you here?

176
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,119
The grapes freshly picked

177
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,280
from my uncle's greenhouse are so sweet.

178
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
What's wrong with Brother Wu Bi?

179
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,359
He didn't look good today.

180
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,679
Who knows?

181
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,280
Alright, go back to sleep.

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,208
Thank you.

183
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,799
Why waste

184
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,504
good grapes?

185
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,119
Here, you eat.

186
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,159
Eat! Until you vomit. Eat, eat.

187
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,239
What's wrong? Are you crazy?

188
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,119
Do you still have her in your heart?

189
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,048
So what if I do?

190
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
So what if I don't?

191
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,280
You can't be with her.

192
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,599
You're overthinking.

193
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,640
We weren't together before.

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,000
How could it be possible now?

195
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,039
Why are you

196
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,960
so afraid of me being with her?

197
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,008
Who's afraid?

198
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,520
I-I just think she's not a good person.

199
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,799
You've only been together for a day

200
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,039
and you know she's not a good person?

201
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,380
If I say she isn't, she isn't.

202
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,440
You just need to remember what you said.

203
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,872
What are you thinking about?

204
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,064
Nothing.

205
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,679
Didn't you say you were going to introduce me

206
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,880
to your brother?

207
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,000
Which one?

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
The one your stepmother brought.

209
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,080
What's there to see about him?

210
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,979
Last time you were praising him.

211
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,280
It's only been a few days

212
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,976
and you've already changed your mind.

213
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,960
He's a very twisted person.

214
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,080
You definitely won't get along.

215
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
The more you say, the more I want to meet him.

216
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,720
A twisted person

217
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,640
can make you, a bad-tempered,
do nothing with him.

218
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,980
What about your little girlfriend?

219
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,960
Haven't seen you be two together for days.

220
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,919
Why don't you accompany her?

221
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,799
What's there to accompany her?

222
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,559
She's just a little girl.

223
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,760
Nothing more than
dining, shopping, or watching movies.

224
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,719
I'm not interested in these.

225
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,320
Just afraid others are interested.

226
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,616
What do you mean?

227
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,719
Nothing. Just drink your wine.

228
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,504
Please come in.

229
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Do you know who I am? You just let me in.

230
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,896
Aren't you Mo Yi?

231
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:15,680
How did you know?

232
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,200
I didn't tell Wu Bi that I would come today.

233
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,808
My hunch.

234
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,880
You are smart indeed.

235
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
But as Wu Bi calls me big brother,

236
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,000
isn't it inappropriate for you
to call me by my name?

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,559
Wu Bi should also call me big brother.

238
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,119
But he also calls me by my full name.

239
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:06,784
Where's Wu Bi?

240
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,768
He went out.

241
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
Would you like something to drink?

242
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,760
Apart from these, are there any other choices?

243
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,359
I can make you a cup of coffee.

244
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,760
I never drink instant coffee.

245
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I'll take this one.

246
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm back.

247
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,048
Brother,

248
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,432
why are you here?

249
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,240
Why can't I be here?

250
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,920
No. Why didn't you inform me before you came?

251
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,920
Do I need to tell you before I come here?

252
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,920
I could have prepared in advance.

253
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,832
Prepared what?

254
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,680
Prepare to get rid of him in advance?

255
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,959
What are you talking about?

256
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,080
Come out.

257
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:55,584
Are you crazy?

258
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:56,736
Why am I crazy?

259
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,680
Is this place for people to live?

260
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,000
What are you talking about?

261
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,976
Am I not a person?

262
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Don't tell me

263
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,119
you're living here just to keep him company?

264
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,104
Not just him.

265
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,239
Next door, there's my uncle, my aunt, and Duo.

266
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,199
A whole family.

267
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,520
Which uncle? Which aunt?

268
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,120
Why don't I know?

269
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,168
It's Su Yu's dad.

270
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
And Ms. Zhou who has been taking care of me.

271
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,976
Wait a minute.

272
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,640
His dad?

273
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,399
Didn't your dad marry his mom?

274
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,959
What does it have to do with his dad?

275
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,439
It's a complicated story.

276
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
I can't explain it in a few words.

277
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,319
It's cold outside. Let's talk inside.

278
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,439
How about we watch TV?

279
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,199
No, it's too messy.

280
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
If you think it's messy,
you can go back to your hotel.

281
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,119
Let's chat.

282
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,959
What's there to chat about?

283
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,520
When you called last time,

284
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,319
didn't you say
there's an abnormal person in your class?

285
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,520
What is it?

286
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,219
The one who sleeps all day in class

287
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,199
but is always first in the school.

288
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,719
The highest-score keeper in the internet cafe,

289
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,599
the abnormal with a high IQ.

290
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
The last time I heard such a character setting

291
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,339
was from my girlfriend.

292
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:57,640
Alright, brother, you should go now.

293
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,320
Why are you always driving me away?

294
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,439
We still have to do homework.

295
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,680
We have to go to school early tomorrow.

296
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,880
You should go.

297
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
Alright, alright, I'll go by myself.

298
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,272
Goodbye.

299
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,439
Tell me, who's abnormal?

300
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,920
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

301
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,479
We weren't familiar at that time, right?

302
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,620
Besides, abnormal is a compliment in my book.

303
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,760
And my brother's description

304
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,119
is all praise for you.

305
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,400
W-Why are you looking at me like that?

306
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,456
Nothing.

307
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,112
Really handsome.

308
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,119
Your brother also works
in your father's corporation?

309
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,800
Yes, he is now the vice president
of the overseas branch.

310
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
That's impressive.

311
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,340
He's had a talent for business
since he was a kid.

312
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,880
He went to college at sixteen

313
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,199
and started learning about
managing the company's affairs at eighteen.

314
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:52,399
It seems

315
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:55,060
your father is quite nice
to your mother's family.

316
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,128
Nonsense.

317
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,880
If it weren't for my uncle's help
in the first place,

318
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,599
he wouldn't even be able to start this company.

319
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,816
Your uncle?

320
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
Mo Yi's father?

321
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah, my father could have what he has today

322
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,920
all thanks to the support
of my mother's family.

323
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:19,000
Why are you so interested in my brother?

324
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,832
Am I?

325
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:23,680
You never

326
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,920
mention our family.

327
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,700
I kind of like him.

328
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,779
You're kidding.

329
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:33,040
Listen, stay away from him.

330
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,072
Why?

331
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,319
He's not the same kind of person as me.

332
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,159
He is very absolute in his actions,

333
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,740
leaving no room for negotiation.

334
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,219
If you don't provoke him, you're fine.

335
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:48,219
Once you provoke him,

336
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:50,000
you won't even know how you will die.

337
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,279
Why would I provoke him?

338
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,368
You…

339
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,848
Nothing.

340
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,439
But to be honest,

341
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,439
your brother is more handsome than you.

342
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:14,760
I'm not sure what kind of person he is,

343
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,520
but he is indeed more handsome than you.

344
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,992
One can lose face, but not demeanor.

345
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:26,080
How dare you!

346
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
One can lose face, but not demeanor.

347
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,820
I'm the most handsome. I'm the most handsome.

348
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,800
Fine, you're handsome.
Hurry up and do your homework.

349
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm asking you, am I the most handsome?

350
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,319
Alright, alright, you're the most handsome.

351
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,860
Okay, the third question.

352
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,159
Be careful to understand the question.

353
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,960
This is not just a sentence imitation.

354
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,160
What is missing?

355
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,719
A poetic line.

356
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,960
Yes, a poetic line.

357
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,919
Look at the subject. This example.

358
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,319
I stared intently at this math problem.

359
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,000
Just when I was about to give up,
I suddenly had an epiphany.

360
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,599
It's really like the path was blocked
and it was dark in front of me,

361
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,900
then suddenly a light appeared in the darkness.

362
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,000
The question is simple.

363
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,976
Who will answer it?

364
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:14,272
Zhang Xiaoxiao.

365
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,539
I stood by the river bank.

366
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,560
The soft willow branches drooped down.

367
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,079
Looks like the dream
of a spring breeze in February cutting plants.

368
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,839
Okay, sit down.

369
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Winter vacation will begin next week.

370
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,839
Ye Wanying asked me out.

371
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,640
She said she is going abroad.

372
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,368
Should I go?

373
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,488
Do you want to go?

374
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,560
I'm fine either way. It's up to you.

375
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,760
Who got it wrong? Raise your hand.

376
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,119
Why are you asking me about your own business?

377
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,176
Liang Wentai.

378
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,980
If I could make a decision, would I ask you?

379
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,380
I-I arrived on the African continent

380
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,039
and instantly felt

381
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,880
the overwhelming atmosphere
of dark clouds pressing against the city.

382
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
I think it's better not to--

383
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,959
His classmate. Wu Bi!

384
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,800
What are you doing? Hand over your phone.

385
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,280
Didn't you hear me talking? Hand it over.

386
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,719
Why don't you confiscate his phone?

387
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,520
Why don't you dare to look at me?

388
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,400
Don't I?

389
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Do you?

390
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,820
Gentlemen, what would you like to order?

391
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,860
Two juices.

392
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,459
What flavor?

393
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:18,000
It's up to you.

394
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,040
Whatever.

395
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:22,016
What's wrong?

396
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:24,800
Nothing.

397
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,479
Mr. Wu's son has good taste.

398
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Look at that girl. So pretty.

399
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,600
This kid is unlucky.

400
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,040
Daring to compete
with Mr. Wu's son for a girlfriend.

401
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,160
I'm telling you,

402
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,580
if it wasn't for his intention,

403
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,480
would Wu Bi send us to watch on them?

404
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,560
Drinking juice here and making a mess,

405
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,719
and we will get five hundred yuan.

406
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,520
Where can you find such a deal?

407
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,520
Yeah.

408
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,439
Wu Bi is really generous.

409
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,399
Today we can't just keep an eye on them.

410
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,079
We need to show some real action.

411
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,599
Su Yu, you've changed a lot.

412
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,440
Have I?

413
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,040
Haven't I always been like this?

414
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,384
You've become more handsome.

415
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:15,392
Waitress,

416
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,560
I want fresh juice.

417
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,740
How did you make this flavor?

418
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,780
Sir, you just said whatever.

419
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,199
So you can't ask me in advance?

420
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:25,359
That's right, waitress.

421
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,239
- What is a waitress for?
- For what?

422
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,959
That's for serving customers.

423
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,820
Do you think it's just about serving drinks?

424
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,640
How about we change seats?

425
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,719
Actually, I was thinking the same thing.

426
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,400
Right?

427
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Exactly.

428
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,640
Do you think I'm right?

429
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,056
Go ahead, go ahead.

430
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,479
Get some tissues, hurry.

431
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,592
Hurry up.

432
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:03,839
How can we sit here?

433
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,100
Let's go. Let's change seats.

434
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,192
Can we sit there?

435
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:09,280
Right here, right here.

436
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,800
How about you come to sit on my side?

437
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,839
If we sit closer,
we won't be bothered by the noise.

438
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,399
Originally, I thought about messing with them.

439
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,239
But now, they're sitting even closer.

440
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,760
Damn kid, it seems he doesn't want to live.

441
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,959
Su Yu, do you know why I came back to China?

442
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,199
Because of me?

443
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,439
More accurately,

444
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,439
because of your phone call.

445
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,079
When did I call you?

446
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,060
Yeah, you never answered my calls.

447
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,740
One day I finally got through.

448
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,160
I was so happy.

449
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,359
But someone else answered.

450
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,239
He told me you had someone you liked.

451
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,340
I couldn't accept it and I didn't believe it.

452
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,120
I wanted to ask you in person who she is.

453
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,920
What am I lacking compared to her?

454
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,899
If you can give me an accurate answer,

455
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:30,199
I'll book a ticket and leave immediately.

456
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:35,239
So, the girl is pursuing him?

457
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,680
The kid is a bit clueless then.

458
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,400
I can't tell you.

459
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,119
Why can't you tell me?

460
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,319
Is it that you can't tell me,

461
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,760
or there's no one at all?

462
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,840
Su Yu, I knew you were lying to me.

463
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,800
I'm not leaving.
I'm staying here to be with you.

464
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,296
Don't be foolish.

465
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,560
Even if you stay here,

466
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,000
we can't be together.

467
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,136
Why?

468
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,239
What else could it be?
Because he deserves a beating.

469
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,296
Stop fighting.

470
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,440
Bro, put more effort.

471
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,800
Teach this guy a lesson.

472
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Stop it.

473
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:40,992
Screw you.

474
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:47,260
I'm telling you,

475
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,080
we can't brag about this when we get back.

476
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,480
We have to calm Wu Bi's down first.

477
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,439
Calm him down? Why?

478
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,232
Think about it.

479
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,500
If we tell the truth about today,

480
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,400
how much would it hurt Wu Bi's pride?

481
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
He's just a kid

482
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,099
in the middle of puberty.

483
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:04,220
This might be his first love.

484
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,560
Right, right, right.

485
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,599
So,

486
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,479
what should we say?

487
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,239
We just say the opposite.

488
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,959
We say whatever is nice.

489
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,560
So we say that the guy was chasing her?

490
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,568
Clever.

491
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,360
Let's go.

492
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,199
They were just chatting normally.

493
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,239
There were no inappropriate behaviors.

494
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,800
What did the girl say?

495
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,700
She said she doesn't like the guy

496
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,344
and she already has someone she likes.

497
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
Right.

498
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,359
So honest? She actually admitted it.

499
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,040
Then why would she meet him if that's the case?

500
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,680
No, she didn't call him.

501
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
It was the guy who pursued her.

502
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,944
Get lost.

503
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,160
I read the messages.

504
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,800
It was the guy who kept pestering her.

505
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,880
The guy called her, but she never answered.

506
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,660
Right? The guy wanted

507
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,000
to keep her in China.

508
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,019
Right, right. The girl rejected him decisively.

509
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:16,096
Shut up!

510
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,880
Did the girl say who she likes?

511
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
She didn't say.

512
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,719
Do you think the person might be you?

513
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:32,896
Bullshit.

514
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,100
Wu Bi, don't worry about it.

515
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,760
We've already avenged you.

516
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:41,680
Right, right, right.

517
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,660
We gave that jerk a good beating.

518
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,360
I guess he won't be able
to get out of bed for three days.

519
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,479
Three days? I think he won't be able
to get up for half a month.

520
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,576
Right.

521
