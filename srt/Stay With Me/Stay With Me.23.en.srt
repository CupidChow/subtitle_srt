<i>[Episode 23]</i>

18
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,800
What did you say to my father today?

19
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,319
I told him about your ambition
to become a pilot.

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,792
You told him?

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,460
Why did you tell him?

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,879
He'll definitely try to stop me.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,639
No, actually, he was quite supportive.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,184
Are you serious?

25
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,320
Yeah.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,639
To get into an aviation university?

27
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,304
And become a pilot?

28
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,520
Don't even think about it.

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
He's already passed the re-examination.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,160
Do you know how many people
in Beijing, even in all of China,

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,560
can pass the re-examination?

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,060
It's a glorious profession.

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,440
Why are you so resistant to it?

34
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,720
I'm not against the profession.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,639
I just know my son too well.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,559
An air force pilot

37
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,119
is not for ordinary people.

38
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,820
It takes arduous efforts

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,240
and extraordinary endurance.

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,639
Are you worried about him?

41
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,839
No, I'm not.

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm just afraid he can't stand the hardship.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,032
Besides,

44
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,579
it takes more than a healthy body
to enter an aviation academy.

45
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,960
The academic performance
must also be top-notch.

46
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,199
Even if he can pass the physical examination,

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,720
can he pass the academics?

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,584
He can.

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,559
Brother Su Yu, what are you thinking about?

50
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,120
I want your brother Wu Bi

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,479
to apply to the Air Force
University of Aeronautics.

52
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:16,768
What?

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,679
You're not kidding, are you?

54
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,720
Why would I be kidding?

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,459
You've passed the re-examination,

56
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,239
and as long as you can pass
the first-tier line in the cultural course,

57
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,660
you're likely to get into
the Aviation University.

58
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm not worried about the re-examination,

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
but the score for the first-tier line.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,680
A person's innate conditions are fixed,

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
but scores are flexible.

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
As long as you can…

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,880
Stop, innate conditions include brains, bro.

64
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,119
You're finally willing
to call him your brother.

65
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,420
Stop, not now.

66
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,639
You go play for a while.

67
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,160
What's your plan then?

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,600
Just taking one step at a time.

69
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,360
Anyway, based on my current score,

70
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,659
Civil Aviation University is more reliable.

71
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,736
Civil Aviation?

72
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you going to fly passenger planes?

73
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,440
Who told me his dream was to be an astronaut?

74
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,320
Who said he wanted to give me stars?

75
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,180
The dream is called a dream

76
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,760
because it's unattainable.

77
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,799
Why are you looking at me like that?

78
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,920
Since childhood,

79
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,440
have you ever been persistent about anything?

80
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,640
Yes.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
What?

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,720
It's buried under this tree.

83
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,079
Then you should go
and make this wish come true.

84
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,720
Do you even know what my wish is?

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,920
And you're asking me to make it come true.

86
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,540
For civil aviation recruitment,

87
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,359
you might be dispatched to other cities,

88
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,519
but I want you to stay in Beijing.

89
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,880
I don't want to be separated from you.

90
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,279
Brother Wu Bi, please don't ever leave Beijing.

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
I don't want to either.

92
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,880
But the objective conditions

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,239
are right here.

94
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,239
For me,

95
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,079
there's no objective, only subjective.

96
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,000
If I say you can do it, you can.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,080
You have so much confidence in me?

98
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,200
I have confidence in my tutoring system.

99
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,320
What system?

100
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,944
Go to sleep.

101
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:44,640
Go to sleep?

102
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,600
What kind of system is that?

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,519
What do you mean by "go to sleep", bro?

104
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,320
Can you be gentle?

105
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,979
How can you still get it wrong
when I've explained it so many times?

106
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,680
You've never explained this problem.

107
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,900
This problem and the previous one are the same,

108
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,000
just with different numbers.

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,780
Tomato scrambled eggs
and cucumber scrambled eggs

110
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,820
are both scrambled eggs.

111
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,200
But the ingredients are not the same,

112
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,320
so they are not the same dish.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,239
You only know about eating.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,008
Sit up.

115
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,320
Did your interview results
for Beijing Film Academy come out?

116
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,239
How did it go? Did you pass?

117
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,432
I did.

118
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,079
Now I'm just waiting
for the cultural course exam.

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
Good job, kid.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,679
I heard that to get into Beijing Film Academy,
one must have connections,

121
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,040
and it costs a lot of money.

122
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Not at all.

123
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,240
At first, I was just trying my luck.

124
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,620
During the tryouts,
a teacher saw potential in me,

125
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,760
and he guided me for free.

126
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,360
I didn't even check the re-examination result.

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,119
The teacher called me to tell me I had passed.

128
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,060
By the third round,

129
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,640
I started to really prepare for it,

130
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:39,959
but I wasn't holding out much hope.

131
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,799
To be honest, I was quite surprised.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,100
Remember to sign for me when you graduate.

133
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,300
In case one day you become famous,
I can sell it for some money.

134
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,879
Don't worry. Even if I become a big shot,

135
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,399
I won't act superior to you ordinary people.

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,920
Yu, what if I pass the interview,

137
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,359
but fail the cultural course exam,

138
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,440
wouldn't that be such a shame?

139
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,799
With a few days left
before the college entrance exam,

140
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,848
can you help me out?

141
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,699
You can get in line.

142
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,079
It's not your turn yet.

143
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,579
Right, Wu Bi,

144
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,920
there's something I've been
meaning to thank you for.

145
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,799
A few days after you hit me,
I went to attend the interview.

146
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,740
With a bruised face,

147
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,220
the interviewers said I had
a kind of damaged beauty,

148
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,799
so I stood out among many candidates.

149
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,760
How about I give you a couple more punches?

150
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,719
Maybe you could land a role tomorrow.

151
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,239
So, the cosine of the angle formed
by the straight line MA

152
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,840
and the straight line QK is…

153
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,319
D.

154
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,448
Right.

155
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,440
Why is it so easy to understand
when you explain it,

156
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,679
but not when the teacher explains it?

157
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
That's because you don't
listen carefully normally.

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,500
No, something's definitely different.

159
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,799
You explain it better than the teacher.

160
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,520
If you open an educational
institution in the future,

161
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,679
you could become the richest man.

162
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,220
If you ask me,

163
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,800
you just don't use your brain, and it's rusty.

164
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,960
A few lubricants can make it
take off immediately.

165
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,840
Wait a minute.

166
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,719
What lubricant?

167
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,119
Why are you sleeping on the table?

168
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,960
You were asleep just now,

169
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,719
so I wrote the solution method on the paper.

170
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,440
You can read it when you wake up.

171
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,039
I've never been so tired studying on my own.

172
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,000
The second mock exam results are out.

173
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,159
I've never seen him

174
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,800
so concerned about his grades.

175
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,119
He's already guaranteed a spot,
so why is he so anxious?

176
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,888
How is it?

177
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:08,224
Not so good.

178
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,919
How could it be?

179
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,280
I've checked the answers, and at least
I got 30 points more than last time.

180
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,520
Definitely enough to make the second-tier line.

181
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,799
You got 32 points more.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Then why did you say it wasn't good?

183
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,440
If you can get another 30 points,

184
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,400
I'll reward you with something.

185
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:33,792
What is it?

186
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,880
I'll reward you…

187
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:09,824
<i>♫ I never thought about what would be
at the end of the road ♫</i>

188
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:12,135
<i>♫ What it would be like ♫</i>

189
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:16,092
<i>♫ I never considered
whether what I was doing was right or wrong ♫</i>

190
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:18,911
<i>♫ Let them say ♫</i>

191
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:23,296
<i>♫ Maybe it's best ♫</i>

192
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:25,503
<i>♫ To remain silent now ♫</i>

193
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:30,600
<i>♫ Let the fire burn in our hearts ♫</i>

194
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>♫ We pray ♫</i>

195
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,456
<i>♫ We look far away ♫</i>

196
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,159
Okay, class dismissed.

197
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,820
Guys, you should go for a walk.

198
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,700
Although the college entrance exam
is approaching,

199
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,280
health is still the most important thing.

200
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,719
Come on, let's get moving.

201
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,864
<i>♫ Dark clouds block every star's light ♫</i>

202
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,976
<i>♫ There will be a dawn ♫</i>

203
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:58,213
<i>♫ As always ♫</i>

204
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,448
<i>♫Promise me to keep searching♫</i>

205
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,440
Has Wu Bi gone mad?

206
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,248
I haven't seen him lift his head these days.

207
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:16,192
<i>♫ Promise me to keep searching ♫</i>

208
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,000
Su Yu, where are you going?

209
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,840
The college entrance examination simulation
exercises seem to be out.

210
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,079
And I heard the predictions were very accurate.

211
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm going to the bookstore to have a look.

212
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,840
Why would you need that?

213
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,079
You don't even need to take the exam.

214
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,480
I voluntarily applied for it,

215
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,520
just for fun.

216
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,239
To see how many points I can get.

217
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,159
Just for fun?

218
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
By the way, I haven't asked you yet.

219
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,139
What did you apply for?

220
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,239
Don't even mention it.

221
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:11,479
I'm almost worried to death over this.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,159
What, did you set your sights too high?

223
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,808
My dad insisted on me
applying to a military academy.

224
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:21,359
Saying things like

225
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,760
no one in our Han family
has ever been a soldier,

226
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,039
and he was counting on me
to honor our ancestors.

227
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,880
He also said that military personnel
have good benefits,

228
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,080
and a position is directly arranged
after graduation.

229
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,380
I couldn't oppose him,

230
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,400
so I gritted my teeth

231
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:35,744
and applied for it.

232
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,760
What was your dad thinking?

233
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,440
Who knows? He comes up
with one thing after another.

234
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,220
What should I do if I really get in?

235
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,479
I can't stand that hardship.

236
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:50,440
I'm nervous every day.

237
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,400
Don't worry, you definitely won't
pass the military inspection.

238
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,848
I got to go now.

239
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,976
Brother.

240
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,719
It's rare to see you by yourself.

241
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,320
Are you still my younger brother?

242
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,799
I'm talking to you, so put down the pen.

243
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm doing these problems on a tight schedule.

244
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,359
Have you ever taken the college entrance exam?

245
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,039
Don't you know that you have to answer
within a set time?

246
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,760
My time is precious.

247
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,200
Isn't mine too?

248
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,679
Do you have any idea how much benefit I create

249
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,760
for the group in a minute?

250
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,960
Do you think I came to you to chat leisurely?

251
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,928
Put down the pen.

252
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,048
Alright, alright.

253
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,080
I'm going to Hong Kong.

254
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,928
Go ahead.

255
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,319
I want you to come with me.

256
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,979
There are great educational
resources in Hong Kong.

257
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:19,800
Your father and I have already discussed this.

258
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,832
No way.

259
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,008
I'm not going.

260
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,568
What do you mean "no way"?

261
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,319
Staying here and attending
a third-tier university is a waste of time.

262
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,319
Who said I'm going to a third-tier university?

263
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,439
I applied to the Air Force
University of Aeronautics.

264
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,656
That's right.

265
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,439
I'm going to a first-tier university.

266
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,359
I'm your brother.

267
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,439
Don't you think I know your level?

268
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,599
No, you don't.

269
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,160
Fine.

270
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,096
Let me ask you.

271
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,439
If you don't get admitted,

272
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,119
will you go to Hong Kong with me?

273
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
I won't.

274
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,479
I promised Su Yu

275
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,439
to grow up with Duo together,

276
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
and never to part.

277
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,520
I am your brother.

278
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,160
I grew up with you.

279
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,359
And you've only known them for a few years.

280
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,380
You'd rather waste time with them

281
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,959
than venture out with me.

282
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,400
You, don't expect to tie me down
with affection and resources.

283
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,839
The road of Wu Bi will be paved by myself,

284
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,520
not you.

285
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,880
Here's another question.

286
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,920
Say it.

287
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,280
Can you not live without him?

288
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,079
What do you mean?

289
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,800
Do you have your own perspective on life?
Your own values?

290
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,239
Why do you sound like my dad?

291
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,800
I don't want my brother
to become someone else's accessory.

292
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,160
How am I an accessory?

293
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,816
You've only lived with me for a few days.

294
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:15,839
Then let me ask you,

295
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,079
if he wants your dad's group,
will you give it to him?

296
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,160
I will.

297
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,719
You guys must be separated.

298
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,239
Impossible.

299
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
Then I wish you,

300
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
a place on the honor roll.

301
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:22,144
How long

302
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,040
do you think this ride would last?

303
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,779
This bike seems like a sturdy one.

304
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,140
The chain's a bit rusty is all.

305
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,839
Apply some oil when we get home,
and it will be as good as new.

306
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,460
I think

307
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,719
it can last for at least another two years.

308
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,400
What I meant was

309
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,480
how long can we ride this bike together?

310
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,339
However long you want it to be.

311
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,380
We're both going to college in Beijing.

312
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,119
I can even pick you up
and drop you off on my bike.

313
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,420
But let's make a deal in advance.

314
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,520
You can't live on campus.

315
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,280
We still live at home, even if it's far.

316
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,280
There's plenty of time in college.

317
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,520
We can spend it on the road.

318
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,580
You should focus on getting admitted first.

319
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,280
No problem, I have faith in you.

320
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,000
Why do I always feel

321
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,940
that our days riding bikes on the road

322
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,160
won't be long now?

323
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,664
What did you say?

324
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,040
Nothing, just keep pedaling.

325
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,359
Guys, the college entrance exam
is the day after tomorrow.

326
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,599
We're going to have a day off tomorrow.

327
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,839
Which means today

328
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,079
will be the last class

329
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,319
we have in this classroom.

330
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,079
I will also assign you the final homework.

331
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,760
I have prepared some wish cards.

332
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,440
Everyone can write your name

333
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,599
and the school you want to apply to on it.

334
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
Finally, stick it on the blackboard.

335
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,719
When you come back to school,
those who have realized their wishes

336
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,800
can take away your wish card.

337
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
I believe

338
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,680
that our whole class
will clear this blackboard.

339
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,880
I wish everyone success in the exam.

340
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:35,262

Son, son, how did you do?

360
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,136
Over here.

361
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:32,160
Mom.

362
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,959
I'm here. How was the exam?

363
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,936
Come here.

364
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,600
Mom.

365
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,839
Son.

366
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,664
How did it go?

367
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:42,816
That's great.

368
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:44,440
- It wasn't difficult.
- Let's go.

369
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,040
Let's go. Let's go home.

370
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,120
Why isn't he back yet? Look at the time.

371
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,144
Mom.

372
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:51,264
Mom.

373
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,880
Come here.

374
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:56,440
Over here.

375
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,472
Mom.

376
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:58,592
How did you do?

377
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,472
Just average.

378
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Forget it, it's over anyway.
Don't think about it anymore.

379
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,319
Wait for me to take you to school.

380
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:11,959
You dare to fool me.

381
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,860
Classmates, the college entrance exam is over.

382
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,439
We're free.

383
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,179
That's great.

384
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:26,319
Come on, let's take a picture.

385
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,279
Cheese.

386
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,400
Cheese.

387
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Cheese.

388
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,864
Su Yu.

389
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,839
I gave you a love letter in my sophomore year,
and you didn't accept it.

390
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,424
Do you remember?

391
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,959
At that time,

392
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,839
I thought it was because of Ye Wanying
that you didn't accept it.

393
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,839
But later,

394
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
I found out I was wrong.

395
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,079
If I gave you a love letter now,

396
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,840
would you accept it?

397
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,319
You can accept it for him.

398
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,920
A love letter written to two people?

399
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
That's wild.

400
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,479
You can read it for yourself.
I'm going to the toilet.

401
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:33,640
What are you looking at?

402
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,752
Nothing.

403
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,079
I don't know what to give you.

404
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,192
I'll give you a mirror.

405
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,100
If you're unhappy in the future,
look in the mirror more.

406
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,520
There's nothing
that your handsome face can't fix.

407
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:48,920
Su Yu, I…

408
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,079
Alright, you don't have to say it.
I understand.

409
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,880
That night,

410
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,280
when I said Wu Bi was more handsome than you,
I was joking.

411
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,319
Actually, in my heart,

412
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,640
you're the most handsome boy
I've ever seen since I was a child.

413
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,048
Are you busy?

414
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:33,056
Uncle.

415
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,839
You're busier than me.

416
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,199
Zhang, a cup of tea, please.

417
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,280
How are things with Hong Kong?

418
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,760
There's one more case next week.

419
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,199
After dealing with it, I can go over.

420
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,479
Uncle, you seem to be in a good mood today.

421
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,560
It's Wu Bi.

422
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,479
He passed the first-tier university line.

423
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,660
I came here to talk to you about this.

424
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,719
You don't need to arrange for him
to go study in Hong Kong.

425
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,280
I really didn't expect

426
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,279
Wu Bi to get into a prestigious
school on his own.

427
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,060
I didn't expect Su Yu

428
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,719
to have such a big influence on him.

429
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,400
Now, if Wu Bi is with Su Yu,

430
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm more at ease.

431
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,959
I never expected

432
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,560
that the son I couldn't teach well

433
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,400
would be taught well by another child.

434
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,319
It's quite something.

435
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,319
Su Yu is quite something.

436
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,599
Mr. Mo, here's your tea.

437
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:58,160
Are you scared?

438
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,168
No.

439
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:10,752
It's a pony.

440
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,680
This pony is mine.

441
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,040
He's my little knight.

442
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,959
You should join us too.

443
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,199
I'm afraid Duo will fall.

444
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,760
I won't, brother. You should go have fun.

445
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:31,019
Come on, there are caregivers over there.

446
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,300
He can watch her for us.

447
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,959
I've never ridden a horse before,
and I'm scared.

448
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,000
So you have things you're afraid of.

449
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,880
Come, I'll teach you.

450
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:43,776
It's okay.

451
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,079
Come on up, let's ride one together.

452
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,439
You're not at home?

453
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,040
I'm at the horse ranch.

454
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:18,140
The contract I left
in your suitcase last time,

455
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,319
I need it now.

456
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,359
Can you come over here?

457
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,839
I'm dozens of kilometers away from the city.

458
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,160
It's going to take a while to get back.

459
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,800
How about this? You go in and find it yourself.

460
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:29,760
The key is underneath the brick
on the left of the front door.

461
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Alright, got it.

462
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:27,936
You can dig one.

463
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,079
Make a little heart.

464
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,192
Okay.

465
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,688
What's wrong, brother?

466
00:31:35,712 --> 00:31:36,719
Haven't found it yet?

467
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,520
Yeah, think again where you put it.

468
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,719
Su Yu, did I give you

469
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,980
a contract the other day?

470
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,839
Yes, you said you were afraid of losing it,
so you asked me to keep it.

471
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,239
Where did you put it?

472
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,119
In the drawer under that desk.

473
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Go to Su Yu's bedroom,

474
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,800
and it's in the drawer of his desk.

475
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,512
Got it.

476
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,199
Let's go and play for a while longer.

477
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,832
Come on.

478
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,719
He trusted such business secrets with him.

479
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:37,728
<i>By the way,</i>

480
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:39,359
<i>Didn't you come back with your girlfriend?</i>

481
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,152
<i>Where is she?</i>

482
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,359
<i>She left in a hurry
as soon as she got off the plane.</i>

483
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,079
<i>I don't know who she rushed to see.</i>

484
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,760
<i>What about your little girlfriend?</i>

485
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,680
<i>Haven't seen you be two together for days.</i>

486
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,599
<i>Why aren't you accompanying her?</i>

487
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,560
<i>What's there to accompany her?</i>

488
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,400
<i>She's just a little girl.</i>

489
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,560
<i>It's just eating, shopping,
and watching movies.</i>

490
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,479
<i>I'm not interested in these.</i>

491
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,800
<i>What if someone else is?</i>

492
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,160
<i>The last time I heard such a character setting</i>

493
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,800
<i>was from my girlfriend.</i>

494
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,944
<i>Enough, bro.</i>

495
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,199
Zhang, help me check something.

496
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:24,400
The high school Ye Wanying
attended before going abroad.

497
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,280
<i>What if she wants to switch you?</i>

498
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
<i>That's impossible.</i>

499
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:34,920
<i>Why?</i>

500
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,079
<i>Even if it's something I don't want,</i>

501
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,520
<i>if someone else wants to take it,</i>

502
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,160
<i>there's only one outcome.</i>

503
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,760
<i>What?</i>

504
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,319
<i>Death.</i>

505
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,560
<i>Of course, except for you.</i>

506
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
<i>Then, you should switch to another one.</i>

507
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:52,439
<i>What do you mean?</i>

508
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,719
<i>She's been pestering me.</i>

509
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,920
Hello, Mr. Mo, I've checked.

510
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,000
It was indeed that high school.

511
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:08,480
Wu Bi.

512
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,199
I can't believe you take the blame
for him for such things.

513
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,479
What else are you not willing to do?

514
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,600
<i>I didn't mean to hide it from you.</i>

515
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,199
<i>Su Yu and I just had a past.</i>

516
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,280
I don't care about you two.

517
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,024
I just want to ask you,

518
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,080
did Wu Bi always know about this all along?

519
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:33,984
<i>Yes.</i>

520
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,240
After you two met in the bar that day,

521
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,679
you went to the bathroom together.

522
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,179
What did you talk about?

523
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,700
<i>I begged him not to tell you about this.</i>

524
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,059
<i>Then he asked me to promise him one condition.</i>

525
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,136
What condition?

526
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,080
To stay away from Su Yu.

527
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,296
Why?

528
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,562
<i>♫ Mila, Mila ♫</i>

529
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:33,322
<i>♫ You're such a beautiful flower ♫</i>

00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:40,194
<i>♫ Mila, Mila ♫</i>

531
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,882
<i>♫ You're the summer I can't bear to part with ♫</i>

532
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:54,040
<i>♫ You always have so many ideas ♫</i>

533
00:35:56,802 --> 00:36:01,058
<i>♫ Occasionally, you're not so obedient ♫</i>

534
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,842
<i>♫ But it's you who bring the worries ♫</i>

535
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:15,029
<i>♫ That make a complete family ♫</i>

00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:18,658
