<i>♫ Did we agree

3
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:29,762
<i>♫ Did we agree

4
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,062
<i>♫ No matter what, it will be true ♫</i>

5
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:44,290
<i>♫ Did we agree

6
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:46,626

<i>♫ How beautiful ♫</i>

16
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:29,442
<i>[Stay With Me]</i>

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,346
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,879
If there are those who commit crimes,

19
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,120
and those who are loyal and good,

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,040
they should be handed over to the authorities
for punishment or reward

21
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,680
to show Your Majesty's fairness and justice.

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,400
It's not appropriate to be biased,

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,279
and make different laws
for the insiders and outsiders.

24
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,440
What does this passage mean?

25
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,319
It means that if there are those who do evil…

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,199
<i>Why isn't he sleeping today?</i>

27
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,720
And those who are loyal and do good,

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,280
they should all be sent
to the relevant departments,

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,880
and let the officials in charge determine
their rewards and punishments.

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
In this way, it can show Your Majesty's

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,400
fair and strict ruling.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,479
Now, I'll give you five minutes

33
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,199
to take some notes.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,399
<i>Why did I have a crush on him?</i>

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,320
<i>I even confessed to him</i>

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,960
<i>trying to win him over.</i>

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
<i>Why was I so narrow-minded?</i>

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,860
We were talking about

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,450
using this method to demonstrate

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,240
Your Majesty's fair and strict ruling.

41
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,000
And a leader should not be biased.

42
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,759
Biased means having preferences.

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,880
This way, the reward and punishment methods

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,520
for people inside and outside the palace
will be different.

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,600
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

46
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,080
Okay, let's look at the next paragraph.

47
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,279
<i>Having good grades means you can do
whatever you want, huh?</i>

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,880
You came here by yourself again.

49
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,039
Dad is working overtime today,

50
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,759
so I came to find you.

51
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,679
I can't believe you hugged him
before hugging me.

52
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,759
All the story-telling wasn't for nothing.

53
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,119
Then I don't know

54
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,839
if I should give you the gift in my bag.

55
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,888
What gift?

56
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,100
How did you get it?

57
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,399
I heard that the bookstore was emptied
as soon as it was on the shelf.

58
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,519
Who do you think I am?

59
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,239
Let's go.

60
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,416
Wait for me.

61
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,079
<i>It's late. Are you coming back?</i>

62
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
<i>I'm staying at the company tonight.</i>

63
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,800
<i>Alright, focus on your work then.</i>

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,000
<i>I'll hold the fort back home. Don't worry.</i>

65
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,160
<i>Don't stay up too late.</i>

66
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>Take care of yourself. Good night.</i>

67
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,679
Sis, I checked it out.

68
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,860
That woman's name is Zhou Li.

69
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,220
She married her ex-husband nine years ago,

70
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,880
and they have a daughter named Li Duo.

71
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,200
Her ex-husband doesn't do anything legitimate.

72
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,200
He's been in jail twice.

73
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,020
Once before they got married,

74
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,239
charged with theft.

75
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,300
The other time was three years ago,

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,679
charged with armed robbery.

77
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,840
Because of his previous convictions,

78
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,720
the sentence this time was longer.

79
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,368
Tell me.

80
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,880
A criminal's child,

81
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,180
will they inherit their character?

82
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,500
I heard this little girl has been naughty
since she was little,

83
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,620
bullying other kids and the like.

84
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,360
I told you, what's in the bones

85
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,600
will show more or less.

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,279
But sometimes it's normal for children
to fight and make noise, right?

87
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,320
I see that Su Yu and Wu Bi

88
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,300
really like this little girl.

89
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,440
Yeah.

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,799
Because Zhou Li's home is very close
to Su Zhigang's.

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,480
Li Duo has been hanging out with Su Yu
since she was a little girl.

92
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,780
After Zhou Li's ex-husband went to jail,

93
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,080
Su Zhigang's family has been
quite helpful to Zhou Li.

94
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,380
And both of their children
come from single-parent families.

95
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,320
They have similar experiences, so…

96
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,799
I'm sorry, Sis, no offense.

97
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,519
That's okay. Keep going.

98
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:20,320
I think if you can't communicate

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,679
with Su Yu and Wu Bi,

100
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,660
perhaps Li Duo will be your way in.

101
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Children have no defenses,

102
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,200
and if you treat her nicely for a bit,

103
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
she'll get along with you.

104
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,619
Besides, she has two brothers
who love her so much.

105
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,200
If she speaks well of you in front of them,

106
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,880
won't that bring you closer?

107
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,239
That makes sense.

108
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,559
But how do I coax a little girl?

109
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,740
You know I've never handled a child before,

110
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,500
especially little girls, so I have no idea.

111
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,959
Isn't it simple?

112
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,640
Just give her whatever she likes.

113
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,860
A child from a background like hers

114
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,679
has probably never received any good things.

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,740
But I don't know what to buy.

116
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,760
Little girls like princess dresses,

117
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
dolls, pretty hairpins, etc.

118
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,760
Alright, I'll give it a try.

119
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,440
I struggled to climb
to the top of the mountain,

120
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,399
but the rocks I was standing on were crumbling,

121
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,539
I could only hold on firmly
to the mountain with my hands,

122
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,720
unable to turn back to look.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,419
But even if I could,

124
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,480
I wouldn't want to.

125
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm afraid my hands won't hold on…

126
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,872
Su Yu.

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,959
Su Yu.

128
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,000
I can't solve this problem.

129
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,719
Fatty and Sherry Yang

130
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:48,480
saw me on the top of the mountain
being all dizzy and weird,

131
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,220
and they wanted to reach out and pull me up,

132
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,139
but the distance is a little far.

133
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,299
The cracks in the mountain are expanding,

134
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,119
and the whole mountain
will collapse in a blink of an eye.

135
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,800
Why did I buy that book?

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,919
I had to take off my belt and let it hang down.

137
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,360
I was called by the two people above

138
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,840
as if a bucket of cold water
poured on me in the dog days.

139
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,000
Wakey wakey.

140
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,420
What time is it now?

141
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,800
It's time to get up.

142
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,440
It's time to get up.

143
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,599
Why are you leaving so early?

144
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,799
To go to morning self-study.

145
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,799
What's got into you?

146
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I've influenced you,

147
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,900
so you should influence me too.

148
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,940
Didn't you say

149
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,400
that if I work hard on my academic courses,

150
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,320
applying to aviation school is not a dream?

151
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,900
Get up, let's chase our dreams together.

152
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go.

153
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:50,976
<i>♫ Let the fire burn in our hearts ♫</i>

154
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:55,364
<i>♫ We pray ♫</i>

155
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:56,968
<i>♫ We look far away ♫</i>

156
00:09:56,968 --> 00:10:00,299
<i>♫ Even falls can't stop us
from running forward ♫</i>

157
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,145
<i>♫ Despite the torment ♫</i>

158
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:03,776
<i>♫ And the times we could only roar in anger ♫</i>

159
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:06,688
<i>♫ We have never retreated ♫</i>

160
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:08,800
<i>♫ Maybe it's not a coincidence ♫</i>

161
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,464
<i>♫ Dark clouds obscure every shining star ♫</i>

162
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:15,607
<i>♫ But the dawn will eventually come ♫</i>

163
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:19,278
<i>♫ As always ♫</i>

164
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,136
<i>♫ Promise me to keep searching ♫</i>

165
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,479
How do you solve this?

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,519
<i>He's going. He's going.</i>

167
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,200
Step aside, it's my turn.

168
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,359
Why?

169
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,880
Because he's my man,

170
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,239
and he can only explain problems to me.

171
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Why?

172
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,700
You're his deskmate.

173
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,400
You can ask him to explain problems
whenever you want.

174
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,392
Duo,

175
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,440
do you still remember me?

176
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,320
Why are you here?

177
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,559
Are you here for Brother Su Yu again?

178
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,419
Today I came here to see you.

179
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:39,560
I have bought a lot of gifts for you.

180
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,576
You'll see.

181
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,032
Look.

182
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,159
Look, Barbie dolls.

183
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,819
Do you like it?

184
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,119
Why do you want to give me things?

185
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,599
Because I'm brother Su Yu's mom.

186
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,080
Your mom was so nice to Brother Su Yu.

187
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,239
So, of course, I should be nice to you.

188
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,579
Nonsense! You scolded my mom the other day.

189
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:05,980
I didn't scold her.

190
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,039
I didn't understand the situation that day.

191
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,280
It was my mistake.

192
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
I apologize to you.

193
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,019
I'll apologize to your mom too.

194
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,460
Accept these gifts,

195
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,840
and let's be good friends.

196
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,440
I'll write a poem for you.

197
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,479
Sure.

198
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,440
Discard the big watermelon.

199
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,419
People don't want it.

200
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,919
Should we do something now?

201
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,239
It's about to explode.

202
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,119
Not bad. It rhymes well.

203
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:39,000
You can't even understand my poem.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,719
And you want to be my friend?

205
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,528
No way.

206
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,159
This little girl.

207
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,919
The little girl even writes poems.

208
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,200
And she says I don't understand.

209
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,700
Discard the big watermelon.

210
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,479
People don't want it.

211
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,760
Should we do something now?

212
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,919
It's about to explode.

213
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,239
Dipshit.

214
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,400
It's an acrostic poem.

215
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,000
This little girl is so cunning.

216
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,719
If the child is this cunning,

217
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,359
her mother must be worse.

218
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:03,319
Come on.

219
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,520
Brother, you don't have to read it for me now.

220
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,424
Why?

221
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,159
I have a pocket dictionary.

222
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,840
Brother Wu Bi bought it for me.

223
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,600
That's a smart move for Wu Bi.

224
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,080
It allows you to read stories,

225
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,280
and also to learn to recognize words.

226
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,200
Yeah, Brother Wu Bi understands me.

227
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,620
He knows what I like.

228
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,960
Unlike your mom.

229
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,520
She bought those junk

230
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,919
and tried to give them to me.

231
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,440
Who would want them?

232
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Which mom?

233
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,280
The one who came to our house that day.

234
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,160
What did she want?

235
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,500
I don't know.

236
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
She wanted to give me gifts

237
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,920
and apologize to me.

238
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,879
She said she wanted to be friends with me.

239
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,359
I don't want to talk to her.

240
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,280
She shouldn't have abandoned you
in the first place.

241
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,440
Brother, am I right?

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,459
Let me explain the question to you.

243
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,200
How did you know I wanted you to explain it?

244
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,320
You think I don't know

245
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,719
why you gave Duo a dictionary?

246
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:27,392
Which one?

247
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:28,512
This question.

248
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,719
Didn't I explain it to you before?

249
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,600
First, add these

250
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,039
two values together.

251
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,440
Then, use the known conditions
to solve these two.

252
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,112
It's right here in the front.

253
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,039
Let's go inside.

254
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,048
Alright.

255
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,120
Sis Xiao.

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,960
This is the best courtyard house

257
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,760
I could find nearby.

258
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,559
It's great. Take a look.

259
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,424
Not bad.

260
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,660
How big is it?

261
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,640
Hello, our courtyard house

262
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,919
is a straight-in courtyard,

263
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,080
covering 200 square meters.

264
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,440
Only 200 square meters?

265
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,719
Although the area is not large,

266
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,340
the courtyard is exquisite.

267
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,179
Look, these doors and windows
are all natural wood color.

268
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,479
The tiles on the eaves

269
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,359
have the patterns of traditional Chinese knots.

270
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,760
You guys can take a closer look first.

271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,159
If you need anything, just call me.

272
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,220
I'll wait for you outside.

273
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,320
Alright, thanks.

274
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,440
Sister.

275
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,840
It's not easy

276
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,239
to find such a spacious

277
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,360
courtyard house nearby.

278
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,479
You can renovate it a bit.

279
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,480
It will be amazing.

280
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,200
How far is it from my son's house?

281
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:47,560
It's just a ten-minute walk.

282
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,799
It's in between your son's house
and the school.

283
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,400
It's closer to the school.

284
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,559
He will pass here on his way to school.
It's convenient.

285
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,360
That's good.

286
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,344
Let's buy it.

287
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,320
Don't you need to discuss this with Mr. Wu?

288
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,420
It's fine.

289
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,980
He's recently been troubled enough
by the company's affairs.

290
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,000
I can make decisions on this matter.

291
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,280
Great. Let's go.

292
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,719
Come on, walk with Mom.

293
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,560
I have something nice to show you.

294
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,959
Come on, let's go in.

295
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:28,384
What are you doing?

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,160
How do you find this place?

297
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,119
It's quite nice. What's it got to do with me?

298
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,920
Everything.

299
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,319
From now on, this will be your new home.

300
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,700
I know you don't want
to live in someone else's house.

301
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,199
And you don't want to leave your father.

302
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:51,359
So I bought the closest yard to your house.

303
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,500
You and Wu Bi

304
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,020
don't need to be squeezed
in that small courtyard.

305
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,319
How good is it to live here?

306
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,959
I can come and take care of you anytime.

307
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,199
Can you not interfere with our family affairs?

308
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,880
Aren't you doing well on your own?

309
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,040
What do you mean by "your family affairs"?

310
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,479
You are my biological son.

311
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,040
Wu Bi is also my son now.

312
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,160
I can't just ignore you.

313
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,912
Besides,

314
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,560
I feel lonely living alone

315
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,920
in that big house.

316
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,864
I miss you.

317
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
I want to see you every day.

318
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:34,624
Miss me?

319
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,640
You're trying to make
your current husband happy.

320
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,439
You can't stand Wu Bi living there, right?

321
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,199
How can you think of me like that?

322
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,839
All I'm thinking about is you.

323
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,419
Look. I decorated

324
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,479
this room into a study.

325
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,020
Don't you love reading novels?

326
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,079
I bought all the most popular

327
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,400
novels from the store.

328
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,032
Do you like it?

329
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,719
If you are not happy,

330
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,880
I will discuss it with your father.

331
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,280
He would want the best for you, right?

332
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,119
No, you can't bother him.

333
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,040
I let it slide when you talked to Duo secretly.

334
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,000
If you harass our family again,

335
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,560
I'll tell Wu Bi about the statue.

336
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,648
Son.

337
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,224
Sis.

338
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,784
Sis, what happened?

339
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,359
Why are you crying?

340
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,959
Should I cancel the house now?

341
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,040
The property certificate hasn't come down yet.

342
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,599
It can be canceled if you want.

343
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
We just need to pay some penalty.

344
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,719
Forget it, keep it for now.

345
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,304
Sis.

346
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,380
I'm having a book shortage.

347
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,839
Whether it's bought or borrowed,

348
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,896
I've read them all.

349
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,040
You read too fast.

350
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,079
Finishing two books in one night.

351
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,400
There won't be enough books for your speed.

352
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,400
<i>How does he know he read
two books in one night?</i>

353
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,820
<i>My novel</i>

354
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,319
<i>is still confiscated by the teacher.</i>

355
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,840
<i>No, I have to get it out early.</i>

356
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,040
<i>Otherwise, they're going to call my parents.</i>

357
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:08,800
<i>[Words and Actions]</i>

358
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,020
What are you doing here?

359
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,220
Well…

360
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,680
The Chinese teacher asked for me.

361
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:32,239
Go in then.

362
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,880
I just went in.

363
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,199
The teacher was not there.

364
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,040
What kind of novel is this?

365
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,560
Forget it, any novel unread is a good novel.

366
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,160
I'll borrow it for one night
and return it tomorrow.

367
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,416
Who are you chatting with?

368
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,240
Mao Chong.

369
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,040
Don't you talk enough
during the day as deskmates?

370
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,080
Speaking face-to-face is different
from chatting online.

371
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,439
Alright, stop chatting.

372
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,359
I got you a novel today.

373
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:52,992
What's it called?

374
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,000
I just put it here.

375
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,199
Where did it go?

376
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,840
Alright, stop chatting.

377
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,864
What are you doing?

378
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,800
Stop chatting. Read a book.

379
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:15,072
Read this.

380
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,144
This is good.

381
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,680
We decided to eat more vegetables.

382
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,488
No meat.

383
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:25,459
Still chatting.

384
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,160
I will beat you. I will make you fall.

385
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,840
You think you can?

386
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,860
Learn and cook for me.

387
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,880
Eat meat. Vegetable salad.

388
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,959
What kind of novel is this?

389
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:41,040
I have never seen such a beautiful cover.

390
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,000
Therefore, feudal thoughts are easy to form.

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,299
Decayed and morbid phenomena

392
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,680
are an important factor
hindering historical development.

393
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,824
Alright. Class dismissed.

394
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,040
Goodbye, teacher.

395
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,199
Those who want to sign up
for the sports day can come to me.

396
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,504
Me.

397
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:14,560
I'm signing up for the 100-meter race.

398
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,616
400 meters for me.

399
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,704
400 meters for me.

400
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
1.5km. 5km.

401
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,840
Alright, what about you?

402
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
5km. 5km.

403
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,984
And me.

404
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,520
I'm going home. Bye.

405
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,688
Bye.

406
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:35,392
Let's go.

407
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,856
Is everyone here?

408
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,640
No, we're short quite a few.

409
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,119
I thought a lot of people signed up.

410
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,880
They were just making up the numbers.

411
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I kicked them out.

412
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,440
Every class has a few placeholders.

413
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
If you take it this seriously,

414
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,872
we won't have enough for the events.

415
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,439
Fill these two spots for me.

416
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,599
N, these two are on the same day.

417
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,800
One in the morning, and one in the afternoon.
It's too much.

418
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,040
No problem. Just fill it out for me.

419
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,040
Try a different one.
I think you can run the 400 meters.

420
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,160
You know I don't have explosive power.

421
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Defense. Block him.

422
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Pass. Pass it to me.

423
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,880
Block him, here!

424
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,959
Come on, here.

425
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,599
Pass it, pass!

426
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,560
Wu Bi, Wu Bi.

427
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,599
Come over here, come here.

428
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,140
Today is the last day to sign up.

429
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,400
Which events are not full yet?

430
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,260
The javelin and 400-meter hurdles.

431
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,000
You better find someone
to fill those spots quickly.

432
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,528
Hurry up.

433
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,820
Block him. Another one.

434
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,400
Catch. Come on, let's score a few more.

435
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Alright.

436
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,700
Are there still vacancies in the events?

437
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes, there are still vacancies
in the 400-meter hurdles and javelin.

438
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,800
Let me think about it.

439
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,339
Both these events seem to suit taller people.

440
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:22,959
All the tall ones in our class
seem to have signed up.

441
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,839
The only one left…

442
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,288
Mao Chong!

443
00:26:29,728 --> 00:26:30,752
Where is he?

444
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,880
No need to look. It's him.

445
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,700
Don't we need to discuss it with him?

446
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,880
Not necessary.

447
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:50,079
Did you say your class's sports commissary

448
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,079
signed you up for the 5,000-meter race
without your permission?

449
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,800
What was he thinking?

450
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,000
Even if they were aiming for the bottom,

451
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,920
they should have found someone more reliable.

452
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,220
Have you had enough of laughing?

453
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,440
Don't be mad.

454
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,159
I'm just trying to comfort you.

455
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,940
Is this how you comfort people?

456
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,599
It's clearly schadenfreude.

457
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:11,380
Think about it.

458
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,560
If I was as worried as you,

459
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,839
wouldn't it make you feel even worse?

460
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,540
You should just laugh it off as a joke.

461
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,140
You'll be cannon fodder anyway,

462
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,200
so just run casually.

463
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,479
Strive to be eliminated in the preliminaries.

464
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,320
Big brother, this is 5,000 meters.

465
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,680
There's no preliminary for the 5,000 meters.

466
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,760
It goes straight to the finals.

467
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
Once you're on the field,

468
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,159
you have to complete the full course.

469
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,439
5,000 meters!

470
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,920
Oh my God.

471
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,359
I can barely walk that far, let alone run.

472
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,540
Can't you be more ambitious?

473
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,940
It's just 5,000 meters.

474
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,659
It'll only take the time to pee to run it.

475
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,079
I don't think it's healthy

476
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,359
for your pee to take that long.

477
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,460
I should really record this and post it online

478
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,200
so that those girls can see your true colors.

479
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,599
Your ugly face.

480
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,408
Let's go back to the classroom.

481
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,980
<i>Of all people,</i>

482
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,060
<i>you had to complain to him.</i>

483
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,600
<i>He's just waiting to laugh at you.</i>

484
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,340
<i>And you jumped into the shit pit. I…</i>

485
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,419
<i>I deserved it.</i>

486
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,940
Good luck.

487
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,199
I find you annoying.

488
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,064
Come over here.

489
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,112
What's up?

490
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,040
There are two vacancies in our class's events.

491
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,119
I've signed you up.

492
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,260
What events?

493
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,040
sports day events.

494
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,579
Can you change it?

495
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,760
Nope, I've handed it to the director's office.

496
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,880
It's about to be entered.

497
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Don't.

498
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,880
I've never even touched a javelin.

499
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,920
And don't even think
about the 400-meter hurdles, it's…

500
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,460
Why don't you find someone to replace me?

501
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,140
Our sports day is based on total points.

502
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,160
We'll have to calculate the class ranking.

503
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,800
Don't let me drag the class down, right?

504
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,220
Find someone to replace you?

505
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,479
Ask around.

506
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,180
Everyone in our school knows who you are.

507
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,720
Getting first place means eight extra points,

508
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,019
but cheating will deduct twenty points.

509
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:01,599
You decide if it's worth it.

510
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,479
I think we can still negotiate.

511
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,079
Javelin is good, yeah.

512
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,760
Javelin…

513
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,920
Please talk to Wu Bi for me.

514
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,380
He only listens to you.

515
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,119
Doesn't our class have a substitute?

516
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,400
Let him find a substitute.

517
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,344
I have faith in you.

518
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:36,199
This…

519
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:38,160
This damn admiration…

520
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,959
Javelin.

521
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,800
<i>Five kilometers.</i>

522
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,000
<i>Five kilometers!</i>

523
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,560
<i>Among the vast track,</i>

524
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,959
<i>where's my resting place?</i>

525
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:03,040
<i>Going round and round,</i>

526
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,960
<i>when will it end?</i>

527
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,168
I'll take your things.

528
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,900
You're here to practice, too.

529
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,760
Yeah, what did you sign up for?

530
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,792
Five kilometers.

531
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,680
You better get going.
It's going to be dark soon.

532
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,039
How about I run a few laps with you?

533
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,319
It's not like I have anything else to do.

534
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,048
Okay.

535
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,880
Shall I join you?

536
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,560
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

537
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,720
<i>You absolutely cannot fall behind.</i>

538
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,904
Let's start officially.

539
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,640
<i>You just need to keep up with him for ten laps,</i>

540
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,400
<i>Han Bokuang, and you'll win.</i>

541
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:08,140
Adjust your breathing.
You're breathing a bit fast now

542
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,199
Three steps inhale, and three steps exhale, go.

543
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,040
<i>Did they exceed me for one lap so fast?</i>

544
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,184
Oh my God.

545
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,920
Are you guys even human?

546
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,696
Keep going.

547
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,839
Good, keep going.

548
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,792
Keep going.

549
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,760
<i>Don't compare yourself to them.</i>

550
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,279
<i>Just do your best.</i>

551
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,040
<i>Remember, your only opponent is yourself.</i>

552
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,439
<i>If you can finish the race today, you've won.</i>

553
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,019
Last lap, sprint.

554
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,072
Okay.

555
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:01,700
How do you feel?

556
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,752
I'm alright.

557
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,760
No need for that.
I'll go home and take a shower.

558
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,060
I'll take your things.

559
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,319
No need, it's nothing.

560
