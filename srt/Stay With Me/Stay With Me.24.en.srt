<i>[Episode 24]</i>

18
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:35,744
How did you make these
scrambled eggs so delicious?

19
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,903
I improved the recipe a bit.

20
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:38,303
- Really?
- Added some garlic.

21
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:40,000
It's delicious.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,056
Hurry up.

23
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:42,144
Come here.

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
What's the occasion today?

25
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:46,863
Our snack shop

26
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:48,264
has been doing better and better.

27
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,943
The landlord agreed to rent
the second floor to us for free.

28
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:54,424
There are several bedrooms on the second floor.

29
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:55,443
It's quite spacious.

30
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:56,664
When you guys go to college,

31
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:57,984
we can move over there to live.

32
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:01,104
There's also a small study room
on the second floor. It's nice.

33
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:05,824
This way, we can do a nice renovation

34
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:08,064
on our current home.

35
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:09,743
I have already arranged a construction team,

36
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,024
and they will come in a few days.

37
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,304
During this time,

38
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:13,504
you can go live with Wu Bi first.

39
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,064
When we clean up the bedrooms

40
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:17,183
on the second floor,

41
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:18,848
you can come back.

42
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,743
What's wrong with you two?

43
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:30,944
You don't seem very happy.

44
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:34,144
We are.

45
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:35,168
Yes.

46
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:36,304
Uncle, I toast to you.

47
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:37,312
Come on.

48
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:54,423
Hey, what are you doing?

49
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:55,584
What do you mean?

50
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:56,864
Stop pretending.

51
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:59,484
Why did you suddenly rent
the second floor to Su Yu's family?

52
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:01,103
Now you admit it's Su Yu's family.

53
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:02,864
Why didn't you say so at the beginning?

54
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:05,763
You are allowed to help them,

55
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,304
but not me?

56
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:11,823
You'd show so much kindness to them?
I don't buy it.

57
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,444
I don't have any kindness for him,

58
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,784
but I do for you.

59
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,284
Isn't this what you would want?

60
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,823
Alright, I've got to go.

61
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:27,344
What… what are you doing standing there?

62
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:29,124
It was you, right?

63
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:30,543
What did I do?

64
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:33,304
You let your brother rent
the second floor to us for free.

65
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:37,724
You, how did you know
that house was my brother's?

66
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,504
Your brother told me on the phone.

67
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,720
When was that?

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,504
When the snack bar was not yet renovated.

69
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:46,823
I can't believe you kept it
from me for so long.

70
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,583
I was on tenterhooks every day.

71
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,864
What do you mean I kept it from you?

72
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:50,944
Who kept it from whom first?

73
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:53,344
Wait a minute.

74
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,384
You've been in touch with my brother privately.

75
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:58,164
I don't understand your brain.

76
00:03:58,164 --> 00:03:59,263
I can't communicate with you.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,172
<i>♫ I never thought about what would be
at the end of the road ♫</i>

78
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,504
<i>♫ What it would be like ♫</i>

79
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,574
<i>♫ I never considered
whether what I was doing was right or wrong ♫</i>

80
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:45,402
<i>♫ Let them say ♫</i>

81
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:49,792
<i>♫ Maybe it's best ♫</i>

82
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,936
<i>♫ To remain silent now ♫</i>

83
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:56,977
<i>♫ Let the fire burn in my heart ♫</i>

84
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,326
<i>♫ We pray ♫</i>

85
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:02,959
<i>♫ We look far away ♫</i>

86
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,144
<i>♫Even if we stumble time and again,

87
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:08,064
<i>♫ Despite the torment ♫</i>

88
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:09,588
<i>♫ And the times we could only roar in anger ♫</i>

89
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:13,224
I finally passed the score line,

90
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:14,543
but I have to go through
another round of re-examination.

91
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:15,904
This is a trap.

92
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:17,744
At the best time of summer vacation,

93
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:19,184
everyone is eating, drinking, and having fun,

94
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:21,568
but I'm here training.

95
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:24,464
<i>♫ As always ♫</i>

96
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,823
Why are you here?

97
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:27,624
Your house is too noisy, and I can't sleep.

98
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:30,103
How could it be noisier than the classroom?

99
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:32,864
Stop dawdling and start running.

100
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:43,456
<i>♫ This world is as colorful as bubbles ♫</i>

101
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,336
<i>♫ Tempting to touch ♫</i>

102
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,496
<i>♫ But the more beautiful it is,
the more it disguises and breaks♫</i>

103
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:52,736
<i>♫ I can't control it ♫</i>

104
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:57,344
<i>♫ Only after experiencing it
can this moment be ♫</i>

105
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:59,584
<i>♫ The most worthy of appreciation ♫</i>

106
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:05,568
<i>♫ Otherwise, how could you know joy? ♫</i>

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,928
<i>♫ We pray ♫</i>

108
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:10,541

<i>♫ And the times we could only roar in anger ♫</i>

112
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,336
What's wrong?

113
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:24,184
Is your back bothering you again?

114
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:25,823
You should rest for a while.

115
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:28,164
I'm in my forties and my back is not good.

116
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:29,864
I should see a Chinese medicine doctor.

117
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,263
Brother Su Yu, are you calling Brother Wu Bi?

118
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,823
Yes.

119
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:41,004
He didn't pick up,
and I don't know what he's doing.

120
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:42,864
Your one doesn't work.

121
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:43,984
We need to use mine.

122
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:46,323
You see, as soon as I press it, it lights up.

123
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,704
Wu Bi's will light up too.

124
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:51,223
He'll contact you in a bit.

125
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,024
Why didn't you answer the phone?

126
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:16,640
Mo Yi?

127
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:23,984
Let's talk about that kick you did.

128
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:28,663
Why are you wearing Wu Bi's clothes?

129
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:31,424
Why can't I wear his clothes?

130
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:34,063
Don't you two often exchange clothes too?

131
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:37,864
I mean,

132
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:40,063
why did you change into another set of clothes?

133
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:43,383
I got my clothes dirty in the garage just now.

134
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,343
I heard from Wu Bi

135
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,144
that your dad's struggling with back pain.

136
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:13,543
I know a national-level expert
in spinal diseases,

137
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,184
and your dad can go see him.

138
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,964
Really?

139
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,383
But you need to make an appointment in advance.

140
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:22,704
It's not easy to get an appointment.

141
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:26,823
Then, can you help me make an appointment?

142
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:42,880
Okay.

143
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:56,463
Just so happens, he's free at 8 am tomorrow.

144
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:58,264
I've already made the appointment for you.

145
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:00,864
Thank you.

146
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:09,376
What?

147
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,663
Why are you looking at me like that?

148
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,624
You need a haircut.

149
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,704
Right, I was planning to go
for a cut these few days.

150
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:24,323
No need, I can do it for you.

151
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:25,376
You?

152
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,343
You know how to cut hair?

153
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,143
When I was studying abroad,

154
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,624
I did all sorts of part-time jobs to make money

155
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:33,184
and gain life experience.

156
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:35,543
Do you want to give it a try?

157
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,240
Sure.

158
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,023
You really trust my skills, huh?

159
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,543
Anyway, every time I just get a buzz cut
at the old man's place outside the house.

160
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:23,488
It's all the same.

161
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:26,304
Being handsome really gives one
the liberty to do anything, huh?

162
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,608
Thanks for the compliment.

163
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,304
This face of yours

164
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:41,504
really is superior.

165
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,103
Your mom's genes weren't wasted.

166
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,583
It's not scary to have a superior face,

167
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,504
but it's scary to have a superior brain.

168
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,184
Then you're quite scary.

169
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:06,624
Are you scared of me?

170
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,248
No.

171
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:13,223
Growing up in your environment,

172
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:16,583
where did you get such confidence?

173
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:19,944
It's not about confidence.

174
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:21,728
Then what is it?

175
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:24,223
Because you are Wu Bi's brother.

176
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:26,656
So?

177
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:30,944
So I won't have any opinions about you.

178
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,160
Right.

179
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,184
The two of us,

180
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,264
one is a crude rogue,

181
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:44,384
and the other is a refined rogue.

182
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:46,663
Essentially we are the same,

183
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,264
just different in the way we express ourselves.

184
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,824
What are you doing?

185
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,008
What did I do?

186
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,343
Tell me what I did.

187
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:07,803
I just helped him cut his hair,

188
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:08,804
and what's wrong with that?

189
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,143
Why would you cut his hair all of a sudden?

190
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:11,712
I asked him to cut it.

191
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:13,343
He said he knows how to cut hair.

192
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,128
I'm going to wash my hair.

193
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:21,792
What are you doing here?

194
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:24,103
I have a case in court tomorrow,

195
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,184
and I came here to inform you.

196
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,683
You must be present tomorrow,

197
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:31,463
so that even if we lose, there would be
someone to support me.

198
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:33,728
What time?

199
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:35,624
9 am.

200
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:00,543
Stay away from him in the future.

201
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,384
What do you mean "stay away from him"?

202
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,644
When have I ever tried to get close to him?

203
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:06,903
He's not as simple as we are.

204
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:09,304
He can be much more complicated than you think.

205
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:11,304
I've told you,

206
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:12,723
everyone in the Mo family is a psycho,

207
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,184
and none of them are easy to deal with.

208
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,663
He can be however he wants to be.

209
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:19,184
I'm not interested.

210
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:27,343
I'm not asking you to know him.

211
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,583
I'm just reminding you

212
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,824
to be wary of him,

213
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:35,504
and don't easily consider him one of us.

214
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:38,944
But he said,

215
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,764
you two, one is a crude rogue,

216
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,364
and the other is a refined rogue.

217
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,583
Essentially, you're the same,

218
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:46,624
just different in the way
you express yourselves.

219
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:47,680
Same my ass.

220
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:49,703
He's just praising himself.

221
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:51,964
We're fundamentally different.

222
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,343
I'm tough on the outside
and soft on the inside.

223
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:55,143
He's tough on the outside
and ruthless on the inside.

224
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:56,984
We're so different

225
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,463
in our bones.

226
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:14,463
Hello?

227
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:15,616
Are you up yet?

228
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,824
Isn't your court hearing at nine?

229
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:22,584
It's only seven.

230
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:25,023
Do you think this is like a class
where you can arrive just in time?

231
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,864
Alright, got it.

232
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,023
Why are you up so early, too?

233
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,744
My dad has been suffering from back pain,

234
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,143
and I've made an appointment

235
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:44,256
with a traditional Chinese medicine doctor.

236
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:46,463
Why so early?

237
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:49,663
He's a national treasure-level expert.

238
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:50,824
You think you can just
make an appointment whenever you want?

239
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:53,463
If it weren't for your brother, I wouldn't even
have been able to get this appointment.

240
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:21,424
Su Yu, I'll drive.

241
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:24,224
Aren't you going to the court?

242
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,484
I'd better take you there.

243
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:27,224
I can go to court after dropping you off.

244
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:28,384
It's not on the same route.

245
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:31,764
You just got your driver's license,
so I'm not at ease.

246
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,123
Didn't you hit the road directly
when you just got your driving license?

247
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:36,143
Besides, isn't your brother rushing you?

248
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:38,424
Don't worry about him.

249
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,143
I have to take you there,
or I won't be at ease.

250
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,424
Get in the car.

251
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,024
Hello?

252
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,064
Where are you now?

253
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,064
I just got out of the community.

254
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:05,264
How much longer until you arrive?

255
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:07,564
I can't say for sure.

256
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,663
I have to drop off Su Yu first
before I come to you.

257
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,103
What did you say?

258
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,023
I said, can't you wait a little bit?

259
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,343
I'm sure I can get there on time.

260
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,384
I won't miss your case.

261
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:22,064
Did you get in his car?

262
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:24,984
I'll talk to you later. Gotta go now.

263
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,144
Did I scare you just now?

264
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:10,744
Try to avoid taking calls
while driving in the future.

265
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,584
What's wrong with the car?

266
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:45,384
There's a little problem.

267
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,423
Is it a brake failure?

268
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:52,183
It's okay, I'm here.

269
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:53,264
Close your eyes and rest for a while.

270
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:07,223
<i>The road ahead is all straight
and there aren't many cars.</i>

271
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:10,664
<i>I can slow down by manual downshift.</i>

272
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:53,760
Wu Bi?

273
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:04,896
Wu Bi.

274
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,484
Wu Bi.

275
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,624
How… how did he get so badly injured?

276
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:37,744
Call an ambulance!

277
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:40,544
It was all because of me.

278
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:42,183
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have been hurt so badly.

279
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,904

296
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:02,943
<i>I wanted to leave a scar.

297

303
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:20,928
<i>Not at all.</i>

304
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:23,044
<i>With your physical condition,</i>

305
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,724

306
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:25,984

308
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:29,280

Wu Bi.

318

Wu Bi.

319
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,643
You have to lay him flat on the ground.

320
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:16,343
Holding him like this is very dangerous.

321
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:20,463
Don't touch him. Don't.

Stop his bleeding.

326
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:39,943
The hospital just called,

327
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:41,303
and it's the morning rush hour now.

328
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:43,744
The ambulance is stuck and can't get here.

329

Wu Bi. Wu Bi, hang in there.

330
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:49,823
You have to hang in there, OK?

331
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:52,823
Your mom already left so suddenly.

332
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:55,223
It can't happen to you again.

Wu Bi, listen,

334
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,103
it's Duo calling you.

335
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:12,223
Didn't you promise we'd always be together?

336
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,544

00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:47,408
<i>We're not redundant to each other.</i>

358
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:52,827
<i>I finally found you.</i>

359
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,648
<i>Quick, pack your things and go home.</i>

360
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:55,727
<i>From today,</i>

361
00:26:57,488 --> 00:26:58,528
<i>to the day you get married,</i>

362
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:01,664
<i>I will be with you</i>

363
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:04,512
<i>for all the holidays</i>

364
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:08,514
<i>♫ No matter where you are, home will be ♫</i>

365
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:13,648
<i>A birthday gift, six years late.</i>

366
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,248
<i>I'm delivering it for my mom.</i>

367
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,767
<i>Why does it feel like
a Superman transformation?</i>

368
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,408
<i>Who could look so handsome
during a transformation?</i>

369
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:27,528
<i>I'm going to set this picture
as my computer desktop.</i>

370
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:35,488
Wu Bi, you have to be okay.

371
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:38,447
We've been through such hard times.

372
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:41,447
There are still so many places we haven't been

373
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:43,888
and so many holidays we need to spend together.

374
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:51,531
<i>♫ When will you grow up ♫</i>

375
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:58,407
<i>♫ Mila, Mila ♫</i>

376
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:04,927
<i>In my heart,</i>

377
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:07,648
<i>you've always been indestructible,</i>

378
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:10,768
<i>always so healthy,</i>

379
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:13,207
<i>always full of energy,</i>

380
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:15,567
<i>never needing care or protection.</i>

381
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:19,327
<i>But at this moment, I realize how wrong I was.</i>

382
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:22,408
<i>You would get hurt,</i>

383
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:24,248
<i>show weakness,</i>

384
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:26,768
<i>and stay in a coma.</i>

385
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:30,528
<i>I realized how afraid I am of losing you.</i>

386
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:33,567
<i>So much so that I would give up everything</i>

387
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:35,888
<i>in exchange for your life,</i>

388
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:39,967
<i>as long as you can live.</i>

389
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:47,584
<i>♫ In that place ♫</i>

390
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:16,512
<i>[In surgery]</i>

391
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:27,008
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

392
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:31,108
<i>Su Yu, Su Yu.</i>

393
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:32,668
<i>Your dad married my mom,</i>

394
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:34,728
<i>and you're still pretending to be poor
and trying to get close with me.</i>

395
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:36,047
<i>How else do you want to humiliate me?</i>

396
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:37,768
<i>Open the door!</i>

397
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:39,207
<i>Do you think I want to be his son?</i>

398
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,047
<i>In their marriage,</i>

399
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,087
<i>am I not a victim too?</i>

400
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:56,944
<i>Why can't we have a complete family?</i>

401
00:33:56,272 --> 00:34:00,784
<i>♫ Mila, Mila ♫</i>

402
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:07,544
<i>♫ You're such a beautiful flower ♫</i>

403
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:14,448

<i>♫ You always have so many ideas ♫</i>

406
00:34:31,056 --> 00:34:35,312
<i>♫ Occasionally, you're not so obedient ♫</i>

407
00:34:37,964 --> 00:34:42,096
<i>♫ But it's you who bring the worries ♫</i>

408
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:49,283
<i>♫ That make a complete family ♫</i>

409

<i>♫ Because with you by my side ♫</i>

412
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,576
<i>♫ Everything becomes beautiful ♫</i>

<i>♫ From today, every moment and instant ♫</i>

414
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:10,480
<i>♫ Will be the happiest time in life ♫</i>
