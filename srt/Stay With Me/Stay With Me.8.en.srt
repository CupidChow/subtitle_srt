21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,040
Wu Bi seems off today.

22
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,959
And what's with that wound on his face?

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,739
His dad must have done it.

24
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,239
Who else would dare to do this to him?

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,000
It's not a matter of daring.

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
It's about who could actually beat him.

27
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,960
♫ You said the two of us must always
protect each other well ♫

28
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,752
What's going on?

29
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,240
Why can't I hate him

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,960
after all this?

31
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,880
After all, he's your father.

32
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,639
How can you just hate him so easily?

33
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,800
Even when I fight with him,

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,919
I can't bring myself to use full force.

35
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,240
Well. Y-You're filial.

36
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,119
Since childhood,

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,759
I've only made one serious friend.

38
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,199
I thought I'd found a confidant.

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,720
Friend?

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Done.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,960
Brother, how did you get this injury?

42
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,479
From punching the sandbag.

43
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,679
This sandbag is so annoying.

44
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,160
I'll help you take care of it.

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,839
Don't. The sandbag is too hard.

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,580
Brother Wu Bi is still the best.

47
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,279
He never hurts his hand
when punching sandbags.

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,448
Calm down, calm down.

49
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:05,720
Brother,

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,520
why hasn't Wu Bi been coming lately?

51
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,239
He got lost.

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,239
He can't find his way home.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,019
It's so infuriating. I just couldn't stand it.

54
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,100
Exactly.

55
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,720
This is excessive bullying.

56
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,760
I've never seen him cry since we were little.

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,980
This is the first time.

58
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,640
We have to help Wu Bi get his revenge.

59
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,780
Otherwise, our top bully at
Weide International High School

60
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,500
would be far too pitiful.

61
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,000
Exactly. I've wanted to deal
with him for a long time.

62
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,079
Students,

63
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,279
the results of our scholarship vote

64
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,339
this semester are out.

65
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,239
The students who received the scholarship are

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,340
Qiao Chuchu and Su Yu.

67
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,519
Any objections?

68
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,799
No.

69
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,320
Alright, congratulations to these two students.

70
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,200
You've changed your ring.

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,000
A matching set.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,680
Your husband really spoils you.

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
My little money can't

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,399
be shown off in front of Mrs. Wu.

75
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,419
Look at her. A 1960s haute couture brooch

76
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,920
is worth several of my sets.

77
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,160
It's not that exaggerated.

78
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,239
It's all from my husband.

79
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:51,479
Hello?

80
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,759
Hello, are you Su Yu's mom?

81
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,119
Yes, I am. Hello.

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,120
Su Yu applied for a scholarship.

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
We'd like to learn about his family situation.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,619
I'm not available right now.

85
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,680
Please call back a little later.

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,720
Thank you.

87
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,568
Go on.

88
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,376
Su Yu.

89
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,824
Why are you here again?

90
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,559
I heard you applied for a scholarship.

91
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,559
I apply every year. Is there a problem?

92
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,160
Why would you rather apply for a scholarship

93
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,180
than take Mom's money?

94
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,500
Because it's your money.

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,920
It has nothing to do with me.

96
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,776
Take it.

97
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,816
Why?

98
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,440
Mom doesn't want people to look down on you.

99
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,239
I rely on my own grades to get government aid,

100
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,520
which eases the burden on my dad.

101
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
Why would people look down on me?

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
Please don't project your vanity

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
onto everyone else.

104
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,799
I'm not vain.

105
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,679
I am worried about you.

106
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,519
Hello, what's up?

107
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,959
Take a look at our school's forum.

108
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:29,500
What's going on? Someone's confessing
their love for you on the school forum again?

109
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,000
No, something happened. Su Yu is in trouble.

110
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,559
A top student pretends to be poor
to get financial aid,

111
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,880
when in reality he's a rich second generation.

112
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,200
What's the situation?

113
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,160
Han Bokuang,

114
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
are you secretly playing on the computer again?

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,399
Dad, wait a moment.

116
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,319
What's going on? You're not doing
your homework and you're playing with it?

117
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm telling you, turn it off
right away. Turn it off!

118
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,399
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

119
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,920
Dad, Dad. I have something to ask you.

120
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,160
What's the matter? Don't talk nonsense.

121
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,440
I-It's about Su Yu's mom.

122
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:14,480
Su Yu's mom?

123
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,840
What happened to Su Yu's mom?

124
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,760
Do you know about Su Yu's
mom getting remarried?

125
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,040
Who doesn't know about that?

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,399
The news got out everywhere.

127
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,504
Turn it off.

128
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,760
Do your homework properly.

129
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:29,399
No more playing.

130
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,432
Okay.

131
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,040
Do your homework properly.

132
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,280
Don't even think about touching it again.

133
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,599
What to do?

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,560
Do you know about last night's
forum post with Su Yu?

135
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,680
What is it?

136
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,100
It's about his mom marrying a rich man.

137
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,400
A rich man?

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,584
Doesn't he have a sister too?

139
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,672
Yeah.

140
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,239
Right, his family isn't poor at all.

141
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,240
He pretended to be a needy student.

142
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,000
His mom married a rich guy.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,479
Here he comes. It's him, it's him.

144
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,320
It's him pretending to be poor.

145
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,280
Don't take that forum post too seriously.

146
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,940
Han Bokuang and I have asked
the forum administrator

147
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,960
to remove the post.

148
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,000
What post?

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,039
You don't know?

150
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:32,080
Gosh.

151
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,559
Li Lei, Han Mei Mei.

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,488
What is it?

153
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,880
It is that someone took a picture of you

154
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,020
and a beautiful woman in front
of school yesterday

155
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,600
and posted it on the forum.

156
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
They said that person was your mom,

157
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,400
and you're not a poor student.

158
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
In fact, your family is doing well.

159
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,880
People actually believe that kind of talk?

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,816
I've been your deskmate for so long.
I know what your family situation is like.

161
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:55,936
What else did the post say?

162
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,160
It's nothing.

163
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,580
I'll go to the computer room
and see for myself.

164
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,760
Don't look.

165
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
Okay, let me tell you.

166
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,359
How should I put this?

167
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,819
Don't push me.

168
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,840
Wait for me.

169
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:13,880
Be careful.

170
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,080
Take it slow. Let's go.

171
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,720
I really did not expect

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,019
Su Yu's mom to be a homewrecker

173
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,739
because he gets such good grades
and acts so righteously.

174
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,599
Not only does this destroy families,

175
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,280
but it also disperses wives and children.

176
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,559
What exactly is this?

177
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,620
What are you guys talking about?

178
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,359
Didn't you see yesterday's pinned post?

179
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,239
I don't really browse the forum.

180
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,539
Then you have to hurry up and take a look.

181
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,119
It'll completely shatter your worldview.

182
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,599
You don't know how close he is with Su Yu?

183
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,680
Why do you say this to him?

184
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,760
Close?

185
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,320
Didn't the two of them just fight
a few days ago?

186
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,424
It's fine.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's not excessive to say it
a few more times for people like this.

188
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Su Yu.

189
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,472
Su Yu.

190
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,640
Your financial aid application
is being reviewed,

191
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
and there may be some problems
during the process.

192
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,440
However, I believe in you.

193
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,719
It's just that this matter has now

194
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,020
reached the school leaders,

195
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,200
and the impact isn't very good.

196
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,700
But don't let this bother you.

197
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,000
Now, your grades are
the most important thing, understand?

198
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,239
It was you who did it, right?

199
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,080
I knew you would think that way.

200
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,400
Why did you do so?

201
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,359
Don't you know

202
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,719
what kind of life my dad and I have?

203
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,080
Do you really want to trample on

204
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,599
my last shred of dignity
just to satisfy yourself?

205
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,680
Is that how you see me?

206
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
What else, then?

207
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:04,599
Apart from you,

208
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,320
who else in this school knows
about my family situation?

209
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,719
Yes, you're right about everything.

210
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,640
It was me. I just couldn't stand you.

211
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,000
I just want to revenge.

212
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,479
Why are you wiping it so vigorously?

213
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,200
It's all on me now.

214
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,599
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,280
It's a karmic relationship.

216
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,479
Dad, I'm going to school.

217
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,159
Take it slow on the road.

218
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,040
Someone on the forum said
his mom is a homewrecker.

219
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,000
No way, that's disgusting.

220
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,640
His mom is really something.

221
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,799
Su Yu,

222
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,639
can you treat us to ice cream this time?

223
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah, you should have no problem
treating the whole class now, right?

224
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,199
Brother Wu Bi.

225
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,079
You came alone?

226
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,272
Yes.

227
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:44,480
♫ To be called a family? ♫

228
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,560
Your hand is so cold.

229
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,239
Su Yu didn't come to school today.

230
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm not here to find him.

231
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm here to find you.

232
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,539
Find me?

233
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,520
Last time I asked Brother Su Yu,

234
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,560
why didn't you come to see us
during this period?

235
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,319
He said you got lost
and couldn't find your way home.

236
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,199
Last time you sent me home,

237
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,119
now it's my turn to send you home.

238
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,100
I don't have a home anymore.

239
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,319
How can that be? My home is your home.

240
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:25,568
♫ Did we agree
we would have endless stories? ♫

241
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:28,079
♫ About you ♫

242
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,520
This is a scarf my mom knitted for you.

243
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,208
♫ About our family ♫

244
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,928
♫ I'll wait here foolishly for you ♫

245
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:44,672

♫ Maybe this is the meaning of family ♫

251
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,479
So that's how it is.

252
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,240
I thought Wu Bi

253
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,239
grew up in this area since he was little.

254
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,639
This child is actually quite pitiful.

255
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,520
Although his family is well-off,

256
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,840
his mom passed away early.

257
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,199
His dad doesn't care about him,

258
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,719
and has remarried.

259
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:26,319
Now, this child doesn't even want to go home.

260
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,416
♫ I'll guard you silently here ♫

261

00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:55,936
♫ To be called a family? ♫

266
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:04,160
♫ Is it true that we must have

267
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:06,080

269
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,719
Son, you're back.

270
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,520
Su Yu is back.

271
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,680
Just in time.

272
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,560
Wash your hands quickly. Today is the
Winter Solstice, the day to eat dumplings.

273
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,479
I made you a zucchini and egg dumpling filling.

274
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,368
Where's Duo?

275
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:44,079
Once she's back, she goes straight to
play with Xiaowu.

276
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,599
- She's off to play with Xiaowu again.
- Yeah.

277
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,860
This kid, why does she like to
visit others so much?

278
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,899
I find this child quite interesting.

279
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:51,000
No matter how much she gets scolded,

280
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,479
she forgets once she turns ahead. Guess it.

281
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,856
Do you think they fought today?

282
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:54,959
They won't.

283
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,680
How can they fight every day? Right?

284
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,899
If they were going to fight,

285
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,232
Xiaowu is not going to defeat Duo.

286
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:00,288
Really?

287
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,959
Duo pushed him over with one shove.

288
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,199
Here, try this. Eat the dumplings.

289
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,216
Alright, alright.

290
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Do you want some garlic?

291
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,700
I'll peel some for you.

292
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,888
I'll peel some garlic for you.

293
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,019
No, you eat the dumplings.

294
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,128
Eat.

295
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,300
I didn't expect this child to really
have a mind of her own.

296
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,880
She went straight to find you.

297
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,256
Mr. Su,

298
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,680
please don't tell Ms. Zhou.

299
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,320
I've already promised Duo.

300
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,439
Alright, I will listen to you.

301
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,280
You see, you haven't been here for so long,

302
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,400
I miss you.

303
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,160
Su Yu, he's just like that.

304
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,580
Since he was a child, he has been stubborn
and loves to dwell on things.

305
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,880
Don't take it to heart.

306
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,680
It's no big deal. Who hasn't lied before?

307
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:14,880
Mr. Su, didn't Su Yu tell you?

308
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,968
Tell me what?

309
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,624
Nothing.

310
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,800
Su Yu,

311
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,680
is he alright?

312
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,720
He's fine.

313
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,239
He just ate a big plate of dumplings.

314
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,800
You should go in and eat too.

315
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,719
Today is the Winter Solstice,
the day to eat dumplings.

316
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:33,279
There are your favorite zucchini
and egg fillings.

317
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,980
No, I have some other things to do.

318
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,120
I'll leave first.

319
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,040
Alright.

320
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,719
Is this your work?

321
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,359
You called us here so late

322
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,400
just to praise us?

323
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:16,384
Apologize.

324
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,079
Apologize? To whom?

325
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,000
You guess?

326
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,760
Wait. Are you sure?

327
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,760
You want us to apologize to
that mistress's son?

328
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,424
Why should we?

329
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,959
We were avenging you.

330
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,359
Why are you turning your back on us?

331
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,040
Avenging me?

332
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,840
Is disseminating my family's scandal

333
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,320
assisting me in avenging?

334
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,160
We didn't mention you.

335
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:48,864
I don't care.

336
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,719
Tonight, you must publicly
apologize on the forum.

337
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,000
Otherwise, no one is leaving here.

338
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,940
I shouldn't have had that attitude towards
you the day before yesterday.

339
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,008
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,959
What are you doing?

341
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:21,079
Su Yu, can you help me with this question?

342
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,239
You fence-sitters!

343
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,980
You were the ones
who were gossiping two days ago,

344
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,119
and now you see the apology post

345
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,599
and come back to please him.

346
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,800
It turns out I really wronged him.

347
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,079
Su Yu,

348
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,719
why are you still unhappy?

349
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,340
Didn't those two people publicly

350
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,599
apologize on the forum?

351
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,359
Now everyone sympathizes with you,

352
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,520
and no one is gossiping about you.

353
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,319
Don't mention it anymore.
I don't want to hear it.

354
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,299
Alright, alright.

355
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,239
Let's talk about something happy.

356
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,239
By the way, why haven't you gone back
home with Wu Bi recently?

357
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,459
Why are you bringing this up?

358
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,479
What's wrong?

359
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,640
Did he take away your crush?

360
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,760
It was his dad who stole my dad's crush.

361
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,800
My mom's current husband is his dad.

362
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,560
No way.

363
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,599
What do you think?

364
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,180
Is it okay?

365
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,264
Okay.

366
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,168
What's going on?

367
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,640
Y-You guys didn't pay.

368
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,719
Pay what?

369
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:09,279
Your husband fooled us out of
so much money before.

370
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,320
I didn't take you as collateral.
That's already good for you.

371
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,439
What's going on? Try it.

372
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,839
Boss, give me a bowl of noodles.

373
00:26:16,928 --> 00:26:18,079
Alright.

374
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,439
Please take a seat first, sit over there.

375
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,472
Okay.

376
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,119
He is the famous rich man's son after all.

377
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,420
Why would he come to our school?

378
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,479
And he's so nice to you.

379
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,119
Could his dad have arranged
for him to come here

380
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,168
to get close to you?

381
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,719
He only found out not long ago.

382
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,119
What a coincidence!

383
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,439
But it's awesome, isn't it?

384
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,600
What are you talking about?

385
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,780
Think about it,

386
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,139
a rich dad falls from the sky,

387
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:58,239
along with a brother who spoils you so much.

388
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,920
This is the perfect

389
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,359
romance script for you.

390
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,400
Get lost, get lost, get lost.

391
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,539
Why haven't you been hanging out
with Mao Chong lately?

392
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:08,760
Weren't you always together before?

393
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,599
Don't mention it.

394
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,119
What happened? Did he steal your crush?

395
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,320
You're actually right.

396
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Really?

397
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,640
That girl from Taiwan.

398
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,019
The person she likes

399
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,079
is Mao Chong?

400
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,520
So who's better off than who?

401
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,520
Students, do you know?

402
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,280
China was the first country

403
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,359
in the world to establish

404
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,400
a unified government system.

405
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,800
It's about seven to eight hundred years
ahead of the West.

406
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,376
Why?

407
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,040
There's an important academic theory.

408
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,040
You've been training a lot recently.

409
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,119
Feel it, feel it.

410
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:06,599
Okay, okay, okay.

411
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,120
- Is it hard enough?
- Hard, hard, hard.

412
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,580
I've trained, you know.

413
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,860
How did you train? Teach me.

414
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,968
Push-ups.

415
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,800
I heard Wu Bi is transferring.

416
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,839
How do you know?

417
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,279
I went to the class teacher's office today.

418
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,160
I heard the class teacher
talking to other teachers about it.

419
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:48,119
You're buying things on TV again.

420
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,419
What do you mean by that?

421
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,400
This was bought for me by Wu Bi.

422
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,400
When did he buy it for you?

423
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,640
I think it was last month.

424
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,760
It's been at the post office,
I forgot to pick it up.

425
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:05,860
Seriously, it's really comfortable.

426
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,599
Wu Bi is such a thoughtful kid.

427
00:29:11,712 --> 00:29:12,760
What are you doing?

428
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,839
Give it back to him.

429
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,620
Why are you so petty?

430
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,760
It's not a big deal.

431
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,880
It's been so many days
and you still haven't let it go.

432
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:20,439
I'm petty?

433
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,359
Will you be kind

434
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,800
if I tell you the truth?

435
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,880
What truth?

436
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,680
You forced me to say this.

437
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,160
Mom married his father.

438
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,520
You mean his dad is…?

439
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,959
Yeah, the so-called good buddy of yours

440
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,880
is the current husband of your ex-wife.

441
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,959
My good buddy.

442
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,048
My wife.

443
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,440
My ex-wife.

444
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,760
I told my dad about this today.

445
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,520
Will it be a big blow to him?

446
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,520
With my tone,

447
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,760
he should be quite heartbroken.

448
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:46,880
Dad.

449
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,464
Dad.

450
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:24,290
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

451
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:31,050
