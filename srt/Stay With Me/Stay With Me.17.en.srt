<i>[Episode 17]</i>

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,480
Where did I go wrong with this problem?

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Read it again.

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,959
Read the question carefully.

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,639
X squared plus Y squared, then…

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,960
Where did I go wrong with this problem?

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,839
Didn't the teacher explain this yesterday?

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,800
<i>I let it go when you talked to Duo secretly.</i>

25
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,820
<i>If you harass my family again,</i>

26
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,740
<i>I'll tell Wu Bi about the statue.</i>

27
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,199
Take a close look at the distance between them.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,639
When the distance of AD
is greater than the one of CD,

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,160
is rectangle ADCA…

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,479
So AM equals AMB which equals two,

31
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,120
and AD equals two.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,880
Where did I go wrong with this problem?

33
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,960
Why is he calling me?

34
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,096
<i>Long time no see.</i>

35
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,168
Long time no see.

36
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,479
<i>How is the preparation

37
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,780
What are you saying?

38
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,039
<i>Are you satisfied with that location?</i>

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
Come on. Have a try.

40
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,200
Measure it.

41
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:24,768
Too big.

42
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:25,799
It's too big, isn't it?

43
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,880
Too big. Let's change it.

44
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
This won't do.

45
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:30,300
Braised noodles.

46
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,340
Braised noodles.

47
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,399
Our specialty.

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,144
It's good.

49
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:35,160
Will it do?

50
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,832
It's a bit high.

51
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,888
How about this?

52
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:39,319
Make it level with this.

53
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,040
Isn't it too low to be level?

54
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,720
Right, right. A bit higher.

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,279
Right, a bit higher.

56
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,760
Just align it with it, right?

57
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,280
Son.

58
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Son, what brings you here?

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
I have something to ask you.

60
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,320
Okay.

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,599
Have you had dinner yet?

62
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,420
I hired a very good chef.

63
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,600
Let's talk over the meal. Come on.

64
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,420
Su,

65
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,400
we're running low on drinks.
We need to restock.

66
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,424
Okay.

67
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,440
Get more sour plum drinks.
They sell fast in the summer.

68
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,479
Got it.

69
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,860
Mom, Mom, Mom,

70
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,239
Brother and I bought a telescope.

71
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,040
A telescope?

72
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,739
The kind that can see stars?

73
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,200
Why are there only two of you? Where's Su Yu?

75
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,799
He said he had business and left early.

76
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,440
Son, try this meatball.

77
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,740
It's very delicious.

78
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,159
And the ribs.

79
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,720
Eat more.

80
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,760
And this.

81
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,760
Dig in.

82
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,359
How much do you know

83
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,064
about Wu Bi's mother's death?

84
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,839
If I say I know nothing about it,

85
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,679
can you believe me?

86
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,480
Son, as you're so smart,

87
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,480
think about it.

88
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,279
What was mom's status at the time?

89
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,920
To put it bluntly,

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,119
I was just a singer.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,040
What was Wu Bi's mother's background?

92
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,279
Would I dare to provoke her?

93
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,224
Besides,

94
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,780
if Wu had anything to do with me at that time,

95
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,160
he wouldn't have taken such a risk

96
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,640
to offend his wife's family

97
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,079
and make such a big grudge

98
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,799
against his own son.

99
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,920
<i>It seems that your dad
was quite nice to your mom's family.</i>

100
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,960
<i>Nonsense.</i>

101
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
<i>If it weren't for the help of my uncle,</i>

102
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,739
<i>he wouldn't have even been able to
start this company.</i>

103
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,980
<i>My father's success today</i>

104
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,799
<i>all owes to the support of my mother's family.</i>

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,179
Moreover,

106
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,079
there was really nothing between me and Wu.

107
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:20,704
Nothing?

108
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,740
Nothing would cause Wu Bi
to have such a big grudge against you?

109
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,559
Nothing would cause him
to hate you for so many years?

110
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,440
If I had anything to do with Wu,

111
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,640
how could he marry me six years later?

112
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,379
If I was able to make him
abandon his wife and child,

113
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,200
would he be away from home all the time now?

114

<i>[Zhou's Snacks]</i>

00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,679

116
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,760
Okay.

117
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,860
You're studying the lottery so seriously

118
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,320
as if it's a serious business.

119
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,719
I am obsessed with it now.

120
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,159
Do some accounting.

121
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,184
The performance today is not bad.

122
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:02,240
Did you see it?

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,180
I saw it. It's so bright, Brother.

124
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,479
Come on, let me have a look.

125
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Brother, do you miss your mom?

126
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,559
Why do you ask this?

127
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,440
Because I heard

128
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,519
that everyone becomes a star after they die.

129
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,039
Do you know which one is your mom?

130
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,860
I know. I marked it a long time ago.

131
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,320
I only look at that one every time.

132
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,520
Then I'll mark one for my dad too.

133
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,380
You still miss him?

134
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,540
No. I just consider him dead.

135
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,759
The teacher said
that a person should live a valuable life.

136
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,319
Some people are alive but already dead,

137
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,540
while some are dead
but still live in our hearts.

138
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,320
So, Brother, be strong.

139
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,216
Come on.

140
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,640
You really are my little angel.

141
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,080
Look, come on, sit tight.

142
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,792
Look at that.

143
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,679
Where did you go today?

144
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,799
Delivering the MP3 to Han Bokuang.

145
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,799
How come I feel like
you have something on your mind?

146
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,880
Everyone in class says I have a poker face,

147
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,119
but you can actually tell
I have something on my mind?

148
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
That's because they

149
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,919
don't spend enough time looking at

150
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,408
your face.

151
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,240
I want to ask you something.

152
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
About your parents.

153
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,208
Do you mind?

154
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,359
If someone else asks,

155
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,752
I would mind.

156
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:06,176
But if it's you,

157
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,608
I won't.

158
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,640
Why are you so sure

159
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,719
that my mom pandered to your dad?

160
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,719
My parents had a good relationship

161
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,704
until

162
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,719
my dad met your mom.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,280
Then they started to argue.

164
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,280
A few days before my mom died,

165
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,840
I also heard them

166
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,440
talk about divorce.

167
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:40,832
Divorce?

168
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,239
Who proposed the divorce?

169
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
My mom.

170
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,180
<i>What did you say?</i>

171
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,919
<i>I said, "Let's get a divorce."</i>

172
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,119
<i>I disagree.</i>

173
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,479
<i>Why are you getting a divorce?</i>

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,479
<i>Adults are talking.
What are you meddling with? Get out.</i>

175
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,679
<i>Is it because of that woman?</i>

176
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,960
<i>Did you have an affair?</i>

177
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,280
<i>Who told you the nonsense?</i>

178
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,840
<i>Your employees. They all said so.</i>

179
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,856
<i>You.</i>

180
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Hello, who are you looking for?

181
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm looking for Ms. Xiao…

182
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,312
Don't stop him. That's my son.

183
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:30,479
Hello, Mrs. Wu.

184
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,039
Why did you come by the bike?

185
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,119
If you said you were coming,
I would have sent a car to pick you up.

186
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:37,340
Come on. Let me help you.

187
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,359
It's okay. I can do it myself.

188
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,000
Come on, have some fruit.

189
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,140
You came to see me today.

190
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,479
I am very happy.

191
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,919
Why don't you redecorate the house?

192
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,440
Why should I redecorate it?

193
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
Isn't it good?

194
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,159
And the furniture here is valuable.

195
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,960
I quite like it.

196
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
I just think

197
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,880
this is a place where they once lived in love.

198
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,960
There is not a single thing
that belongs to you.

199
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,039
Doesn't it bother you to live here?

200
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
Or is it because

201
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,880
you like the feeling of
taking over other people's things?

202
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,400
Why can't you just believe in me?

203
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,599
I never thought about taking over anyone.

204
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,640
I couldn't before,

205
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,216
and now,

206
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,280
I can't either, can I?

207
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,960
Do you think I don't want to redecorate?

208
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,584
But can I?

209
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,880
Every room here has its own master,

210
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,840
and each piece of furniture has its own story.

211
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,400
This is all that Wu has left.

212
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,559
If I change it,

213
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,880
he will not want to come back home even more.

214
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,159
Why should you be so humble?

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,960
Because I truly love him.

216
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,559
You play by yourself. I'm going to rest.

217
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,020
You're pretty busy.

218
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,440
You were even late
for our trampolining appointment.

219
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,919
Why don't you go down and play it?

220
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:09,800
I've never played.

221
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,440
What does it matter if you've played or not?

222
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,576
Just do it.

223
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,919
I have noticed
you've been looking gloomy these days,

224
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,719
so I invited you here to relieve.

225
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,719
Have I?

226
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,880
Haven't you?

227
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,720
Let's go.

228
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,122
<i>♫ You said that between us ♫</i>

229
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:47,472
<i>♫ You will protect me ♫</i>

230
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:51,132
<i>♫ No matter how dangerous it gets ♫</i>

231
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:53,926
<i>♫ You will never leave ♫</i>

232
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:58,176
<i>♫ I believe in every promise ♫</i>

233
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:02,784
<i>♫ You made to me ♫</i>

234
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:07,392
<i>♫ You won't leave me behind ♫</i>

235
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,456
<i>Su Yu,</i>

236
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,680
<i>why do you always hold onto this issue?</i>

237
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,080
<i>I want to find the truth.</i>

238
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,000
<i>What truth?</i>

239
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,479
<i>The truth about Wu Bi's mother's death.</i>

240
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,320
<i>You want to prove that I am innocent, right?</i>

241
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,192
<i>You're overthinking.</i>

242
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,200
<i>I just don't want</i>

243
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,919
<i>Wu Bi to worry about this every day.</i>

244
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,440
<i>I know you care about me,</i>

245
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
<i>right?</i>

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,048
<i>♫ It's not because I am cold ♫</i>

247
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,824
<i>♫ Nor intend to hide from you ♫</i>

248
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:01,600
<i>♫ It's just because I am not expressive ♫</i>

249
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,448
<i>♫ So, I have to keep silent ♫</i>

250
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:08,576
<i>♫ I understand that you are not only ♫</i>

251
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:13,156
<i>♫ The most important person in my life ♫</i>

252
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:18,159
<i>♫ But also my family ♫</i>

253
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,336
<i>♫ Thank you for exploring with me ♫</i>

254
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:26,432
<i>♫ Tasting everything in this world ♫</i>

255
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:29,670
<i>♫ Good or bad, it doesn't matter ♫</i>

256
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,704
<i>♫ As long as we're by each other's side ♫</i>

257
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:39,479
I met Wu at a party.

258
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,479
At that time,
I was traveling all over the country.

259
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,020
Then I went to a karaoke bar
in Hainan for a residency.

260
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,680
Wu went on a business trip to Hainan,

261
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,839
and he came to the karaoke bar.

262
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,160
That day, after I finished singing a song,

263
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,040
he asked for my contact information.

264
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,359
He fell for you at first sight?

265
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,420
That's what I thought at the time,

266
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,260
wondering if he had feelings for me.

267
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,000
But it turned out I was overthinking.

268
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,239
He asked for my phone number

269
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,320
because the song I sang that day

270
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,359
was his ex-wife's favorite song.

271
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,719
So he wanted to invite me

272
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:21,640
to sing at his ex-wife's birthday party.

273
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,040
So that's how it was.

274
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,664
What do you mean?

275
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:32,544
Nothing.

276
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,880
<i>I thought she intentionally
seduced someone else's husband</i>

277
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,119
<i>by learning the same song.</i>

278
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,199
Later, his ex-wife wanted to give me a gift

279
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,232
as a token of appreciation.

280
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,400
She even took me to her room.

281
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,840
The room was full of sculptures,

282
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,400
all works of art.

283
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,959
I thought your birthday was around the corner,

284
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,000
so I secretly asked your dad for your photo.

285
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,136
That's it.

286
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,400
The two of you
didn't contact each other privately?

287
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,840
We did,

288
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,520
but it was all normal interactions.

289
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,880
However, I admit

290
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,592
I did have ulterior motives toward Wu at first.

291
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,400
But in that situation,

292
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,040
I was alone and helpless,

293
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,239
and suddenly such a man
appeared in front of me.

294
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,239
It was hard to resist his charm.

295
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,680
He was handsome, successful in his career,

296
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,760
and very affable.

297
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,620
Which single woman

298
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,160
wouldn't have thoughts about him?

299
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,199
But when I saw
that his ex-wife was so outstanding,

300
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,040
and upright,

301
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,400
I completely gave up.

302
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,199
I knew

303
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,560
I had no chance to intervene.

304
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,719
If there was nothing between you two,

305
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,520
how did the rumors in the company

306
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,780
start circulating?

307
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,160
What rumors?

308
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,199
I heard from Wu Bi

309
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
that before his mom passed away,

310
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,439
the rumors about his dad and you in the company

311
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,520
were circulating.

312
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,000
I had just returned to Beijing at that time,

313
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,820
and I was jobless,

314
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,319
so I asked Wu

315
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,199
to help me find a job as a receptionist.

316
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,359
It was in his company.

317
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,319
His ex-wife knew about it.

318
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,760
Later, she even stood up for me.

319
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,880
The senior employees all knew about this.

320
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,456
Moreover,

321
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,079
think about it, if there was something
between Wu and me,

322
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,640
his ex-wife
wouldn't have given me a gift, right?

323
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,224
Since there was nothing,

324
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
why did they divorce in the first place?

325
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,064
Divorce?

326
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,479
How could that be?

327
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,520
Absolutely impossible.

328
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,640
To be honest,

329
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,560
if there were any emotional grudges

330
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,239
between Wu and his ex-wife,

331
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,800
I would feel a bit better.

332
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,959
Wu's love for his ex-wife

333
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,199
was unshakable.

334
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,359
Do you know how jealous I was of his ex-wife?

335
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,040
Even now, I feel

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,880
the person Wu loves is still her,

337
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,496
not me.

338
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,560
Did Wu Bi mishear?

339
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,560
But there was a big incident
in the company at that time.

340
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,400
Everyone was in a state of self-preservation.

341
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,319
Even I, a receptionist,

342
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,319
could feel the tension.

343
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,319
It's possible that the company's affair

344
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,680
was all over his ex-wife's head,

345
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,079
which led to the traffic accident.

346
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,800
What happened? Can we investigate it?

347
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,379
This is internal confidential information.

348
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:47,000
We can't find it out.

349
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,199
If I ask Wu…

350
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,312
Mom.

351
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
What did you call me?

352
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,680
Son, tell me.

353
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,280
I would do anything for you.

354
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:15,000
Alright, students,

355
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,880
in this lesson, let's talk about

356
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,400
the relationship
between resistance and voltage.

357
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,719
As shown in the figure,

358
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:26,119
R is the resistance box,

359
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,640
and V is the ideal voltmeter.

360
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,400
<i>You said there was nothing between you,</i>

361
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,339
<i>so how did you end up together?</i>

362
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,820
<i>During the time when Wu's ex-wife passed away,</i>

363
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,079
<i>he was very vulnerable,</i>

364
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,680
<i>surrounded by government officials,
businessmen, and relatives.</i>

365
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,199
<i>There were a ton of thorny issues
waiting for him at the company.</i>

366
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,439
<i>He didn't even have an outlet.</i>

367
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,760
<i>Maybe it's because I'm too ordinary,</i>

368
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:51,560
<i>he could</i>

369
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,640
<i>open up to me without any guard.</i>

370
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,980
<i>During that period of time, we talked more</i>

371
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,800
<i>than we have in the half year
since we got married.</i>

372
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,920
<i>Over the past six years,</i>

373
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,400
<i>I often sent him messages,</i>

374
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,760
<i>comforting and encouraging him.</i>

375
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,032
<i>Perhaps,</i>

376
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,680
<i>it was my sincerity that moved him.</i>

377
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,560
The electromotive force "E" of the power supply
and internal resistance "r".

378
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:19,439
Who wants to answer this question?

379
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,560
How come I've never seen you raise your hand?

380
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,199
Because even if I raise it, he won't call me.

381
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,359
So this is why you zone out without restraint?

382
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,319
Wang Chao, come up and explain it to everyone.

383
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:44,239
<i>In order to have more conversations with Wu,</i>

384
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:48,060
<i>I have been reading books related to economics,</i>

385
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,359
<i>even specifically enrolled in a course.</i>

386
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,199
<i>I have been in contact
with several key employees in his company.</i>

387
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,479
<i>Maybe I could get some information from them.</i>

388
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,600
The distance between the point "O"
and the position where the particles

389
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,000
hit the fluorescent screen.

390
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,040
Who would like to

391
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,319
explain this problem?

392
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,160
<i>I've found the incident files from that year.</i>

393
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,079
<i>Let's meet at noon.</i>

394
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,488
Su Yu,

395
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,479
explain it to everyone.

396
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,500
Assuming the velocity of
the particle shot out from AB is v,

397
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,560
then we have qU equals mv squared.

398
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,839
Assuming that when the particle
leaves the electric field,

399
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,060
the angle of deflection of a particle is φ,

400
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,119
and the deflection distance is y.

401
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,560
<i>How come I don't have such a brain?</i>

402
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,000
<i>Never mind. I already have this handsome face.</i>

403
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,040
<i>If I had such a brain too,</i>

404
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,079
<i>the entire Northeast China would be mine.</i>

405
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,640
Don't wait for me for lunch.

406
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
I have something to do.

407
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,239
I really can't bear it.

408
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,419
This matter was figured out so soon.

409
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,448
Why?

410
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,680
Once it's figured out, won't you be cleared?

411
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,520
Whether I'm cleared or not doesn't matter.

412
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:24,160
The important thing is

413
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,640
I can talk a bit more with you.

414
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,280
All these years, the conversations between us…

415
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,279
Alright, alright, stop being sentimental.

416
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,479
Let's get to the point.

417
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,512
Look,

418
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,880
this matter is actually quite simple.

419
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,719
Wu's medical equipment company back then

420
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,940
had a strong momentum of development,

421
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,239
and was about to go public.

422
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,160
But at the critical moment,
a big problem arose.

423
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,440
One of the suppliers mixed
a batch of problematic instruments

424
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,000
into Wu's company.

425
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,479
Later, this batch of instruments was used,

426
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,839
and people died on the operating table.

427
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:08,160
<i>[Supplier Entry Form]</i>
Xincheng Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.

428
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Yes, it's the supplier.

429
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,599
So how was this resolved later?

430
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,719
Later, it was determined
that the person responsible was his ex-wife.

431
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,400
At that time, she was
the deputy general manager of the company,

432
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,920
in charge of every aspect of the company.

433
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,800
The medical equipment
procurement process was rigorous,

434
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,079
and it had to be personally approved by her.

435
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,180
His ex-wife later admitted

436
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,960
that she took this big order

437
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,380
to obtain greater benefits.

438
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,199
She thought with such a low failure rate,

439
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,359
nothing would go wrong.

440
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,504
Who could have predicted…

441
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,479
I've heard Wu Bi talk a lot about his mother.

442
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,180
I felt that given her character
and family background,

443
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,599
she wasn't the type to seek quick success.

444
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,680
Perhaps she was trying to help Wu's company

445
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
get listed sooner.

446
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,279
She was ultimately deemed
responsible for the incident.

447
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,200
After she had an accident,

448
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,119
this matter finally subsided.

449
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,680
That's too much of a coincidence, isn't it?

450
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,648
Yeah.

451
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:02,439
So Wu has been brooding over it
for so many years.

452
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,279
I have to go to class now. I'll take my leave.

453
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,359
There you go.

454
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,580
Can I take these materials with me?

455
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,720
Yes.

456
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,752
Okay.

457
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,040
<i>In fact, you could go find someone about this.</i>

458
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,140
<i>Who?</i>

459
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,160
<i>Mo Renhe.</i>

460
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:37,880
<i>He is Wu Bi's second uncle,</i>

461
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,560
<i>and was in charge of
the procurement department back then.</i>

462
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:42,080
<i>But ever since that incident,</i>

463
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,719
<i>Mr. Mo left the company</i>

464
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,319
<i>and cut off contact with Mr. Wu.</i>

465
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,800
<i>Do you have his address or contact information?</i>

466
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,319
<i>Well, I do,</i>

467
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,659
<i>but I wouldn't recommend you to go find him.</i>

468
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,160
<i>He has a strange temper.</i>

469
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,180
<i>Because of his sister's death,</i>

470
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,140
<i>he completely severed ties with Wu.</i>

471
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,599
<i>And you are his…</i>

472
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,599
What are you doing, Duo?

473
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,744
Doing homework.

474
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,800
Do you want me to teach you?

475
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Be quiet.

476
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,620
I need to take this book back.

477
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,880
You can't read it anymore.

478
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,680
Take it. I finished reading it long ago.

479
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,760
<i>Hongsheng Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.</i>

480
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,599
What are you doing here?

481
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,079
Well…

482
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,520
You should go practice dancing right away.

483
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,479
The Children's Day is the day after tomorrow.

484
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,959
Let's go, hurry up.

485
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,216
Okay.

486
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,816
Go.

487
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,820
<i>Six years ago, when the incident occurred,</i>

488
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,479
<i>Zhenghao Company was thriving,</i>

489
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,260
<i>and the only competitor, Hongsheng Company,</i>

490
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,560
<i>was also being squeezed,</i>

491
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,119
<i>and its market share shrank drastically.</i>

492
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,560
<i>But ever since that incident,</i>

493
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,479
<i>Hongsheng Company has risen again.</i>

494
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,079
<i>Also, they had the same supplier.</i>

495
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,239
<i>I wonder if there's something behind it.</i>

496
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,960
I have a novel.

497
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,040
Do you want to read it?

498
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,520
I don't have time. I don't want to read.

499
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,279
What's gotten into you,

500
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,959
even refusing to read a novel?
