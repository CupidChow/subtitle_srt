18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,880
Um,

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,160
I need to go to the restroom.

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,320
Sorry, sorry.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,479
See you around, then.

22
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm exhausted. Don't make me do this again.

23
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,304
You

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,820
What? Isn't it all over?

25
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,120
Are you stupid?

26
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,800
You're in full drag,

27
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,220
and if you shave your head,

28
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,639
everyone would be staring at you.

29
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,480
Right, let's go back quickly

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,559
and return the rented clothes.

31
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,656
Let's go.

32
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,199
I'll get in line. You stay with Duo.

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
Good brother.

34
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,839
I'm telling you.

35
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,320
If it wasn't for you this time,

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,919
I really don't know what to do.

37
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,919
Thank you so much.

38
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,312
Mao Chong?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,136
It's really you.

40
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,279
Yes, it's really me.

41
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,360
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,960
Oh my god.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,320
<i>Why is Su Yu here?</i>

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,919
I had some free time,

45
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,320
so I'm hanging out with Wu Bi and Duo.

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,520
Wu Bi is here too?

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,080
Yes, he's queuing in the dessert shop.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,880
<i>Wu Bi and Duo are here too.</i>

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,479
<i>They're pushing me into a dead end.</i>

50
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,232
Who's this?

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,839
She's a senior from my previous school.

52
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,880
Just a senior?

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,399
I saw you two chatting and laughing just now.

54
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,408
You seemed pretty close.

55
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,279
How about an introduction?

56
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,880
You two practically grew up together,

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,199
and you want me to introduce you?

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
You two have fun, and I'll go in first.

59
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:13,792
Aren't you going to help her?

60
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:15,720
Ningning, are you okay?

61
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,720
If you dare to tell Su Yu, I'm dead.

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,839
Don't worry, Su Yu won't tell.

63
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,359
Can I have some time with her alone?

64
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,140
No, no, no.

65
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,959
Go ahead. I'll go to pay the bill.

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,820
Senior, I have a buddy called Han Bokuang.

67
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,839
I think you look a lot like him.

68
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,544
Do you know him?

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, I don't.

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,799
Senior, don't get me wrong.

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,519
They were crooked,

72
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,839
so I adjusted them for you.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,160
Where's Su Yu? Isn't he with you?

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,224
Nope.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,180
Why are you dressed like this?

76
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,460
Life is too vacant?

77
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,480
I'm selflessly dedicating myself
to disaster relief for others.

78
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
What do you mean?

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,208
Here, I'll tell you.

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Brother Wu Bi, look.

81
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,880
Who's that girl?

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,080
You two are really something,

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,512
I can't believe you thought of this.

84
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:45,559
Let me tell you,

85
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,419
you absolutely cannot tell anyone about this.

86
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,279
Not Wu Bi, and not even Duo.

87
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,104
Fine.

88
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,160
I couldn't tell that you

89
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,000
are actually a cross-dresser.

90
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,380
Stop it.

91
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,720
Why can't I look?

92
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,959
Because you're a kid.

93
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,839
I'm going to change my clothes.

94
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,459
Let me tell you something, it's hilarious.

95
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,040
You want to tell me that you were
flirting with some girl on the street?

96
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:18,740
How did you know?

97
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,160
Because I saw it.

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,399
I saw it too.

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,239
He's not a girl.

100
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,680
That was Han Bokuang in disguise.

101
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,119
How about it? You couldn't tell, could you?

102
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,860
I really didn't.

103
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,820
Can you try to think of a better excuse?

104
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,519
Exactly. Brother Han Bokuang
doesn't look like that at all.

105
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm not lying.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,072
Su Yu.

107
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,040
You see, I didn't lie to you, did I?

108
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,720
Don't tell me

109
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,799
that he was that girl just now.

110
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,760
I told you to not say anything.

111
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,720
What? What girl?

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,839
What's Wu Bi talking about?

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,720
Where's the girl?

114
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,679
I don't understand.

115
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,640
Did you see a girl?

116
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,399
Enough.

117
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm trying to protect you,

118
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,799
so stop biting the hand that feeds you.

119
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,600
The brother just now was so handsome.

120
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,160
Enough with the puppy love.

121
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
She just gave someone a compliment.

122
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
Why would you be so jealous?

123
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
Isn't that right, Duo?

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,279
You hit me,

125
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,880
so I hit you back.

126
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,500
You're finally back.

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,279
You must be tired from the trip.

128
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,839
I made some soup, and you can drink some
to warm your stomach.

129
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,768
Where's Wu?

130
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,300
He went upstairs.

131
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,640
- Perhaps to change his clothes.
- Okay.

132
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
Madam, let me do it.

133
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
It's okay. I'll take it up to his room.

134
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,599
So he doesn't have to come down again.

135
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,320
Okay.

136
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,119
Madam, why aren't you with Mr. Wu?

137
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,679
Instead, you're drinking alone.

138
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm letting him rest.

139
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,960
Madam, is there anything on your mind?

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,056
No.

141
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
I just feel that in this home,

142
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,239
I'm dispensable.

143
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,200
Madam, that's nonsense.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,112
I ask you.

145
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,280
Ever since I came into this house,

146
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,000
have you seen Wu

147
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,880
go to his ex-wife's room?

148
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,872
I don't think so.

149
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,239
Well, today he did.

150
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
After three months away,

151
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,880
the first thing he does when he comes back
isn't to change clothes,

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,200
but to see his ex-wife.

153
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
It's clear

154
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,080
that when he was abroad,

155
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,520
the person he missed was not me.

156
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,440
Madam, I heard

157
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,479
that Mr. Wu's branch company
had some financial problems.

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,080
Previously, it was all handled
by Wu Bi's mother.

159
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,720
And he never

160
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,280
found a more suitable partner.

161
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,260
Maybe it's because work isn't going well,

162
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,479
so he…

163
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,479
Yeah.

164
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,679
She was talented and capable.

165
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,919
What do I have?

166
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,760
I didn't even get into university.

167
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,760
Besides saying some meaningless nice things,

168
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,600
what else can I do?

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,880
Madam, don't think like that.

170
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,880
You're still up.

171
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,952
I can't sleep.

172
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,259
Between the plane ride and the jet lag,

173
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,320
aren't you tired?

174
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,560
In Wu Bi's mother's room,

175
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,080
there's a statue of a little boy.

176
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,360
Have you seen it?

177
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,000
Wha… what statue?

178
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,159
The one that used to be
in the little box on the desk.

179
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,359
Today I didn't see it.

180
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,600
I've never been to her room.

181
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,640
You know that.

182
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I didn't say you took it.

183
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,159
Maybe Wu Bi did.

184
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,640
Apart from the maid and Wu Bi,

185
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,559
no one goes to that room.

186
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,424
Maybe.

187
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
While I was away,

188
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,520
did you go to see Wu Bi?

189
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:07,808
I…

190
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,679
Didn't I tell the maid to give you the key?

191
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,632
You didn't go.

192
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,320
I did, but…

193
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,640
Say what you want to say.

194
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,479
Wu Bi wasn't living there at all.

195
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,584
Then where is he staying?

196
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,304
I don't know.

197
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,719
I heard that he's living with Su Yu,

198
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,359
but I'm not sure exactly where.

199
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,880
Living with Su Yu?

200
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,599
Are you kidding me?

201
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,560
He doesn't even want to come back
to this house because of you,

202
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,960
and now he's hanging out with your son?

203
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,699
I can't figure it out either.

204
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,719
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

205
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,719
You were abroad,

206
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,320
and you have o many things to deal with.

207
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,119
I just didn't want to bother you.

208
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,679
Eighty. Eighty.

209
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,280
Eighty.

210
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,760
Eighty.

211
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,820
Eighty.

212
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,680
Eighty.

213
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,520
Eighty.

214
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
You know this Li.

215
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,320
He's quite easy to talk to.

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,799
Once I offered him 500 yuan,

217
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,320
he agreed to tear down the courtyard wall.

218
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,900
Look, once the wall is torn down,

219
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,000
the courtyard is so spacious.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,048
Exactly.

221
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:52,960
Eighty. Eighty.

222
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:27,520
Eighty.

223
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,080
Eighty.

224
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,000
Eighty.

225
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,520
This is too slow.

226
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,080
Come on, you two step back, let me do it.

227
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,960
What is this kid up to?

228
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,799
Cool! I'm doing it too.

229
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:52,359
Be careful.

230
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,520
You should come down first.

231
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Uncle, you should come down. Let me do it.

232
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,940
You don't know how to do this.

233
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,080
I want to try.

234
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,320
- Go slow, okay?
- Sure.

235
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,720
Duo, it's too dangerous.

236
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,400
We should go fold that and rest.

237
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,080
Su, keep an eye on him.
Kid's never done this before.

238
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,159
Uncle, just teach me once, and I can do it.

239
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,440
Okay, let me tell you.

240
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,359
These tiles have to be stacked like this.

241
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,400
- Wu.
- You try it, come on.

242
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:16,359
Okay.

243
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,359
Is that Wu Bi up there?

244
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,679
That's right.

245
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,808
Seems like it.

246
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,000
And who's the old man beside him?

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,280
That's my ex-husband.

248
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,599
And what's the deal with that woman?

249
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,200
Seems like his new wife.

250
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,280
And there's a little girl.

251
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,840
That woman must have brought her along.

252
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,679
So why is Wu Bi here?

253
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,472
I…

254
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,599
Why is he here?

255
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:54,816
Su Zhigang.

256
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,280
Wu Bi, come down quickly. Don't fall.

257
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,080
You're really something.

258
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,180
How dare you make my son do this kind of work?

259
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,359
Is it any of your business?

260
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,519
You brat. How dare you talk like that?

261
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,820
Who let you come here?

262
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,079
What's going on?

263
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,599
- It's alright.
- I should ask you that question.

264
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,680
And you're asking me?

265
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,540
You're really something.

266
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,319
Just because he's not your own,
you can just boss him around?

267
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,400
Don't talk to my mom like that.

268
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,000
This little girl.

269
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,919
Please leave.

270
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
You're not welcome here.

271
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,439
Neither are you.

272
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,319
Come out with me.

273
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,880
I have work to do.

274
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,760
If you don't make things clear to me today,

275
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,239
I'll get an excavator
to tear down this house tomorrow.

276
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,119
Talk nicely with your dad.

277
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,079
I'm sorry, Uncle.

278
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,240
It's okay.

279
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,880
So you're living here with Su Yu?

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,760
If you don't want to live at home, fine.

281
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,319
I bought you that apartment at Guomao.

282
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,079
But instead of staying in that nice apartment,

283
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
every now and then,

284
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,760
you come to this dump to suffer.

285
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,299
Isn't this a slap in my face?

286
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,800
How did I slap your face?

287
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,460
What do you think I'm working so hard for?

288
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,560
Why do I make so much money?

289
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,520
Your way of life

290
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,079
is trampling on my labor.

291
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,640
I didn't ask for your labor.

292
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,600
Don't… don't be angry.

293
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,119
At least this means they are getting along.

294
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,319
We still have a chance in the future.

295
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,599
You're his mother.

296
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,959
We're a family.

297
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,140
He glares and growls at you,

298
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,160
but he runs to your ex-husband…

299
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,880
He runs to other people
and does hard labor smiling.

300
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,640
I just don't get it.

301
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,800
What are you playing?

302
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,880
I just like their family.

303
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,560
I like their home, their atmosphere.

304
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,040
Is there a problem?

305
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,359
Is there something wrong with your brain?

306
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,199
How did I raise a son like you?

307
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,120
So you can steal other people's wives,

308
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,040
but I can't be a son to others?

309
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,719
Why should you get all the benefits?

310
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,080
Don't get angry.

311
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,580
- Hit me.
- Don't hit him. Don't.

312
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,800
Get out of my way.

313
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,536
Are you okay?

314
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,800
Are you alright?

315
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,239
I'm fine. I'll apply some medicine
when we get back.

316
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,279
<i>Your way of life is trampling on my labor.</i>

317
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,040
<i>I didn't ask for your labor.</i>

318
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,119
Don't overthink it.

319
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,000
He's just a kid.

320
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,880
He's just trying to make you angry.

321
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,079
To get your attention.

322
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,359
Do you believe what he says
about liking that family?

323
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,640
I know exactly what Su Yu's dad is like.

324
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,680
There's no way he looks up to him.

325
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,839
Alright, don't get angry.

326
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,199
What does he really want?

327
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,839
Usually, you're so arrogant.

328
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,599
But now you're awfully quiet.

329
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,119
My dad made such a scene this afternoon,

330
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,959
and I felt quite sorry for Uncle.

331
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:51,439
It's nothing.

332
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,959
My mom started it, didn't she?

333
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,760
Stop mulling over it.

334
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,880
My dad is a broad-minded person.

335
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,479
Why are you so okay with this?

336
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,359
Normally, you would be
emotional about these things.

337
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,839
Actually, you have quite an influence on me.

338
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,104
What influence?

339
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,136
Values.

340
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,120
What kind of influence can a person like me

341
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,220
have on a straight-A student like you
in terms of values?

342
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,272
What do you think?

343
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,319
Why do you think I became your friend?

344
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,099
It must be because
you have qualities that I don't,

345
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:36,640
and I can learn from you.

346
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,912
What qualities?

347
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
To tell you the truth,

348
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,119
before I met you,

349
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,199
my concept of money was somewhat extreme.

350
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
I always felt that my parents

351
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,339
shouldn't have planted

352
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,719
the idea of poverty in my mind,

353
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,599
making me desperately use self-improvement
to cover up my inner inferiority.

354
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,680
After knowing you,

355
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,640
I gradually realized

356
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,599
that wealth and poverty
are not a gap between us.

357
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,599
It's just an objective fact about our parents.

358
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
What you have, you may not enjoy,

359
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:24,480
and what I lack

360
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,599
does not mean deprivation.

361
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
You're absolutely right.

362
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,320
The ability to make money

363
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,359
is an objective fact about our parents.

364
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,976
Love, however,

365
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,439
is a subjective consciousness.

366
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,008
Although,

367
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,199
I do think your dad loves you.

368
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,479
Today, when you were working on the roof,

369
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,079
I saw the look in your dad's eyes.

370
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
He was distressed.

371
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,079
Have you ever thought

372
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,760
that maybe your mom's incident
was really an accident?

373
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,959
Of course, I'm not making excuses for anyone.

374
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
I just think

375
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
the thorn between the two of you

376
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,199
should be removed.

377
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,079
I'm afraid to touch this matter.

378
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,920
Every single detail

379
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,160
about the scene

380
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,280
of my mom's accident

381
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,640
makes me shudder.

382
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,400
You're not really upset

383
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,079
about what happened today, right?

384
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,359
Or what? I should be like you?

385
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,640
Act as if nothing happened?

386
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,719
That's how Xiao San is.

387
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,599
She speaks rudely,

388
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,760
but she doesn't mean any harm.

389
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,400
I don't think she was wrong.

390
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,359
I think we should reflect on that.

391
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:42,976
Reflect?

392
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,680
How to reflect?

393
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,319
Reflect on why Su Yu is living like this.

394
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,400
I married you

395
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,880
wanting our two families to have a better life.

396
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,479
But looking at it now,

397
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:59,199
Su Yu's life has not improved.

398
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,680
That's because you're asking too much.

399
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
You're doing really well now.

400
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,119
Every day, he wears

401
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,380
clean clothes,

402
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,060
and eats a hot meal.

403
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,239
Compared with the past…

404
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:12,400
Your bar is too low.

405
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,800
We can't just slack off

406
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,680
just because he is understanding.

407
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,440
Su Yu and Duo,

408
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,000
they both grew up in single-parent families.

409
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,740
We already owe them in this aspect.

410
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,800
If we cannot

411
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,740
satisfy them materially,

412
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,359
what value do we have as parents?

413
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:36,800
You're right.

414
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:39,079
I'll go get a part-time job tomorrow.

415
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,000
It's not about getting a part-time job.

416
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,439
We need to change our mindset.

417
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:45,780
What do you mean?

418
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,239
Here's what I think.

419
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,500
Look at us now,

420
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,880
working our asses off
and getting paid so little,

421
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,400
barely enough for basic living expenses.

422
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,539
If you get a part-time job,

423
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:58,959
all you can do is physical work.

424
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,139
And the factory where you work,

425
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:02,199
it's been here for over twenty years, right?

426
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,040
The workload is heavy and gets you dirty.

427
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,380
And there's no insurance.

428
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,800
With your physique,

429
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,680
how long can you work there?

430
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,439
But at my age,

431
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,839
if I go find a job again…

432
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,900
Who told you to find a job?

433
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,040
Let's do it ourselves.

434
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,648
Do it ourselves?

435
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,360
How?

436
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,959
Look at my small shop now,

437
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,720
the foot traffic is small.

438
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,560
And if it gets busy, I can't cope.

439
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,240
If we borrow some money
from relatives and friends,

440
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,380
rent a store,

441
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,599
and we can manage it together.

442
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,680
That way, I don't have to hide
from the city management every day,

443
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,520
and the customer flow will be bigger.

444
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,740
The food will be clean and hygienic,

445
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,199
and we can raise the prices a bit.

446
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,839
Opening a shop?

447
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
That's not a small matter.

448
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,020
Do you know why I took to your dad

449
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,079
like a duck to water?

450
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,640
I have no idea.

451
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,560
You two are from two
completely different worlds.

452
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,280
Because of his approval of you.

453
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,100
No matter what you do,

454
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,440
even if it's something small,

455
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,119
your dad always praises you endlessly.

456
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,880
That's something

457
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,439
I've never had.

458
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,959
Maybe your dad is just not good at expression.

459
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,832
No.

460
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,119
Actually, my physical condition is very good.

461
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,719
I won the youth wrestling championship
when I was young,

462
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,920
and was rated as a national
second-level athlete in middle school.

463
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,880
But these were not important to my dad.

464
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,520
Compared to my body, he values my mind more.

465
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,239
He planned all my future

466
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:53,280
in his business blueprint.

467
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,760
The rest of my highlights,

468
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,439
it's like they don't exist.

469
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,479
So, what is your dream?

470
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,000
I want to be an astronaut.

471
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,719
Does it sound crazy?

472
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:11,712
Not at all.

473
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,920
With your physical condition,

474
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,199
if you work on your academic courses,

475
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,920
you can definitely get in.

476
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,940
Really?

477
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,064
Of course.

478
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,560
Tell me, which star do you like?

479
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,296
Your big brother will give it to you.

480
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,359
You're my 'little brother'.

481
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,199
Not again.

482
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,208
So…

483
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,160
What is your dream?

484
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:42,464
Guess.

485
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,920
Scientist?

486
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,280
You think I'm in kindergarten?

487
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,380
It's naive for others to have that dream,

488
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,740
but it's blasphemy to your brain

489
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,680
if you don't want to be a scientist.

490
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,800
So, what is it really?

491
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,439
I want to be a traveler, an adventurer.

492
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,599
Traveler?

493
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,360
Yes.

494
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,199
I want to see the prairies and the sea.

495
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,680
I want to explore mountains, rivers, and lakes.

496
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,392
So, where

497
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,680
do you want to go the most?

498
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,432
Tibet.

499
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,160
Brother, I can't sleep.

500
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,040
I want to hear a story.

501
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:44,448
Okay.

502
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:46,959
I want to hear it too.

503
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:50,624
Wait for me.

504
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:00,439
What do you want to hear?

505
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,504
Ghost Blows Out the Light.

506
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,740
Ghost Blows Out the Light again?
You love it so much.

507
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,520
Come on, lie down, and let's start.

508
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,020
We had just walked behind the sand dune

509
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,959
when Ye Yixin stepped into a void,

510
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,439
and her whole body sank halfway.

511
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,359
I quickly grabbed her

512
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,199
and blew the whistle for help.

513
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,439
But it doesn't seem to be quicksand.

514
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,640
Quicksand has a strong pull
and swallows things quickly.

515
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,359
If it were really quicksand,

516
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,959
I wouldn't be able to hold her
with my strength.

517
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,620
And after she sank halfway down,

518
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,760
it stopped.

519
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
It seems like the bottom is solid.

520
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:08,386
