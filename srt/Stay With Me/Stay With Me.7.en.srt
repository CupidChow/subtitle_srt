(Episode 7)

18
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,000
Han Bokuang,

19
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,739
can you help me give this

20
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,000
to Mao Chong?

21
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,440
What's the matter, you can't do it?

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,088
Okay.

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,880
Thank you.

24
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,839
Mr. Wu, we have arrived.

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Are you sure it's here?

26
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,180
It should be correct.

27
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,800
I've had someone follow him for two days.

28
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,579
I'll go in by myself.

29
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:10,679
You wait outside for a while.

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,220
Excuse me, does Wu Bi live here?

31
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,264
Yes, he lives here.

32
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:20,980
Please take a seat.

33
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,199
I'll be back after washing my face.

34
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,199
Please sit. There's water here.

35
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,440
I'll be right back.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,152
Hello.

37
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,479
You don't even have hot water here?

38
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,539
I'm too lazy to boil it,

39
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,759
so I'll just use cold water instead.

40
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,260
So, are you the landlord here?

41
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,500
Or are you sharing the rent with him?

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,600
Neither.

43
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,519
Then who are you?

44
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm his dad.

45
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,539
Who are you?

46
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm his dad.

47
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,359
I'm telling you, I'm his dad!

48
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,376
If you're his dad, who am I?

49
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,519
Even if the King of Hell comes,
I'm still his dad.

50
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,679
I'm his biological father.

51
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,000
Even if the Heavenly King comes,
I'm still his dad.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,959
What brought you here, Dad?

53
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
You're really something.

54
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,980
Not only did you change houses,

55
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,239
but you also changed your dad along the way.

56
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,799
Is he really your dad?

57
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,559
You have a dad, but you still
let me act as your dad?

58
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:09,239
Alright, you can go back now.
There is no need to come tonight.

59
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,359
I'll take my leave then.

60
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,344
So awkward.

61
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,760
Your dad is quite handsome.

62
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,608
Su Yu.

63
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,119
Su Yu, here.

64
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,739
These are dumplings with
zucchini and egg filling.

65
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,300
Send these to Wu Bi and his father.

66
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,799
I noticed he liked this filling

67
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,360
the last time he was at our house.

68
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,079
So I asked Ms. Zhou to make some extra.

69
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,780
I love them too.

70
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,920
Did you save some for me?

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,720
Of course, I've already saved some for you.

72
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,540
Look at you. Geez.

73
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,584
Okay.

74
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:57,320
- Hurry up.
- Alright, alright.

75
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,744
Wu Bi.

76
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,020
You moved to this place

77
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,879
just to get even with me.

78
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,160
What's wrong with this place?

79
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,700
Isn't this how hundreds of
people live around here?

80
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,040
I think they're doing quite well.

81
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
I bought the house you rented

82
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,159
in International Trade for you.

83
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,759
If you really don't want to go home,
just stay there.

84
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,200
I'll arrange a maid for you.

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
No need.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
What more do you want?

87
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:41,000
Haven't you had enough trouble
after all these years?

88
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm not causing trouble.

89
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm not trying to get even with you either.

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,140
I just like living here.

91
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,460
I wouldn't move.

92
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,200
I won't allow you to live here.

93
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,839
On what grounds do you not allow me?

94
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,872
On what grounds?

95
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,560
Because I'm your dad,

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,119
I have a parenting obligation to you.

97
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,720
I am responsible for all your food,
clothing, shelter, and transportation.

98
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,568
Su Yu!

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,519
Su Yu, Su Yu, Su Yu!

100
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,320
Su Yu, Su Yu!

101
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,119
Su Yu, listen to me.

102
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,600
I didn't mean to deceive you.

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
It's quite a coincidence.

104
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,512
Your dad, he--

105
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,679
He didn't want me to tell you.

106
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,060
That night, you told me,

107
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,480
you didn't want to be with someone
from a too well-off family.

108
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,559
Your dad married my mom,

109
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,100
and you're still pretending to be poor
and trying to get close with me.

110
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,480
How else do you want to humiliate me?

111
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,239
What do you mean my dad married your mom?

112
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,799
Is it fun for you to mess with me?

113
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm asking you,

114
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,279
what do you mean my dad married your mom?

115
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,799
Your dad was the person

116
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,399
who came to the school to see me that day.

117
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,820
Today, why did the teacher want to see you?

118
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,992
It's about my mom.

119
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,592
Your mom?

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,384
Your mom came to see you?

121
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:30,912
Not her,

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,239
it's her current husband.

123
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,159
Why did he come to see you?

124
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,080
He came as my mom's go-between,

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,160
asking me to transfer to a better school.

126
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,272
I heard that

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
your son is also in
his second year of high school.

128
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,184
Yeah.

129
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,200
Which school is he in?

130
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,640
What's the name of the high school?

131
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,900
I can't remember it right now.

132
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,239
Anyway, it's just an ordinary
high school in their area.

133
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,039
The teaching environment is merely adequate.

134
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,440
But my son can always rank first
in the whole school.

135
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,640
So the person who came to the school that day

136
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,919
to represent you at the parent-teacher meeting

137
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,919
was my mom, correct?

138
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,320
Tell me, how did you two meet?

139
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,840
Was he introduced to you by Aunt Xiao?

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,152
We're in the same class.

141
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,840
You and him are in the same class?

142
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,159
When did you switch schools?

143
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,159
You dare to switch schools behind my back.

144
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,359
What else are you not daring to do?

145
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,380
You. Your own son switched schools
for three months

146
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,400
and you had no idea.

147
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,039
You went to the school to talk to the other son

148
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,020
and had no idea your own son was there.

149
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,080
What else are you not daring to do?

150
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,752
You--

151
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,679
You actually colluded with my dad
to deceive me.

152
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,239
No way, my dad being so nice
to a love rival's son,

153
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
it doesn't make sense.

154
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,520
There must be some misunderstanding here.

155
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,359
Son, did you deliver the dumplings?

156
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,744
What's wrong?

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,000
Dad,

158
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,840
tell me the truth.

159
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,039
How did you get to know Wu Bi?

160
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,119
Didn't I tell you? I and his dad…

161
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,400
That's not his dad.

162
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,440
So you were aware of his dad's phony identity

163
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,760
from the start, correct?

164
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,840
Son, listen to my explanation.

165
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,799
I just want to know how you got to know him.

166
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,640
I-I…

167
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:54,159
I worked a part-time job

168
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,960
on the weekend,

169
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,320
just happened to help him move

170
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,968
when he was moving.

171
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:01,099
Then--

172
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:02,479
Why did you take a part-time job?

173
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,919
I saw other kids had new school uniforms.

174
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:13,039
A-And you didn't.

175
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
What's wrong with this school uniform?

176
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,304
It's not worn out,

177
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,960
why can't I wear it?

178
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,040
Even so,

179
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
why did you help him hide his identity?

180
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,380
Do you know who he is?

181
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,599
No.

182
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,400
He promised to help me conceal the fact
that I was taking a part-time job first,

183
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,340
and then I agreed to assist him
in hiding his identity.

184
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,359
Because he's afraid that
if you know his family is well-off,

185
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,720
you won't hang out with him anymore.

186
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,760
Do you know who he is?

187
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,039
H-H-H-He. Who is he?

188
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,599
Nothing, I am going to bed.

189
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,340
Wu Bi.

190
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,416
Thanks.

191
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,256
Are you okay?

192
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm fine.

193
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,312
Be careful.

194
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,359
Mr. Wu, when are we going back?

195
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,384
We're not going back.

196
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,880
But you have a very important client
to meet tomorrow,

197
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,320
how can you rest well without going back?

198
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,408
Cancel it.

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,719
I stand on the city tower,
watching the mountain view,

200
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:11,840
hearing the chaos outside the city.

201
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:44,704
Open the door!

202
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:48,880
What for?

203
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,100
You said it yourself, what for?

204
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,320
Get back to your own house,
don't come back here!

205
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,840
What gives you the right to tell me to leave?

206
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,960
You think I want to be his son?

207
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,320
Did I have a choice?

208
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,719
In their marriage,

209
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,599
am I not the victim?

210
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,320
It was your mom

211
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
who shattered my parents' marriage.

212
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,119
It was your mom who killed my mom.

213
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,300
Yes, it's my mom's fault.

214
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,559
My mom is the mistress.

215
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,679
I am the son of the mistress,

216
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,039
so why are you still arguing here?

217
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,119
Open the door! Open the door!

218
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,840
There are still some of your things at home.

219
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,440
I'll pack them up for you.

220
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:47,440
I don't want them anymore!

221
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,880
They're not worth anything.

222
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,439
I'll go back with you to
the International Trade apartment.

223
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,300
Wu Bi hasn't been to school
for three days in a row.

224
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,380
What is happening?

225
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,400
How would I know?

226
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,000
What? Why don't you ask him
since you two are so close?

227
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,279
Who says we are close?

228
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,719
Wh-Why did it change?

229
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,420
Wu Bi didn't show up, so you helped him
keep his exercise book first.

230
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,359
Look, I told you so.

231
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,104
You leave first.

232
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,040
Son, school's over?

233
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,800
What are you doing here?

234
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,000
Your son didn't go to school today.

235
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,079
What do you mean? You're not my son?

236
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,599
I never thought you'd be in this school too,

237
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,639
and in the same class as Wu's son.

238
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,719
Mom is simply overjoyed.

239
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,760
Overjoyed?

240
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,000
What's there to be overjoyed about?

241
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,119
I was thinking of introducing you two,

242
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,400
but I was afraid you wouldn't be happy.

243
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,439
Now it's easier.

244
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,359
It's also easier for
parent-teacher meetings, right?

245
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
I went too late that day.

246
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,479
If I had gone earlier and met your dad,

247
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,640
I would have known
you were in that class, right?

248
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,899
Dad, when did you buy this suit?

249
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:54,959
I've never seen you wear it.

250
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,079
You must not have seen it.

251
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,280
I bought it when I married your mom.

252
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm glad you didn't run into Dad.

253
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,960
I think when I got off the car,

254
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,319
I saw your dad riding a bicycle
as he passed by.

255
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,359
So that was really your dad?

256
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,200
I thought I had traveled through time.

257
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
Why is he still wearing a suit
he bought over a decade ago?

258
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,600
He doesn't even dress up a bit
for his son's parent-teacher meeting,

259
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,959
it's so embarrassing.

260
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,319
You shut up.

261
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,239
Sorry, I apologize.

262
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,640
Don't apologize.

263
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,800
Can I get this removed?

264
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,820
Why did you take a part-time job?

265
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,160
I saw other kids have new school uniforms,

266
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,439
A-And you didn't.

267
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,719
Don't push me too far.

268
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,460
Don't be angry, don't be angry.

269
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,520
I'll buy you a brand-new one.

270
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:58,912
♫ I never considered
whether what I was doing was right or wrong ♫

271
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:01,184
♫ Let them say ♫

272
00:23:01,952 --> 00:23:05,664
♫ Maybe it's best ♫

273
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,890
♫ To just keep silent at this moment ♫

274
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:12,864
♫ Let the fire burn in our hearts ♫

275
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,120
♫ We pray ♫

276
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,816
♫ We look far away ♫

277
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:21,991
♫ Even falls can't stop us
from running forward ♫

278
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,904
♫ Despite the torment ♫

279
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,536
♫ And the times we could only roar in anger ♫

280
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:28,288
♫ We have never retreated ♫

281
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,624
♫ Maybe it's not a coincidence ♫

282
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:35,328
♫ Dark clouds obscure every shining star ♫

283
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:37,395
♫ But the dawn will eventually come ♫

284
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:40,704
♫ As always ♫

285
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:44,992
♫ Promise me to keep searching ♫

286
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,760
Block him, block him!

287
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,800
Stuff it down here. Pass, come on.

288
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,239
Nice!

289
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,239
Come on, come on. Again, again.

290
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,560
Go down, go down.

291
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,080
It's not that great.

292
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,312
I can do it.

293
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,448
Wu Bi?

294
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,119
Where have you been these two days?

295
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,119
Why didn't you come to school?

296
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
What's wrong with you?

297
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,079
Can I borrow your exercise book for a while?

298
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,232
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

299
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,439
Your exercise book and papers. Take them away.

300
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,640
This is your stuff.

301
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,239
You know it's my stuff and you still touch it.

302
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Do you think I want to touch it?

303
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,520
They forced it on me.

304
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,180
Then you can just throw it away.

305
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,760
Why bring it back to disgust me?

306
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,119
What are you looking at?
What are you all looking at?

307
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,496
Su.

308
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,984
Go in.

309
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:42,239
Wh-Why didn't you say you were going to come?

310
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,392
Sit over there.

311
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,216
Where's Su Yu?

312
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,839
He's doing his homework in the room.

313
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Why are you sighing
when your child is doing homework?

314
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,280
Normally, he would have finished much sooner.

315
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,660
At this time, if he hasn't finished yet,

316
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,800
there's only one possibility.

317
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,400
He's in a bad mood.

318
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,479
He vents his anger by doing exercises.

319
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,719
Among all the fathers in the world,

320
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,839
the only one who could worry about this is you.

321
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,119
I'll go see him.

322
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,288
You go.

323
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:15,712
Duo.

324
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,119
Su Yu, I'm coming in.

325
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:25,760
Auntie.

326
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,008
Doing exercises?

327
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,760
It's been getting cold lately,

328
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,640
and I am worried about you two riding
your bikes to school and getting cold,

329
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,040
so I knitted you a scarf.

330
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,928
Tie it on and have a look.

331
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,520
It looks good.

332
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,519
Thank you, auntie.

333
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,040
This one is for Wu Bi.

334
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,152
Give it to him later.

335
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,400
This is not something he lacks.

336
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,360
How come he doesn't lack this?

337
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,400
Aren't you two going to school together?

338
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:01,880
Auntie, I still have a few questions
left to finish.

339
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,920
Okay, you can go on venting.

340
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,479
No, go on working on the questions.

341
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,680
Finish it quickly and go to bed.

342
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,760
What's going on

343
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,528
with Su Yu and Wu Bi?

344
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,408
Let me tell you.

345
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,760
This is also my fault.

346
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,880
Here's what happened.

347
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,119
It's getting late. You should go back and rest.

348
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Then you two be careful on your way back.

349
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,880
It's just a few steps away.

350
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
Let's go, Duo.

351
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,960
Well.

352
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,360
You knitted a scarf for Su Yu.

353
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,479
Thank you.

354
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,399
Look at what you're saying.

355
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:19,259
Don't you always help me too?

356
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,160
I didn't help you that much.

357
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:25,980
Uh.

358
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,160
When will you make

359
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,719
that fried stuffed sausage again?

360
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,479
Duo, don't sit there, come to bed now.

361
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,920
Mom, why did you knit scarves for them

362
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,020
and not for me?

363
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,479
I did knit for you.

364
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,080
Didn't I knit one for you last year?

365
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
But I still want one.

366
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,400
This scarf is too long, you can't wear it.

367
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,839
And a little girl

368
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,439
shouldn't wear blue, it doesn't look good.

369
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,959
I like blue, I like blue.

370
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:59,239
Alright, alright. Come to bed first, okay?

371
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,680
We can talk about it
after you wake up tomorrow.

372
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:03,104
Come on.

373
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,119
Come on, cover up.

374
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,240
Students,

375
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,560
next class, we'll have a big cleanup.

376
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,440
Leaders from the bureau
will come to inspect tomorrow.

377
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,419
The inspection result will
greatly affect our year-end

378
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:40,139
evaluation for outstanding class collective.

379
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:41,359
Everyone must take it seriously.

380
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,424
Su Yu,

381
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,839
you and the hygiene commissioner should

382
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,860
assign tasks well.

383
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,880
Clean every corner.

384
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,320
Come on, get this side too.
Wipe it carefully, come on.

385
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,680
Why don't you do it instead of just talking?

386
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,488
Be careful.

387
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,319
The floor is slippery, I just wiped it.

388
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:08,820
Hand me a rag.

389
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,119
Watch out, the table is not very stable.

390
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,300
Bei Yan, go get a bucket of water.

391
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,408
Okay, okay.

392
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,024
Alright.

393
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,912
Thank you.

394
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:36,079
Good, come on, come on.

395
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Put it down, put it down.

396
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,400
Watch out.

397
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,952
Alright.

398
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,088
Watch your feet.

399
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,500
Su Yu, can you go in and persuade Wu Bi?

400
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,920
He's refusing to get up from his seat,
and I can't sweep the floor.

401
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,079
Over there, on the left. Yes.

402
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,319
Change to a new rag, this one is dirty.

403
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,120
- Alright, I'll go wash it.
- Right, wipe it here.

404
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,384
Get up.

405
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,280
I told you to get up.

406
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:14,860
I won't get up.

407
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,040
So what?

408
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,520
Even if there's a personal issue,

409
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,959
shouldn't you consider
the class collective's honor?

410
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,340
The class collective's honor
is your business as class president.

411
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,959
What does it have to do with me?

412
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,000
Aren't you a member of this class?

413
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,840
If you don't want to stay here,

414
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,160
go back to your previous school.

415
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,079
What did you say?

416
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,080
I said, go back to your previous school.

417
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,220
I won't go anyway.

418
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,319
There's no need to come here to
experience life just to avoid me.

419
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,239
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

420
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,840
Stop fighting.

421
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,232
Alright, stop fighting.

422
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:49,200
That's enough, Su Yu.

423
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,400
Su Yu, that's enough.

424
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:29,506

425
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,266

♫ But it's you who bring the worries ♫
