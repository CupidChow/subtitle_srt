(Episode 9)

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,480
Still sleeping?

19
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:42,240
Wake up.

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,776
Get up now.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,319
Wake up.

22
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,120
Why are you waking me up

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,199
so early, Dad?

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,472
Listen.

25
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,279
Don't you think it is fate?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,300
What fate?

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,199
Our family and Wu Bi.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,559
Isn't it fate?

29
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,879
I helped someone move

30
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,680
and it turned out it was his family.

31
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,960
He had a falling out with his dad
and transferred schools,

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,820
and it turned out
he transferred to your school.

33
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,880
What a coincidence. What odds.

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,399
Even TV dramas
wouldn't dare to play it this way.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,800
Imagine if I were this accurate
in buying lottery tickets,

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,199
that would be great, wouldn't it?

37
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,000
Dad,

38
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,880
have you gone mad from the shock?

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,419
What do you mean mad?

40
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,360
His father marries your ex-wife.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,479
So what?

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,940
Your mom and I have been divorced
for over ten years.

43
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,080
Moreover,

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,520
when your mom and I divorced,

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,899
they didn't even know each other.

46
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,800
What does that have to do with his dad?

47
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,856
T-T-Then--

48
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,080
There's even nothing wrong with Wu Bi.

49
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,619
I don't know what his dad is like,

50
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,160
but I genuinely like Wu Bi.

51
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,960
He's so righteous and kind.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,919
And he doesn't look like
a spoiled rich kid at all.

53
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,100
A while ago,

54
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,020
he was eating and living
at our house every day.

55
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,000
I almost considered him my own son.

56
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,639
Your ex-wife was stolen by someone else

57
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,839
and you were even raising his son.

58
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,160
No one is willing to endure these but you.

59
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,780
Listen to me, just talk it out with him.

60
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,720
I've already cut off the ties.

62
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,279
How am I supposed to take it back?

63
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,340
How could I tell you if you didn't tell me?

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,180
I was afraid you'd be shocked.

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,759
Who knew you'd be so broad-minded?

66
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,440
I didn't expect you to be so narrow-minded.

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,639
I don't care.

68
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,699
Anyway, this week,

69
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,880
you have to bring him back home.

70
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
I get it.

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,039
That's my good boy.

72
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,839
Hop on. I'll take you to school.

73
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,232
Do I know you?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,379
You've already put on the scarf.

75
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,679
Don't put a damper.

76
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,080
Who wants to hitch a ride on your crappy bike?

77
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:03,399
Please get in.

78
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,759
You've been hitching for several months
and now you find it crappy.

79
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,539
Do I need to drive faster?

80
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,119
Go faster my foot. Slow down.

81
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,240
You want to tire him out?

82
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,304
Yes.

83
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,620
No matter how good your car is,

84
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,959
you can't be faster than me.

85
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,500
Didn't you leave?

86
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,679
I told the driver to leave first

87
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,839
and then ran to catch up with you.

88
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,740
Weren't you aloof?

89
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,440
Didn't you feel upset with whoever you saw?

90
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,216
Why are you actively finding me?

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,279
Don't push your luck.

92
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,360
Go in.

93
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,679
What should I say after I go in?

94
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,640
Nonsense, just say what you usually say.

95
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,640
Will uncle…

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,559
Are you going in or not? If not, I'm going in.

97
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,352
I'll go in. I'll go in.

98
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,112
Dad.

99
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:32,800
Dad.

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,279
I fell asleep when I planned to take a nap.

101
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,559
Wu Bi is here.

102
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:42,880
Yes, uncle.

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,159
As today is New Year's Day,

104
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,679
I went to the supermarket for some groceries,

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,840
but I can't cook.

106
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,279
So I wanted to ask Ms. Zhou--

107
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,459
Look at you.

108
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,780
Why are you spending so much?

109
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,080
I told him not to buy them.

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,240
Isn't he always a freeloader?

111
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,200
You guys both are my children.

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,280
What freeloading?

113
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,559
I'll call Ms. Zhou over now.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
What was I saying?

115
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,320
My dad didn't care about the matter at all.

116
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,320
Brother Wu Bi.

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,912
Duo.

118
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,840
Wait, you hugged him before hugging me.

119
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,519
Looks like you like him more.

120
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,760
No, I like you the most.

121
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:36,864
Come on.

122
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,279
Today is New Year's Day.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,040
The first day of 2006.

124
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,839
From today,

125
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
all of you are a year older.

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,519
Come on, cheers.

127
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,279
Come on, cheers, cheers.

128
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,424
Cheers.

129
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:03,519
Enjoy the meal.

130
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,900
Right, I'm eight now.

131
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,000
Right, you've grown up too.

132
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:10,359
Son, you're seventeen in a blink of an eye.

133
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,720
Wu Bi, how old are you?

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm also seventeen.

135
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,519
They are of the same age.

136
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,079
Whose birthday comes first?

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,119
I don't think I've ever asked that.

138
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,679
Wu Bi, when's your birthday?

139
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,240
In June.

140
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,300
Su Yu also has his birthday in June.

141
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,160
I remember Su Yu's birthday is on the 10th.

142
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,960
Mine's on the 1st.

143
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,840
So, it seems Su Yu should call you big brother.

144
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,460
Both of you are Gemini.

145
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,719
Gem what? Mini?

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,560
Dad, Gemini.

147
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,719
A name of a constellation.

148
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,060
You know quite a lot.

149
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,719
Of course, I also know

150
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,000
people of Gemini are the most flirting.

151
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,000
- Flirting?
- Nonsense!

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,039
How can it be?

153
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,620
So, what sign are you?

154
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,119
I'm Sagittarius.

155
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,919
I think you are sausage rolls.

156
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,099
Come on, cheers.

157
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:11,200
Cheers, come.

158
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,760
Come, come, cheers, cheers.

Okay, what game?

163

Everyone writes their wish

and then buries it under the tree.

165

This way, it can help us fulfill our wishes.

How childish.

Make it or not?

185
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,799
Pinky, pinky bow-bell,
no take-backs for a hundred years.

186
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
Sealed.

187
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,560
Hey, bro.

188
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,119
Why are you calling so late?

189
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,840
Isn't today New Year's Day?

190
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,719
Just wanted to wish you a happy New Year.

191
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
Bro, did you forget about the time difference?

192
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,160
I've already celebrated it.

193
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,220
Your brother personally called to wish you well

194
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,280
and you're being choosy.

195
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,720
Every year you are the first
to send me good wishes.

196
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,799
What were you doing this year?

197
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,840
I-I forgot because I was busy.

198
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,000
Busy? I think you were playing around.

199
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,560
By the way, next month my girlfriend and I
will come back to China.

200
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,840
Pick us up at the airport.

201
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
Girlfriend?

202
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,960
You actually have a girlfriend!

203
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,559
I always thought
you weren't interested in girls.

204
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:26,679
What are you talking about?

205
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,960
Bro, how long have you been dating?

206
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:32,672
About half a year.

207
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,119
Why didn't you tell me?

208
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,599
Why bother mentioning it?

209
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:15,960
Who are you?

210
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,099
- How did you get in?
- Who am I?

211
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,280
What are you doing? You! Get out of the way!

212
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,479
Keep your mouths shut.

213
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,960
Otherwise, no one will survive.

214
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,200
You are bad guys. Let go of my mom!

215
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,599
Shut up!

216
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,599
What are you doing?

217
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,800
Her dad and my dad are friends.

218
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,559
That she was able to enter the school abroad

219
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,200
was due to my connections.

220
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,159
So, she's just using you then.
She's so calculating.

221
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,799
It's a mutual benefit.

222
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,719
Bro, do you have a picture? Show me.

223
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,479
Shouted, huh?

224
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:04,760
Uncle, something happened to Mom. Come now.

225
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,336
What happened?

226
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,520
Wait, wait for me, I'm on my way.

227
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,060
Su Yu! Su Yu! Su Yu!

228
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,159
Dad, what happened?

229
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,200
Something happened to Ms. Zhou.

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,520
Come with me quickly.

231
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,624
Now.

232
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:25,940
What happened?

233
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,072
Come with me.

234
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,479
You really have some strength.

235
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,719
Scratched me, huh? Scratch!

236
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,479
What are you doing? Who are you?

237
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,288
Duo.

238
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,559
It's okay, it's okay.

239
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,344
Duo's Mom.

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,799
Duo's Mom, are you alright?

241
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,424
Stay still.

242
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,599
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

243
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,159
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

244
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,479
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

245
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:31,456
Go.

246
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,160
Duo, Mom is okay.

247
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,200
Stay at home with brother.

248
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,479
I will be back soon.

249
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,208
Did you hear me?

250
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,459
I'll make a statement with uncle and Ms. Zhou.

251
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,592
You take care of Duo.

252
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,648
Let's go back.

253
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,704
Scared, aren't you?

254
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
From your childhood,

255
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,359
I've never seen you cry like this.

256
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,520
When can my father come out?

257
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,280
What are you talking about?

258
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,540
The wish I made yesterday

259
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,600
was for my father to come back soon.

260
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,200
But today, seeing the bag guys

261
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,239
taken away by the police,

262
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,679
I suddenly didn't want to wait for him.

263
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,128
Not sleeping yet?

264
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,072
It's almost dawn.

265
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,640
I'm not sleepy. You can go to sleep.

266
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,880
I saw when we left,

267
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,359
Duo was already cheerful.

268
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,599
Children are broad-minded.

269
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,816
She will forget soon.

270
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
You don't have to worry.

271
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm not worried.

272
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,256
I'm scared.

273
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,624
Scared?

274
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,439
Scared those two people
will come and make trouble again.

275
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,060
You don't have to worry about that.

276
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,420
With the crime they committed,

277
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,880
they won't be out for three to five years.

278
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,119
I'm not worried about that.

279
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:11,136
What is it then?

280
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,088
I'm worried

281
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,432
My heartache

282
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,040
will surpass my possessiveness.

283
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
If you want to vent,

284
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,719
don't always keep it in your heart.

285
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,536
You could tell me.

286
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,239
You've known for a long time, haven't you?

287
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,816
About my dad and Ms. Zhou.

288
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,896
I know.

289
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,040
Actually, I'm jealous of Duo.

290
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,640
Ms. Zhou loves her so much.

291
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,199
My dad's love for her is no less than for me.

292
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,079
I also know that
my dad didn't make things clear

293
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,319
because he was considering my feelings.

294
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,959
I've been running away from it too.

295
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But today,

296
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,400
when I saw Duo,

297
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,680
I had one thought in my mind.

298
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,560
I don't want to see her cry like that again.

299
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,119
You're a child too.

300
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,479
You also need love.

301
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,400
Besides, your mom already…

302
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:08,448
Forget it.

303
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,439
I was consoling you,

304
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,359
but I'm not much better than you.

305
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,800
From childhood,

306
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,640
I didn't know what the word 'selfish' meant.

307
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,239
I studied hard every day and lived frugally.

308
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,880
I never asked my dad for anything.

309
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,959
All to make my dad happy.

310
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,080
Even…

311
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,640
Even to say this.

312
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,079
I-I've never really hated my mom.

313
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,359
What I want is simple.

314
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,119
I just want

315
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,800
a love that is not shared.

316
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,319
There will be such a person.

317
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,560
Where's my physics book?

318
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,620
I remember that
after lending it to Mao Chong yesterday,

319
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,880
he returned it to me.

320
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,719
Are you looking for this?

321
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,880
I saw that the edge of your book was curled,

322
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,300
so, I made a cover for you.

323
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,360
Thank you.

324
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,180
So, do you owe me a little bit?

325
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,659
Tell me, whatever you want, I'll satisfy you.

326
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,479
I want Mao Chong's jacket.

327
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,528
Well.

328
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,840
His jacket is a men's style.

329
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,060
Besides,

330
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,760
I don't know where he bought it from.

331
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,240
I just want the one he's wearing.

332
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,560
Can you help me borrow it?

333
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,319
Don't you have a jacket?

334
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,600
Why wear his?

335
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,239
Are you going to help me or not?

336
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,160
Then I'll tear it off.

337
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,760
No, no, no. It was hard to wrap it up.

338
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,000
You… Alright, I'll give it a try.

339
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,024
Okay.

340
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:17,632
Dad,

341
00:23:20,928 --> 00:23:22,016
get married.

342
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,000
Marry Ms. Zhou.

343
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,700
Why do I hear a nasal sound in your speech?

344
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,800
You're probably running a fever.

345
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,979
I'll find some medicine for you.

346
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:43,160
I'm serious.

347
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,839
You're just a child. What do you know?

348
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,880
Is getting married that easy?

349
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,464
Besides,

350
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,479
I can't possibly marry her.

351
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,568
Why not?

352
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,520
Your mom's already married.
If I get married too, what will you do?

353
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,000
Unless you have your own family,

354
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,680
then I'll consider finding a partner.

355
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,079
But what about Ms. Zhou and Duo?

356
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,239
They have no ability to protect themselves.

357
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,079
We were just in time that day.

358
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,079
What if something like that happens again?

359
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,560
All of these matters
are not as important as you.

360
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,839
Then get married for my sake.

361
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
I don't want to eat your food anymore.

362
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't want to stay in this messy house
that no one cleans up.

363
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,599
I don't even want to
hear people gossip about you.

364
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
Moreover,

365
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,160
if you're married, I can do whatever I want.

366
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,079
What do you think of my coat?

367
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,760
How come Mao Chong's coat is on her?

368
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,319
It must be his gift to her, right?

369
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,040
They can't really be together, can they?

370
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,760
This color suits me well.

371
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,199
Come to my house for a wedding feast tonight.

372
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:25,159
Whose wedding feast?

373
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:26,240
My dad's.

374
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,980
What are they playing?

375
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,560
His mom just…

376
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
And now his dad…

377
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,599
Never mind. My matter
is trivial compared to this.

378
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,640
The clothes may belong to someone else,

379
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
but at least the parents are my own.

380
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,079
They're waiting for us, hurry up.

381
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,080
Do you want to see Duo?

382
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,160
Yes.

383
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,199
Look, Duo is there. Greet her.

384
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,079
Thank you all.

385
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,839
Thank you all, thank you all.

386
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:01,000
Come on, come on, sit down.

387
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,760
Enjoy your meal, enjoy your drinks.

388
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,439
Come on.

389
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,040
Eat more, eat more.

390
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,780
Thank you, everyone. Thank you all.

391
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,920
Enjoy your meal, enjoy your drinks.

392
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,440
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

393
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,800
Everyone, enjoy your meal, enjoy your drinks.

394
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,199
Uncle, I want a drink too.

395
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,280
Duo, you can't call him uncle anymore.

396
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,439
You should call him Dad.

397
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,592
Yes, yes, yes.

398
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,319
Duo.

399
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Look at them.

400
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,740
Daughter, call me dad.

401
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,792
Dad.

402
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,079
Too low. We didn't hear it. Louder.

403
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,688
We didn't hear it.

404
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,880
Call him again, louder.

405
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,359
Daughter.

406
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,424
Dad.

407
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,319
Bravo.

408
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,599
Everyone, enjoy your meal, enjoy your drinks.

409
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,368
Thank you, everyone, thank you all.

410
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,439
Everyone, eat more.

411
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,599
You guys, eat more.

412
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,000
Please help yourself.

413
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,959
Come on, hurry up.

414
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,560
Hurry up, hurry up, don't dawdle.

415
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,760
Tonight, stay at my place.

416
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,680
I haven't told my dad yet.

417
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,520
Today is uncle's big day.

418
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,528
Don't disturb him.

419
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,000
Can you make it?
Or should I go up and help you?

420
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
From now on,

421
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,920
I won't be able to taste my dad's food anymore.

422
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,479
And no one will toss my clothes around.

423
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,056
From now on,

424
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:20,599
we're the extra people in the families.

425
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,928
I'm your brother.

426
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:26,976
You're my younger brother.

427
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,520
We are not extras to each other.

428
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:36,320
♫ We are on the same side ♫

429
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:41,178
