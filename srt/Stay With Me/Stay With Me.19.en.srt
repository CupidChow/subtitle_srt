17
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,378
(Episode 19)

18
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:36,443
Han Bokuang, Han Bokuang.

19
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:40,523
Is Su Yu here with you?

20
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:41,723
No, what's up?

21
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:43,443
Have you heard from him these days?

22
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:45,882
What happened?

23
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:54,842
He's so handsome.

24
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:58,522
Why is this young man here again?

25
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:03,922
So handsome.

26
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,763
So handsome.

27
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:09,562
What, Wu Bi's mother committed suicide?

28
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:15,202
Actually, the person responsible
for that accident

29
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,322
wasn't her at all.

30
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,763
The batch of goods she handled was fine.

31
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,363
It only had an issue later

32
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,543
because the commercial spies
colluded with the dealer

33
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,682
and switched some of the goods.

34
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:27,883
It's pretty much as I guessed.

35
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,963
Wasn't this investigated
thoroughly at the time?

36
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:34,483
Investigate, how?

37
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,103
The stakeholders disappeared,

38
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:37,363
and no evidence could be found.

39
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:41,243
Someone had to take the fall for it.

40
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,323
The other party's purpose was clear,

41
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:45,003
to ruin Wu Zhenghao

42
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:46,842
and his company.

43
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:50,302
So Wu Bi's mother,

44
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,963
in order to protect
the company and her husband,

45
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,623
stepped out and took all the responsibility.

46
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:56,443
She knew Wu Zhenghao too well,

47
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:00,603
a man who sees his career as his life.

48
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,482
Wu Zhenghao was born into a poor family,

49
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:06,243
and he worked hard all his life

50
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:08,282
for the wealth and fame he has now.

51
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:11,562
Although you're still a child,

52
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:15,723
I don't think you'll be ordinary in the future.

53
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,123
To be honest with you,

54
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:22,803
all of us in the Mo family are tough,

55
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:25,163
except for my sister,

56
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:27,682
a soft persimmon

57
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:31,523
who was crushed by Wu Zhenghao
to the point of losing her life.

58
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,363
Then why did you say

59
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:40,622
that my mom was used?

60
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:43,402
Because all those rumors
about the mistress back then

61
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,482
were spread by me.

62
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:47,008
What?

63
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:48,992
I had no choice.

64
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:52,202
At that time, I realized

65
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,363
my sister was going to take the fall.

66
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,202
To make her give up this idea,

67
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:59,062
I purposely spread rumors

68
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:01,083
to ruin their relationship.

69
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:05,843
I just didn't expect their love
for each other to be so strong

70
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:09,963
that my sister trusted
Wu Zhenghao unconditionally.

71
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,803
But even if she took the fall,

72
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:18,042
she didn't have to die, right?

73
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:23,840
Do you think

74
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,803
someone from my family would go to jail?

75
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,322
If my sister didn't die,

76
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,083
Wu Zhenghao would have to.

77
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:37,442
How much love does it take to do that?

78
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:41,283
We worked so hard to build this company,

79
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,962
and it took more than a decade

80
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:45,602
to get it to its current state.

81
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,262
If anything happens to you,
our company would be finished.

82
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:49,643
The truth hasn't been investigated yet.

83
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:51,283
Can you not jump to conclusions?

84
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:52,322
What's there to investigate?

85
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:54,363
I've said it was my fault.

86
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:57,283
I took the risk for sales performance.

87
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:58,822
Even if it was your fault, so what?

88
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,563
We're a family, and I'm your husband.

89
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:01,643
We will handle this together.

90
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:04,722
Then let's dissolve our relationship.

91
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:06,803
That way you won't be implicated.

92
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,042
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,703
I'm saying, let's get a divorce.

94
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:12,963
No.

95
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,363
Why are you getting a divorce?

96
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:18,816
This is an adult conversation.
You're a kid. Get out.

97
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,083
Is it because of that woman?

98
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,363
Are you having an affair?

99
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,743
Who told you such nonsense?

100
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:24,928
The company staff. They're all saying it.

101
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:25,984
You…

102
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:28,602
It's nonsense. Don't listen to them. Let's go.

103
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,322
So that's the truth.

104
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:41,643
Does Wu Zhenghao,

105
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,683
Wu Bi's dad, know about this?

106
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:47,843
I think he does.

107
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,123
My sister asked me to always keep it from him,

108
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:53,403
but I think,

109
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:56,762
if he's not a fool, he would know.

110
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,602
He just couldn't accept it,

111
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:04,283
and couldn't face his deceased wife and son.

112
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:19,922
This is the suicide note my sister wrote to me.

113
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:23,723
If I could have seen it sooner

114
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:25,442
and arrived at the scene earlier,

115
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:29,722
this wouldn't have happened.

116
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:32,403
Now you take it.

117
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,083
With this letter,

118
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,363
you can prove your mother's innocence.

119
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:44,803
Thank you.

120
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,162
As for Wu Bi,

121
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:51,322
he's about to come of age in a few days.

122
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,363
He should know the truth.

123
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:58,976
Uncle,

124
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,322
I still want to ask you

125
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,563
why are you willing to trust me,

126
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,963
and tell me about these things?

127
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:08,256
Take a guess.

128
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:12,482
Because my persistence has touched you?

129
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:20,202
Because my dog didn't bite you.

130
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:24,882
I've had this dog for over a decade,

131
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:28,482
and in my memory, he's only well-behaved twice.

132
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,363
The first time

133
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:32,243
was when my sister came here.

134
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:34,144
And the other time

135
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:36,042
was when you came here.

136
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:41,643
I've always felt dogs are
more reliable than people.

137
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:41,600
Wu Bi.

138
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,603
Wu Bi, let me tell you.

139
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,523
Where have you been these days?

140
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,043
You even lied to me about being home.

141
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,923
Do you know I've been
looking for you day and night?

142
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,643
Do you know I was very worried?

143
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:58,762
Wu Bi, listen to me first.

144
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,242
I know the truth about your mother's death.

145
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,242
She was not plotted against by your dad.

146
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,083
You've misunderstood your dad.

147
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,362
I'm asking you,

148
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,202
where have you been?

149
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:12,963
Calm down now.

150
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:25,163
I've been meaning to tell you

151
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,743
that little statue of a boy is me.

152
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:30,752
This proves

153
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:33,843
there was no affair
between your dad and my mom,

154
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:36,883
and your mom was close with my mom.

155
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:38,043
If you don't believe it,

156
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:41,643
you can also read this.

157
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,923
I'm asking you,

158
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,083
where have you been?

159
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,122
I went to your uncle's place,

160
00:09:58,283 --> 00:09:59,562
which is, Mo Renhe's house.

161
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,582
Who told you to go?

162
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,043
Who told you?

163
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,403
Answer me! Who told you to go find him?

164
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:06,802
Who told you to?

165
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:44,882
(Xicai Fenfang Knife-cut Noodles)

166
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,963
Boss, a bowl of noodles, please.

167
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,882
What if they all know the truth,

168
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:02,403
but they just don't want to accept it?

169
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:05,843
Is everything I did

170
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:08,562
meaningless?

171
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:24,523
Sir, you should rest early.

172
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:27,242

Mom.

189
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:02,083
Why were you willing to die for him,

190
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,720

The meal is ready.

207
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:24,928
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,442
You…

209
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,923
I apologize to you for what I said before.

210
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:33,923
It's okay. You're still a child after all.

211
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:37,343
Besides, you're also my son.

212
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:39,603
How could I hold a grudge against my own son?

213
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,682
The things my mom used before she died,

214
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:44,483
you can keep the valuable ones,

215
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:47,403
and burn the worthless ones.

216
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,363
In this lesson, we will review
magnesium and aluminum.

217
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:01,883
Why do we put magnesium and aluminum together?

218
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,122
They are both in the same period and adjacent

219
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:06,603
in the periodic table,

220
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,522
and they are similar.

221
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:10,163
They both tend to lose electrons.

222
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:13,443
Magnesium loses two electrons.

223
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:15,523
Aluminum loses three electrons.

224
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,803
Uncle, where's Su Yu?

225
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:40,882
He's in the hospital.

226
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:56,832
Wu Bi, what are you doing here?

227
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,002
Where's Su Yu?

228
00:16:58,002 --> 00:16:59,122
He just fell asleep.

229
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:36,128
Su Yu.

230
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:14,362
All of this.

231
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:15,602
Over a thousand.

232
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:17,440
Well…

233
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,362
Brother Wu Bi.

234
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:22,583
Why did you lock Brother Su Yu outside?

235
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,443
Did he upset you?

236
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,563
What do you mean?

237
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,163
That day when Su Yu came back,
he had a high fever,

238
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:30,683
and he kept talking nonsense,

239
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,283
saying

240
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,583
someone didn't let him in the house,

241
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,842
someone let him stand in the rain all night,

242
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:40,043
someone didn't give him any food,

243
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:41,482
and so on.

244
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:43,722
So I thought those days,

245
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,722
Su Yu said he was with you, right?

246
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:48,803
I'm just guessing.

247
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:50,183
If I got it wrong,

248
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:51,443
don't take it to heart.

249
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,122
Hey, why are you still up?

250
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,882
I couldn't sleep, so I wanted to talk to you.

251
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,122
Why is it so lively there?

252
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:06,923
We're having a party here.

253
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,303
What are you eating?

254
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:13,803
Seafood.

255
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,323
A rainy day with a table of seafood,
how free and easy.

256
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,122
I'm really envious.

257
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,384
Show your ID.

258
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:39,403
ID my ass.

259
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:45,312
What are you doing?

260
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,563
Stop him.

261
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:56,803
Mo Renhe.

262
00:19:57,472 --> 00:20:00,002
♫ What it would be like ♫

263
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:01,088
Come out.

264
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:03,587
♫ I never considered
whether what I was doing was right or wrong ♫

265
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:05,783
Mr. Mo is busy.

266
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:06,842
You can't disturb him.

267
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:10,507
♫ Maybe it's best ♫

268
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:13,312
♫ To remain silent now ♫

269
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:18,097
♫ Let the fire burn in our hearts ♫

270

♫ We pray ♫

271

♫ We look far away ♫

272
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,296

♫ We have never retreated ♫

276
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,648
♫ Maybe it's not a coincidence ♫

277
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,632
What are you doing here?

278
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:39,968
What are you doing?

279
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:42,482
♫ But the dawn will eventually come ♫

280
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:44,523
I am your uncle. Why are you hitting me?

281
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:46,443
Why not? You deserve it.

282
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:47,456
Wu Bi.

283
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,923
Wu Bi, have you gone mad?

284
00:20:55,283 --> 00:20:56,288
Stop it.

285
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:01,403
He is my nephew.

286
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:04,512
♫ This world is as colorful as bubbles ♫

287
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:07,360
♫ Inviting people to touch ♫

288
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,648

290
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:18,563
♫ Only after experiencing it
can this moment be ♫

00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:20,672
♫ The most worthy of appreciation ♫

292
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:25,563

(Zhou's Snack)

306
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,423
Ladies and gentlemen,

307
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:17,323
today is the grand opening

308
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:19,023
of Zhou's Snack Shop.

309
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:21,683
Everyone is welcome to come in for a taste.

310
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:23,283
Thank you, please come in.

311
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:26,242
Please. Welcome.

312
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:27,264
Please come in.

313
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,563
(A promising future. Happy Birthday.)

314
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:31,623
Today is a really lucky day.

315
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:33,183
The opening of our little shop

316
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:35,602
and also Su Yu's birthday.
A double celebration.

317
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:37,962
Thank you, Ms. Zhou, for the cake.

318
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,803
This is the first time I've ever celebrated
a birthday since I was a child.

319
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:44,122
You've never celebrated your child's birthday?

320
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:46,643
Well, only old people celebrate birthdays.

321
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:49,082
Why should a child celebrate a birthday?

322
00:22:49,082 --> 00:22:50,263
Some father you are.

323
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:51,982
Let's celebrate.

324
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:55,422
Son, I've been busy with the opening all day,

325
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:57,143
and I didn't prepare a gift for you.

326
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,176
How about this?

327
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,082
I'll give you a lottery ticket.

328
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:01,923
If you win anything, it's all yours.

329
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:05,203
You say you're busy,

330
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:06,722
but you never forget to buy lottery tickets.

331
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:12,704
Duo, how about improvising a poem
for your brother?

332
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:13,760
Okay.

333
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,323
Without Brother Wu Bi, I have no inspiration.

334
00:23:17,283 --> 00:23:18,304
Oh…

335
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,523
Are you two having a quarrel?

336
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:26,722
You're both young men.

337
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:28,023
You can light the candles now.

338
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:30,043
Okay, fine.

339
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,203
Why are you celebrating a birthday without me?

340
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:38,542
Brother Wu Bi, you're finally back.

341
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,503
I was on duty today, so I came a bit late.

342
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,203
What kind of gift is this?

343
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:43,783
You can't open it yet.

344
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:44,963
It's a secret.

345
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:47,163
Come and sit. Grab a chair.

346
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:00,160
Make a wish.

347
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:02,882
Make a wish.

348
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:04,832
Make a wish.

349
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:21,323
May your wish come true.

350
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:24,002
I have inspiration now.

351
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:27,923
You still have to go up.

352
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:28,928
- Be careful, slow down.
- Come on.

353
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:31,943
He closed his eyes.

354
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:35,422
His long eyelashes trembled slightly.

355
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:39,043
He looked at that face full of stories.

356
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:44,082
Through the flickering candlelight.

357
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:48,403
If there is a wooden box
in the depths of the sea.

358
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:51,242
It must contain a wish.

359
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,962
Hoping that we will always be together.

360
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,283
- Come on, get down,
- Be careful, slow down.

361
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,803
Let's cut the cake. Come on.

362
00:25:05,842 --> 00:25:06,842
Come on.

363
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:43,552
Just now,

364
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,362
you threw up the cake you ate.

365
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:49,523
Why do you care?

366
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,122
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,882
I apologize for my attitude yesterday.

368
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:03,643
What is there to apologize for?

369
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:07,323
I meddled with your business.

370
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:10,752
Yes,

371
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:13,923
you did meddle.

372
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:20,163
Why did you have to go to him?

373
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:23,203
Why let a bunch of people bully you?

374
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:26,643
Why would you?

375
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:33,242
Because I wanted to give you the truth.

376
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,803
If I had known that the truth
would come at such a price,

377
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,043
I would rather not have it.

378
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:52,384
♫ You said that between us ♫

379
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:55,923
♫ You will protect me ♫

380
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:56,928
Wait.

381
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,422
I should be the one feeling wronged,

382
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:00,683
but why are you crying?

383
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:06,459
♫ I believe in every promise ♫

384
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,482
♫ You made to me ♫

385
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:10,624
Sorry.

386
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:14,122
It was wrong of me to take matters
into my own hands.

387
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:18,762
I shouldn't have hastily told you the truth.

388
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:20,962
I didn't know you couldn't handle it.

389
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:23,904
I, I really…

390
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:27,781
♫ Good or bad, it doesn't matter ♫

391
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,456
♫ As long as we're by each other's side ♫

392
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,635
♫ Thank you for never holding back ♫

393
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,352
Thank you.

395
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:46,528

397
00:28:04,803 --> 00:28:05,882
Your birthday gift.

398
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,304
♫ It's just because I am not expressive ♫

399
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:13,103
♫ So, I have to keep silent ♫

400
00:28:13,856 --> 00:28:17,112

00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:21,344

♫ Good or bad, it doesn't matter ♫

406
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,523
A birthday gift, six years late.

407
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:45,632
♫ Thank you for never holding back ♫

408
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:49,082
I'm delivering it for my mom.

♫ You've done enough ♫

410
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:57,316

Stop crying.

413
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:08,672
My younger brother.

414
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,448
Get lost.

415
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,312
♫ Thank you for never holding back ♫

416
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:20,694
♫ Even if it means giving me

♫ This time I'll guard you in return ♫

419
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:41,763
Do you know why I reacted the way I did

420
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,323
when I heard you went to my uncle?

421
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,242
Because he has a strange temper?

422
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:49,962
He's more than just strange.

423
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:52,122
He's downright bizarre.

424
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:54,563
Do you know what his nickname is?

425
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,183
What is it?

426
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:57,443
Mo One Move.

427
00:29:58,323 --> 00:30:00,023
Whatever he can kill with one move,

428
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:01,362
he never makes a second one.

429
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:05,002
When I was a kid, I got beaten up
by him the most.

430
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:07,562
He even hits his nephew?

431
00:30:07,562 --> 00:30:09,683
I thought only his own son would be hit.

432
00:30:11,203 --> 00:30:13,283
You underestimated our Mo family.

433
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:14,283
Let alone him,

434
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:17,482
I've been hit by my eldest uncle
and youngest aunt.

435
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:21,643
Your dad and mom are a combination
of violent aesthetics.

436
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:23,643
No wonder you can fight so well.

437
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:29,523
What's wrong? Is your stomach hurting again?

438
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:32,523
it's alright. I've taken medicine.

439
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:34,882
Just taking medicine won't work.

440
00:30:34,882 --> 00:30:36,083
You need to eat something.

441
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,223
I'll make you some porridge.

442
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:38,368
I don't want to eat.

443
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:40,384
You have to eat.

444
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:48,563
Brother Wu Bi, I want to sleep on your bed.

445
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,963
That won't work.

446
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:53,563
Our bed is a wooden plank.

447
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,242
It's too hard for you.

448
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:57,283
It's okay, I like sleeping on hard surfaces.

449
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:00,923
But our bed is too narrow.

450
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:02,643
I'm afraid all three of us won't fit.

451
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,022
It's okay, all I need

452
00:31:04,022 --> 00:31:06,523
is a space this small.

453
00:31:11,443 --> 00:31:13,503
Your brother Su Yu is sick,

454
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:15,082
and he needs a good rest.

455
00:31:15,762 --> 00:31:17,503
If the three of us squeeze together,

456
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:19,703
he definitely won't rest well.

457
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:22,362
Who says? When you're sick,
you need to sweat more.

458
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:23,862
Once you sweat, you'll get better.

459
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:26,602
Only by squeezing together to sleep,
can he sweat.

460
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:32,043
Let me get something for Su Yu to eat first.

461
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:34,022
We'll discuss this later.

462
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,163
Okay, okay.

463
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:41,403
Discuss?

464
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,683
Once I go back to the room, I'll lock the door.

465
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:11,563
Little girl, you're quick.

466
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,376
She's asleep?

467
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:32,363
She has been in the store all day
for the past two days.

468
00:32:32,363 --> 00:32:34,482
The moment she's back, she wants
to hang out with you guys.

469
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:36,416
Good night.

470
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,283
Sir, the meal is ready.

471
00:32:53,043 --> 00:32:55,722
I never thought Wu Bi
would come home for his birthday.

472
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:58,463
What's even more surprising
is that our family of four

473
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:00,283
can sit together and have a meal together.

474
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:02,963
You two, eat more.

475
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:04,242
Here, have a leg.

476
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:06,563
You have one too.

477
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:12,803
If you want to eat, help yourself.

478
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:13,983
Why are you taking his?

479
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:15,323
He's allergic to crab.

480
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:18,043
Su Yu is allergic to crab?

481
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:21,203
You see, even his own mother doesn't know.

482
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:24,643
Look how well they're getting along.

483
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:30,880
You see,

484
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,523
our family is getting along so well now,

485
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:36,543
and your father is not so busy lately.

486
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:38,962
Why don't you two move in together?

487
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:41,403
There's no way I'm moving in.

488
00:33:42,683 --> 00:33:44,882
Then Wu Bi, you can move in alone.

489
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:47,523
Wherever he is, I will be.

490
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,122
What are your plans for school?

491
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,482
You are going to be a senior.

492
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,722
What universities are you planning to apply to?

493
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:04,643
Do you want me to find a tutor for you?

494
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:08,643
Look, your academic performance now…

495
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:11,042
Can I just eat in peace?

496
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,362
We'll talk about that later.

497
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:17,802
We just started getting along with the child.

498
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:19,403
Besides, it's his birthday today.

499
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:22,282
Wu Bi, guess what birthday gift

500
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:23,403
your father has prepared for you?

501
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:35,802
You're turning 18 today.

502
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,562
You can get your driver's license now.

503
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,842
This car is your birthday gift.

504
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:41,952
Thanks.

505
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:48,522
Right, it was Su Yu's birthday a few days ago.

506
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:52,062
As parents, you can't favor one
and neglect the other, right?

507
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:53,503
Get him a car too.

508
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:55,243
What are you talking about? I don't want it.

509
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,312
You should have one.

510
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:00,704
Take the kids to the 4S store
this afternoon to pick one out.

511
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:01,723
No, thanks.

512
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:03,122
I really don't want it.

513
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:07,104
Why not?

514
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:08,122
If you don't take it,

515
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:09,723
they're going to say you are
trampling on their labor again.

516
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,483
Today is your birthday,
and I didn't get you a gift.

517
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:31,402
Because I really don't know
what could be more precious

518
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:32,602
than what you gave me.

519
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:35,584
You've already given me the best gift.

520
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:43,122
By the way,

521
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:44,143
when we were eating just now,

522
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,403
why did you start acting up again?

523
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:49,323
I don't know why,

524
00:35:49,323 --> 00:35:50,963
but I just can't help it when I see my dad.

525
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,582
I've been at odds with my dad
since I was a kid.

526
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:55,843
I've told you,

527
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:57,043
apart from the issue with my mom,

528
00:35:57,043 --> 00:35:58,523
the biggest gap between me and my dad

529
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,842
is his disapproval of me.

530
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:02,143
You saw his expression today.

531
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:03,562
He looked down on me.

532
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:08,163
Have you ever thought
about winning his approval?

533
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,723
Why should I cater to him?

534
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:56,605
♫ Do we have to look the same ♫

535
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,592
♫ To be called a family? ♫

536
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:10,624
♫ Is it true that we must have
the same surname ♫

537
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:13,470
♫ To be able to ♫

538
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:18,848
♫ Be called siblings ♫

539
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,643
Happy birthday, brother Wu Bi.

540
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,880
♫ No matter what, it will be true ♫

541
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:43,008
♫ Did we agree
we would have endless stories? ♫

542
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:47,802
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday.

543
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:51,296
♫ About our family ♫

544
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:53,203
What are you doing here?

545
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:55,583
My dad is a fan of Wu Bi.

546
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,563
He's crazy about him.

547
00:37:57,563 --> 00:37:58,982
You kid.

548
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:00,443
Are you as manly as Wu Bi?

549
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:02,443
If you were this manly, could I not like you?

550
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:06,282
Look how manly Wu Bi is, such a young man.

551
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:08,288
Is that so?

552
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:10,562
Happy Birthday, Wu Bi.

553
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:11,648
Thank you.

554
00:38:13,475 --> 00:38:16,672
♫ I fear even my breath will disturb you ♫

555
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:21,376
♫ Maybe this is the meaning of family ♫

556
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:25,380
♫ How beautiful ♫

557
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:37,890
♫ Did we agree
we would stay together forever? ♫

558
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:44,190
♫ No matter what, it will be true ♫

559
00:38:46,954 --> 00:38:52,418
♫ Did we agree
we would have endless stories? ♫

560
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:54,754
♫ About you ♫

561
00:38:56,866 --> 00:39:01,218
♫ About our family ♫

562
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:07,202
♫ I'll wait here foolishly for you ♫

563
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:11,074
♫ No matter if a sudden storm comes ♫

564
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:14,498
♫ I'll have everything ready here ♫

565
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:18,370
♫ Just waiting for your word ♫

566
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,984
♫ I'll guard you silently here ♫

567
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:25,666
♫ I fear even my breath will disturb you ♫

568
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:30,498
♫ Maybe this is the meaning of family ♫

569
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:33,826
♫ How beautiful ♫

570
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:40,322
I get it now.

571
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:42,882
He's not angry with me.

572
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:45,763
He genuinely wants to stay here.

573
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:48,403
I can give him a car,

574
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:50,763
and it would be less than a meal here.

575
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:53,722
He's a kid.

576
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:56,503
It's normal for him to seek novelty.

577
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:57,803
I have a niece

578
00:39:57,803 --> 00:39:59,982
who's used to living in a big city.

579
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,202
As soon as she gets to the countryside,

580
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,823
she is overjoyed.

581
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:05,882
She even gets into the pigsty
and chases the pigs.

582
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,123
I know him.

583
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,723
If it's about seeking novelty,
he wouldn't last three days.

584
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:16,322
He's been here for almost half a year.

585
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:21,322
What are these kids thinking?

586
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:22,880
When I was little,

587
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:24,523
a full meal,

588
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,882
and a spinning top could make me happy all day.

589
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:29,103
Back then, let alone cars,

590
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,963
I hadn't even seen a bicycle.

591
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:34,443
Mr. Wu, there's something

592
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:37,122
I am not sure whether I should say it or not.

593
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:39,392
Go ahead.

594
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:41,663
Actually, I think it's exactly

595
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:43,923
because we grew up in different environments

596
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:45,003
that our source

597
00:40:45,003 --> 00:40:47,463
of inner satisfaction is also different.

598
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:48,803
Take you as an example.

599
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:50,543
When you were young,
you lacked material things.

600
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:52,363
So, you could obtain inner satisfaction

601
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:54,143
through material things.

602
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:55,883
But Wu Bi is different.

603
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:58,442
He's been well-fed and well-clothed
since he was a child.

604
00:40:58,442 --> 00:40:59,522
He lacks nothing.

605
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:01,683
What he lacks most

606
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:03,602
is companionship.

607
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,503
When he was a child,

608
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,443
I should have starved him a few times.

609
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:40,610
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

610
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:47,370

611

00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:08,088
♫ You always have so many ideas ♫

614
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,106
♫ Occasionally, you're not so obedient ♫

615
00:42:17,758 --> 00:42:21,890
♫ But it's you who bring the worries ♫

616
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:29,077
♫ That make a complete family ♫

617
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,706
♫ From today, every minute and second ♫

618
00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:36,546
♫ Will be the treasure of my life ♫

619
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:39,554
♫ Because with you by my side ♫

620
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:42,370
♫ Everything becomes beautiful ♫

621

♫ No matter where you are, home will be ♫

♫ In that place ♫

625
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,242
♫ In that place ♫

626
00:43:29,058 --> 00:43:33,314
♫ In that place ♫
