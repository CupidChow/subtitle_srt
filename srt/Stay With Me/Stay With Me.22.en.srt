18
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:42,639
Here's your tomato and egg noodles.

19
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,720
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

20
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,400
Welcome. Have a seat.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,480
Sir, the bill, please.

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,536
Just a moment.

23
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:51,559
- Take a look at the menu.
- Okay. Thank you.

24
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,959
You have this, let me see.

25
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,208
- Is it enough?
- Just right.

26
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,239
Alright.

27
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,440
- Take care. Come back next time.
- Okay. Alright.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,420
Waiter, hurry up.

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,639
Clean this up.

30
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,360
The dishes are ready.

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,000
Su Yu, it's time for lunch.

32
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,699
I had your father buy you a mobile phone.

33
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,160
I saw that all your classmates have it.

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,000
Dad, what happened?

35
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,220
Zhou's mother passed away.

36
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,579
I have to visit her hometown

37
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,720
and pay my respects.

38
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,580
She must be very upset, right?

39
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,632
Yeah.

40
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,500
Her father passed away early.

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,320
She was the only relative left in her hometown.

42
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,559
I'll take Duo with me.

43
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,560
You stay with Wu Bi

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,639
and take good care of yourselves.

45
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,460
You don't have to worry about me.

46
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,059
Just take care of Ms. Zhou.

47
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,112
Okay.

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,420
When Zhou left, she didn't take
many clothes with her.

49
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,000
She thought she would be back in a few days.

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,279
But she ended up leaving for two months.

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,240
I'll bring her some more.

52
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,679
How did this get all piled up? This won't do.

53
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,832
Let me…

54
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Where did I put my bag?

55
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,119
She usually organizes things.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,880
I don't know where she put it.

57
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,799
<i>I bought Su Yu a pair of shoes.</i>

58
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,959
<i>You should let him try them on</i>

59
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,359
<i>to see if they fit.</i>

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,900
Two.

61
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,048
Three.

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,776
Four.

63
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,140
Five.

64
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,279
I never noticed before how much you love money.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,819
This is different.

66
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,079
This is money I earned with my own two hands.

67
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,180
Aren't you also getting a salary?

68
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,559
Where are you planning to go?

69
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,032
Are you listening?

70
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,839
The last time we went to the amusement park,
Mao Chong bought tickets.

71
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,679
So this time,

72
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,959
I want to buy the tickets and take him to play.

73
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,080
Mao Chong again.

74
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,720
Do you still treasure your life?

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,279
How dare you play again with Mao Chong?

76
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,288
Alright, alright.

77
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,799
And you, what are you planning
to do with your money?

78
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,799
This is the first money I earned.

79
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,279
I have to spend it
on the most important person.

80
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,560
What's happening?

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,559
The power's out.

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,800
Who kissed?

83
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,399
I just heard someone kiss.

84
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,959
What? Really?

85
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,840
Who? Who was it?

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,880
The power's back.

87
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,160
- Who was it?
- Yes, who was it just now?

88
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,559
Who was it? Really?

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,239
Brother.

90
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,279
You're back.

91
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,839
- Where's your Mom?
- In the kitchen.

92
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:46,200
Ms. Zhou.

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,359
Su Yu, Wu Bi.

94
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,519
I missed you guys.

95
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,480
Why do you look thinner?

96
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,920
It smells so good.

97
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,239
Zucchini and egg filling.

98
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,840
Don't even think about using your hands.

99
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,760
Let's go. Time to eat. Sit at the table.

100
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,799
Time to eat.

101
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,640
Dinner time.

102
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,520
Quickly, you two pour the drinks.

103
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,528
Okay.

104
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,640
Time for dumplings.

105
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:26,464
<i>♫ Do we have to look the same ♫</i>

106
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:32,602

108

109
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,360
Don't hit me.

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Hit him, Duo.

111
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Duo, you should hit him. Don't always hit me.

112
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:59,008

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000

What a kid.

128
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,159
You should spend your salary on yourself.

129
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,119
Why are you spending it on me?

130
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,440
These shoes aren't cheap, right?

131
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,504
Mom.

132
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,256
In the future,

133
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,919
you should look nice too.

134

<i>♫ Did we agree

135
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:24,899
Hey, you're doing all the mushy stuff alone.

136
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,080
You're not including us two.

137
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,672
Mom.

138
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,140
This is a dress I bought for you.

139
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,760
It'll look even better with these high heels.

140
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,119
Look at you two.

141
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,039
I'm so happy I don't even know what to say.

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,199
She's my mom.

143
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,340
Why are you joining in the fun?

144
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,879
She's my mom in the first place.

145
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,320
Right, Mom?

146
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,176
Yes.

147
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,260
You already have two moms,
and you're still trying to steal mine?

148
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,080
I don't care, your mom is my mom.

149
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,760
Mom, this is the scarf I got for you.

150
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,559
Duo, you also prepared a gift for mom?

151
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,359
Mom, don't be sad.

152
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,559
Grandma may be gone,

153
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,719
but you still have us, your family.

154
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm not sad.

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,119
I'm not sad.

<i>♫ Is it true that we must have

157

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,119
you want to spend money
on the most important person?

159
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,359
Yes, I did spend it
on the most important person.

160
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:36,080
So, your most important person is Ms. Zhou?

161
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,799
Your brain

162
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,880
is only made for math problems.

163
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,184
Son.

164
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,039
Dad, what's wrong?

165
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,064
Did you hear?

166
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:04,580
The Air Force Academy started enrolling.

167
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,640
Did you apply?

168
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:08,480
No.

169
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,640
Kiddo.

170
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,799
I heard that Wu Bi has applied.

171
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,699
Dad, look at Wu Bi's physique,

172
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:21,940
and then look at mine.

173
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,159
You and I both know

174
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,620
the requirements for pilots are so strict.

175
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,840
They only choose the cream of the crop.

176
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,419
It's even harder
than getting into Tsinghua University.

177
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,080
I won't make it.

178
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,180
I don't like hearing you talk like this.

179
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,239
How do you know if you don't try?

180
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,448
Han Bokuang.

181
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:42,304
What's going on?

182
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,060
I'm telling you, Han Bokuang,

183
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,200
if you don't apply,

184
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,039
I'll contact your teacher directly.

185
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,520
Fine, I'll apply. Happy now?

186
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,080
That's more like it.

187
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,159
That's my good son.

188
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
Go apply for it tomorrow.

189
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,599
Come, this one.

190
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,119
98.

191
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,776
And this one?

192
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:21,320
And this one?

193
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,840
602.

194
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,799
Switch.

195
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,599
I can't see it.

196
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,296
180 cm.

197
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:48,416
Here you go.

198
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,559
Please take off all your clothes.

199
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,400
Not bad, young man.

200
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Follow my instructions.

201
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
Turn around, all of you.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,320
Face the wall, and take off your pants.

203
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,000
Dinner's ready!

204
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,280
Dinner's ready!

205
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,239
Why isn't Su Yu coming out?

206
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,160
He said he wasn't hungry.

207
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,559
How can he not be hungry
after a day at school? I'll get him.

208
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,184
I'll go.

209
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,400
Mom asked me to get you for dinner.

210
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,599
I said I'm not hungry.

211
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,220
You're not interested in being a pilot,

212
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,440
so what if you're eliminated?

213
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,120
Don't bring it up,

214
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,419
or I'll get mad at you.

215
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,520
Okay, okay, I won't mention it.

216
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,500
If you're upset or angry,

217
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,560
you can hit me.

218
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,719
Come on, hit me wherever you want.

219
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:21,824
Forget it.

220
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,760
You have a re-examination in a few days.

221
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,080
If you get a scar on you,

222
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,176
I'll be the one to blame.

223
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,440
Then I won't be polite.

224
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,619
- What are you doing?
- Let's go, time to eat.

225
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:35,640
Anyway, you don't dare to hit me. Let's go.

226
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I…

227
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,599
I heard that today,

228
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,000
out of the entire school,
only two people passed

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,740
the Air Force Academy physical examination.

230
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,559
And Wu Bi was one of them.

231
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Really?

232
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,040
Congratulations, Wu Bi.

233
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,039
Our family is going to have a pilot.

234
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,128
Of course.

235
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:53,799
It's still early. There's a re-examination.

236
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,420
And it is even stricter.

237
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,960
Brother Wu Bi won't have any problems.

238
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,099
That's true, not to mention his studies,

239
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,679
in terms of physical fitness,

240
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,679
he has never been afraid of anyone.

241
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,704
This kid.

242
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,700
I think it's pretty amazing

243
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,832
that after all these years
of bumps and bruises, no scar was left behind.

244
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:09,856
Come on, Duo.

245
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,920
I wanted to leave a scar.
How cool would that be?

246
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,280
But no matter how badly I get hurt,

247
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,760
my body always heals well.

248
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,739
There's no help for it.
I'm just too slick all over,

249
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:19,840
right?

250
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,679
Why didn't you share
this good news with your dad?

251
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,320
He's not interested in these things.

252
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,760
But being a pilot is a noble thing.

253
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,039
He will support you.

254
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,039
Congratulations, brother Wu Bi,

255
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,359
you're one step closer to your dream.

256
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,400
Yes.

257
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,576
Let's have a toast again.

258
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,599
Come on, cheers.

259
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,080
Congratulations to him, come on.

260
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,239
- Eat up, eat more.
- Okay.

261
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,400
Come, come, hurry,

262
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,080
Duo, here's a piece of meat for you.

263
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,039
Come on, eat it.

264
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
You scared me. What are you doing?

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,080
I got my driver's license today.

266
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,640
Stop sleeping.

267
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,919
Come on, wake up.

268
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,208
It's our day off, so let's go for a drive.

269
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,239
Wake up.

270
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,200
How dare you hit the road
just after getting your license?

271
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,359
If you dare to go, I dare to drive.

272
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,960
I don't.

273
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,960
That would be such a shame

274
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:54,160
because I have to go on an adventure by myself.

275
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,559
I remember someone's dream

276
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,760
was to become a traveler,

277
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,080
and I remember he also once complained,

278
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,199
about how he's never been out of Beijing.

279
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you know the way?

280
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,016
Don't you know?

281
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,839
I've never been out of Beijing,

282
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,640
so how would I know the way?

283
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,800
Just make a decision.

284
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,040
Where shall we go for our first stop?

285
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,920
I can't think of anything for the moment.

286
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,959
How about this? I'll give you a tip.

287
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,000
Alright, we'll drive westward.

288
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,248
Get in the car.

289
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,520
I'm surprised. Your driving skills are good.

290
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,640
Who do you think I am?

291
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,560
If we keep going west,

292
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,000
will we not see the sea?

293
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,880
Not necessarily. If we keep driving,

294
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,119
we'll eventually get to Western Europe
and see the sea.

295
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,920
What if

296
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,479
I say I want to go to a city with a sea?

297
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,640
Why didn't you say it this morning?

298
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,800
I didn't think of it then.

299
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,899
We've already driven three hundred miles
and now you're saying it.

300
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,800
Do you know how much fuel
three hundred miles take?

301
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,260
Do you know how many breakfasts
we could have had with that money?

302
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,280
If you don't run a household, you don't know
the cost of fuel and groceries.

303
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,199
I'm not joking with you. Be serious.

304
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,959
Alright.

305
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,319
I'll listen to you.

306
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,448
Let's go west.

307
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:27,160
Forget it, let's go east.

308
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,460
Look how lazy you are.

309
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,920
I even have to feed you milk.

310
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,959
Drink this. I just warmed it up for you.

311
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,119
Your stomach has been acting up these days.
So don't drink anything cold.

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,040
When did you warm this up for me?

313
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,439
When you went to the bathroom.

314
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,192
Is it still hot?

315
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,272
No.

316
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,920
It's quite warm.

317
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,384
It should be.

318
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Look! It's really the sea outside.

319
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,199
Of course, we camped on the beach last night.

320
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,600
If it's not the sea outside, what would it be?

321
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,199
It was too dark last night to see clearly.

322
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,800
Let's go. Hurry up and watch the sunrise.

323
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
It's not even dawn yet.

324
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,640
Who watches the sunrise when it's dawn?
Hurry up.

325
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,056
Look.

326
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,800
Come on, let's take a picture.

327
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,200
Why does it feel like
a Superman transformation?

328
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Who could look so handsome
during a transformation?

329
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,880
I'm going to set this picture

330
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,920
as my computer desktop.

331
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:50,079
What's wrong?

332
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,240
I want to shout out loud.

333
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,479
Go ahead and shout.

334
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,408
How boring would it be
if we don't shout at the seaside?

335
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,920
I love you.

336
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,280
Ocean.

337
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,959
Honestly, it's the first time
I've seen you smile so happily.

338
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,119
My son, Su Yu,

339
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,359

Play it a few more times. Take a look.

Come on, cheers.

Come on.

362
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,000
To celebrate your first place
in the biology competition,

363
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,280
I have prepared a big gift for you.

364
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,160
I bought you fifty lottery tickets.

365
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,959
If you win, it's all yours.

366
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,479
Who would have thought that our Su family

367
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,920
would have a student
going to Tsinghua University?

368
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,300
Dad, the guaranteed admission
hasn't come through yet.

369
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,319
You're the national champion,
so how could you not get it?

370
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,760
If you get guaranteed admission, does that
mean you don't have to take the entrance exam?

371
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,160
Not having to take the college entrance exam
is great, isn't it?

372
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,239
You should learn from your brother.

373
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,079
Don't always read messy books.

374
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,632
That's right.

375
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,040
Mom, aren't the dumplings ready yet?

376
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,664
Let's serve the dumplings.

377
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,359
Brother Su Yu, you don't have to take
the college entrance exam,

378
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,839
so your main task would be

379
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,359
tutoring Brother Wu Bi, right?

380
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,900
This watch I gave you really wasn't in vain.

381
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,280
Duo is getting more and more
in tune with her brother.

382
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,339
Why should I tutor you for free?

383
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:21,472
Are you going to pay me?

384
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,839
Given our relationship,

385
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,296
I can give you something better than money.

386
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,119
Here come the dumplings!

387
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,439
Come quickly,

388
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,920
Zucchini and egg filling.

389
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,959
Eat quickly, come on.

390
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,560
Eat while it's hot, come on.

391
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,976
Eat.

392
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,280
Have one yourself.

393
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,640
What's the matter with you?

394
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,280
I've won something!

395
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,160
It's my son who's brought me luck!

396
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,119
I knew I would win one day.

397
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,712
God is watching.

398
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,560
God is watching.

399
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,540
God is watching!

400
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,959
Did you really win five million?

401
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,959
How much did you win exactly?

402
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,079
Three thousand, three thousand!

403
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,700
Uncle, three thousand is not a small amount.

404
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,760
Yes.

405
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,339
Don't forget, the money is my reward.

406
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,720
Son, you're the national champion,

407
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,080
three thousand is definitely not enough.

408
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,960
I'll buy another three thousand
worth of lottery tickets,

409
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,959
and then give you three hundred million.

410
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,040
Give it to me.

411
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,359
Son.

412
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,520
Three thousand for three hundred million
sounds like a good deal.

413
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,680
Son, listen to me.

414
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,620
You're really stingy.

415
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,680
Giving the child a bonus,

416
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,280
and you're using a red envelope to offset it.

417
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:01,880
Isn't the bonus money?

418
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,880
I study this lottery trend chart every day,

419
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
and it's also intellectual labor.

420
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,160
Dad, I want to discuss something with you.

421
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,160
You two chat. I'll go check on Duo.

422
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,359
Dad, my mom,

423
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,840
when she heard that I came in the first place,

424
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,740
she wanted to have a meal with me to celebrate.

425
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,000
Then go.

426
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,839
You came in first,

427
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,680
and your biological mother should be happy,
shouldn't she?

428
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,140
There are other people at her house,
and I feel awkward.

429
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,520
What's awkward about that?

430
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,520
Didn't your mom

431
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,839
clear the misunderstanding with them?

432
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,279
She cleared it with them,

433
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,280
but not with me.

434
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,320
She may have abandoned you back then,

435
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,560
but think about it,

436
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,000
with my IQ,

437
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,959
you couldn't have won
the national championship.

438
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,199
Considering your mother's genes,

439
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,640
you should be more understanding.

440
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,880
Go, go.

441
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,700
This is really rare.

442
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,500
I thought only Mo Yi would come,

443
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,400
but I didn't expect you to come as well.

444
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,760
When Zhenghao was starting his business,

445
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
I heard you helped him a lot.

446
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,319
Here, let me toast to you.

447
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,200
This is the first high-achieving
student in our family,

448
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,920
so I wouldn't miss it.

449
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,880
The high-achiever can't compare to him.

450
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
The high-achievers still have to take
the college entrance exam.

451
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,640
He is directly admitted.

452
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,160
Does your admission
have any major restrictions?

453
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,176
No.

454
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,479
Then have you decided what major to choose?

455
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,159
You don't have to ask that.

456
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,719
He is the first place
in the National Biology Olympiad.

457
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,299
Of course he will choose biological science.

458
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:01,160
Isn't this exactly what our family does?

459
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,976
I haven't decided yet.

460
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,700
I think that's a nice idea.

461
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,900
Our company

462
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,220
lacks top-notch talents like you.

463
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,760
With your intelligence and ability,

464
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,800
not doing research

465
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,839
is a waste of national education resources.

466
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,199
I'm sorry, everyone,

467
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,400
I have to go.

468
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,640
You guys have fun.

469
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,664
I'll go check it out.

470
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Dad.

471
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,400
Did you hear what my uncle said just now?

472
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,040
Of course I did.

473
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,160
He doesn't respect our family at all.

474
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,839
If it weren't for my aunt,

475
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,760
how could he have today?

476
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,240
Even if these things
don't all belong to the Mo family,

477
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,000
they should belong to the Wu family.

478
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,319
What's the Su family's share in this?

479
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,079
But looking at Wu Zhenghao's intention today,

480
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:12,359
and considering the boy's
intelligence and ability,

481
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,839
it's hard not to share.

482
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,656
Besides,

483
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,400
I see Wu Bi is very open-minded.

484
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,839
He gets along well with that boy.

485
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
More than well.

486
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,760
I feel sorry for your aunt.

487
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,120
Your uncle was here just now,

488
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,480
and I didn't ask you,

489
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,199
but Su Yu is already admitted,

490
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,839
so what are your plans?

491
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,488
No plans.

492
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,800
What do you mean no plans?

493
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,620
Are you planning to take the college
entrance exam and go to university directly?

494
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,160
At your current level,

495
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,719
at most it's a third-tier university.

496
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,680
I can't afford to lose my face.

497
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,800
Put down your phone.

498
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,260
I'm giving you two choices now.

499
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,119
Either go to the company's
foundation's university,

500
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
work-study, and get into the business early,

501
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,072
or,

502
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,000
study abroad.

503
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,920
Can you stop dictating my life?

504
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
I've already given you,

505
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,599
the maximum indulgence.

506
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:47,139
Dad, I'm eighteen this year.

507
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,400
Not the age where you can slap me

508
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,640
and make me listen to you.

509
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,279
I already have my own view of life.

510
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,439
I have the standard to judge right from wrong.

511
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:57,119
It's not something your violence can dictate.

512
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Then tell me,

513
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,479
what's your standard
for judging right from wrong?

514
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,800
What I think is right is right.

515
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,000
What I think is wrong is wrong.

516
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,000
If I gain an advantage, it's a gain.

517
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,160
If I suffer a loss, it's a loss.

518
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,680
Nonsense.

519
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,280
Why are you talking to him like that again?

520
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:29,239
Uncle, I have something
to discuss with you alone.

521
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:56,706
<i>♫ Mila, Mila ♫</i>

522
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,466
