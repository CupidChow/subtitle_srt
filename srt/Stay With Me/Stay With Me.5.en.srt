(Episode Five)

18
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:03,552
Who bought this for me?

19
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,919
You brought me breakfast, huh?

20
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:41,639
No.

21
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,679
Stop lying.

22
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,479
I can tell it's from Ms. Zhou's snack stand.

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,432
You knew and still asked.

24
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,400
Did Ms. Zhou ask you to bring it for me,

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
or did you want to bring it yourself?

26
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,020
Will you eat it or not? If not, give it to me.

27
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,559
Fine, I'll eat it.

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,472
Why are you looking at me?

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,059
We've been desk mates for almost half a year.

30
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:11,360
I've never seen you buy anything for anyone.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,039
Not to mention breakfast,

32
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,880
you haven't even bought me a piece of candy.

33
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,160
Alright, I'll treat you to ice cream
after morning exercise.

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,424
That's more like it.

35
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,039
Pass it on.

36
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,320
Inside, inside! Block him!

37
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,632
The ball!

38
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,400
You finally treated me to ice cream.

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,759
Are you sure you don't want to try a bite?

40
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,664
I don't like sweet food.

41
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,160
Just try a bite. Come on.

42
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:51,199
Go away.

43
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,288
Look at you.

44
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,288
There's still some left here.

45
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,288
Okay.

46
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,720
Wu Bi.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,704
What's up?

48
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:12,060
Can you help me give this letter to Su Yu?

49
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,199
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

50
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,619
I can't do it.

51
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:17,839
Please help me.

52
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,136
It's from Zhang Yao.

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,336
Give it back to her.

54
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,480
You won't even take a look?

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,592
She wrote it with so much effort.

56
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,288
I don't want to see it.

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,427
(Restroom-Men)

58
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,359
Did you reject me because of Ye Wanying?

59
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:05,952
It has nothing to do with her.

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,559
Then who is it related to?

61
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,080
I want to ask you something.

62
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,328
What is it?

63
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,740
Who is Ye Wanying?

64
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,640
The prettiest girl in our school before.

65
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:45,879
And then?

66
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,920
She went abroad.

67
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,420
Not only is she beautiful,

68
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,799
but she's also an excellent student.

69
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,940
Back then, our school's top two spots

70
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,880
were always occupied by her and Su Yu.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,239
And she has a great personality.

72
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,640
Most of the boys in our school liked her.

73
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,759
Her leaving

74
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,480
made many people heartbroken.

75
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,260
Were you heartbroken?

76
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,060
How come?

77
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,720
I just asked for her autograph.

78
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:19,872
Look,

79
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,959
I still keep it.

80
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,896
(Ye Wanying)

81
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,472
Do you have QQ?

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,072
Yes.

83
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,608
Tell me your number.

84
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,128
Su Yu.

85
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:45,140
Let's go back together.

86
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,144
Okay.

87
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,519
What's wrong with him?

88
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,040
It's nothing. He's just like that.

89
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Moody.

90
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,060
Oh, right. Do you want to come to my place
to do your homework tonight?

91
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,280
Sure, and I just want to use your computer.

92
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,352
Alright.

93
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,100
106688288.

94
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,119
What are you doing?

95
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
Text two people's names to that number,

96
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,279
and it'll tell you their match percentage.

97
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,700
99 percent matched.

98
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,880
Look, look!

99
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
Even God thinks

100
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,640
I am destined to be with Guo Xiaorou.

101
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,760
Mom.

102
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,239
Su Yu, come and have some fruit.

103
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,000
Ma'am, you don't have to be so polite.

104
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,880
Shouldn't you be doing your homework right now?

105
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,159
But he's not doing his either
but playing on the computer, is he?

106
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,799
He's the top student in school.

107
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,119
He can play however he wants.

108
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,119
What rank did you get?

109
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,160
What have you got to say for yourself?

110
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,920
It's okay. Su Yu, take your time.

111
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,359
I'm just going to accept a friend request.

112
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,799
No rush. Let's eat together before you leave.

113
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,279
What kind of silly screen name is that?

114
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,136
Who is it?

115
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:22,688
It's nothing.

116
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,200
I saw you viewing my Qzone.

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
You still miss me, don't you?

118
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,339
Why don't you say anything?

119
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:13,599
What are you avoiding?

120
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,719
The farthest distance in the world

121
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,840
isn't the one between life and death.

122
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,119
Leaves, evening, ribbons.

123
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,840
Ye Wanying.

124
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,440
Didn't expect you to be such a romantic.

125
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,080
Let's go.

126
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,280
This place is fun.

127
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,392
There's a toy store here.

128
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,160
Look at this doll.

129
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,300
I don't like Barbie dolls.

130
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,400
What do you like then?

131
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,479
I like guns.

132
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,559
A little girl actually likes guns.

133
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,880
Because I want to be a police officer
when I grow up.

134
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
Why?

135
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,559
So I can see my dad earlier.

136
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,280
She actually knows everything.

137
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,599
Take a look. Is there anything you like?

138
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,039
Wrap up all the guns.

139
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,359
No, don't wrap. I don't want them.

140
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,640
What's wrong? Don't you like guns the most?

141
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,599
She doesn't want you to spend so much money.

142
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,736
She's just being thrifty.

143
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,000
It's okay. It's not much money.

144
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,719
No, I don't want them.

145
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,259
Alright, just wrap one then.

146
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,260
Okay.

147
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,799
- This one?
- Okay.

148
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,479
Mr. Su, look.

149
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,679
Wu Bi bought me this gun.

150
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,240
So nice.

151
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,659
Duo

152
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,559
doesn't love fancy dresses but loves weapons.

153
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,000
Wu Bi, you don't have to spend money on her.

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,088
It's okay, Mr. Su.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,320
The food is ready.

156
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,260
Duo, put the gun down.

157
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,039
Su Yu, time for dinner.

158
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,180
Come on, come on.

159
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,480
Fried stuffed sausage.

160
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,720
This is great.

161
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,479
Sit down.

162
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,880
Come and eat. Give it a try.

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,520
Here, Wu Bi.

164
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,780
- Thank you, Mr. Su.
- Have some sausage.

165
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,419
Su Yu, you eat too.

166
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,608
Yu.

167
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,440
Duo, here you are.

168
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,559
Duo wants to eat meat.

169
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,672
Give it a taste.

170
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,160
It's delicious.

171
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,256
Really?

172
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,459
Authentic. It reminds me
of the dish of Longfu Temple.

173
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,280
- You like it, right?
- It's really good.

174
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,479
I know you love it. Go ahead and eat.

175
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,679
This doesn't seem like a domestic number.

176
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:19,619
Hello.

177
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,020
Mr. Su, hello. I want to talk to Su Yu.

178
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,104
Su Yu?

179
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,184
A girl wants to talk to you.

180
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,360
This one.

181
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,039
How does she even know my dad's phone number?

182
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,239
Peanuts, stuffed sausage, all your favorites.

183
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,904
Why did you hang up?

184
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,568
It's a harassing call.

185
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:48,039
Clearly…

186
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,880
Dad, let me have a drink with you.

187
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,119
Mr. Su, I'll have a drink with you too.

188
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,552
Come on.

189
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,536
Duo, eat.

190
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,920
You finished it in one gulp.

191
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,240
Because I'm happy.

192
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,719
Let me pour you another drink.

193
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,760
Alright.

194
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:07,500
Thanks.

195
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,576
Alright.

196
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:09,760
This is a bit full, huh?

197
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,840
Tell me.

198
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,479
H-H-How is this made?

199
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,400
Don't care about it. Just eat.

200
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,320
I already ate a lot.

201
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,459
You need to dip it in this.

202
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,039
Right. I forgot.

203
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,100
How did you make this? It's so authentic.

204
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,239
This? It's a secret.

205
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,904
A secret, huh?

206
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,200
Where did my drink go?

207
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,320
I just…

208
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,080
Duo. Look at her little face.

209
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,039
Duo, did you drink it?

210
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,799
My little rascal, you drank alcohol?

211
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,479
D-D-Doesn't it burn your tongue? You girl!

212
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,719
Why are you lying on my bed?

213
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,239
I'm tired.

214
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,239
Go to your own house.

215
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,504
I can't walk anymore.

216
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,020
Let him stay here.

217
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,500
It's so late, and he lives far away.

218
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,159
Isn't their house nearby?

219
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,680
Yes, it's nearby.

220
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,599
But I called his dad.

221
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,000
His dad said the door had been locked.

222
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,919
What's up?

223
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,840
I can't sleep. Let's chat.

224
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
What's there to chat about?

225
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,159
Who is the person

226
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,800
who called your dad

227
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,936
today?

228
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,440
Why are you so nosy?

229
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,719
Ye Wanying.

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
How do you know her?

231
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,700
Don't care about it.

232
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,799
Just tell me if it's her.

233
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,599
I don't know. I didn't answer the call.

234
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,039
Were you two together?

235
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,344
No.

236
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Then do you like her?

237
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,919
What's the point if I do?

238
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,479
What do you mean?

239
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,840
It means she doesn't like you?

240
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,599
She likes me.

241
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,039
Then why didn't you two end up together?

242
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,799
Don't say
it was because of studies or anything.

243
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,060
With the time you spend sleeping,

244
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,840
you could have had several relationships.

245
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,119
I'm not good enough.

246
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,728
Put her on the bed.

247
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,340
Duo, time for bed.

248
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,479
Come on, let go.

249
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Dad.

250
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,679
Look at her. She's so drunk
that she doesn't recognize people.

251
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,960
Duo, let go.

252
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,560
Duo.

253
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,839
I'll stay with her a bit longer.

254
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,199
Dad.

255
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,000
After she went abroad,

256
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,199
I regretted it a lot.

257
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,280
I regretted always avoiding and refusing her.

258
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,079
But when she texted me,

259
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,128
I chickened out.

260
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,959
I didn't dare reply even a single word.

261
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,359
Is the difference in family background

262
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,359
really that important

263
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,800
to you?

264
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,640
You know my family's situation, right?

265
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,384
I do.

266
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,479
Your mom passed away long ago,

267
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,719
and your dad raised you alone.

268
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,776
Who said that?

269
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:11,488
My dad said it.

270
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,079
Your dad told you my mom passed away?

271
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,720
Maybe even your dad doesn't know

272
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
about my mom's existence.

273
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,800
My mom didn't pass away.

274
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,040
She just abandoned my dad and me

275
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,040
for money.

276
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,560
Now she's remarried

277
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
to a rich man.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,048
Do you know?

279
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,239
Over the past ten years,

280
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,479
I've met her less than five times.

281
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,880
Every time she talks, it's all about money.

282
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,800
The word "poor" is like a thorn

283
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,880
deeply embedded in my heart.

284
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,000
So you

285
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,359
won't be friends with people

286
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,680
from well-off families anymore?

287
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,448
Maybe not.

288
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
I haven't encountered any.

289
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
We probably aren't from the same world.

290
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,640
Sir, have you eaten?

291
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,880
I just finished. How about you?

292
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,039
I'm going to eat soon.

293
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,740
Last night, my husband went to the outhouse.

294
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,560
Guess what he saw?

295
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,660
What did he see?

296
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,680
He saw Su

297
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,140
coming out of Ms. Li's house!

298
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,680
Keep it down.

299
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,839
Coming out of a widow's house
in the middle of the night?

300
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,160
Are you sure he didn't see it wrong?

301
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,820
You didn't notice them being so close usually?

302
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,839
No, I didn't. Did you? Did you?

303
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,500
Why did you pry my door open?

304
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,779
Breaking into someone's house

305
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:00,920
is illegal.

306
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,719
A son telling his father about illegality?

307
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,560
I came here last night.

308
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,439
I knocked on the door, but no one answered.

309
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,599
I called, but no one picked up.

310
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,120
I thought something happened to you,

311
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,359
so I asked someone to pry the door open.

312
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,160
I waited for you here all night.

313
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:23,968
Tell me.

314
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,272
Where were you last night?

315
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,056
Why do you care where I went?

316
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:31,424
You…

317
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,839
Fine, go pack up your things

318
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,240
and come home with me today.

319
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,839
I won't hold your past against you.

320
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm not going back with you.

321
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,880
You're quite enjoying
living outside too much, huh?

322
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,800
Or what? You think
I'm still the same as before?

323
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,119
Hanging out for a few days and then going back?

324
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:58,640
I never planned
to go back to your home this time.

325
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
You…

326
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
I warn you.

327
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,760
You can't beat me anymore.

328
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,060
If you use violence against me again,

329
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,760
don't blame me for not being polite.

330
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,239
You think you're cool like this?

331
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,640
Everything you eat and live on
comes from my money,

332
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,760
and you've got some attitude!

333
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Fine, starting today,

334
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,640
I won't give you a penny.

335
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,079
Let's see how long you can last outside.

336
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,400
So you

337
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,260
won't be friends with people

338
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,408
from well-off families anymore?

339
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:46,760
I haven't encountered any.

340
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,280
We probably aren't from the same world.

341
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,060
My allowance will not be provided.

342
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,640
Doesn't that make me poor?

343
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
Hello,

344
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,720
real estate agent?

345
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,400
I rented a house from you last time.

346
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,936
I want to sublet it.

347
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,439
Hop on. I'll take you to school.

348
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,800
Why don't you get on my bike
instead of walking?

349
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,880
The school isn't far. Why should I get on?

350
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,439
I'm afraid if those thugs come after us,

351
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,592
you can't outrun them.

352
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,139
Those punks haven't shown up

353
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,280
since you took care of them last time.

354
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,599
That's not certain. Are you getting on or not?

355
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,959
If you don't get on, I'll hit you!

356
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
You're sick.

357
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,000
Xiaorou, what are you doing?

358
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,960
She's making a gift
for the guy she has a crush on.

359
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,800
Isn't she saying this on purpose to me?

360
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,920
Xiaorou, how many can you make
during one break?

361
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,000
At most five or six.

362
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,400
Five or six?

363
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,400
So how long will it take you

364
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,660
to fill this up?

365
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,299
It has taken over a month.

366
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,680
Last night, I was even doing it until midnight.

367
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,760
Over a month ago?

368
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,079
Wasn't that when her attitude
towards me started to change?

369
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,560
Xiaorou, actually,

370
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,119
I think it's enough.

371
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,820
If that boy

372
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,140
sees you like this,

373
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,660
he'll feel bad, right?

374
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,000
No.

375
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,520
I must make 999

376
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,439
and give them to him on Christmas.

377
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,520
You are really romantic.

378
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,560
Okay.

379
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,599
Let's do a simple sentence exercise.

380
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,240
He is an iron man.

381
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,439
Change it to a tag question.

382
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,176
Who can answer?

383
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,336
Liu Xi.

384
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,520
Is he an iron man?

385
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,880
That's an interrogative sentence,
not a tag question.

386
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,600
Le, your turn.

387
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,640
He is not an iron man.

388
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,959
That's a negative sentence.

389
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,160
You're sophomores,
and you still can't do this simple exercise?

390
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,479
Mao Chong, you try.

391
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,079
Iron guy, is he human?

392
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,272
Sit down.

393
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,304
Have you tried riding a bike backward?

394
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,800
How do I ride backward?

395
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,920
I hold the handlebars,
and you face me while pedaling backward.

396
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,439
Boring.

397
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,040
Give it a try. It's fun.

398
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:18,848
Come on.

399
00:27:20,032 --> 00:27:21,088
Get on.

400
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,040
Face me.

401
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:36,365
♫ You said you would ♫

402
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:39,584
♫ Protect me ♫

403
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,584
♫ And no matter how dangerous ♫

404
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:46,304
♫ You wouldn't leave ♫

405
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,400

406
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,066
♫ You made to me ♫

407
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,296
♫ You won't leave me behind ♫

408
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:04,800
♫ Thank you
for accompanying me on this journey ♫

409
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,263
♫ And trying everything with me ♫

410
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:11,296
♫ Good or bad, it doesn't matter ♫

411
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:15,392
♫ As long as we're by each other's side ♫

412
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:18,880
♫ Thank you for never holding back ♫

413
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,356
♫ Even if it means giving your all to me ♫

414
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:25,696
♫ You've already done enough ♫

415
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:30,464
♫ This time, let me be the one to guard ♫

416
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,719
Who are you? Riding a bike on campus.

417
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,880
Stop! Which class are you from?

418
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,239
Madam, is the food not tasty?

419
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,680
I just don't have an appetite.

420
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,079
Should I heat it up again?

421
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,256
No need.

422
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,959
When eating alone,

423
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,160
even the best food

424
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,680
tastes bland.

425
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,959
Why don't you answer my call?

426
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:02,626
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

427
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,386
♫ You're such a beautiful flower ♫

428
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:16,258
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

429
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:22,946
♫ You're the summer I can't bear to part with ♫

430
00:31:25,972 --> 00:31:30,104
♫ You always have so many ideas ♫

431
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:37,122
♫ Occasionally, you're not so obedient ♫

432
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:43,906
♫ But it's you who bring the worries ♫

433
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:51,093
♫ That make a complete family ♫

434
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,722
