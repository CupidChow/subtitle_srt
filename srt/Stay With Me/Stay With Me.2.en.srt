00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,914
♫ Do we have to look the same ♫

3
00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:22,205
♫ To be called a family? ♫

4
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:30,626
♫ Did we agree
we would stay together forever? ♫

5
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:36,626
♫ No matter what, it will be true ♫

6
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,354
♫ Did we agree
we would have endless stories? ♫

7
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,890
♫ About you ♫

8
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:53,654
♫ About our family ♫

9
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,610
♫ I'll wait here foolishly for you ♫

10
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,010
♫ No matter if a sudden storm comes ♫

11
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,938
♫ I'll have everything ready here ♫

12
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:10,206
♫ Just waiting for your word ♫

13
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:14,234
♫ I'll guard you silently here ♫

14
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:17,502
♫ I fear even my breath will disturb you ♫

15
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:23,330
♫ Maybe this is the meaning of family ♫

16
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,762
♫ How beautiful ♫

(Episode Two)

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,879
Although it's just a pop quiz,

20
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,040
I hope everyone takes it seriously.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,000
Those who cheat, you're just smart alecks.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,060
You're not deceiving others

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,380
but fooling yourselves.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,080
Hand it over.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Wake up.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,480
Wake up. We have a test.

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,059
Why do you have to cover it so tightlywhen snoozing?

28
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,579
Later, the class representative
will distribute the test papers.

29
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,499
You will grade each other's papers.

30
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,379
Alright, class is over.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,719
Go find Su Yu's paper for me.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,960
Are you going or not?

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,680
I'm going. I'm going.

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,104
Go.

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,032
Go.

36
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:15,720
You'll see.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,759
Let me mark some
of your multiple-choice answers as wrong.

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,388
What are you looking at?

39
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,440
Class begins. Stand up.

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,159
Good morning.

41
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,604
Please sit.

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,459
The results of yesterday's pop quiz are out.

43
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,879
First of all, I want to praise everyone.

44
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,260
Each student's grading is meticulous.

45
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,279
However, the results are still not ideal.

46
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,320
Only two students scored above 140 points.

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,240
Only one got a perfect score, Su Yu.

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,760
You all know this without me saying it.

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,440
Class representative,
please distribute the test papers.

50
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,679
I will start discussing the problems soon.

51
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,939
Let O be the midpoint.

52
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,940
Connect DB.

53
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,139
Then connect OM.

54
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,440
And finally, we conclude that OD equals OM.

55
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,439
Alright, class is over. Stand up.

56
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,560
Goodbye.

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,379
Tell me, did you tell the teacher?

58
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,839
N-N-No, I really didn't.

59
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,240
If I snitched, I-I-I'd be a rat.

60
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,760
Then how come the answers
that I marked as wrong get marked as correct?

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,559
Because he can't be wrong.

62
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,359
Why?

63
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,279
Because from his first year
of high school until now,

64
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,839
he's always got full marks in all subjects,

65
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,459
never getting a single point deducted.

66
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,899
There was one time
when he got a question wrong.

67
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,939
However, the result was…
- What was the result?

68
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,060
The result was that the answer key
was printed incorrectly.

69
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,779
But he sleeps all the time.

70
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:18,359
He sleeps because he knows everything already.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,480
I have seen your test paper

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,299
and know some student
deliberately scored your answers as wrong.

73
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:33,399
I have already corrected them for you.

74
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,432
Thank you.

75
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:36,239
You've been the top student
in the school for years.

76
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,320
It's inevitable
that some students will be jealous of you.

77
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,220
Don't take it to heart.

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,064
I got it.

79
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:05,480
Su Yu, time to have dinner. Come on.

80
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,356
Su.

81
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,320
Y-Y-You guys are here!

82
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,720
We brought some buns.

83
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,359
You don't have to be so polite.

84
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:16,108
Mrs. Zhou, you brought delicious food again.
- Go wash your hands.

85
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,220
I want to wash my hands with him.

86
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,232
Alright.

87
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:21,440
Then I'll go get some bowls and chopsticks.

88
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,500
Who knows who my daughter takes after?

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,640
A girl being so naughty all day long.

90
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,400
The naughtier she is, the less likely
she'll be bullied in the future.

91
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,244
That's right.

92
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,760
I bought a pair of shoes for Su Yu.

93
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,280
Let him try them on later to see if they fit.

94
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,000
We can't accept these.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,399
It's already nice of you
to bring food to my child.

96
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,059
We can't accept these from you.

97
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:11,060
You…You pick up Duo for me every day.

98
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,639
You save much time for me.

99
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,600
Every now and then, you also help me with my stall.

100
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,139
For us, a girl and a single mother,

101
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,320
if it weren't for you, we wouldn't even have a stall.

102
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,980
It's no big deal.

103
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,939
It's just a breeze to do it
on my way to and from work.

104
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,660
This is for the kid.

105
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,640
It's up to him whether to accept it or not.

106
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm telling you,
boys need to be raised frugally, not spoiled.

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,200
It's true.

108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
But hasn't it gone a little too far?

109
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,820
Look at Su Yu's shoes.

110
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,519
They were bought two years ago, right?

111
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,760
The glue on the sole
has come apart several times.

112
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,980
They can't be worn anymore.

113
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,820
He doesn't care as long as he has something to wear.

114
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,679
Don't you understand?

115
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,260
I'm telling you, Su Yu is in his adolescence.

116
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,520
Boys at this age care
about their images the most.

117
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,460
Alright.

118
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,280
If I don't accept it, you might get mad at me.

119
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,620
Right, take it, and let him try it on.

120
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,579
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

121
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,580
Mr. Su.

122
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,399
Mr. Su,

123
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,020
these are apples from my aunt's orchard.

124
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,640
My mom asked me to send some to you.

125
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,260
These apples look pretty good.

126
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,959
Your mom always thinks of us when she has something good.

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,200
Let me look at you.

128
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Having a capable mom makes a difference.

129
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,100
These clothes are washed so bright and clean.

130
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,080
Mr. Su, this is the new school uniform.

131
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,760
I haven't even washed it yet.

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,299
Your school issued new uniforms?

133
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:48,080
Yes, everyone got them. Didn't you know?

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
Why didn't I see Su Yu bring one home?

135
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,940
Maybe he didn't order one. Because it's voluntary.

136
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,999
Whoever pays gets one.

137
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
Where's Su Yu? He left?

138
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,520
Yes, he left early.

139
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,999
Alright, I'm leaving too.

140
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,584
- Goodbye, Mr. Su.
- Goodbye.

141
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,299
I'm telling you, Su Yu is in his adolescence.

142
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,760
Boys at this age care
about their images the most.

143
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,980
Everyone's wearing new ones.

144
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,560
Slow down.

145
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,080
You are blind or something?

146
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,059
Sorry, sorry.

147
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,380
Duo, are you alright?

148
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,780
Chill out, Mr. Su.

149
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm sorry.
- Watch your riding.

150
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:22,599
Wait for me.

151
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,416
You got new shoes?

152
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,800
Pass the ball.
- Pass to whom?

153
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,228
Over here.
- Here.

154
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:45,216
So arrogant.

155
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Defend, defend, over here.

156
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,140
Come one, pass the ball.

157
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,024
Block him.
- Give it to me.

158
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:02,412
Cover for a moment.

159
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,000
Follow up.

160
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,200
What the heck are you doing? Hurry up.

161
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,780
He's fouling.

162
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,784
Rebound.

163
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,860
What's up with your defense?

164
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,660
Come on, mark your man.

165
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,219
Get him covered.

166
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:18,719
Move in.

167
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,039
Take a break first.

168
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,060
Okay, okay.

169
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm going back to the classroom.

170
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,840
But there's still time before class. Let's play a little longer.

171
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,384
I'm tired.

172
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,824
Continue.

173
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,484
Give me some tissues.

174
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,260
I remember I had
half a pack of tissues in my drawer.

175
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,880
Where did it go?

176
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,780
Forget it.

177
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,919
Look at his face.

178
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,472
You look.

179
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,280
He doesn't know.

180
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,520
Dirty face.

181
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,616
It's all black.

182
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,760
Fine.

183
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,799
You wait and see.

184
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,760
That guy's interesting.

185
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,424
Stop sleeping. Let's go.

186
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,400
Take a walk outside.

187
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,880
My neck feels stiff.

188
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,280
You're a real piece of work.

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,700
If I don't ruin your shoes,

190
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,080
I'll admit defeat.

191
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,320
What's wrong?

192
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,960
He smeared 502 glue under my seat.

193
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
T-T-The glue is too sticky.

194
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,380
Last time it stuck to my hand and the door.

195
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,619
I had to peel off
a layer of skin to get it off.

196
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,920
You need to use a small knife for this.

197
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,000
No.

198
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,599
If you don't use it and try to force it open,
the bottom will fall apart.

199
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,400
CH2.

200
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,799
CCN.

201
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,180
COO.

202
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,359
C2H5.

203
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,940
Go to the lab and borrow some chemicals for me.

204
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,800
They won't lend them to me, will they?

205
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,880
Just tell them they're for Su Yu.

206
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:23,744
Wait a moment.

207
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,479
Oh, that's amazing.

208
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,039
This is far beyond imagination.

209
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,280
Bro, let me tell you.

210
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,180
There's a weirdo in my class.

211
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,040
My previous school

212
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,179
was filled with nothing but elites,

213
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,559
and there were plenty of good students.

214
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,320
But like now, this one…

215
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,919
What do you mean by the previous school?

216
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,920
You transferred?

217
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,096
Yeah.

218
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:01,320
How come I didn't know?

219
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,579
Your dad never mentioned it to me.

220
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:04,640
He doesn't know.

221
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,579
Where did you transfer to?

222
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:07,920
Just a regular high school.

223
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,239
Were you crazy?

224
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,200
You gave up an international school

225
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,520
to attend a regular high school.

226
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,232
What were you thinking?

227
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:16,760
My dad sent his adopted son

228
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,239
to my previous school.

229
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,780
To avoid seeing him,

230
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,299
I transferred to this school.

231
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,280
Have you lost your mind?

232
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,180
Letting others eat a banquet
while you eat scraps?

233
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,400
I'd rather eat scraps

234
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
than see that woman's son.

235
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,699
Bro, let me tell you something from the heart.

236
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,739
I feel like I can't stand living
in my house anymore.

237
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:37,840
I can't bear seeing
that woman's gross face again.

238
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,960
Why hasn't my mom come to pick me up yet?

239
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,019
Tomorrow is the weekend.

240
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,259
There must be many people
going to her stall tonight.

241
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,919
But why hasn't Mr. Su come back yet
at this late hour?

242
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,760
Who knows?

243
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,599
He's probably discussing
lottery numbers with his pals again.

244
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,700
Mr. Su has been acting strange these days.

245
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,520
He always sends me home

246
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,439
and then leaves in a hurry.

247
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,599
Let's play a game for fun.

248
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,760
What game?

249
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,640
You hold these two ends.

250
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:32,779
I'll hold this one.

251
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,640
We pull and see whose breaks first.

252
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,140
One, two, three.

253
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,280
I want to play it again!

254
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,000
Then let's pick up leaves together. Let's go.

255
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,104
My son

256
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
has been suffering
with his father since he was little.

257
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,239
He often has to endure hunger.

258
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:57,599
To be honest, every time I see good dishes,

259
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,599
I think of him

260
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,599
and can't eat at all.

261
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,760
Didn't I ask you
to send money to your son before?

262
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,320
He wouldn't take my money.

263
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,079
He doesn't even want
to acknowledge me as his mother.

264
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,359
Take it slow with matters of the heart.

265
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,199
Besides, you've been away from them
for so many years.

266
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
There needs to be a transition.

267
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,220
I don't come back home very often.

268
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,399
How about this?

269
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,600
Bring him here

270
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,640
and let him live here for a while.

271
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,960
What are you doing?

272
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,120
What am I doing?

273
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,200
Get lost!

274
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,880
Then you get lost.

275
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,460
Get as far away as you can.

276
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,599
Wu Bi, don't be angry.

277
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,060
My son won't come here.

278
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,119
Forget him!

279
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,680
Should we really?

280
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:53,000
He's got plenty of no-good buddies.

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,080
He won't be lost.

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,280
It's not the first time he's thrown a tantrum.

283
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,919
When he runs out of money,
he'll come back on his own.

284
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,000
It's not the first time? He…

285
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,776
Eat the meal.

286
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:29,568
Dad,

287
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,599
where are you going so early in the morning?

288
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,872
Yu, I had a great dream last night.

289
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
What dream?

290
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,040
I dreamt of the winning lottery numbers.

291
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,700
Really, not a single number off.

292
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,719
I wrote them all down.

293
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,439
Trust me.

294
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,479
I read in the newspaper a few days ago

295
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,680
there was an old man in Shanxi

296
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,700
who dreamt of a set of lottery numbers.

297
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,760
He wrote them down
but had no money to buy a ticket.

298
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,119
Guess what?

299
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,000
He won the jackpot!

300
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,560
The winning numbers
were exactly the same as he had dreamt.

301
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,608
So…

302
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:08,560
Dad, that's all fake news.

303
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,920
It's just a marketing strategy.

304
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,680
How could the newspaper publish fake news?

305
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,339
The note was even posted.

306
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,359
That old man cried so miserably.

307
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,860
Imagine if this happened to our family.

308
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,839
Five million, gone in a flash.

309
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,120
Then what a regret it would be.

310
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,660
Yeah.

311
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,359
So you're up early just to buy lottery tickets?

312
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,660
That's right.

313
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,840
According to the dream,

314
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,520
I must arrive at the lottery station

315
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,959
at 8:08 a.m. sharp today.

316
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,040
I'm running out of time.
I can't talk to you anymore.

317
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,200
I've got to go.

318
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,419
Young man, I'm sorry.

319
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:06,580
Bicycles are not allowed in your neighborhood.

320
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,680
So I'm a bit late.

321
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,680
It's okay. Start moving now.

322
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,720
Okay.

323
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,136
Put it there.

324
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:30,000
Move it in a bit more.

325
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
Here?

326
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,224
Okay.

327
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,660
Sir, are you okay?

328
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm fine. My back just isn't great.

329
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,319
If your back isn't good, why are you a mover?

330
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,880
I just want to get my son
a new school uniform.

331
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:14,976
Sir,

332
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,864
sit down and have a drink.

333
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,040
No, no.

334
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Don't be polite. Come sit down.

335
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,439
I'm all dirty from the dirt.

336
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,599
- It's okay.
- No, no.

337
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,656
Sit, sit.

338
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,024
I'll get you some water.

339
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,239
This kid…

340
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,719
My son is about your age.

341
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,616
Not to brag,

342
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,460
but if he comes in second,

343
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,839
no one will come in first.

344
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,080
Thank you, sir.

345
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,360
It's already dark.

346
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,479
How did I talk for so long?

347
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,180
I'm a chatterbox.

348
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,060
I can't stop talking when I'm idle, you know?

349
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,380
I quite like listening to it.

350
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,488
Really?

351
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,399
Kids your age,

352
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,700
who like to listen to all this chatter?

353
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,960
My son

354
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,319
complains that I'm too talkative all day.

355
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,000
I envy your son.

356
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,288
Don't envy him.

357
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,760
He's actually quite pitiful.

358
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,359
His mother has been gone since he was little.

359
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,920
It's just the two of us.

360
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,079
Sometimes,

361
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,500
I'd rather he not be so mature.

362
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,439
I'd rather he ask me for this and that.

363
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,800
Alright, it's getting late.

364
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,479
I'd better go.

365
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,199
If you are in need, just tell me.

366
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,416
Sir,

367
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,480
you keep the extra.

368
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,640
That won't do.

369
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,680
We agreed on 30, so it's 30.

370
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,119
I may be poor, but I earn money with my skills.

371
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:49,359
You really don't need to.

372
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,340
No, no. Take it.

373
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,539
If you don't take it,

374
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:53,760
you're insulting me.

375
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:57,888
Sir,

376
00:24:57,888 --> 00:25:00,299
can you come again tomorrow
to help me organize?

377
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,400
Tomorrow? Okay, I'm off tomorrow anyway.

378
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,159
Alright, see you tomorrow.

379
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,839
Alright, that's it.

380
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,432
Dad,

381
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:27,539
are you back?

382
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm back.

383
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:33,740
What's up, Yu?

384
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,880
Did you win?

385
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,719
The draw isn't today.

386
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,800
It's tomorrow.

387
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:40,480
Let's see.

388
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,616
Alright.

389
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,839
How could your parents let you handle

390
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,000
such a big move by yourself?

391
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Where are they?

392
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,440
I'm not moving.

393
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
I'm running away from home.

394
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,040
Kid, are you joking with me?

395
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,199
More precisely,

396
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,560
I'm living on my own.

397
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,380
You're so young. Living on your own?

398
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,820
If your parents knew,

399
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,079
they'd be so worried.

400
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,680
My mom

401
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:50,752
has passed away.

402
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,480
Kid, I didn't mean any harm with my words.

403
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,800
Don't take it to heart.

404
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,816
As for my dad,

405
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,160
not everyone is fit to be a father.

406
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,359
Kid, let me tell you something.

407
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,040
There isn't a father in this world

408
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,359
who doesn't love his own child.

409
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,840
Sir, let me tell you about my family.

410
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,920
Alright.

411
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,288
You sit.

412
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,140
Was he talking about this place?

413
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,959
I don't know. It looks about right.

414
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,199
No one to ask.

415
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,160
I'll ask later.

416
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,640
Kid, let me ask you something.

417
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,239
Do you know Ms. Zhao Ruihua?

418
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
She is our head teacher.

419
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,640
Do you know where she lives?

420
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,380
Just across the street.

421
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,440
Not far from here.

422
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
Can you take us to find her?

423
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,864
No problem.

424
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:58,200
Okay, get in the car.

425
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,119
Let's go. Come.

426
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,400
I won't get in your car.

427
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,500
How are you going to lead us to find her?

428
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,719
You can drive slowly. I'll run ahead.

429
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,839
That's tiring. Just get in the car.

430
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,904
Exactly.

431
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,520
You drive. I can run.

432
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,328
Well.

433
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:16,416
Alright.

434
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,520
Follow me.

435
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:29,079
Silly Li Duo leads the car running.

436
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,800
You guys came to visit me?

437
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,340
Ms. Zhao, they're here for you.

438
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,359
Ms. Zhao, ever since you moved,

439
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,840
we haven't had a chance to visit you.

440
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,520
We didn't deceive you, did we?

441
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,919
We're not bad people.

442
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,880
It's Duo who led you here, right?

443
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Yes. She's one of your students, right?

444
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,199
Yeah. Li Duo.

445
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:26,119
No wonder this kid is so sharp.

446
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,680
She is taught by you!

447
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:35,760
We talked about my son yesterday.

448
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,780
I didn't expect you to have it tough too.

449
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,300
At such a young age,

450
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,920
you've been through so much.

451
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,420
But I am

452
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,320
just a mover.

453
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,199
I haven't achieved much in my life

454
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,160
and can't give you any life advice.

455
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,272
No, sir.

456
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:55,872
You make me feel

457
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,080
very warm.

458
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,608
Child,

459
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,720
do you know?

460
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,240
Every parent in this world

461
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,119
has a different way of expressing love.

462
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,420
You can't see your dad

463
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,880
often in a year,

464
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,199
but isn't he the one who provides you

465
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,319
with such a big house?

466
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,680
When you grow up,

467
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:23,620
you'll know what all his efforts, struggles,

468
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,040
and endeavors are for.

469
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,040
My son can see me every day,

470
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,952
but I…

471
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:33,040
I can't even afford
a new school uniform for him.

472
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,360
As for me,

473
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,760
I've been fantasizing
about hitting the jackpot.

474
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,040
Even though I know
it's very unlikely to happen,

475
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,560
at least I have something
to look forward to while I'm alive.

476
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,800
I just feel sorry

477
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,479
for him.

478
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,460
If he really had another chance

479
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,280
to be reincarnated,

480
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,040
I hope he wouldn't have me as his father again.

481
