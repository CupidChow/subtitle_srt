(Episode Three)

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,480
I hope he wouldn't have me as his father again.

19
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,008
Sir,

20
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,240
can I have your phone number?

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,080
Okay, I'll enter it for you.

22
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:21,472
These--

23
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:24,519
Sir, I know you wouldn't take
more money than promised.

24
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,800
Take these back for your son to eat.

25
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:28,640
No, these--

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,760
Sir, don't overthink it.

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
These are not some rare food.

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,520
Two of my classmates
were supposed to come to visit me,

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,740
but they didn't show up finally.

30
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,300
And I can't eat them all by myself.

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,479
I don't want them to go to waste.

32
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,559
For my son,

33
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,059
these are a rare treat.

34
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,200
Although he can see them on the street,

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,040
he's never had any of them

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,160
in his life.

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,180
Please take them back.

38
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,919
Alright, let me thank you on behalf of my son.

39
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,199
Don't be so polite.

40
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,980
Dad, two family buckets.

41
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,280
Over 100 yuan.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,440
You really won!

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,600
Of course, I won a fourth-place prize.

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
See, I told you dreams were useful.

45
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,119
Don't just think about yourself.

46
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,380
Go call Duo here.

47
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,080
Alright, I'll call Han Bokuang here too.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,119
Duo, don't just drink.

49
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,559
Eat. Come on, eat.

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,559
You two eat slowly. Don't choke.

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,392
Let me tell you,

52
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:17,799
our class recently got a new exchange student

53
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,840
from Taiwan.

54
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,160
She's very pretty,

55
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,640
and her voice is super cute.

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,119
Her accent

57
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,480
makes my whole body feel like jelly.

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,239
She's way much gentler

59
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,600
than Beijing girls.

60
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,140
Most importantly,

61
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,079
I feel like she's interested in me.

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
How do you know?

63
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,440
She's always picking on me.

64
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,200
Picking on you means she's interested in you?

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,119
Isn't that how boys

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,980
show interest in girls?

67
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,600
That's what boys do to girls.

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,079
Girls do different things to boys.

69
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,479
How do you know?

70
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:00,799
You've never been in a relationship.

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,760
Your mind is filled with math problems.

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,160
Let's go to KFC tonight.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,440
I just had it last night.

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,568
What's the next class?

75
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:27,616
Chemistry.

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
Isn't today a day off from chemistry?

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,180
It was rescheduled.

78
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,600
It was written on the blackboard yesterday,
didn't you see?

79
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,920
I had to use the restroom.
I didn't have time to look.

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,420
What should I do?
I didn't bring my book and exercise book.

81
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,860
Why don't we share one?

82
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,819
It's fine if you don't have one,

83
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,640
but if it's me, I'd be dead.

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,559
You know very well
how mean our chemistry teacher is.

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,240
Why don't you borrow one from class four?

86
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,620
I just came to our class this year
as an exchange student.

87
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,799
I don't know anyone in the next class.

88
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,100
I introduced you to my friend last time.

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,144
Don't you remember?

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,880
That guy. What's his name? Bokuang.

91
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,340
Han Bokuang.

92
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,040
Right, I'm going.

93
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:16,608
Hey, excuse me.

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,000
Can you ask Han Bokuang to come out for me?

95
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,279
What are you looking at?

96
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,720
Am I ugly?

97
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,780
What? What are you talking about?

98
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,799
Can you say it again, please?

99
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,640
Can you help me

100
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,720
get Han Bokuang out?

101
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,239
What do you want with him?

102
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,856
Forget it. Next one.

103
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,440
Hey, could you ask Han Bokuang to come out?

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,519
- Okay.
- Thanks.

105
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,500
Hello, my name is Guo Xiaorou.

106
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,119
Blood type O, Aries.

107
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,399
I don't like cats.
I don't eat spicy food. What about you?

108
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,399
Why are you telling me those?

109
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,519
You go ahead, alright? Bye.

110
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,479
Sir, the International Trade Apartments.

111
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,496
Get in.

112
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,600
Isn't that the old man?

113
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
His son goes to the same school as me?

114
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,079
Su Yu.

115
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,420
Dad, why are you here?

116
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,880
I heard the weather report said it would rain,

117
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,940
and you didn't bring an umbrella.

118
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,520
Didn't you help Ms. Zhou pack up her stall?

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll pick you up first,

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,559
and then we'll go help her together.

121
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,959
- Let's go then.
- Let's go.

122
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
Let's go.

123
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,880
If your back isn't good, why are you a mover?

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,000
I just want to get my son a new school uniform.

125
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,640
Sir, I know you wouldn't take
more money than promised.

126
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,399
Take these back for your son to eat.

127
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,600
Let's go to KFC tonight.

128
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,520
I just had it last night.

129
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,520
It can't be such a coincidence.

130
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,679
I must have mistaken him for someone else.

131
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,008
Hello?

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,024
Hello?

133
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,136
Hello?

134
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,696
Hello?

135
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,100
Don't envy him.

136
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,640
He's actually quite pitiful.

137
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,819
His mother has been gone since he was little.

138
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,380
It's just the two of us.

139
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,592
Sometimes,

140
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,040
I'd rather he not be so mature.

141
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,280
I'd rather he ask me for this and that.

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,239
What's this smell?

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,559
Sorry, I didn't walk carefully.

144
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,520
My gosh, so much oil.
How should this be washed off?

145
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,359
Don't push it too far.

146
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,940
Don't be angry.

147
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,960
I'll return you a brand new one.

148
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,399
He'll be thrilled

149
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,320
to get it later.

150
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,440
What do you want to do?

151
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,960
Isn't it obvious?

152
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,559
We don't have money for drinks.

153
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,880
Either hand over your money or get hit.

154
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,359
Then just smash my head directly.

155
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:57,220
We ran into a tough one today.

156
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,240
What?

157
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,119
You don't care about your head
or you don't want to go to school anymore?

158
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,080
What can I do if I don't have money?

159
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,300
No money? Go home and get some.

160
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,559
We'll be waiting here.

161
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
If you don't come back,

162
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,559
we'll harass you every day.

163
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,960
These three punks are really silly, huh?

164
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,479
Targeting the poorest one to rob.

165
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,679
Why don't you just rob my dad directly?

166
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,760
At most, he has two yuan in his pocket.

167
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,160
Instead of wasting it,

168
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,400
he might as well give it to you.

169
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,000
You've got some nerve, huh?

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,760
Do you think I won't fight?

171
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,440
Don't bother talking to him. Just do it.

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,039
You like meddling, huh?

173
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:46,628
♫ I never thought about what would be
at the end of the road ♫

174
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,440
♫ What it would be like ♫

175
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:53,335

178

♫ To just keep silent at this moment ♫

179
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,876
♫ Let the fire burn in our hearts ♫

180
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:12,192

Leave.

203
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,448
Thank you.

204
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,400
Why are you following me?

205
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,359
Why did you help me?

206
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,359
I just can't stand
to see my classmates being bullied.

207
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,840
I'll go buy you some band-aids.

208
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,220
Don't buy me band-aids.

209
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,520
Just treat me to a meal.

210
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't have money.

211
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,960
You're quite confident despite being broke.

212
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,440
Alright, I mean

213
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
you can invite me to your house for dinner.

214
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,720
You can't go to my house.

215
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,848
Why not?

216
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,119
Anyway, you just can't.

217
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,640
Alright, I won't go.

218
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,384
You don't have to walk me.

219
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,800
We've walked so far. The bullies are long gone.

220
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,448
You can go back.

221
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,479
It's fine. My house is on the same route.

222
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,479
I'm back!

223
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,872
Dad, you're back.

224
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,280
Aren't you that…?

225
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,199
You two are classmates, huh?

226
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,820
What a coincidence, right?

227
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,239
Dad, how do you know him?

228
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,239
Well.

229
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,980
I know his dad.

230
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,280
His dad is my close friend.

231
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
Right, his close friend.

232
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,360
How could I not know him?

233
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,640
Little brat, you've grown so tall.

234
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,280
Since you're here,
have dinner with us before leaving.

235
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Alright.

236
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,620
Dad, have you gone mad?

237
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,560
What do we have at home for him to eat?

238
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,299
I'll go buy groceries right now, won't I?

239
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,400
Forget it.

240
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,540
With your cooking,

241
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,319
he'll definitely embarrass me
when he goes back to class.

242
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,376
That's not a problem.

243
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,760
I'll call Ms. Zhou right away
to help out, okay?

244
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,820
Let's see.

245
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,984
It's fine.

246
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,280
Look at this. Is it fun?

247
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,176
What is this?

248
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,580
Is this fun?

249
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,664
Yes.

250
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:08,439
Let me draw one for you.

251
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,140
How about it?

252
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,168
Good.

253
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,152
Does it look nice like this?

254
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,260
Yes.

255
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,456
You paint the nose.

256
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
What did you draw?

257
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
I drew you.

258
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:33,792
Child,

259
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,160
thank you for not exposing my secret.

260
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,520
Sir, don't tell him

261
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,280
about my situation either.

262
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,959
Just treat me like the good son of your buddy.

263
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,880
Deal, the son of my close friend.

264
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,304
Let's go.

265
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,816
Come on.

266
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,599
Come on. Dinner's ready!

267
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,824
Come on.

268
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:10,660
Wu Bi,

269
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,560
try the fish I made.

270
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,568
Thank you.

271
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,480
Is it good?

272
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,020
Yeah, it's yummy.

273
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,339
We didn't make much.

274
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,680
It's just home-cooked food.

275
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,400
I don't know if it is to your taste.

276
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,780
Mom, I wrote a poem today.

277
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,560
You can write poems?

278
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,239
Duo, you can write poems.

279
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,520
Come on. Recite it for everyone.

280
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:37,359
By the river, there's a cow

281
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,440
running into the water.

282
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,319
What has it become now?

283
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,880
What?

284
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,079
It's become

285
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,119
a water buffalo.

286
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,959
That's really clever.

287
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,280
Why aren't you eating? Not to your taste?

288
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
N-N-Not at all, sir.

289
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,580
What sir?

290
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,800
She calls my dad Mr. Su.

291
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,464
Don't call him sir anymore.

292
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:03,660
Mr. Su,

293
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,520
can I come often in the future?

294
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
- Yes, you can.
- No, you can't.

295
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,520
Yes

296
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,904
or no?

297
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,000
What's wrong, Yu?

298
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,479
It's so late. Why haven't you gone to bed?

299
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,800
Dad,

300
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,439
does he know everything about our situation?

301
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,920
Why are you asking this?

302
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,680
Think about it.

303
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,180
Today, at the table, it was just the two of us,

304
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,680
Duo and Ms. Zhou.

305
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,959
He didn't find our relationship strange

306
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,199
or ask about my mom.

307
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,280
Maybe his dad told him something.

308
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,160
Dad,

309
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:12,360
are you really close friends with his dad?

310
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,359
Yeah, very close.

311
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,280
What kind of person is his dad?

312
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,264
A good person.

313
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,528
Good person.

314
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,760
Good person.

315
00:22:34,848 --> 00:22:39,296
(Haircut and shaving, eight yuan)

316
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,680
What a coincidence.

317
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:45,560
How come you're here?

318
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,279
I pass by here on my way to school.

319
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,660
Didn't I tell you yesterday?
I live in this area.

320
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,419
How come I haven't seen you before?

321
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,120
We've only known each other for a few days.

322
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,359
Besides, even if you've seen me,

323
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,456
you wouldn't remember.

324
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,839
But students who live in this area

325
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,359
are directly enrolled in our high school.

326
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,719
Why did you transfer midway?

327
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,040
Why do you have to overanalyze this?

328
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,839
It's just a minor matter,
not some kind of detective story.

329
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:10,439
Let's go to school.

330
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,552
But…

331
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,319
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

332
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,040
Who?

333
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,159
Who else could it be? Wu Bi.

334
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,199
I just saw him following closely behind you.

335
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,359
He didn't make a hole in your clothes, did he?

336
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,319
What are you talking about? We came together.

337
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,079
You came together with him?

338
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,760
Weren't you the one who hated him the most?

339
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,180
Who said I hated him?

340
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,920
The whole class knows.

341
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,380
How come…?

342
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,000
Have you forgotten how he treated you?

343
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,000
Haven't I treated him the same way?

344
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,768
We're even.

345
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:43,079
How could you change so suddenly?

346
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,980
I met three gangsters after school yesterday.

347
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,100
He helped me deal with them.

348
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,599
Him? Dealing with gangsters?

349
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,000
It's good enough
that he didn't become a gangster himself.

350
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,760
One, two, three, four.

351
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,220
Five, six, seven, eight.

352
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,380
Two, two, three, four.

353
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,040
Five, six, seven, stop.

354
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,359
Alright, disperse in place.

355
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,560
What's going on?

356
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,839
The sun rose from the west today?

357
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:00,544
Have you practiced martial arts?

358
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,560
Why do you suddenly think of asking this?

359
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,160
It was cool watching you fight those gangsters.

360
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,760
I've learned a little bit about Sanda and Judo.

361
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,040
I learned it as a boy.

362
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
So learning these

363
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,199
must have cost quite a bit of money, right?

364
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,380
No, my dad is a martial artist.

365
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,456
He taught me.

366
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,359
Why doesn't my dad have this skill?

367
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,860
Your dad has already trained you
to be number one in the whole school.

368
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,760
If you were to also achieve stunning results
in martial arts,

369
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,880
you'd set the bar pretty high
for the rest of us.

370
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:41,040
Can you teach me?

371
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,760
Then I can defend myself in the future.

372
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,920
What do you want to learn?

373
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,040
I want to learn boxing.

374
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,500
I'll teach you wrestling then.

375
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,100
Wrestling improves fighting skills
faster than boxing.

376
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Is that okay?

377
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,184
Okay.

378
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,599
Bro, why are you sitting here alone?

379
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,079
Give me.

380
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:22,239
Do you guys want to try some Taiwanese jerky?

381
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,520
Thanks.

382
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,199
You can share it together.

383
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,740
I knew she had feelings for me.

384
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,560
Or why else would she be so nice to my friend?

385
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,600
Come on, you grab me.

386
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:43,380
You'll often encounter this.

387
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,280
Others will grab you like this.

388
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
At this time, you need
to pay attention to the coordination

389
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,839
of your feet and your upper body.

390
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,479
Come on, try it all together.

391
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,719
Let go. Go.

392
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,488
♫ We pray ♫

393
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:57,009
♫ We look far away ♫

394
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:00,880
It's okay. You don't have to be so cautious.
Just throw me.

395
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,800
Alright, let's move on to the next move. Go.

396
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:08,608
♫ Maybe it's not a coincidence ♫

397
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm not that fragile.

398
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,719
I don't care about other parts of your body,

399
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,760
but your head is too precious.

400
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,119
If it gets hurt, the principal
would probably have my head on a platter!

401
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,800
I'm really fine.

402
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,384
Come on.

403
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,920
Are you ready?

404
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,952
Come on.

405
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,479
How dare he bully my childhood friend!

406
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,360
What are you doing?

407
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:45,719
Who are you?

408
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,616
Let go.

409
00:28:47,616 --> 00:28:49,239
No, no. He's my childhood friend.

410
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,848
Are you okay?

411
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:51,920
Alright.

412
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
We were just wrestling for fun.

413
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,680
Let me introduce him, Han Bokuang.

414
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,880
As your name implies.

415
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,000
They grew up together like brothers.

416
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,760
That's good. You come here.

417
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,599
What are you going to do?

418
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,520
With your demonstration, he'll learn faster.

419
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,944
You…

420
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,680
Y-Y-You…

421
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,940
Oh my god.

422
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,160
H-H-How…

423
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,640
Yu, I've prepared the sandbag for you.

424
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:40,319
Let me tell you,

425
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,820
I went quite a distance

426
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,440
to get this sand for you.

427
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,839
It's all fine sand.

428
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,439
It won't hurt your hands at all.

429
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,180
Your physical foundation is good,

430
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,540
and you learn the moves pretty quickly.

431
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,440
You're just a bit weak in strength.

432
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,479
You can do some muscle training at home.

433
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:25,312
Dad.

434
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,079
I'm going to the bathroom.

435
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,842
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

436
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:58,602
♫ You're such a beautiful flower ♫

437
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:05,474
♫ Mila, Mila ♫

438
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,162
♫ You're the summer I can't bear to part with ♫

439
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:19,320
♫ You always have so many ideas ♫

440
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:26,338
♫ Occasionally, you're not so obedient ♫

441
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,122
♫ But it's you who bring the worries ♫

442
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:40,309
♫ That make a complete family ♫

443
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,938
♫ From today, every minute and second ♫

444
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:47,778
♫ Will be the treasure of my life ♫

445
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:50,786
♫ Because with you by my side ♫

446
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:53,602
♫ Everything becomes beautiful ♫

447
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:57,602
♫ From today, every moment and instant ♫

448
00:31:57,602 --> 00:32:01,506
♫ Will be the happiest time in life ♫

449
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,754
♫ No matter where you are, home will be ♫

450
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:11,010
♫ In that place ♫

451
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:21,474
♫ In that place ♫

452
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,546
♫ In that place ♫
