(Episode 1)

18
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:00,919
- What are you running for?
- Let's go. Play basketball.

19
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,684
Wait for me.

20
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,440
Question six.
- Question six. C.

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,260
Right, right, question seven.
- Question seven. A.

22
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,980
Our answers are the same
for the seven questions. Looks like we'll make it this time.

23
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,240
Hurry up. Question eight. Question eight.

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,900
Question eight. Still C.

25
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,499
C?

26
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,360
I chose A.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,860
Which one of us is wrong?

28
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,880
It's not me.
I've calculated this question twice.

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,839
I even checked it once. I must be right

30
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,160
Choose A.
- C. I say it is C, then it is.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,264
Shall we bet?

32
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:30,159
If the answer to this question is A, then…
- Choose D.

33
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:38,860
Well, both of us were wrong.
- What else?

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,820
Can't he be wrong once?

35
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,759
But he is Su Yu.

36
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:12,770
Mrs. Jin.

37
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,040
This child is getting more handsome.

38
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:33,380
Have you heard this child's mother got married again?

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,980
What's so strange about getting married?

40
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,740
The couple has been divorced
for more than ten years.

41
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,620
But this time, she married a rich man.

42
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,140
Rich man?

43
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,060
How rich is he?

44
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,000
How rich?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,839
A big villa. Several cars.

46
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,279
And several companies.

47
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,479
So rich?

48
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, then he is old, right?

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,799
Same age as Su Yu's mother.

50
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,160
Second marriage?

51
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,220
That's for sure.

52
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,060
I heard he also has a boy.

53
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,600
Look at her. Look at her.

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,240
Leaving her own son behind

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,219
to be a stepmother for the other.

56
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,288
Alas.

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
Dad, I'm back.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,160
You're home, Son.

59
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:37,559
What's this?

60
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,908
Ten catties of potatoes.

61
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:41,120
Why did you buy so many?

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,260
I didn't buy them. I got them at the street corner.

63
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,060
As long as you go to listen to the class, you can get a box of potatoes for free.

64
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:53,940
Tell me, how much money did you get scammed out of?

65
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,099
Can you stop hanging out
with a bunch of old men?

66
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,060
How old are you?

67
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,520
And how many times have I told you?

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,120
Those free giveaways are scams.

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,660
Their goal is to brainwash you, and you will buy
a bunch of useless health care products.

70
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,540
It is not health care products.

71
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,640
It is plasters, specifically for treating my waist injury.

72
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,940
And it's only 9.9 yuan for ten patches.

73
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,899
Where can you find such a steal?

74
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,340
Even if the plasters don't work,

75
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,560
9.9 for ten catties of potatoes
is worth it, right?

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,559
Son, don't you love potatoes?

77
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,160
Go and bake some.

78
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,240
These are your ten catties of potatoes?
- What's wrong?

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,720
This is nine catties of dirt
and one catty of vegetables.

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,480
Let me have a check.

81
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,060
What a scam!

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
But it's not wrong.

83
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,740
Potatoes, potatoes.

84
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,040
Which are vegetables growing in dirt, right?

85
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:09,084
Dad. Did you apply the plaster?

86
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,640
Sir, Madam, the dishes are all ready.

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,580
Auntie, let me help him peel them.

88
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,739
You could go take a break.

89
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,600
Wu Bi. Dinner time.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,460
Wu Bi, I heard you love king crab. So, I went to the fish market--

91
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,959
Please watch your words.

92
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,000
I have my own mother.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,239
She passed away.

94
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:37,740
If you died too, I'd call you mom.

95
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,079
You jerk, how can you talk like that?

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,300
Zhenghao, don't be angry.

97
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,839
As it's our first meeting, it's normal to be a bit estranged.

98
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,140
Don't peel it for him.

99
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,879
Let him do it himself.

100
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,519
Alright, kids at this age are rebellious.

101
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,720
My son is even more stubborn.

102
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,120
I heard your son is also a sophomore, right?

103
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,048
Yes.

104
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:12,036
Which school is he attending?

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,880
What high school is it?

106
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
I can't remember at the moment.

107
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,440
Anyway, an ordinary one near his home.

108
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,760
With the normal teaching environment.

109
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,299
But my child can always rank first
in the whole school.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,580
Such a good talent, we can't let him go to waste.

111
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,459
What about transferring him to Wu Bi's school?

112
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,499
Private schools are generally better.

113
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:42,359
And the two kids can keep each other company.

114
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,440
Really? I heard that school
is hard to get into.

115
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,860
Wu Bi, are you done eating?

116
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,579
I'm full.

117
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:54,400
Mom, this boy is dressed so shabbily.

118
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,559
Don't talk nonsense.

119
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,259
Don't discriminate against kids
who are worse off than you.

120
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,960
Mom, are you carving this to give away?

121
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,119
Yes. A friend of mine's son
has a birthday next month.

122
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:13,780
She asked me to make a statue as a birthday gift for her son.

123
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,120
Is it Aunt Zhang?

124
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,080
Is it Aunt Liang?

125
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,300
No.

126
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,039
She is a new friend of mine.

127
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,020
He has a mole on his ear.

128
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah.

129
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,320
Kids with moles on their ears are smart.

130
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,100
Mom, when do you plan to give it to her?

131
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,119
In a couple of days,I'll send it over when I am free.

132
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,220
Come on. I'll teach you how to draw.

133
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,239
Yeah.

134
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,580
Great job.

135
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,280
Mom, today my dad brought that woman home.

136
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,180
They got married.

137
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,208

It didn't work, Son.

140

Let's go to another place and try it.

141
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Son, stop pulling.

142
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,080
It hurts too much.

What's wrong?
Do you have time to date me today?

145
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,579
Auntie, please do me a favor.

146
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,100
No favors between us.
Just tell me if you need anything.

147
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,392
I want to transfer.

148
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:40,212
Transfer? Why do you want to transfer?

149
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,619
My dad wants to transfer

150
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,720
his mistress's son to our school.

151
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,216

let me introduce a friend to you. My deskmate. He's Mao Chong.

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,000
Machine? What machine?

163
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,280
Mao Chong. Him!

164
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,000
Him? So what about the machine?

165
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I am Mao Chong, not machine.

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,060

My name is Mao Chong. Mao Chong is my name.

You're silly instead.
Your parents are silly instead.

169
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,220
What a crappy name they gave you.

170

May I ask for your honorable name, sir?

171
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,640

Son, I have some great news to tell you.

182
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,440
Get in the car with Mom.

183
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,320
Please mind your words, madam.

184
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,900
I only have a dad, no mom.

185
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,900
If it weren't for your dad,

186
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,579
I wouldn't have left you back then.

187
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,088
What did he do wrong?

188
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,479
Children don't understand adult matters.

189
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,459
He's just stubborn.

190
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:49,700
He spent all day in that small factory. He would do nothing else but work.

191
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,440
I'm not like him in personality.
- He's poor.

192
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,860
It's not like what you thought.

193
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,459
Alright, let's not talk about this today.

194
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,080
Get in the car with Mom first. Let's talk about something else.

195
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,000
If you don't get in the car with me,
I'll go home with you.

196
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,000
That brat.

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,140
Left with his mom.
- Heartless. Really heartless.

198
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,980
Just say what you have to say.

199
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,980
Eat something first.

200
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,540
It is the best Western restaurant in Beijing.

201
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,559
Potatoes are just a side dish.

202
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,540
Why eat it?

203
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,060
Don't you know how to use a knife and fork?

204
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,100
I will help you cut.

205
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,939
If you don't say anything, I'll go back.

206
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,440
Alright, alright, I'll listen to my son.

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's talk about the main issue.

208
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,848
Your stepfather,

209
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,919
which is my husband,

210
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,240
said he wants to transfer you
to an international school.

211
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,160
Can you not always interfere with my life?

212
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,080
What do you mean
by interfering with your life?

213
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,620
Mom is doing this for your good.

214
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,880
My husband's son is about your age. He's studying there too.

215
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,879
What's worse about you? Why can he--
- Enough!

216
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,579
There's no way
I'll have any interaction with him.

217
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,060
Su Yu.

218
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,379
Give me some reaction, alright?

219
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,779
Wait, why do you have a long face?

220
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,860
Do I?

221
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,500
Haven't I always been like this?

222
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,100
That's true. I haven't seen you smile a few times
since you were little.

223
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,460
If I had such a handsome face like you,

224
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,319
I would rearrange my facial features several times a day.

225
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,460
But you always have a poker face instead.

226
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:19,460
Fine. I won't say anything. Is that okay?

227
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,980
You can't get past me.

228
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,300
Go.

229
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,092
Like this.
- I'll hit you.

230
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,800
You can't catch up. Go, go.

231
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,900
- Come back.
- Let's go.

232
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,140
You hit.

233
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,560
Hit me, hit.

234
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,760
You hit.

235
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,880
You failed.

236
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,359
Don't run. Come back.

237
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,000
Harder.

238
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:54,000
I heard a new student
transferred to our class.

239
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,119
So what?

240
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,980
Aren't you curious about
what kind of person he is?

241
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,180
What's there to be curious about?

242
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,319
Alright, you killed the conversation.

243
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,700
With your face, if only you had a little expression,

244
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,479
the title of school hunk
wouldn't have been mine.

245
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,620
Classmates, today, we have a new student in our class.

246
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,384
Please come in.

247
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,099
He's quite hot.

248
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,976
Let's welcome him.

249
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,180
Oh, my.

250
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,019
The school hunk
is probably going to change hands.

251
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,460
Please introduce yourself.

252
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,340
My name is Wu Bi.

253
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,160
Well, finished?

254
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
- That's it?
- Finished?

255
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,319
He's so dope.

256
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:50,719
Classmates, what does Zhu Zhiwu's art of persuasion

257
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,940
mean to us modern people?

258
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,780
When you talk,
you shall understand others' feelings.

259
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,499
Not too straightforward.

260
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,060
So that effective communication
can take place.

261
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,140
Also, be good at listening
to other people's opinions and improve yourself.

262
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,959
Only then can you improve your cultivation.

263
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,260
I see you're all sleepy. How about this?

264
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,132
Any volunteer sings a song
to wake everyone up?

265
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,339
Sounds good?
- What song?

266
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,852
Volunteer?

267
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,839
No one? Then, class president, you'll do it.

268
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,488
Sir.
- Great.

269
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:30,239
Great, great.

270
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,239
Then I'll sing a song I like for you.

271
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,300
"Goodbye, Lonely Heart."

272
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:03,199
♪ Goodbye, my old friend ♪

273
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,760
♪ It's time to go our separate ways ♪

274
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:15,359
♪ It feels so bittersweet ♪

275
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,439
♪ But you belong to yesterday ♪

276
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,719
♪ My lonely heart goodbye ♪

277
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:49,720
Thank you.

278
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,740
You said you can't sing.

279
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,019
Is there something else surprising
I don't know about?

280
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,920
Have you done copying the notes?

281
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,199
Alright, let's go.

282
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,648
Okay, go.

283
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,468
Your name is Su Yu, huh?

284
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:44,400
Anything wrong?

285
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,820
Why do you like such an old song?

286
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,540
Is it any of your business?

287
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,920
There's a mole on your ear too.

288
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,716
What's wrong with you?

289
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:15,540
I'm telling you nobody's ever dared to have this attitude
towards me since I was little.

290
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,140
Have you watched too many soap dramas?

291
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,179
Fantasizing about being a rich boy.

292
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,420
Everyone bows down to you.

293
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,880
If someone dares to defy you,

294
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,300
they will successfully get your attention.

295
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,359
Fine, I won't argue with you

296
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,000
since you look like that sculpture.

297
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,704
What did you say?

298
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,839
I said you look like a certain sculpture.

299
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,860
Why did you push me?

300
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,399
I hate it when people say I have a poker face.

301
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,620
(Certificates)

302
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:46,332
Qu Yuan whose given name is Ping
and who styled himself as Yuan.

303
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:52,280
He was a famous poet and politician in the State of Chu
during the Warring States period.

304
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,480
Once served as the minister and official
in the State of Chu.

305
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,180
The Songs of Chu is a collection of poems
by a group of poets led by Qu Yuan

306
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,400
in the State of Chu
during the Warring States period.

307
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,200
Sleeping all day.
Is this how a class president acts?

308
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,719
These poems have a common feature.

309
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:19,380
They used the form, dialect, and rhyme of Chu poetry

310
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,119
to describe the local customs of Chu.

311
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:30,139
Qu Yuan was trusted by King Huai of Chu in his early years,

312
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:33,300
handling domestic and foreign affairs.

313
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,400
He advocated good governance.

314
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,800
He argued for promoting talents
and improving laws internally,

315
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,119
forming an alliance with the State of Qi
to resist the State of Qin externally.

316
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,359
Due to the exclusion
and slander of the nobles,

317
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,179
he was successively exiled
to the Hanbei and Yuanxiang regions.

318
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,300
After the capital of Chu, Ying,
was occupied by the Qin army,

319
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,199
Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River.

320
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:59,399
It's Wu Bi.
- I know.

321
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:02,216
Alright, classmates, what I just talked about

322
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:05,439
is the historical background of Qu Yuan.

323
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:10,019
You can also search for some historical stories about Qu Yuan after class.

324
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,239
Where is my weapon?

325
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,460
Never mind, I'll buy another one later.

326
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,139
Look, he's chewing bubble gum.

327
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,259
You can blow it that big?

328
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,820
I can't even make this sound.

329
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,008
I'll blow an even bigger one. I'll teach you later.

330
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:55,539
Okay. A bigger one. How do you make it?

331
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,920
Amazing.

332
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,700
How did you do that?

333
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,780
Look, look at this.

334
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,800
Amazing.

335
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,988
So big.

336
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,456
So funny.

337
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,400
Okay, thank you.

338
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,620
Dad, eat more.

339
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,880
Done?
- Done.

340
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,800
Duo, stay away from that stove
in case of getting burned.

341
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,420
Mom, uncle is here.

342
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
Here you are.

343
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,472
As usual.

344
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,896
Duo,

345
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,420
get chopsticks for uncle.

346
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:09,599
Alright, thank you, thank you.

347
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,956
Duo, bring two pancakes to uncle, will you?

348
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:17,859
Here, hold it and give him.

349
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,640
Why did you give me two more pancakes?

350
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,199
Don't I know your appetite?

351
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:32,079
Saving that two bucks
is just to buy lottery tickets, right?

352
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,199
You know me so well.

353
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,260
Duo, hurry up and pack your school bag.

354
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,700
I will take you to school later.

355
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,956
Here, Duo, come.

356
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,040
Alright, let me check.

357
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,276

♫ In that place ♫
