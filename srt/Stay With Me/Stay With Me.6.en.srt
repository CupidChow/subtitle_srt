(Episode 6)

18
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:04,000
(Outgoing call)

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,600
Could you help me find out
which school Su Yu is in?

20
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,496
The teacher is coming.

21
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,768
The teacher is coming.

22
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,080
Su Yu, come out with me for a moment.

23
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,759
Su Yu, I can't get involved in
your family matters.

24
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,920
Go in by yourself.

25
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me introduce myself.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,759
Don't bother. I know who you are.

27
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,639
You really live up to being Xiao San's son.

28
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,160
Born with an extraordinary temperament.

29
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,559
My temperament
has nothing to do with your wife.

30
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
I take after my dad.

31
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,600
Your mom is right.

32
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,720
You are stubborn for real.

33
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,160
What do you want from me? Just say it.

34
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,320
Your mom misses you.

35
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,639
I hope you can visit her when you have time.

36
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,520
Is there anything else?

37
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,799
I think she should have mentioned it to you.

38
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,760
We want to transfer you to a better school.

39
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,000
With your grades, your future is limitless.

40
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,799
Can I ask you a favor?

41
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:30,336
Go ahead.

42
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,399
Tell your wife not to meddle in
others' family affairs.

43
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,760
My son is your age.

44
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,320
His rebelliousness is even stronger than yours.

45
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,839
I often tell him one thing.

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,079
You can be reckless.

47
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,440
But when it comes to your future

48
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,239
and gains and losses,

49
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,079
you need to consider the bigger picture.

50
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,679
So is your son listening to you?

51
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,440
He will sooner or later.

52
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,160
Because no one would give up shortcuts

53
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,600
and compete with others instead.

54
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,359
In my eyes, both of you are the same.

55
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,079
Both are my sons.

56
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,080
For what he has,

57
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,920
I will do my best to provide them for you.

58
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,519
I won't let your mom feel
that I'm being unfair.

59
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,824
First,

60
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,799
I am not your son.

61
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,959
I have my own father.

62
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:35,904
Second,

63
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,200
I am not on the same path as Xiao San.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My life has no shortcuts.

65
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,040
Really. Call me next time.

66
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,159
No problem.

67
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,240
Deal?

68
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,296
Definitely.

69
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,384
Let's go, let's go.

70
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
Hello, Auntie.

71
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,799
You didn't tell my dad
which school I transferred to, did you?

72
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,640
I was freaked out.

73
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
I thought I saw him just now.

74
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,064
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

75
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,320
What did the teacher want with you today?

76
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,080
It's about my mom.

77
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,119
Your mom?

78
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,160
Your mom came to see you?

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,359
No.

80
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,559
It's her current husband.

81
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,040
What did he come to see you for?

82
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,079
He came to be my mom's spokesperson.

83
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:35,880
To get me to transfer

84
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,160
to a better school.

85
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,576
Did you agree?

86
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,920
Nonsense. How could I agree?

87
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,220
I didn't like him in the first place.

88
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,560
Especially his aggressive attitude.

89
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,280
As if everyone is his subordinate

90
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,359
and has to listen to him.

91
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,119
Just like my dad.

92
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,600
He even compared me to his son,

93
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,840
which made me seem so ignorant.

94
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,239
If his son is so outstanding,

95
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:04,239
let him cultivate his own son.

96
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,519
Why is he always thinking about you?

97
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:10,000
In my opinion, his son must be a waste.

98
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,279
Otherwise, he wouldn't always think about you.

99
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,839
I feel upset.

100
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,700
Let me tell you, if you're unhappy,

101
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,960
curse his son.

102
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,720
Curse his son to be hit as soon as he goes out.

103
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:34,660
Are you alright?

104
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,719
What happened?

105
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Maybe it's too old.

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,200
Alright, Sir, I'll definitely attend
the parent-teacher conference.

107
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,239
Son, tomorrow's parent-teacher conference--

108
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,984
What happened?

109
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,840
Hit by the fan.

110
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,400
No wonder the other day,

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,799
I heard this fan creaking.

112
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,220
I wanted to get a new one.

113
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,159
Move around and see if anything's broken.

114
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,380
I'm fine, Uncle, my leg can move.

115
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,560
It's just

116
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,560
that I might not be able to go home tonight.

117
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,880
No worries. I'll go find some medicine for you.

118
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,919
What for?

119
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:30,799
Hello?

120
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,200
Hello, is this Wu Bi's parent?

121
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,119
Yes, yes, I am.

122
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,780
There's a parent-teacher conference tomorrow.

123
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,880
His auntie handled his enrollment before

124
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,620
and only left her contact information.

125
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,880
But the call didn't go through.

126
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,239
Fortunately, the home phone number
was left in the contact list.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,180
Alright, alright,
I'll be there on time tomorrow.

128
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,919
Okay, see you tomorrow.

129
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,679
He actually transferred school
and kept it from his dad.

130
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,400
What kind of school is this?

131
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,359
It looks like an ordinary high school.

132
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,119
Should I tell Wu?

133
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,140
No. If I tell him directly.

134
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,720
he will definitely be furious

135
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,600
and then the father and son will quarrel.

136
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,760
The kid will definitely
say I'm stirring up trouble.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,048
No, no, no.

138
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,139
Put it under the desk lamp.

139
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,179
This way, every time
I turn on the light to do homework,

140
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,919
I can see that bottle of stars.

141
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,696
Not bad, not bad.

142
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
That's not right.

143
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:14,220
I think I heard
that bottle of stars can glow in the dark.

144
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,140
If I put it under the desk lamp,

145
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,320
won't the light be completely
overshadowed by the lamp?

146
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,256
No, no, no.

147
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,912
I got it, I got it.

148
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,960
This position is good, right in the middle.

149
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,479
So, every time I come in, I can see it.

150
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,479
What are you messing around with?

151
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,080
Look at the mess you've made of this room.

152
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,140
What's the matter with you, kid?

153
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,159
W-W-What are you doing with all this fuss?

154
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,359
You little brat, dare to run out.

155
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,560
Get back here right away.

156
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,799
Wait until the parent-teacher meeting is over

157
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,199
and see how I deal with you.

158
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:54,760
I really should discipline him better.

159
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,840
This c-c-child.

160
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
W-W-Why is he---

161
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,039
He what?

162
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,720
You, clean up the room now!

163
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,919
I…

164
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:22,528
Dad.

165
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
Why are you dressed like this?

166
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,760
I have to dress up nicely
for your parent-teacher conference, right?

167
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,280
I can't let you lose face.

168
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,000
I pressed it with a washbasin last night,

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,599
but there are still wrinkles.

170
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,320
How come this suit has gotten so small?

171
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Dad,

172
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,239
when did you buy this suit?

173
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,559
I've never seen you wear it.

174
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,679
Of course, you haven't seen it.

175
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,719
I bought it when I married your mom.

176
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:07,919
Take it off.

177
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,359
- No, no, no.
- Take it off.

178
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:10,579
I'm going to be late.

179
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,259
I'm going to be late!

180
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,408
Dad!

181
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:26,640
Hello, sir.

182
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,679
Please sit, please sit.

183
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,568
Hello.

184
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,020
Dear parents, please find your seats

185
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,039
according to the names on the seats.

186
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,739
You are Mao Chong's mother.

187
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,960
Yeah, and you are Su Yu's dad.

188
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Right, right.

189
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,200
No wonder my son always

190
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,880
praises Mao Chong for being handsome at home.

191
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
Turns out his mother is so beautiful.

192
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,840
Oh my, you are good at sweet talk.

193
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,200
Your son is the real elite.

194
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
My son keeps talking about it every day,

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880
saying he can still rank first
even if he sleeps.

196
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,960
That's amazing.

197
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,159
Not really.

198
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,400
Alright, everyone quiet down.

199
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,919
Have all the parents arrived?

200
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,840
Wu Bi's parent hasn't arrived yet.

201
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,919
Poor child.

202
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,239
Okay, let's not wait for them anymore.

203
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,379
I'll introduce myself first.

204
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,119
I am the class teacher of our class.

205
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,380
My name is Wang Jianjun.

206
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,080
The purpose of this parent-teacher conference

207
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,200
is mainly about

208
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,400
last week's midterm exam

209
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,719
and sharing experiences and summaries
with all the parents.

210
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,280
Madam, it's almost ten o'clock.

211
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,559
I haven't finished my makeup yet.

212
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,440
It takes more than half an hour to get there.

213
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,960
Let them start first.

214
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,560
Madam, hurry up,

215
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,359
or you'll be too late.

216
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,039
The exam situation is roughly like this.

217
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,479
Next, let's welcome the parents

218
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,640
to exchange educational experiences.

219
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,080
First, let's welcome Su Yu's father

220
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
to share with you, okay?

221
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,136
Everyone, welcome.

222
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:28,180
Come.

223
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,520
Hello, Sir. Hello, dear parents.

224
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,880
Uh, I-I really don't have

225
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,479
anything good to share,

226
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,939
because I never managed this child.

227
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,360
Don't hide it. Just share it.

228
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,840
We want to learn too.

229
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:46,220
Dear parent, I'm not hiding anything.

230
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,519
You see, when I come home from work every day,

231
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,520
the child has already finished his homework.

232
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,920
When I get up in the morning to go to work,

233
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,960
he's already gone to school with his backpack.

234
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
How do I...

235
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,496
How can he still score first place?

236
00:15:58,496 --> 00:15:59,559
Just say a few words, please.

237
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,940
It's so annoying.

238
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,500
Our child studies till midnight every day

239
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,760
but still fails.

240
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,040
You should be content.

241
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,820
My daughter doesn't even do her homework.

242
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,479
All she cares about is looking pretty.

243
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,216
All girls are like this.

244
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,080
Wang, drive faster, please.

245
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,104
Alright.

246
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,799
Next, let's broadcast the principal's speech.

247
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:32,280
Dear parents and teachers,

248
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,280
I believe the class teachers

249
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,840
have already summarized the experiences

250
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,880
and shortcomings of this exam for the parents.

251
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,200
I won't go into detail on that.

252
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,900
My speech today

253
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,820
is mainly to inspire you, dear parents.

254
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,800
Students in every score range
have their own goals.

255
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,160
For example, how could students in the top 200

256
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,440
squeeze into the top 100

257
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,000
with the help of the parents?

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,820
For students in the top 100,

259
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,919
let's strive for the top 10

260
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,919
in the next monthly exam.

261
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,860
For the top 10 students,

262
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,799
strive to rank second

263
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,700
in the whole school.

264
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,599
After all, surpassing Su Yu

265
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,119
is still a difficult thing to do.

266
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,219
Of course, Su Yu

267
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:15,820
not only has talent

268
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,680
but also puts in a lot of effort.

269
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,359
Our classmates should learn from him.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,088
That's impressive.

271
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,000
Alright, thank you, dear parents.

272
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,599
We'll end today's parent-teacher conference.

273
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,199
If any parent has any questions,

274
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,340
you can come to me individually.

275
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,520
Everyone else can leave.

276
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,160
Uh, aren't you going to chat with him?

277
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,280
I won't go just yet.

278
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,640
Alright, I'll go over and chat.

279
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,800
Okay, there you go.

280
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,539
I need to hurry to the lottery station.

281
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:51,839
I won second prize yesterday.

282
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,119
This is a big deal.

283
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,920
My child has been working hard lately,

284
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,839
but the grades just won't improve.

285
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:05,800
Take it easy, Madam.

286
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,959
I'm fine.

287
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,800
It feels like I've traveled back in time.

288
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
I seem to have seen Su Zhigang
from more than a decade ago.

289
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,000
I must be seeing things wrong.

290
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,840
Encouragement is still needed.

291
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,640
That's right, what you said is very true.

292
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,880
Didn't we just say that?

293
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:28,760
You are?

294
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,040
I am Wu Bi's parent.

295
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,300
Please wait a moment.

296
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,760
We'll go to the conference room
for a separate chat later.

297
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,479
Okay, Sir, you go ahead.

298
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:38,020
Sir, what should we do with our child?

299
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,520
It's still a problem
with their learning methods.

300
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
How have you been feeling these past few days?

301
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,640
It doesn't hurt anymore.

302
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
Just walking is still a bit difficult.

303
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,599
How did the parent-teacher conference go?

304
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,359
Just one word: awesome.

305
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,459
I've never felt as proud as I did today.

306
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,439
Son, you really make me proud!

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,479
Did you see your good buddy?

308
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,599
What good buddy?

309
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,119
I saw him, I saw him.

310
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,199
We chatted for a long time and didn't let go.

311
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,560
I'll cook for you guys now.

312
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:13,984
Alright.

313
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,359
He probably didn't go.

314
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,959
How could he possibly go?

315
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,079
If he found out I transferred,

316
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,359
he would have made a fuss already.

317
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:48,640
Ms. Zhou.

318
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,496
Take this.

319
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:51,580
Okay.

320
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,719
Eat it while it's hot.

321
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,959
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

322
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,048
Ride carefully.

323
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,216
Do you have the strength?

324
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Alright, I'll really give it to you this time.

325
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,712
Where did you go?

326
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,880
Helping Wu Bi to the restroom.

327
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,719
You know about his mom's situation?

328
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,820
You know about it either?

329
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,239
Who doesn't know in our class?
His mom is so high-profile.

330
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,599
High-profile?

331
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,219
Yeah, on the day
of the parent-teacher conference,

332
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,560
his mom dressed very high-profile and flashy.

333
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,280
How is that possible? You must be mistaken.

334
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,279
How could I be mistaken?

335
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,900
His mom stood at the door

336
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,920
and said, "I am Wu Bi's mother."

337
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,119
Then the teacher dismissed the other parents

338
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,220
and had a private meeting with his mom.

339
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,560
My mom has a deep impression of it.

340
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,440
Your mom must be mistaken.

341
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
It was Wu Bi's dad who came that day.

342
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,620
There's no way it could be wrong.

343
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,000
At that time, apart from my mom,

344
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
other parents also saw it.

345
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,299
They were all discussing it.

346
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,359
If you don't believe me, go ask them.

347
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,439
Really? Everyone saw it?

348
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,599
Don't run. Wait a moment.

349
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:10,144
What's wrong?

350
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,560
How about I give you a ride home directly?

351
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,120
Don't bother. I can go back by myself.

352
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,980
How can you go back with this foot?

353
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,520
I can ride on one foot.

354
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,584
Right,

355
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,359
aren't your dad and my dad really close?

356
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,520
But I've never seen your dad show up.

357
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,439
Don't you guys live in this area?

358
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,760
Well, he's usually busy,

359
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,000
always working night shifts.

360
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,640
Then, how about some weekend,

361
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I come to your house for dinner?

362
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,959
You can't always be mooching off my family.

363
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,600
My dad doesn't know how to cook.

364
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,640
If not eating, at least I can visit, right?

365
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,299
Alright. Let's go.

366
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:50,680
- Are you tired from riding?
- It's fine.

367
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,560
I'll ride. Give it to me.

368
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:57,440
Get on.

369
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,304
Hold on tight.

370
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,464
Let's go.

371
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,448
I'm leaving.

372
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,839
Hey, I'm Wu Bi.

373
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:46,080
Do me a favor.

374
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,800
Help me hire a dad.

375
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,384
Dad.

376
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,479
How did you get to know Wu Bi's dad?

377
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,239
Well...

378
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,460
His dad's company
used to be next to our factory.

379
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,000
When we had time, we would eat together
at a construction site cafeteria.

380
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
And as time went by,

381
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,560
we became familiar.

382
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,599
But I heard Wu Bi say

383
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,239
his mom was a sculptor before she passed away.

384
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,239
His dad was able to marry an artist.

385
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,000
He must not be an ordinary person, right?

386
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,940
His dad's business
was doing really well at the time.

387
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,560
But then he lost money in business.

388
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,620
And his mom passed away.

389
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,880
Didn't they just move to this area?

390
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,839
I'm an extra.

391
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,640
I'm a professional actor.

392
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,719
What have you acted in?

393
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,000
I acted as a head once.

394
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,840
I was playing a servant,

395
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,760
peeping at women
taking a bath through a window.

396
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,719
At that time, I stretched my head out

397
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,160
and I got stuck there.

398
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,760
I moved left and right.

399
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,659
From beginning to end, there was just

400
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,079
my head in the frame.

401
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,239
Isn't that funny?

402
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,600
Alright, alright.

403
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,232
It's you then.

404
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,312
Thank you.

405
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:25,824
Oh, right.

406
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:27,580
I would like to know

407
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,319
if you want me to pretend to be your dad

408
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,479
and go to a parent-teacher conference for you.

409
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,760
No. It's much more complicated than that.

410
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,079
I like challenging roles.

411
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,119
Those with

412
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,500
rich emotions.

413
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,959
When I let it all out in acting,

414
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,152
I even scare myself.

415
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,020
So, starting from today, you'll live here.

416
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,119
No matter who comes,

417
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,180
you have to insist that you're my dad.

418
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,680
And don't mention
that you were an extra before.

419
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,792
Is that okay?

420
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,352
It's a big deal, huh?

421
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:07,640
Why don't you give it a try

422
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,839
and call me "dad"?

423
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:14,959
What actor did he find me?

424
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,592
Dad.

425
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,368
I am dad.

426
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,672
I am daddy.

427
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,624
I am his father.

428
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,800
Hello, I am a dad.

429
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:41,024
Son.

430
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,008
Take a look.

431
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,936
Start.

432
00:27:58,272 --> 00:27:59,380
Hello.

433
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,920
Uncle, I am Wu Bi's classmate.

434
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,560
My dad asked me to bring you some fruit.

435
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
Su Zhigang's son.

436
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,959
You've grown so much.

437
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,056
Come in, come in.

438
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,980
You even brought apples.

439
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,399
I'll wash the apples for you. Take a seat.

440
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,740
Alright then.

441
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,660
Luckily only one came.

442
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,700
If his dad came along, too.

443
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,119
It would have been a group scene.

444
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,599
You don't look like your dad.

445
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,579
You don't look like your dad either.

446
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,079
Sons take after their moms.

447
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,264
Come on, come on.

448
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:32,299
Eat an apple.

449
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,000
Alright, you have one too.

450
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,192
Thank you, Dad.

451
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,919
He is quite good-looking, isn't he?

452
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,079
Dad, I want to chat with my classmate.

453
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,719
You can stay aside for a while.

454
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,520
How could you talk to your dad like that?

455
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,640
Do you talk to your father like this?

456
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,419
How have I been educating you?

457
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:55,899
My old classmate's son is visiting us.

458
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,400
Shouldn't I chat with him?

459
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,256
Right?

460
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,660
It's also my fault.

461
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,319
I've been neglecting to discipline my son.

462
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,680
Uncle, are you busy with work usually?

463
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,319
To say I'm not busy,

464
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,439
I have to get up at six
in the morning to stake out.

465
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,199
To say I'm busy,

466
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,880
I haven't had a job for days,
just waiting for a boxed meal.

467
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,104
Stake out?

468
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,959
What do you do for a living?

469
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:32,280
I... collect debts.

470
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,560
Nowadays, debts are not easy to collect.

471
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,960
You must have a tough job.

472
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,439
Yeah, who doesn't have it tough?

473
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
Being a father is hard.

474
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,880
Your dad is struggling too.

475
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,000
But when I think of

476
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,540
my older brother,

477
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,599
I feel

478
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,680
not good.

479
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,140
When I think of your dad,

480
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,312
I feel

481
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,359
pain.

482
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,959
Pain.

483
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,296
Pain.

484
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,800
Dad, I'm back.

485
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,640
Why are you back so late today?

486
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,959
I chatted with Wu Bi's dad for a while.

487
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,079
He's quite a talker.

488
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,079
He talked a lot about your youth.

489
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,239
Wu Bi... he's quite mischievous.

490
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,320
To be honest with you,

491
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,680
a few days ago, my classmates
were gossiping about Wu Bi's family.

492
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,640
I had doubts about his identity.

493
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,719
But after going there today,

494
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,040
I realized I was overthinking.

495
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,680
Look, look.

496
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,940
Even if you doubted him,

497
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,719
you couldn't have doubted
your own father, right?
