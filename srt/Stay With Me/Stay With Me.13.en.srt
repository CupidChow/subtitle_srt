<i>[Episode 13]</i>

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,760
What do you think of this new bag I bought?

19
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,839
We'll start packing these days,

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,959
and we're going back next week.

21
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,199
Why so sudden?

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
What's so sudden about it?

23
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,860
We've finished what we came to do,

24
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,879
so why wait?

25
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,760
But you promised me

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,619
that you would stay with me
until after the New Year.

27
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,080
You want to stay here

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,839
and keep pestering my brother, right?

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,480
Stop playing dumb.

31
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,960
Wu Bi has already told me

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
that you've been contacting him privately.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,299
How is that possible?

34
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:30,119
I never contacted him.

35
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:46,880
What's this then?

36
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:56,416
I'm telling you.

37
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,720
He's my only brother.

38
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,312
Stay away from him.

39
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,279
We're leaving next week.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,279
What if I insist on staying?

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,160
Then we break up.

42
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,799
Hello?

43
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,239
Why did you say that to your brother?

44
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,359
What did I say to him?

45
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,060
Stop playing dumb.

46
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,880
You know what you said.

47
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,600
You accused me of pestering you,

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
but I can't say the same about you?

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,640
You even secretly took
pictures of me at the café.

50
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,760
You took pictures of me at the bar,

51
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,879
so why can't I do the same at the café?

52
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,119
You…

53
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,000
What's the matter? The cat's out of the bag?

54
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,739
As you wished,

55
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,319
I broke up with your brother.

56
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,640
Now I can openly be with Su Yu.

57
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,559
Then I wish you happiness.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,559
<i>Let's open the box again in ten years.</i>

59
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,699
<i>Whoever digs it up first is a puppy.</i>

60
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,399
<i>Okay, let's make a promise.</i>

61
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,584
<i>How childish.</i>

62
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,312
<i>Are you in or not?</i>

63
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,960
New Year's Eve is the day after tomorrow.

64
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,799
Chinese New Year really has a festive spirit.

65
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,260
<i>I wonder if Wu Bi
is spending the New Year alone</i>

66
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,760
<i>or with his family.</i>

67
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,800
What are you thinking about?

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Would you like to try some?

69
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,984
No, thanks.

70
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,640
How boring to just sit there like that.

71
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,839
You know, I don't like sweets.

72
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,280
Su Yu, do you remember

73
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
when I used to drink milkshakes,

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,840
I was always afraid the first sip
would be too cold,

75
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,119
and you would always taste it for me.

76
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,559
Were you reluctant back then?

77
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,480
When are you leaving?

78
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,380
Are you that eager for me to leave?

79
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,119
You should go back soon. You have school.

80
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
Su Yu,

81
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,399
I feel like you've changed these past few days.

82
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,200
Did Wu Bi say something to you again?

83
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,480
I've explained to you about what he said.

84
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,780
He didn't say anything to me.

85
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,040
We haven't been in contact

86
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,744
since it happened.

87
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,160
Then why are you acting like this?

88
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Could it be

89
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,200
because he likes me?

90
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,600
Yes, it's because he likes you.

91
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,040
But I don't like him at all.

92
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,160
Whether you like him or not

93
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,960
doesn't matter to me.

94
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,039
What do you mean?

95
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,600
That's impossible.

96
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
You can't possibly not like me.

97
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
You saw him with me last time,

98
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,200
and you helped me beat him.

99
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,280
That punch wasn't for you.

100
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
It was for myself.

101
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:19,904
Ye Wanying,

102
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,840
I rejected you before

103
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,080
because I felt inferior.

104
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,656
But this time,

105
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
I truly don't like you.

106
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,960
Why?

107
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,560
How could you change so much over one year?

108
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,559
Feelings change not because of time,

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,184
but people.

110
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,919
So my return

111
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,880
doesn't mean anything to you?

112
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,864
It does.

113
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,559
Thank you for letting me
see my own heart clearly.

114
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,039
There used to be a knot in my heart,

115
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,239
but now it's completely gone.

116
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,159
Let's take one last picture together.

117
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,520
The two of us

118
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,719
don't even have a proper picture together.

119
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,080
<i>Dad, why did you print two copies?</i>

120
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,980
<i>I thought you looked good in this picture,</i>

121
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,200
<i>so I printed one more.</i>

122
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:29,599
<i>Dad, are you going to give
the other picture to someone?</i>

123
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,699
<i>Your birthday</i>

124
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,599
<i>is just around the corner, right?</i>

125
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,599
<i>Your mom hasn't seen you
for several years, and she misses you.</i>

126
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,460
<i>She wants--</i>

127
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,040
<i>She doesn't want me anymore.
What does she want my photo for?</i>

128
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,180
<i>No, no.</i>

129
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,400
<i>Give it to me.</i>

130
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,479
<i>Listen to Dad.</i>

131
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:52,039
<i>Do you know why I like that statue so much?</i>

132
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,760
<i>Because it was my mom's last work.</i>

133
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,919
<i>Even now,</i>

134
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,400
<i>I can still feel my mom's warmth.</i>

135
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,220
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

136
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,900
<i>The little boy that my mom sculpted</i>

137
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,520
<i>looks just like you.</i>

138
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,599
<i>He also has a mole on his ear.</i>

139
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,660
<i>So, the first time I saw you,</i>

140
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,359
<i>I felt a special connection.</i>

141
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,984
Son.

142
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,032
What are you doing here?

143
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,039
I wanted to ask you something.

144
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,359
Let's talk inside. It's cold out.

145
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:18,304
Over here.

146
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,320
Have a seat.

147
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,599
I went to Guomao to look for you last time.

148
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,420
And the house was vacant.

149
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,280
Where are you staying right now?

150
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Wu Bi totally ignores me.

151
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,660
He won't even answer my calls.

152
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,140
You see, it's Chinese New Year.

153
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,300
And I couldn't just knock on your door.

154
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm afraid your dad would think I'm dramatic.

155
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,200
Wait, did that woman give you an attitude?

156
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,760
I haven't seen you for a long time,

157
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,320
and I have so much to tell you.

158
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,640
Why don't I cook a few dishes

159
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,760
and we can talk over lunch?

160
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,859
I missed the first day of the new month,

161
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,080
but The Spring Festival hasn't passed yet.

162
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,799
No, I've already eaten.

163
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,952
You have?

164
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,599
Are you alone?

165
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,560
Yes.

166
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,479
The housekeeper went back to her hometown
for the New Year.

167
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,159
Wu has been abroad and hasn't come back.

168
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,599
That Wu Bi?

169
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,039
You can't even catch his shadow.

170
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,320
Have some candies.

171
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,679
I don't like sweets.

172
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,679
I remember when you were little…

173
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,679
Let's cut to the chase.

174
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,768
Do you remember this?

175
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,320
<i>You are so talented.</i>

176
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,340
<i>So are you.</i>

177
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,479
Your singing is so nice

178
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,760
<i>Those are just superficial skills.</i>

179
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,559
<i>Your works are true art.</i>

180
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,280
<i>You can pick out one as a gift.</i>

181
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,656
<i>No, I can't.</i>

182
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,719
<i>These things are too valuable.</i>

183
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,280
<i>You sang for me at my birthday party.</i>

184
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,900
<i>I should give you a gift in return.</i>

185
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,200
<i>Just pick one you like as a gift.</i>

186
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,820
<i>Can I ask you to sculpt a new one for me?</i>

187
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,440
<i>My son's birthday is next month.</i>

188
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:47,300
<i>And I want to give him a mini sculpture</i>

189
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>as a birthday gift.</i>

190
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,799
<i>If it's too much trouble, never mind.</i>

191
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,339
<i>It's okay. No problem.</i>

192
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,512
<i>Really?</i>

193
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,808
<i>Thank you.</i>

194
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,199
I thought as an honorable artist,

195
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,280
she would have long forgotten this matter.

196
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,599
But unexpectedly,

197
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,539
she really did it for me.

198
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes.

199
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,239
She was making a birthday gift for your son
when she was dying,

200
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,439
and you were plotting
to be her son's stepmother.

201
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:23,648
I wasn't.

202
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,160
Back then, I had only met her once.

203
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,640
And I just met Wu.

204
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,199
I felt really bad when she had an accident.

205
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,760
I've always admired her,

206
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,920
and I never wanted
to intervene in her marriage.

207
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,400
Even you don't believe me?

208
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,680
I'm not interested in your affairs.

209
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,800
I just feel sorry for Wu Bi.

210
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
If he knew that his mother's last work

211
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,120
was a sculpture for your son,

212
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,399
how would he feel?

213
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:56,060
Please don't tell him.

214
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,359
If he knew that his mother was busy
with my matters before she died,

215
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,520
he would definitely think that the car accident
had something to do with me.

216
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,540
If it had nothing to do with you,

217
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,599
what are you afraid of?

218
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,040
No, I'm not afraid.

219
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm just worried that
the misunderstanding will get worse.

220
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,560
Son, I'm begging you.

221
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,319
Please don't expose this matter.

222
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,160
It's already hard for me

223
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,640
to survive in this family.

224
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,920
Happy Lantern Festival.

225
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,040
- Come on, happy festival.
- Happy Lantern Festival.

226
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,159
Duo, try this meatball.

227
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,400
The meatballs are delicious, come on.

228
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
No, we need to eat sweet dumplings first.

229
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,680
Right. Duo knows the best.

230
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,119
Duo is the smartest.

231
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,136
Here, serve your brother first.

232
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:52,192
Come on.

233
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:53,248
Okay.

234
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,744
It's black sesame flavored.

235
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:58,080
Here you go.

236
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,760
Okay.

237
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,519
You want four? Okay.

238
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,079
Four for Duo.

239
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,820
Four for stability.

240
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,400
Duo, learn this word.

241
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,400
What's wrong with Su Yu?

242
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,760
He didn't eat much.

243
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,552
I'll go check on him.

244
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,264
Son.

245
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,319
Where are you going?

246
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,180
To Wu Bi's place.

247
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,359
To Wu Bi's place?

248
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,560
Today is the fifteenth day
of the first lunar month.

249
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,240
It's a day for family reunions.

250
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,199
You should be celebrating the festival at home.

251
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,280
It's the same for Wu Bi.

252
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,359
What about his family?

253
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,039
His dad is on a business trip.

254
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,199
Only my mom is there.

255
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,800
Never mind. Forget about her.

256
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,380
It's quite sad when you think about it.

257
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,439
You should go.

258
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,752
Who is it?

259
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,134
<i>♫ You said that between us ♫</i>

260
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,342
<i>♫ You will protect me ♫</i>

261
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,108
<i>♫ No matter how dangerous it gets ♫</i>

262
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:30,617
<i>♫ You will never leave ♫</i>

263
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Did you freeze?

264
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:39,584
<i>♫ Every promise you made to me ♫</i>

265
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:43,968
<i>♫ You won't leave me behind ♫</i>

266
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,298
<i>♫ Thank you for exploring with me ♫</i>

267
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:51,680
<i>♫ Tasting everything in this world ♫</i>

268
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,160
I thought you were too allured by that vixen

269
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
to care about anyone else.

270
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:00,239
<i>♫ As long as we are by each other's side ♫</i>

271
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,520
Did she confess everything to you?

272
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,519
About what?

273
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,800
About her and my brother.

274
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,220
Don't tell me you still don't know.

275
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,680
She really is my brother's girlfriend.

276
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,580
I don't know if they've broken up.

277
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,920
But when she approached you,
she was indeed with my brother.

278
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,976
I don't care at all.

279
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:20,340
I don't care if she has any relationship

280
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,400
with your brother or anyone else.

281
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,239
I severed ties with her

282
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,920
simply because I figured it out.

283
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,000
How did you figure it out?

284
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,040
Because of something Duo said.

285
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,860
What did Duo say to you?

286
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,599
Think about what you said to Duo.

287
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:45,696
<i>♫ I understand that you are not only ♫</i>

288
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:49,934
<i>♫ The most important person in my life ♫</i>

289
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,800
<i>♫ But also my family ♫</i>

290
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,840
What is this?

291
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,359
I almost forgot. Sweet dumplings.

292
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,760
Sweet dumplings?

293
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,919
Today is the fifteenth day
of the first lunar month.

294
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,000
Don't you know?

295
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,400
I've been up all night these two days.

296
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,560
I'm completely muddled.

297
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,144
<i>♫ Thank you for never holding back ♫</i>

298
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:17,277
<i>♫Even if it means giving me
everything you have♫</i>

299
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,480
So…

300
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,839
you've come to celebrate the festival with me.

301
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:25,640
You wish.

302
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,719
It was just too noisy at home
with so many people.

303
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:32,079
Su Yu, can you ever say something nice?

304
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,159
I'm afraid if I say something nice,

305
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,520
I'll move you to tears.

306
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,340
Come on, make me cry.

307
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,359
Make me cry for once.

308
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,284
<i>♫ As long as we are by each other's side ♫</i>

309
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
From today

310
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,599
to the day you get married,

311
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,599
I will be with you

312
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,239
for every holiday.

313
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,079
I'm going to cook sweet dumplings.

314
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,280
Don't ruin it.

315
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,920
Otherwise, we will have nothing to eat.

316
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,479
Should we just dump it?

317
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:23,760
What are you doing? Wasting food?

318
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,359
Is it still edible?

319
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,319
It tastes burnt.

320
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,839
You're too polite.

321
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,680
I just like sweets.

322
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,736
Mao Chong.

323
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,100
We haven't seen each other
for such a long time.

324
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,199
Did you miss me?

325
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,620
Of course, how could I not?

326
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,880
You're lying.

327
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,599
I sent you so many messages,

328
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,959
and you didn't reply to a single one.

329
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,760
You know, I don't like replying to messages.

330
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,599
Why do I feel like you've lost weight?

331
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,580
People usually gain weight during the New Year,

332
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,079
but you seem to be getting thinner.

333
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,239
It doesn't seem like I've lost much weight.

334
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,160
But your chin does seem sharper.

335
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,992
Su Yu,

336
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,620
here, my mom made these fried cakes.

337
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,460
Take them home, reheat and you can eat them.

338
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,680
Very thoughtful.

339
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,720
Please thank Auntie for me.

340
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,340
Why are you being so polite to me?

341
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,199
If you find it delicious,
you can come home with me.

342
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,599
And I'll have my mom make fresh ones for you.

343
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,552
Sure.

344
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,680
What's so delicious? Let me try.

345
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,979
Why are you everywhere? Go eat dirt.

346
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,752
Listen, don't share it with others.

347
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:15,839
You can only eat them yourself.

348
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,839
Otherwise, I won't bring any for you next time.

349
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,240
- Okay.
- Put them away.

350
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,359
Alright, got it.

351
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
"Don't share with others. Eat them yourself."

352
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:52,768
What are you going to do?

353
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,540
Ask Ms. Zhou to fry them.

354
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,640
It's late. Don't disturb Ms. Zhou.

355
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,439
She has to set up her stall early tomorrow.

356
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,544
I'll fry them for you.

357
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,976
Can you?

358
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,920
Who are you looking down on?

359
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,319
I learned well from Ms. Zhou.

360
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,352
Eat.

361
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,280
Just some simple fried cakes.

362
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:37,239
<i>But he can't share with others?</i>

363
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,599
<i>Watch me eat it.</i>

364
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
It smells so good.

365
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,792
Can I eat them now?

366
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:00,199
Yes, go ahead.

367
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,239
Did you overcook it?

368
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,000
I remember it was yellow at first.

369
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,599
Don't blame me. It was black to begin with.

370
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,672
Please.

371
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,959
How's the taste?

372
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,599
It smelled so good just now,

373
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,239
but why does it taste different?

374
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,079
It was never that great.

375
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,680
Do me a favor.

376
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,860
What?

377
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,479
It's about Guo Xiaorou.

378
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,280
She keeps pestering me. It's annoying.

379
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,000
Look at your pathetic face,

380
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,460
showing off here, aren't you?

381
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,560
What am I showing off?

382
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,920
Don't you know whether I like her or not?

383
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,479
Besides, if it wasn't for your meddling,

384
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,199
could the two of us be in this mess?

385
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,740
And you're still asking me for help.

386
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,640
Can't you see I'm out of options here?

387
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,760
You wouldn't want me to say harsh words

388
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,839
to hurt Guo Xiaorou, would you?

389
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,520
Let me tell you, I can't do that.

390
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,920
Our Han lineage

391
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,680
is staunch supporters of feminism.

392
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,000
'Women are not to be harmed', we say.

393
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,280
No.

394
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,400
You're thinking too negatively.

395
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,600
Good.

396
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,040
I don't want to be the bad guy.

397
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,359
Guo Xiaorou invited me for a meal
in a couple of days,

398
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,980
and I want you to go with me as my girlfriend

399
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,339
so that she will give up completely.

400
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:41,599
That's even worse. I can't believe
you thought of this.

401
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,639
No, no.

402
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:43,719
I'll treat you to a week's worth
of spicy strips.

403
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,720
A month's worth!

404
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,560
Why don't you just find a girl,

405
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,660
instead of asking for my help?

406
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,239
Where would I find one?

407
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,340
In our school.

408
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,880
Then it wouldn't be a one-time thing.

409
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,979
I'd have to act every day.

410
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:58,239
But once you remove your female disguise,

411
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,719
she wouldn't even be able to find you,

412
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,719
And, I think there isn't
a single girl in our school

413
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,620
who looks prettier than you.

414
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,680
Get lost.

415
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,040
Think about it. If I really found a girl

416
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,719
whom I don't like to act with me,

417
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,800
I would be busted instantly.

418
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,520
But it's different with you. You're a guy.

419
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,680
I can be affectionate with you naturally.

420
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,599
Do you think it's easier for her
to see that we're acting,

421
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,640
or to tell that I'm a guy?

422
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,768
Neither.

423
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,959
Bro, bro.

424
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,760
This thing is so uncomfortable.

425
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,920
But you know what?

426
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,620
This silicone is quite elastic.

427
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,040
Try to be discreet, will you?

428
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:55,079
Let's go.

429
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,128
Okay.

430
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
<i>Being a love rival for your crush.</i>

431
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:12,040
<i>I'm probably the only one in the world.</i>

432
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,820
<i>Forget it.</i>

433
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,479
<i>Never mind. I'll just do it.</i>

434
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,359
<i>Maybe when she gives up on him,</i>

435
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,520
<i>I'd have a chance.</i>

436
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,976
<i>Let's go.</i>

437
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,096
Mao Chong.

438
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,539
<i>She dressed up so beautifully.</i>

439
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:40,800
<i>Mao Chong is really ungrateful.</i>

440
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Sit down, babe.

441
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,880
What do you want to eat? You can order.

442
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,359
Ningning, what do you want to have?

443
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,240
Anything, anything is fine.

444
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,319
It's all up to you.

445
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,400
I forgot to introduce you guys.
This is my girlfriend, Ningning.

446
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,184
Nice to meet you.

447
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:46,978
