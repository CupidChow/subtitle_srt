18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,360
Superstar Mao Chong,

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,480
practicing javelin here.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,919
Don't come over. I'll stab you to death.

21
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:54,944
Ok, fine.

22
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:02,320
Good job!

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,820
What's so good about it?
The tail hit the ground first.

24
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,440
No matter how far it gets, it doesn't count.

25
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,040
My posture was correct.

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,880
Why can't I always make it stab on the ground?

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
If you hold the javelin in reverse,

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,679
won't the head hit the ground first?

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,140
Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry.

30
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,440
Could you move a bit this way?

31
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,400
Thanks.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,688
Where's Wu Bi?

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,479
He's in the 100-meter preliminary.

34
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,520
He's already gone to check in.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,280
When's your race?

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,679
Tomorrow and the day after.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,056
Are you prepared?

38
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,880
I mean… well, it's like

39
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,552
I haven't prepared at all.

40
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,320
So silly.

41
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,460
On your marks.

42
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,860
Why are you still laughing?

43
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,519
Focus and listen to the command.

44
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,776
Get set.

<i>♫ Maybe it's not a coincidence ♫</i>

65
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,399
Seems like he broke the school's
previous 100-meter record.

66
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,728
This is just the group stage.

67
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,899
Wu Bi, you're amazing.

68
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,519
You scored 20 points for our class
as soon as you came on.

69
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,544
It's alright.

70
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,488
I'm amazing, right?

71
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,079
So sweet.

72
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,820
Look at that Zhang Yao,

73
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,319
still taking pictures of Su Yu.

74
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,279
Yes, she has been rejected so many times,

75
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,679
yet she still pines for him.

76
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,879
<i>This is not pining.</i>

77
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,239
<i>This is mutual love, not unrequited love.</i>

78
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,399
He's too handsome.

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,792
Look this way.

80
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,079
Look here. This way.

81
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,440
This way.

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,060
Look this way,

83
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,079
Over here.

84
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:31,840
So handsome.

85
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,864
Go, go.

86
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:34,280
Come on.

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go!

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,760
Go Su Yu! Go Su Yu.

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,880
Get the first place.

90
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,079
Go Su Yu.

91
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,000
Go Su Yu.

96
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,944
Hold on. Keep going.

97
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:55,959
Go!

98
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,260
Go Su Yu!

99
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,100
Go Su Yu!

100
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,224

Go!

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
Go Su Yu!

103

Go! Yu!

107
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:11,679
Go, go, let's go!

108

00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:17,880
Han Bokuang.

112
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,239
If you really can't do it, just get off track.

113
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,264
Really.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,480
<i>I hope you can finish the entire race.</i>

115
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:30,760
<i>Fellow students,</i>

116
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,940
<i>during my race,</i>

117
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,360
<i>please don't cheer for me,</i>

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,019
<i>and don't call out my name.</i>

119
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,079
<i>Just let me lose face in silence.</i>

120
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,019
<i>Thank you.</i>

121
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,260
Go, Su Yu!

122
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,880
Go, Su Yu!

123
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,896
<i>It's okay.</i>

124
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,720
<i>I'm still a fair distance from the last place.</i>

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,879
Go, Su Yu!

126
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,600
Look, what's going on here?

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
What… what's happening?

128
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,060
Aren't these three in the same group?

129
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,320
Right, they're clearly teaming up.

130
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:19,440
Calm down.

131
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,659
It's normal for this
to happen in a competition.

132
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,480
It's our fault for not being fully prepared.

133
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,679
We're currently in first place.

134
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,179
Your actions might ruin everything.

135
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't worry, I won't cause any trouble.

136
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
Strange, based on Su Yu's speed,

137
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,480
he should already be a lap ahead of me.

138
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,399
Why isn't he in sight yet?

139
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,860
Are they bullying us because we're outnumbered?

140
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,160
Su Yu, don't worry, I'm coming.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,279
Running like this is really exhausting.

142
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,120
I feel like my lungs are going to explode.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,559
Su Yu, you must keep going.

144
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,780
Go, Su Yu!

145
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,359
Go, Su Yu!

146
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,060
Go, Su Yu!

147
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,640
Go, Su Yu!

148
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,820
Go, Su Yu!

149
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,920
No need to chase them.

150
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,560
No need to chase.

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,700
Maintain your own speed and rhythm.

152
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,200
Hold out for three laps.

153
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,440
He can't outlast you.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
Calm down, calm down.

155
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,679
Go, Su Yu!

156
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,760
Go, Su Yu!

157
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,399
Go, Su Yu!

158
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,159
Go, Su Yu!

159
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,119
Go, Su Yu!

160
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,119
Go, Su Yu!

161
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,880
Go, Su Yu!

162
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,679
Go, Su Yu!

163
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,520
Go, Su Yu!

164
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,580
We're definitely going to be first.

165
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,719
No need to run so fast.

166
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,400
Is this how you cheer someone on?

167
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,919
Why speed up?

168
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,304
To break the record.

169
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,319
Take it easy, will you?

170
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:06,320
Don't act foolishly.

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,479
Just getting first place is enough.

172
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,679
Why do you need to break that record?

173
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,380
Even if there are bonus points,
they will be given to our class.

174
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,520
What's in it for you?

175
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,719
Can you stop nagging?

176
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,606
<i>♫ Perhaps it's for the best ♫</i>

177
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:26,656

The record is broken!

187
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,880
<i>♫ As always ♫</i>

188
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,576
<i>♫ Promise me to keep searching ♫</i>

189
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:57,792
<i>♫ Maybe it's not a coincidence ♫</i>

190
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:02,458
<i>♫ Dark clouds obscure every shining star ♫</i>

191
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,601
<i>♫ But the dawn will eventually come ♫</i>

192
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:08,443
<i>♫ As always ♫</i>

193
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:12,320
<i>♫ Promise me to keep searching ♫</i>

194
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:35,740
Quiet, be quiet.

195
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,840
They're back.

196
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,760
Great, that was amazing.

197
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,840
Guys, please quiet down.

198
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,960
This honor is hard-won.

199
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,599
I propose that our two heroes

200
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,980
perform a show for us

201
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,200
to celebrate, okay?

202
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:07,560
Do it together. Perform it together!

203
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,019
Zhang Yao is usually so quiet,

204
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,520
why is she so active now?

205
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,216
What should we perform?

206
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,679
You can dance together.

207
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,880
No way, I can't dance.

208
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:24,160
Let's sing a song together.

209
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,080
What should we sing?

210
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,136
What can you sing?

211
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,919
Let's sing "Goodbye Lonely Heart."

212
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,960
You know it too?

213
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Let's start.

214
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,840
♪ Goodbye, my old friend ♪

215
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,400
♪ It's time to go our separate ways ♪

216
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,080
♪ It feels so bittersweet ♪

217
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,359
♪ But you belong to yesterday ♪

218
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:12,320
<i>♫ I never could rely on you ♫</i>

219
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,719
<i>♫ You always seemed to make me blue ♫</i>

220
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:20,879
<i>♫ Goodbye lonely heart ♫</i>

221
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,460
<i>♫ Although I knew it all along ♫</i>

222
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,960
<i>♫ I was afraid of moving on ♫</i>

223
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,960
<i>♫ Goodbye lonely heart ♫</i>

224
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,000
<i>♫ I'm getting over
all the tears I used to cry ♫</i>

225
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,239
<i>♫ My lonely heart goodbye ♫</i>

226
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,160
Does it sound good? Sweetheart.

227
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,376
It does.

228
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:46,679
I don't want any.

229
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,340
Mama saved it all for you.

230
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,960
If it sounds good, shouldn't you reward Mama?

231
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,216
Good boy.

232
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,919
I remember the first time I sang this song,

233
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,600
you thought it was old-fashioned.

234
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
And now, you've learned to sing it.

235
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,479
I learned it a long time ago.

236
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,500
My mom loved this song.

237
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,039
It was always playing at home
when I was a child.

238
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,799
I learned it without even trying.

239
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,799
So, the first time you sang this song,

240
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,952
I noticed you.

241
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,420
Why did you sing this song anyway?

242
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,239
It's a song from the 90s.

243
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,072
Could it be because…

244
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:36,159
I heard it with my dad,

245
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,719
while we were strolling around Houhai.

246
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,920
There's a themed bar
that always plays this song.

247
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,300
I thought it was quite nice,

248
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,520
so I bought the cassette tape.

249
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,936
You have good taste.

250
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,280
Don't just eat rice. Eat some vegetables.

251
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,536
Come on, Duo.

252
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,119
I have an announcement to make.

253
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,359
I know, you guys are going to
open a shop together.

254
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,160
How did you know?

255
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,880
You guys have been mumbling about it
all the time, so how could I not know?

256
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,159
I really don't know

257
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,480
how much you have in your little head.

258
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,620
That's nice.

259
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,520
You guys won't have to live
hand to mouth anymore.

260
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,640
Have you chosen a location yet?

261
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,640
We're still looking for a place.

262
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,820
Location is so important

263
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,060
for a snack bar.

264
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,640
We need to look around carefully.

265
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,500
So your dad and I might be quite busy recently.

266
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,080
The three meals a day

267
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,040
might not be served on time.

268
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,479
If you two come back and get hungry,

269
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,679
just make do with something to eat.

270
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,696
It's okay.

271
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:47,296
I can cook.

272
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,280
And also,

273
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,919
Duo's school pick-up and drop-off.

274
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,960
You two get off school late.

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,540
I've talked to Xiaowu's mom.

276
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,080
No need, I can go home by myself.

277
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,800
A lot of my classmates
are going home by themselves.

278
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't need a pick-up,

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,799
and I can even pick them up.

280
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,960
Oh, you're so capable.

281
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,296
Then let's eat.

282
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,320
Let's dig in.

283
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,919
I also have an announcement to make.

284
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,840
Okay.

285
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,239
Children's Day is coming.

286
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,640
Our class requires

287
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,080
each parent to perform a program.

288
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,408
Well…

289
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,880
I decided to ask my two brothers
to perform a dance together.

290
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,256
Dance?

291
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:29,880
Can't we sing?

292
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,579
No, singing is not exciting enough.

293
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,760
I want to be the Queen of Children's Day,

294
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,400
making all my classmates envious

295
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,239
that I have such handsome two brothers.

296
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,840
It's not exciting enough.

297
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,000
I think, we can do it.

298
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:47,200
We can.

299
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,224
Very good.

300
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:49,720
Come on, let's make a big show.

301
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,060
Come on, cheers.

302
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,000
Cheers.

303
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,200
It's great when Mom is not around.

304
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,519
She rarely lets me watch TV,

305
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,039
and I can only watch cartoons if I do.

306
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,580
What's so good about cartoons?

307
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,840
So childish.

308
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,679
You understand me.

309
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,479
Do you like Ling'er or Yueru?

310
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,520
Sister Yueru.

311
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,128
Why?

312
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,880
The feeling of unrequited love.

313
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,528
What about you?

314
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,159
Of course, I like Li Xiaoyao.

315
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,280
It's about time for Mom and Dad to come back.

316
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,239
Should we switch to homework mode now?

317
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,039
Let me watch one more episode.

318
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,736
No way.

319
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,479
If I do my homework now,

320
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,719
when I'm done, you have to practice
dancing with Wu Bi.

321
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,800
You, you can keep watching.

322
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
Look at Duo,

323
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,199
usually, when I'm at home, I ask her
to do her homework when she comes back,

324
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,259
but she never listens.

325
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,599
Now that I'm not home, she's obedient.

326
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,000
It's good

327
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,960
for kids to have some interests.

328
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,239
Just let her watch.

329
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,959
Just spoil her.

330
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,620
It's really hard to find a location.

331
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,100
The places we've looked at

332
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,520
are either too far or too expensive.

333
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,319
Our money is just enough
for half a year's rent.

334
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:01,400
Yeah, this doesn't even include
the cost of procurement.

335
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,520
When it comes to opening a snack bar,

336
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
there's no way to break even in half a year.

337
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,920
We're a small business with a small profit.

338
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,800
If we can't get enough
customer traffic at the beginning.

339
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,680
I'm afraid it won't last half a year.

340
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,959
Let's continue the search tomorrow.

341
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,640
Alright, we'll look again tomorrow.

342
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:53,740
Hello?

343
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,752
Hello, bro.

344
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,980
I remember you have
a few storefronts vacant, right?

345
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,479
Yeah, what's up?

346
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:01,300
I have a friend who wants to open a snack bar.

347
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,440
He's looking for a storefront.

348
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,419
Why don't you rent yours to him?

349
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:05,472
Sure.

350
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,199
So, how's the rent?

351
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,239
That property has been vacant
for many years now.

352
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,256
It's just sitting there.

353
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,120
Just give it to him to use.

354
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,520
No. They won't take it for free.

355
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,839
You can decide on the price.
I have to go, I'm busy.

356
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,439
I don't have the time or the energy
to deal with that property.

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
Bro, is there a way

358
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,320
to rent the property at a low cost

359
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,199
without making them feel uncomfortable?

360
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,440
That's easy. You can become a partner.

361
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
A partner?

362
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,760
Yes, becoming a partner in the form of rent.

363
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,300
You get a share of the profits
from the business.

364
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,899
This way, you bear the initial risks and costs.

365
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:41,300
If the business does well,

366
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,439
you receive higher returns later.

367
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,340
I never thought of that.

368
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,880
You really have a businessman's mind.

369
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:48,640
What kind of friend is this?

370
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,560
You're planning so meticulously for them?

371
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,239
It's nothing. Go on with your work.

372
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,576
Five.

373
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,880
No, that's not right.

374
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,980
I…

375
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,520
I really can't do it.

376
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,040
Do that move again. You watch me.

377
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,839
Alright. Let's take a break.

378
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,439
Uncle, you're back so early today.

379
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,660
Did you find a place?

380
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,219
Really? Where is it?

381
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,179
It's in Hepingmen, not far from here.

382
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:18,272
Hepingmen?

383
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:19,936
Isn't that quite expensive?

384
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,600
Surprisingly, they didn't want any money.

385
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,640
No money?

386
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,119
I don't know anything about this.

387
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,719
They don't want rent.

388
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,839
They see this as an investment,

389
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,200
waiting for a share of the profits.

390
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,968
How do they know it'll definitely make money?

391
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:37,019
What if we lose money?

392
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,140
We won't.

393
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,700
That area is very popular.

394
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,880
- Every store that opens there succeeds.
- Yeah.

395
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,399
How can there be such a good thing?

396
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,000
It's not a scam, is it?

397
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,160
What do we have that they could scam?

398
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,256
Exactly.

399
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,624
By the way,

400
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,599
the most important thing is

401
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,000
there's a lottery station next door.

402
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,319
Dad, you're not going to use the snack bar

403
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,680
to support that lottery station, are you?

404
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,479
No, I'll keep an eye on him.

405
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,160
Be careful with your back.

406
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,224
It's fine.

407
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,039
Brother Wu Bi, I have something to tell you.

408
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,359
Don't tell Su Yu.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,400
I stole one of his novels.

410
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,160
I'm really into it.

411
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,240
So, that's where it's been all this time.

412
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,599
Promise me that you won't tell him.

413
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,500
I'll finish it really soon.

414
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,552
Okay.

415
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,800
He's been lacking

416
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,760
a good book for a while.

417
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,260
I've made up my mind.

418
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,399
I won't be a poet anymore.

419
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,560
I want to be a web novelist.

420
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,200
I want to be a big shot.

421
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,439
I want to turn our stories into a novel.

422
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,920
What do you think?

423
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,792
That's really good.

424
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,040
I'm so hungry.

425
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,680
What are we eating today?

426
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,920
I'll go make some noodles.

427
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,800
Ever since Dad and Auntie
went to set up the store,

428
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,719
we've been eating noodles
three out of every five days.

429
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,820
Isn't that great?

430
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,760
It reminds you of the taste of fatherly love
from your memory.

431
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,199
Fatherly love, huh?

432
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,139
I think you're asking for a beating.

433
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,336
Stop right there.

434
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,700
By the way.

435
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,920
I found the tenant information you mentioned.

436
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,960
Who?

437
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
The person who signed the contract
is named Zhou Li.

438
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:33,760
Female?

439
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,280
Yes, a middle-aged woman.

440
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,056
A middle-aged woman.

441
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,839
Is she running the store by herself?

442
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,079
No, she's partnering with her husband.

443
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,184
What's her husband's name?

444
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,079
I forget what exactly it is.

445
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,319
I heard that woman always calls him Su.

446
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,400
What do you feel like eating tonight?

447
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,488
Anything's fine.

448
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,040
How about we have noodles?

449
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,040
Brother, can we have something different?

450
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,000
This time it's different.

451
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,840
Didn't you guys complain that the noodles
we bought weren't tasty?

452
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,199
This time I'm making them from scratch.

453
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:50,160
Or, we could just eat something pre-made.

454
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,299
What do you mean?
Don't you trust my cooking skills?

455
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:56,620
Let me tell you,
I definitely have a knack for this.

456
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,920
I should've known better.

457
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,839
When you asked me earlier what I wanted to eat,

458
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:02,199
I should've given a clear answer

459
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,760
to completely dispel his idea
of causing mischief.

460
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,920
First, twist it like this.

461
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,660
Look, twist it over like this.

462
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,439
Twist it over here.

463
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:22,496
Here.

464
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:25,599
What about this?

465
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,620
Look, it's almost ready.

466
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,840
Su Yu.

467
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,040
Li Duo.

468
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,079
You…

469
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,144
Why did you call my name?

470
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,640
I just wanted to show you

471
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,439
that I've made the dough.

472
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,560
Brother Su Yu.

473
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,000
When will Brother Wu Bi be done cooking?

474
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Let me check.

475
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,239
It really is noodles.

476
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,719
Although they're a bit thick.

477
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,040
Why are you messing around?

478
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,040
That's not how you hold noodles.

479
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,700
Is there a particular way to hold noodles?

480
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,000
Doesn't Ms. Zhou hold them this way too?

481
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,144
And they don't break.

482
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,880
In the eyes of amateurs like you,

483
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,580
noodles can be handled any which way.

484
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,040
Only professionals like us

485
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,319
understand the intricacies.

486
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:05,472
See?

487
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,400
This is how you handle noodles.

488
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
I didn't see anything.

489
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,520
I got it wrong. Let's do it again.

490
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,119
The food at other people's houses
smells so good.

491
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:00,040
Is it ready yet?

492
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,912
What are you doing?

493
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,760
Are you making sauce?

494
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,359
The sauce my mom usually makes is this black.

495
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,336
Where are the noodles?

496
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,400
I've changed my mind.

497
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,500
Haven't you guys gotten tired of noodles?

498
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,839
Today, we're not having noodles.

499
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,760
We're having fried lumps.

500
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,080
Fry up some little lumps, huh?

501
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,479
Fry up some little lumps.

502
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,760
Lumps, lumps, lumpy lumps.

503
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,239
Lumpy, lumpy, lumpy lumps.

504
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:52,959
<i>What's going on?</i>

505
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,560
Where did Brother Wu Bi go?

506
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,959
He might have snuck off to dump
that dark culinary disaster.

507
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:03,160
Let's go check it out.

508
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,120
Let's go.

509
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,336
Mom.

510
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,520
Today was your birthday.

511
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,640
When I was younger and it was my birthday,

512
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,719
you would always make me
a bowl of hand-rolled noodles.

513
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,479
How I wish

514
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,479
on your birthday,

515
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:25,640
I could make you a bowl too.

516
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,959

He doesn't really like these kinds of events.

527
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:35,159
We don't want to expose him
to society too early.

528
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,920
But today is your birthday.

529
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,719
How can a son be absent?

530
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:43,439
We'll go back and celebrate
with him alone. Something simple.

531
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,119
Just a bowl of noodles.

532
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,072
Okay.
