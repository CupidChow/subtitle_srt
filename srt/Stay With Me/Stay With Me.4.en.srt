(Stay With Me)

17
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:33,410
(Episode 4)

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,008
Wu Bi!

19
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,016
Run!

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,279
Isn't it just those three punks?

21
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:56,960
Over there.

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,984
Over there!

23
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,000
Quick!

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,440
Oh my, so many of them!

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,239
Hurry, chase him!

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,480
It's him!

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,639
Chase! Don't run!

28
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,800
Why are you running? Stop!

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,919
Stop! Stop! Hurry! Catch up!

30
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:16,479
Still running? Kid, stop! Don't run! Stop!

31
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:20,672
Where is he?

32
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,680
Where did he go?

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Where is he? Check over there! Where?

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,440
Where did he go? No one here!

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,839
This kid

36
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,399
is definitely an Olympic champion talent.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,679
At a time like this, you're talking about this?

38
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,839
I used to be an athlete.

39
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,200
His speed is definitely within 11 seconds.

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,479
Within 11 seconds?

41
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,639
We, more than 20 people, can't catch him.

42
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,059
How can we survive in this area?

43
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,679
Chase! Over there!

44
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,600
Go! Go! Go! Chase! Chase!

45
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,479
Where did he run to?

46
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,960
He's over there? Chase!

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,360
Hurry! Stop! Chase! Stop!

48
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,224
Don't run!

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,408
Where is he?

50
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,392
Let's go!

51
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,408
Where did he run to?

52
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:39,744
Mom.

53
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,839
Sorry, I mistook him for someone else.

54
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been looking for you.

55
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:45,888
Here.

56
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:47,240
Brother Wu Bi.

57
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,440
What a coincidence. You go to school here?

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,512
Yes.

59
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,119
You're so young,

60
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,120
but why do you have such a good memory?

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
We only met once.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,639
Although we only met once,

63
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,820
I have a deep impression of you,

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,824
Why?

65
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,759
I don't know. I just feel very close to you.

66
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,919
Brother likes you too.

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,000
Where's your mom? Hasn't she picked you up yet?

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,919
My mom has to do the street vending
and doesn't have time to pick me up.

69
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,480
Uncle picks me up every day.

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
Uncle?

71
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,480
I see. When is your uncle
coming to pick you up?

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,180
Not sure. It depends on
whether Uncle has to work overtime

73
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,680
Sometimes at six.

74
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,099
Sometimes at six-thirty.

75
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,079
Anyway, I'm usually

76
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,000
the last one to leave.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,920
In that case, I will take you home today.

78
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
Then, you can get home earlier.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
You need to call Uncle and let him know.

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,440
Of course, let's go.

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,160
These punks are too troublesome.

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,920
No. I need to make a call.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,079
Hello, Uncle Li.

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,768
It's me, Wu Bi.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,880
I need you to arrange some bodyguards for me.

86
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:01,504
I need them.

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,399
Brother, did you call Uncle?

88
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,760
Why did his phone turn off?

89
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,119
Sir, Sir.

90
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:31,872
Hello.

91
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,519
Sir, my daughter hasn't come out yet,

92
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,880
but why is this door closed?

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,920
No way. I just took a walk around.

94
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,079
All the classrooms are empty.

95
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,119
Did you see a little girl this tall

96
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,780
with two braids?

97
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,359
The little girls all look similar.

98
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,140
How can I remember them so clearly?

99
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,399
Anyway, I know all the students have come out.

100
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,820
I watched them being picked up one by one.

101
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,359
You should look elsewhere.

102
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,559
What if Zhou Li picked her up?

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,480
My phone.

104
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,320
It always runs out of battery
at crucial moments.

105
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,872
You're back?

106
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,680
Has Duo not come back yet?

107
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,704
No.

108
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,760
Oh no, oh no.

109
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,020
Duo didn't come back with you?

110
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,440
No. What if she's caught by human traffickers?

111
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,640
She wouldn't. Duo is usually very sharp.

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,380
She wouldn't easily go with strangers.

113
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,120
Let's split up and look for her.

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,279
Split up and search, split up and search.

115
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,679
Where on earth did Wu Bi run to?

116
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,440
He couldn't have been beaten
by those punks, could he?

117
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,980
He can't beat more than twenty people
no matter how good he is at fighting!

118
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,096
Duo!

119
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,392
Duo!

120
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:52,500
What's wrong, Dad?

121
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,600
Duo!

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,704
Duo!

123
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,136
Duo!

124
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,864
Duo!

125
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,780
What happened?

126
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,020
Son, Duo is missing.

127
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,860
Hurry up and go with Dad to look for her.

128
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,380
Missing? How did she go missing?

129
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,040
I went to her school to pick her up.

130
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,320
When I got to the school gate,
there was no one there.

131
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,640
I was thinking she's just a child

132
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,920
and she has no relatives in Beijing.

133
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,240
If she really goes missing,
how can I explain it to Ms. Zhou?

134
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,320
Uncle.

135
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,112
Duo.

136
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,032
Duo.

137
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,900
Where have you been?

138
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,480
You scared me off.

139
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,160
You scared me off.

140
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,880
Why did you bring her back?

141
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,200
What a coincidence.

142
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,120
I was being chased to the school gate.

143
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,279
I just mixed in with the parents.

144
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,060
It turns out she was at that elementary school.

145
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,020
So I thought I'd take her home on the way.

146
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,320
And then I'd call Uncle.

147
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,359
But I couldn't get through.

148
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,839
Duo, where have you been?

149
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,119
I was so worried.

150
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,799
You can't run around like that anymore.

151
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,040
If you didn't know,

152
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:09,040
you'd think he was her real dad.

153
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,496
Are you okay?

154
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,200
If I had a problem, could I still stand here?

155
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,680
I think those guys won't let it go.

156
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,912
What's there to be afraid of?

157
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,440
I'll deal with them sooner or later.

158
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,080
Duo, you must not
go with strangers in the future.

159
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,500
If you really get lost,

160
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,220
your mom would be so worried.

161
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,280
Did you hear that?

162
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,980
But I said Duo can't be lost.

163
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,880
This child is usually very clever.

164
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,039
She can't easily go with others.

165
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,440
Uncle, I'm sorry.

166
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,900
It's my fault for taking Duo back

167
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,440
before letting you know.

168
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,479
It's not Brother's fault.

169
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,679
It was me who asked Brother to take me home.

170
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,800
It's okay. I know you meant well.

171
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,919
If you want to blame someone,

172
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,860
you can only blame my broken phone.

173
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,440
It always runs out of battery
at crucial moments.

174
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,880
Let's not talk about that.
The child is safe anyway.

175
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,960
Stay here. I will make dinner for you.

176
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,719
Well, that's nice.

177
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,952
It's late.

178
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,440
What's going on with Uncle?

179
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,520
Lottery. Only 15 minutes left
before they close.

180
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,980
Let's go. I'll take off your backpack.

181
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,200
Go help Mom cook.

182
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,400
It'll be ready soon.

183
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,984
Mom.

184
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:51,488
Brother, I want to play with you.

185
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:52,608
Where's Brother Wu Bi?

186
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:53,719
In your room.

187
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,960
Who let you mess with my stuff?

188
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:23,359
So what if just took a look?

189
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,544
Get out.

190
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,680
Get out.

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,799
Dad, why did you develop two of this?

192
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,660
I thought you looked good in this photo,

193
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,840
so I developed one more.

194
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,400
Dad, are you going to give
the other photo to someone else?

195
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,380
After a few days,

196
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,159
you're supposed to have a birthday, right?

197
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,260
Your mom hasn't seen you for several years.

198
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,280
She misses you.

199
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,180
She wants--

200
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,880
She doesn't want me anymore.
What does she want my photo for?

201
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Stop it. Stop it.

202
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,039
Give it to me.

203
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,119
Listen to Dad.

204
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,136
Duo!

205
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,960
Duo, where have you been?

206
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,559
You scared me off.

207
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,840
Duo, you must not
go with strangers in the future.

208
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,340
If you really get lost,

209
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,940
your mom would be so worried.

210
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,960
Did you hear that?

211
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,679
Mom.

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,064
Mom.

213
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,272
Mom.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,359
Son, Dad has to go too.

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,400
From now on, this home will only have you.

216
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,919
Dad, where are you going?

217
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,960
Dad. Dad!

218
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,599
Dad. Dad!

219
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,679
Dad. Dad!

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,320
Some of our classmates

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,479
always guard against the teachers.

222
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,512
What do you mean?

223
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you study for the teachers?

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,760
If you ranked last in the class,

225
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,780
it has nothing to do with me.

226
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,400
But you have a big problem.

227
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,919
Don't think the teachers don't know anything.

228
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,119
The teachers know everything,

229
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,599
but they just don't want to deal with you.

230
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Why not put your efforts into studying?

231
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,919
Pretending to be a wolf all day.

232
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,119
Sir, why are you scolding me?

233
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,060
What are you laughing at?

234
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,100
Just play your tricks.

235
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,264
The class begins.

236
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,760
Show me how you guys run.

237
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,840
Can't run this time, right?

238
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,112
Run, run.

239
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:51,020
Run with me.

240
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,880
Chase! Still running? Chase.

241
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,952
Keep running, won't you?

242
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:20,220
Go.

243
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,559
What's going on?

244
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,320
Where did all these bodyguards come from?

245
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,160
I guess the school's security
hasn't been good lately.

246
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,159
So, the school found someone
to protect the students.

247
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,400
That's too much of a coincidence.

248
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,559
Never mind. As long as we're okay. Let's go.

249
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,560
Why are you so free lately?

250
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,640
Always coming to see me when you're free.

251
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,736
What about your deskmate?

252
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,520
He's always been with Wu Bi recently.

253
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,799
He's forgotten about me.

254
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,280
Don't mention Wu Bi to me.

255
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,719
Every time you mention it, my body aches.

256
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,060
He's always coming to our class lately.

257
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,760
He must be into you too.

258
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,500
No. He's just on better terms
with Han Bokuang.

259
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,072
Han Bokuang, wipe the blackboard.

260
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:20,179
On my way.

261
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,400
I'll help him.

262
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,239
We arrived.

263
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,400
Go.

264
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,959
Can I skip the shot?

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,159
You have a fever of 40 degrees.

266
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,320
You have to get the shot.

267
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,920
What about you being the patient
and I being the doctor?

268
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,319
How did we agree?

269
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,580
You'll be the patient first
and I'll be the doctor.

270
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,240
Then I'll be the patient
and you'll be the doctor.

271
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,599
Do you want to play it or not?
If not, leave now.

272
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,660
I'll play. I'll play.

273
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,784
Lie down.

274
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,160
After you give me the shot,
I have to give you one.

275
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
Fine, lie down.

276
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,119
What's wrong with these two kids?

277
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,439
Mom! Li Duo, where are you?

278
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:10,479
When will you finish the shot?

279
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,599
Li Duo, where are you?

280
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,459
I just can't figure it out.

281
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:42,979
How can you

282
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:44,520
play with that Wu Bi?

283
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,479
Just looking at him,

284
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,400
I feel creepy.

285
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,280
He's just slow to warm up.

286
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,312
Once you are familiar, it'll be fine.

287
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,000
Actually, he's quite righteous.

288
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,719
But that doesn't fit your friendship principle.

289
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,199
What friendship principle do I have?

290
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,379
For students with good grades like you,

291
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,079
shouldn't you play with those
who have good grades?

292
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,680
Why should I play with those
who have good grades?

293
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:14,079
Besides, will his grades be better than mine?

294
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,448
That's true.

295
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,640
How's it between you
and that girl from Taiwan province, China?

296
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,740
Her? She changed her strategy.

297
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,539
Probably found out that
picking on me didn't work,

298
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,860
so she started being nice to me again.

299
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,299
Buying me snacks,

300
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,440
teaching me,

301
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,700
and wiping the blackboard for me.

302
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,760
Think about it,

303
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,339
there's so much chalk dust

304
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,700
and she cares so much about her look.

305
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,800
If it's not true love, what is it?

306
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Really?

307
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,940
Really.

308
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,420
The whole class could tell it.

309
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,959
It's all the rage.

310
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,560
If you don't believe it, go ask around.

311
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,839
Good for you.

312
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:50,000
But when she took the initiative,

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,940
I didn't like her as much.

314
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,279
People

315
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,959
really can't gain what they want easily.

316
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,380
Xiaowu, don't cry. Listen to me.

317
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,060
Hurry home.

318
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,119
It's getting late.

319
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,399
Your mom has already cooked
and is waiting for you at home.

320
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,760
If you don't go home, your mom will be worried.

321
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,839
Little boy.

322
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,400
Don't cry, okay?

323
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,080
- Don't cry, don't cry, okay?
- What's wrong, Dad?

324
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,640
What's wrong?

325
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,119
Nothing. Two kids were playing house
and got into a fight.

326
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,319
You guys came just in time.
Hurry up and cheer him up.

327
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,560
I was in the middle of cooking.

328
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,599
Alright, alright.

329
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,520
I was going to give Li Duo a shot.

330
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,680
She won't let me after she's done.

331
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,419
Take it slow, take it slow.

332
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:34,439
After she gave me a shot,
she won't let me do it.

333
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,719
There, there.

334
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,199
He hasn't left yet?

335
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,920
Yeah, he's crying so sadly.

336
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,520
Why don't you comfort him?

337
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,279
No way. If I go out now,
I'll be turning myself in.

338
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,000
He's holding back, waiting to give me a shot.

339
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,200
Why don't you give him half of the candy?

340
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,260
No way. He's already so fat.

341
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,839
If I keep feeding him, I'm harming him.

342
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,199
Will you stop crying, please?

343
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,640
Xiaowu, what about you give me a shot?

344
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,240
No, two shots, okay?

345
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,159
I don't want to.
I just want to give Li Duo a shot.

346
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,599
Xiaowu, we men should show

347
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,359
our manly spirit and chivalry, right?

348
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,280
We'd rather be hit by women,

349
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,760
but we can't hit women, right?

350
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:43,479
Stop crying.

351
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:46,680
After she's done,
it's my turn to get her a shot.

352
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,560
Kid, you can keep crying here.

353
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,800
It's seven o'clock.

354
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,920
I have to watch the news.

355
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,800
Come on, come on.

356
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,120
Wait.

357
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,300
Why is your school uniform so outdated?

358
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,780
What kind of talk is that?

359
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,880
Even being outdated can't hide

360
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,760
the noble aura of Young Master Wu.

361
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,520
You didn't even tell us
when you transferred schools.

362
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,319
Ever since you left, class two has wilted.

363
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Wang Yang from class six

364
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,599
used to be like a coward when you were here.

365
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,620
Now he's all cocky all day.

366
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,760
Yeah, when are you coming back?

367
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,940
Ever since you left,

368
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,300
Yaoyao changed her QQ's name

369
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,599
to Panpan.

370
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,360
Our classmates

371
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,620
now call her panda.

372
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,239
Her eyes have darkened from waiting for you.

373
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm not coming back.

374
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,600
Really? You're serious?

375
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,300
Experiencing life is enough.

376
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,100
You really see yourself as a commoner now.

377
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,140
Don't let the real young master
suffer hardships outside,

378
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,599
while the fake one acts arrogantly at home.

379
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:44,880
You haven't met
your stepmother's son yet, have you?

380
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,519
Don't let me see him.

381
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,359
If I see him, I'll kill him.

382
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,900
Come on, come on. As we finally reunited,

383
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,112
let's not talk about this.

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,040
Fine, fine, I got it.

385
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,659
My mom is so annoying.

386
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,000
She called me three times,
urging me to go home during dinner.

387
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,319
Be content with what you have.

388
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,800
Your mom just calls you at most.

389
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,599
My mom sends the driver to follow me.

390
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,240
See?

391
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,320
The driver is waiting outside the door
before I even finish eating.

392
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,480
Afraid that if she doesn't watch me closely,
I'll run away.

393
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,000
My mom even applied for a QQ account

394
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,160
and added me as a friend.

395
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,760
Fortunately, I discovered it early,

396
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,600
or the consequences would be unimaginable.

397
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,100
Your mom sure has a lot of free time.

398
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,480
My mom only controls my spending.

399
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,199
She never interferes with my friendships.

400
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,260
So, are we still going to the arcade later?

401
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,839
Yeah. Why not?

402
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,319
The driver is your mom's spy.

403
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,199
Can he take us to the arcade?

404
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,560
Nonsense. He's here to pick me up.

405
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,760
Of course, he will drive us
to wherever I say to go.

406
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,500
Last time, you spent my 6,000 yuan for a night.

407
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,520
This time, I have to make you spend much.

408
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,580
It is nothing.

409
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,079
You guys go ahead. I will pass.

410
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,319
Don't be like that. It's no fun without you.

411
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,328
Don't leave.

412
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
Brother Wu Bi.

413
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,599
Wu Bi, why haven't you gone home yet?

414
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,040
I went out to play with my classmates.

415
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Did you eat?

416
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,808
I did.

417
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,728
But I didn't get full.

418
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,320
I will cook some noodles for you, okay?

419
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Alright.

420
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,199
Sit there. It'll be ready soon.

421
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,576
Okay.

422
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,119
Serve the noodles to your brother.

423
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:08,128
Hold it.

424
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,959
I'll do it. It's hot.

425
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:12,920
It's not. I often help my mom carry bowls.

426
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,080
That's great.

427
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,160
Wu Bi, why aren't you eating?

428
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
Don't you like this?

429
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:36,719
My mom used to make this for me all the time.

430
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,192
Her sauce

431
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
is just like yours.

432
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:45,079
There are only a few types
of sauce for the noodles.

433
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,800
Hurry up and eat while it's hot.

434
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,880
A bowl of noodles on such a cold day

435
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,599
keeps you warm, right?

436
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,439
Li Duo's mom.

437
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,420
What's up, Xiaowu's mom?

438
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,079
Come and see what your daughter has done.

439
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,719
She made our son's butt
bleed from the injection.

440
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,860
Come here and take a look.

441
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,064
What happened?

442
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:09,199
Take a look.

443
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,820
Duo, what did you do again?

444
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,760
I didn't want to interfere with kids' matters,

445
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,599
but your daughter is way too much.

446
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,119
This has happened several times already.

447
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,359
The last time our son's hand got cut,
I didn't say anything.

448
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,920
This time, she made his butt bleed.

449
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,400
- Duo.
- What if leaving a scar? How will he get married?

450
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,700
Apologize to him quickly. Now.

451
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,768
I won't.

452
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:30,240
Why are you so disobedient?

453
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,392
Hurry up and apologize.

454
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:33,680
I won't. He said I don't have a father

455
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,400
Who's knocking at the door so late?

456
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,072
Uncle.

457
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:08,440
Why did you carry her here?

458
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,568
Where's Ms. Zhou?

459
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,640
Ms. Zhou took Duo's classmate to the clinic.

460
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,359
It's cold outside. Come in quickly.

461
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,400
Alright, hurry up.

462
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:29,680
What's the situation with Duo's dad?

463
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:36,832
He's in jail

464
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,000
for armed robbery.

465
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,792
He even injured someone.

466
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,959
He was sentenced to more than ten years.

467
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
When did this happen?

468
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
The year before last.

469
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,359
Duo was only five years old then.

470
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,079
Does she know about her father's situation?

471
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,560
She doesn't know.

472
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,400
Ms. Zhou has been keeping it from her.

473
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,920
When she asks about him,

474
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,479
Aunt Zhou just says he's gone abroad.

475
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,239
She's been asking less and less lately.

476
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Probably she has already been used to it.

477
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,040
Why can't

478
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,760
we have a complete family?

479
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,904
We?

480
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,400
My mom passed away more than six years ago.

481
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,104
But until now,

482
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,199
I still can't accept the reality.

483
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,319
My mom was a sculptor.

484
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,560
She had many works in her lifetime.

485
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,560
My favorite piece

486
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,920
is a statue of a little boy.

487
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,439
My mom said it was
for her friend's son's birthday.

488
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,959
So she made the statue as a birthday gift.

489
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,680
But she passed away

490
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,319
before she could give it to him.

491
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,719
Do you know why I like that statue?

492
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,520
Because it was my mom's last work.

493
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,760
Even now,

494
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,280
I can still feel my mom's warmth.

495
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,640
What a coincidence.

496
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,680
The little boy my mom sculpted

497
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,359
looks a lot like you.

498
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,120
He also

499
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,319
has a mole on his ear.

500
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,480
So when I first met you,

501
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,139
I felt a special connection.

502
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,760
That's why you always went against me.

503
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,079
Why did you hit me for no reason?

504
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,100
I didn't know
the sculpture was a real sculpture.

505
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,239
I thought you were teasing me.

506
