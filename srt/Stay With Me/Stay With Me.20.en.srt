17
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,378
(Episode 20)

18
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,760
Brother, which one is Gemini?

19
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,839
Which one is Sagittarius?

20
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:09,632
Well,

21
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:12,219
your dad gave you a car for your birthday.

22
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,759
Why didn't you seem happy?

23
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,759
Your dad gave you a car?

24
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,399
You can take us for a ride, right?

25
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,960
Not before I get my driver's license.

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,440
Then why aren't you happy?

27
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,640
It's nothing.

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,279
He has loads of these.

29
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,279
He can buy a car whenever he wants.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,440
There's no sincerity in this.

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
Be content.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,279
What my dad gave me was a lottery ticket.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,619
What your dad gave you was hope.

34
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:45,119
Stop arguing.

35
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,559
Didn't you ever learn a text in school?

36
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,559
It's called
"The Duck and the Goose Host a Feast".

37
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,039
The duck and the goose
were swimming in the river.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,160
The goose said, I've found something delicious.

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,100
Please come to my house.

40
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,399
Then, the duck visited the goose.

41
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,880
The goose took out
fresh grass roots and sprouts.

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,120
The duck left unhappily,

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
thinking, "why did it
treat me to such lousy things?"

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,299
The next day, the duck
invited the goose to its house.

45
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:19,320
It prepared its beloved snails and eels.

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,039
But the goose said,

47
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,520
"I'm sorry. I only like
grass roots and sprouts."

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,240
Keep these for yourself.

49
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,919
The duck understood.

50
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,200
Others may not necessarily like what you like.

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,320
The goose had already taken out
its most beloved food

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,800
to treat it.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,240
So the duck said,

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,360
"I will find some grass roots and sprouts."

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,839
"Let's eat together."

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,376
So, they have already taken out
their best things

57
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:46,479
for you.

58
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,960
You should stop being picky.

59
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,880
Did you hear that?
Even a single child knows it.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,460
If you put it that way,

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,320
doesn't that mean your mom did nothing wrong?

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,979
She loves money.
She naturally hopes you live a wealthy life.

63
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,160
Then why won't you accept it?

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,000
That's a different matter.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,679
Brother, I want to see Pisces.

66
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,320
Let me check.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,860
We've paid so much money,

68
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,440
but we only received a little.

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,160
It's not enough for me to vent.

70
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,200
Don't say such words, bro.

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,480
Or else, I'll share some with you.

72
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,600
What's the point of doing the same questions?

73
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,480
Can you tell if the questions are different?

74
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,519
No matter how many times I do,

75
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,720
it's like in vain.

76
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,020
Don't worry,

77
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,360
you won't have to rely on this

78
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
to make a living in the future.

79
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,448
Well,

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,280
should I also enroll in
an art exam training program this summer?

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,239
Next year, I will also take the exams for
Central Academy of Drama and Beijing Film Academy.

82
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,784
Sounds reliable.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,359
You are going to be senior.

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,380
What should you do during this holiday?

85
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,200
Students, you don't need me
to remind you, right?

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,936
School's over.

87
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,464
Holiday's started.

88
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:45,600
Your noodles.

89
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,040
Here's your menu.

90
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:54,280
Su,

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,959
you're employing child labor.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
It's fine if Duo comes to play,

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,299
but don't let those two come.

94
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,799
They are about to be senior.

95
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:11,399
Don't let their studies be delayed.

96
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,840
This is not my doing.

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
They wanted to come themselves.

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,179
We're not working for free.

99
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,800
It's "work-study balance."

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,959
You need to pay us at the end of the month.

101
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,160
Look, look.

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,959
Right, we need to save up for our trip.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Right?

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,608
Alright, you bet.

105
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:29,660
Take this over now.

106
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,120
It is hot. I'll do it.

107
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,128
Okay.

108
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,768
Is there no menu?

109
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,559
Here's your menu.

110
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll have the braised noodles then.

111
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,679
Mom, Wu Bi's father is here.

112
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,239
He wants to eat braised noodles.

113
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:23,808
Waiter, the bill please.

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,600
How much is it?

115
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,656
Twenty yuan in total.

116
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,079
Then just make him whatever he wants.

117
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,752
Right.

118
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,608
I'll do it.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,104
Take this to your dad.

120
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,920
The taste is not bad.

121
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,880
It tastes like what your mom made.

122
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:27,776
We're doomed.

123
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,408
What's wrong?

124
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,720
He said the noodles you made
taste like his ex-wife's.

125
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,359
Isn't it good that he likes it?

126
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,424
What's good about it?

127
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,359
I already have an ex-wife who went with him.

128
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,599
What are you thinking about?

129
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:04,832
(Zhou's Snacks)

130
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,328
It tastes good.

131
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,232
Are you alright?

132
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:41,856
I'm fine.

133
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
He didn't say anything to you, did he?

134
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,960
No. He just had a bowl of noodles and left.

135
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,919
I am exhausted for toiling for a day.

136
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,919
I'm saying,
"I am exhausted for toiling for a day."

137
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,440
You are not tired after lifting
fifty or sixty kilograms of dumbbells

138
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,979
dozens of times back and forth,

139
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:21,320
but you're already tired
for carrying a few plates.

140
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,960
Work and exercise are not the same.

141
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,239
It's true.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,340
My back is sore.

143
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,159
Why don't you help me stretch my muscles?

144
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,000
You're tired and I'm not?

145
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,440
Then I'll help you stretch.

146
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,928
Stop it.

147
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,359
It's not like we haven't done it before.

148
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:55,008
Easy.

149
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:57,632
(Zhou's Snacks)

150
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,720
I'm going to go out for supplies.

151
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,359
You two take good care of the restaurant.

152
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,416
Okay.

153
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,280
Why is your dad here again?

154
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,656
How should I know?

155
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:23,680
Here it is.

156
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,280
I used to not see him for a long time,

157
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,760
but why is he so free now?

158
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:28,640
Sit here.

159
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,664
Okay.

160
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:30,720
Order.

161
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,359
Come on. Have a seat.

162
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Little girl, order.

163
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,904
Look.

164
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,840
Yes.

165
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,280
We'll have six bowls of noodles
and a portion of braised beef.

166
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,368
What about you?

167
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,419
Whatever. You guys order.

168
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,536
Okay.

169
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,416
Then let's have a large mixed vegetable dish.

170
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,479
Okay, okay.

171
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,496
That's all.

172
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,200
The noodles are good.

173
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,559
It's hand-rolled noodles. Very chewy.

174
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,200
I usually eat too much meat and fat,

175
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,239
and just want to eat this.

176
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Isn't that Wu Bi?

177
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,520
Wu Bi.

178
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,919
Is it your son, Mr. Wu?

179
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,359
Yes, my son.

180
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,799
Is this your own noodle restaurant?

181
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,840
Mr. Wu doesn't have that time.

182
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,320
Mr. Wu, is he doing work-study here?

183
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,919
I didn't ask him to come here,
but he insisted on coming.

184
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,799
Mr. Wu, your son

185
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,019
is willing to work-study in a place like this.

186
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,800
What a good boy, right?

187
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,139
That's right. Yes.

188
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,159
Mr. Wu, how did you educate him?

189
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,440
For my little brat,

190
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
don't mention work-study.

191
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,880
It's already a blessing
if he isn't extravagant.

192
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,799
Brother Wu Bi, they are praising you.

193
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,160
I know.

194
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,952
Dig in.

195
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,740
Try this. I cooked it.

196
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,919
Stir-fried pork with green peppers.

197
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,960
The seasoning is just right.

198
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,799
Well done. Only working for a few days,

199
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,080
and you've already mastered it.

200
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,392
Delicious.

201
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:28,500
Eat more.

202
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,960
Look, what did I tell you?

203
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,679
There's no father in the world

204
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,100
who doesn't care about his own child.

205
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,479
Your father

206
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,379
has visited our restaurant twice already.

207
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:39,039
Yeah. You even said
your dad didn't approve of you.

208
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,720
He praised me through others' mouths.

209
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,239
He's really trying hard.

210
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,440
Some men just aren't good at
expressing themselves.

211
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,400
Aren't you just like your dad?

212
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,100
Your dad never praised you,

213
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,400
but have you ever praised your dad?

214
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,136
I won.

215
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,679
You may be smarter than me,

216
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,880
but your tongue isn't as flexible as mine.

217
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:20,980
Again.

218
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,039
Still not convinced?

219
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,520
Brother, I found a treasure
in the small statue.

220
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,672
What treasure?

221
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,359
This is evidence that Hongsheng Company
colluded with Xincheng Company

222
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,919
to switch the batch of goods.

223
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,208
What switch?

224
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,140
What evidence?

225
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,699
Your mom got the evidence before she died.

226
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,080
She had no reason to commit suicide.

227
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,640
Fifty, fifty-three.

228
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,820
Where are you going?

229
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,140
We have important business to handle.

230
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,280
Stay at home.

231
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,079
Did you get through on the phone?

232
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,619
No. It's busy.

233
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,340
Are you sure your dad is at the company?

234
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,440
Let's check first.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Today's order is very important.

236
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,760
Hongsheng Group has been watching closely.

237
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,940
There can't be any mistakes.

238
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,000
Don't worry.

239
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,600
We are very well prepared.

240
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,599
As long as you negotiate sincerely,
there will be no problem.

241
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:17,799
Why are you here?

242
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,960
I have something important to tell you.

243
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,344
I have more important things to do.

244
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:22,440
I don't have time for you.

245
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,239
Uncle, this matter is really important today.

246
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,880
We hope you can give us a few minutes to talk.

247
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,300
Why are you messing around with him?

248
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,440
I have an important client to meet.

249
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,560
I can't waste time.

250
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,080
What client is more important than my mother?

251
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,152
What are you talking about?

252
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:41,792
Here.

253
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,160
Where did you find this?

254
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,320
In this small statue.

255
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,679
So, are we still meeting Mr. Ma today?

256
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,920
What do you think?

257
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,200
Then we are going…

258
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,336
To the police station.

259
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,679
Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry to bother you again.

260
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,344
Mr. Wu,

261
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:06,680
haven't you watched
the traffic accident video of your wife

262
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,139
many times?

263
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:10,119
That place is a blind spot for surveillance.

264
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,040
I want to see the driving trajectory
before her accident.

265
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,240
Okay.

266
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,560
Who left this?

267
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,208
I'm not sure.

268
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,040
I went out to feed Dalang just now.

269
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,319
When I came back,

270
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,760
this letter was already here.

271
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,680
Who came here this afternoon?

272
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,400
Your sister came.

273
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,539
You weren't there at the time.

274
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,199
And then she left after a while.

275
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,520
How long it has been since she left?

276
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,319
About an hour ago.

277
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,740
Wu Bi, I'm sorry.

278
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,239
You need to live a good life with your dad.

279
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,640
I have evidence of Hongsheng Group's fraud.

280
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,740
Bring a million in cash to Baige Bridge.

281
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,359
Don't withdraw money with your own card.

282
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,740
Don't tell anyone.

283
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,839
Time waits for no one.

284
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,719
This is her record
passing this intersection twice.

285
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,659
In other words,

286
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,000
on the day when Ms. Mo had an accident,

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,400
she left the city and then returned.

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,620
She definitely had something to do.

289
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,400
Otherwise, she wouldn't have passed
the same place twice.

290
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,320
This also proves either this incident

291
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,599
was a traffic accident,

292
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
or murder.

293
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,839
There is no possibility of suicide.

294
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,439
Mr. Zhang, I just found out
that there is more money

295
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,440
in Zhou Shu's account.

296
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,160
This kid might have leaked the information.

297
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,820
Where is he? Have you contacted him?

298
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,839
I can't get in touch.

299
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,900
Have you sent someone to watch Wu Zhenghao?

300
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,560
Yes, he's been in the company
and hasn't gone out.

301
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,720
But his wife

302
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,239
left the city for no reason today.

303
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,719
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go.

304
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:44,896
(Receipt)

305
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,500
No. It's too dangerous to take this.

306
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,680
What if something goes wrong?

307
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,520
What do I do then?

308
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,752
Mr. Zhang,

309
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,339
thank you.

310
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,400
You're welcome.

311
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,359
I will definitely be responsible for this case.

312
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,680
If I remember correctly,

313
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,959
this hit-and-run driver's

314
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,839
sentence isn't up yet, right?

315
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,800
Yes. He was a hit-and-run driver.

316
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,040
His sentence will not be up until next year.

317
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Contact the lawyer.

318
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,960
Ok, I got it.

319
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,280
Stop mulling over. Go to sleep.

320
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,839
Su Yu, I'm scared.

321
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,239
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

322
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,288
I'll pick it up.

323
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:33,400
Wu Bi, your dad can
give you an explanation now.

324
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,760
Mom, mom!

325
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,280
Mom, mom!

326
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,344
Don't cry.

327
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:11,904
(Grave of beloved wife Mo Renci)

328
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,119
The hit-and-run driver

329
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,296
confessed everything.

330
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,880
Zhou Shu has also been found.

331
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,504
Zhang Hongsheng

332
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,959
has also been put on file for investigation.

333
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,199
What's the point of saying such things now?

334
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,472
Renci,

335
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,359
can you hear me?

336
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,280
Can you forgive me?

337
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:02,959
I'm sorry.

338
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,199
I didn't take good care of your mother.

339
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,180
Wu never let me get involved in

340
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,000
the company's affairs before.

341
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,280
I thought he was looking down on my abilities.

342
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,719
Now I know

343
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,500
he was protecting me.

344
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,520
Sis, actually Mr. Wu is quite good to you.

345
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
He is just not good at expressing.

346
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,719
I used to be quite jealous of his ex-wife.

347
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,239
I felt that Zhenghao only had her in his heart.

348
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,359
Now that I know the truth,

349
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,000
I feel quite ashamed.

350
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,680
Before her accident,

351
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,439
she was still thinking of
giving me a little sculpture.

352
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,880
I have only met her a few times,

353
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,640
but she cared so much about my son.

354
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,920
But now, what I do for her son

355
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,560
is really not enough.

356
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,520
She makes me feel ashamed.

357
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,959
Sis, don't think like that.

358
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,719
You've been so good to Wu Bi.

359
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,199
We've all seen it.

360
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,160
Besides, there are still so many days ahead.

361
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,000
Zhenghao, why are you here?

362
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,640
I came to have a look.

363
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,140
Sis, I'll leave you.

364
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,520
Mr. Wu, I'm leaving.

365
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,024
I'm really sorry,

366
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,160
I bought this yard without your consent.

367
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,280
I thought the kids could come live here.

368
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,288
I didn't expect…

369
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,640
It's okay. Isn't this great?

370
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,959
Weren't you going to a meeting?

371
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,288
I didn't attend.

372
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,040
It has been a long time
since we had a meal together.

373
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,760
(Zhou's Snacks)
Easy, watch the step.

374
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,720
There is soup in here. In case of spilling it.

375
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,359
Push it in.

376
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,008
Let's go.

377
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,536
Easy, easy.

378
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,296
Okay.

379
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:44,384
Be careful.

380
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,599
I told you to hire someone early on,

381
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,680
but you insisted on using the kids.

382
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,000
Look how good it is now.

383
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,119
The kids are freed,

384
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,940
and we don't have to rush around anymore.

385
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,280
There weren't so many customers at first.

386
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,440
Look at it now.

387
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,568
Look at this.

388
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
As Wu Bi lives in our house,

389
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,300
his dad gave us such a big order.

390
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,259
He definitely wants his son to live better.

391
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,740
We can't treat him badly.

392
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,520
Of course, we can't treat him badly.

393
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,260
Most importantly,

394
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,239
he's not just doing it for his son.

395
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,160
It's because your cooking is good.

396
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,599
Sweet talk, huh?

397
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,219
By the way, my mom called.

398
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:21,860
She said she wasn't feeling well recently.

399
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm thinking of going home
in a few days to check on her.

400
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,020
Do you need me to accompany you?

401
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,760
The restaurant can't be left unmanned.

402
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,239
Besides, there are two kids at home.

403
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,919
I'll go by myself.

404
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,339
What about Duo?

405
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,400
I'll take Duo.

406
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,599
Grandma loves her the most.

407
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,740
She definitely wants to see her.

408
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,800
Okay, then be careful on the road.

409
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,680
I'm here. Don't worry.

410
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,000
Put it up there. Be careful.

411
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,032
Is there any more?

412
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,152
Yes.

413
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:46,304
- Hurry, hurry.
- Is there any more?

414
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,359
Duo, don't take so many books.
They're too heavy.

415
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,480
I can carry them.

416
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,479
Look, we're going to

417
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,880
accompany grandma and take care of her.

418
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,760
You won't have time to read so many books.

419
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,800
I'll read novels and tell stories to grandma.

420
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,079
Maybe her illness will get better.

421
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,319
Take them then.

422
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,359
Come on. Let me do it.

423
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,904
My girl,

424
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,920
remember to call me if you miss me.

425
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,760
Don't secretly eat candy.
Wait until I come back.

426
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Got it.

427
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,120
What candy?

428
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,840
She likes sweets, right?

429
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,920
She's afraid we'll eat secretly.

430
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
What are you looking for?

431
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,320
I put eight quail eggs.

432
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,719
We agreed to have four each one.

433
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,680
I only ate three. How come

434
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,839
there's none left?

435
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,280
Nonsense. I didn't eat that many.

436
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,359
Did you eat them secretly?

437
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,280
You're the one who ate them secretly.

438
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,120
It was you who ate them.

439
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,199
You ate them.

440
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,780
You ate them secretly.

441
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,480
It's nothing if you ate them.

442
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,664
It was you.

443
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,040
You… I…

444
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,040
- Are you seeking death? Are you?
- Brother.

445
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,560
Fine, fine, stop messing around.

446
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,632
Dig in.

447
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,040
You ate them secretly. It was you.

448
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,184
I…

449
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,328
Stop!

450
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:03,426

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,186
