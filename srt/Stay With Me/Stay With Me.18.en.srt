<i>[Episode 18]</i>

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,100
I took a close look at the materials yesterday

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,919
and searched for relevant information online.

20
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,160
Have you noticed Hongsheng Company

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,879
bought a batch of goods in 2000?

22
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,820
If the supplier was the same,

23
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,599
it was most likely that it bought

24
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,599
the same batch of goods as Zhenghao Company.

25
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,080
But Hongsheng's goods didn't have any problems.

26
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:58,740
I noticed that too.

27
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,260
And I asked Deputy General Manager Zheng.

28
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,360
He said the batch of goods had already entered

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,180
the clinical use stage
when Hongsheng bought it.

30
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,220
That was why Wu's ex-wife felt reassured

31
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,519
to purchase it.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,320
Could this be a setup by the other party?

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,904
Actually…

34
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,560
What?

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,039
Actually, there's something I didn't tell you.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,559
Someone knew about this case at the time,

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,199
but his identity is quite special.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,800
I've been hesitating these few days
about whether to see him.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,936
Who?

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,240
Wu Bi's uncle.

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,439
Mo Yi's father?

42
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,600
No, Mo Yi's father is the elder one.

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,820
What I refer to is the younger one.

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,160
His name is Mo Renhe.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,219
That person is said to have a strange temper.

46
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,199
If he heard those rumors back then too,

47
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm afraid if I go--

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
I'll go.

49
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,560
You can't go.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,839
How can a child like you take such a big risk?

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,260
Isn't it just right for me to go?

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,720
He can't make things difficult for a child.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,380
What if he knows you are my son?

54
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,479
I just won't say it.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
I'll say I'm Wu Bi's friend.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,440
How can you make someone

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,119
tell you such an important thing?

58
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,544
I'll play it by ear.

Duo, be good.

112
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,239
It's not safe for a little girl like you
to be home alone.

113
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,580
Right. You can't stay in the same room with us.

00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,880
Can I use my student ID card?

<i>I don't see anything weird about him.</i>

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,880
I have something to discuss with Mr. Mo.

134
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,440
I know, but Mr. Mo is busy right now.

135
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,600
He doesn't have time to talk to you.

136
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
Wait outside for now.

<i>Since he wants me to wait outside,</i>

00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,479
<i>I'll do it.</i>

141
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,239
<i>I guess I won't make it this time.</i>

142
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,000
<i>I'll leave to eat something first.</i>

143
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,760
I want to go out.

144
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,359
You need Mr. Mo's approval to leave too.

145
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,700
Could you go in and inform him

146
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,040
I want to go out for a meal?

147
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,359
When Mr. Mo is eating,

148
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,719
no one can go in and disturb him.

149
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,680
Can you go in and report now?

Mr. Mo said

151
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,320
you could go out,

152
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,280

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,259
Your presence here
will disturb Mr. Mo and his guest.

181
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,320
Please wait over there.

182
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,280
Happy, happy.

183
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
Li, we didn't drink enough today.

184
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
We drank a lot.

185
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,580
Looking forward to your next visit.

186
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,319
We'll continue drinking then.

187
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,328
Okay, okay.

188
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,696
Li, I'll leave you here.

189
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:34,719
Go back.

190
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,040
You two, take good care of Li for me.

191
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,199
Surely they will. Bye.

192
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,400
Mr. Mo, we…

193
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,640
Why are you still here?

194
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I've been waiting for you.

195
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,800
Mr. Mo is about to rest.

196
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,740
You can stay here,

197
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,400
but you can only stay over there.

198
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,439
Don't come here.

199
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,079
If you disturb Mr. Mo's rest,

200
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,760
don't blame me for being rude.

201
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,560
Why did you kick me?

202
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,060
You're pacing around
by the pond at this late hour

203
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,640
instead of going home to sleep.

204
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,680
What if you disturb Mr. Mo's rest?

205
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,959
If you gave me water, would I do that?

206
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,400
One more sound,

207
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,880
and I swear I'll kick you out right now.

208
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,400
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

209
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,319
Hello, Su Yu.

210
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,520
Why aren't you two at home so late?

211
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,479
I…

212
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:04,120
I'm having dinner
near Wu Bi's apartment with him.

213
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,479
I'll stay in his place tonight.

214
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,199
I thought you two might be hungry at night,

215
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,700
so I brought you some dumplings
with zucchini and egg filling.

216
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,640
Alright, I'll put them in the fridge.

217
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,139
If you two are hungry tomorrow,

218
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,959
let Wu Bi fry them.

219
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,968
Go to bed early.

220
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,360
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

221
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,760
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

222
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,880
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

223
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,520
Wu Bi,

224
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,079
are you really not planning
to transfer back to our school?

225
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,620
This should never have happened.

226
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,399
At first,
you were just rebelling against your dad.

227
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:57,560
Now you're really determined to stay there.

228
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,560
Do you have a crush on a girl there?

229
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,579
No way.

230
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,120
We're a science class for Olympiad math.

231
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,520
There are hardly any girls who are half pretty.

232
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,640
What do you think of my looks?

233
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,199
Just talk. Don't touch me.

234
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:19,400
Wu Bi, do you not like girls?

235
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,199
What are you talking nonsense?

236
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,400
Panpan, he doesn't dislike girls.

237
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,640
He just doesn't like you.

238
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:58,479
<i>♫ You said that between us ♫</i>

239
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,966
<i>♫ You will protect me ♫</i>

240
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,749
<i>♫ No matter how dangerous it gets ♫</i>

241
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:08,288
<i>♫ You will never leave ♫</i>

242
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,704
<i>♫ I believe in every promise ♫</i>

243
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:16,400
<i>♫ You made to me ♫</i>

244
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,560
Aren't you thirsty?

245
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,839
Now you can drink to your heart's content.

246
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:26,848
<i>♫ Thank you for exploring with me ♫</i>

247
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:30,393
<i>♫ Tasting everything in this world ♫</i>

248
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:33,792
<i>♫ Good or bad, it doesn't matter ♫</i>

249
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:37,472
<i>♫ As long as we're by each other's side ♫</i>

250
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,319
Hello, still up so late?

251
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,504
Yes.

252
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,800
I can't sleep.

253
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,680
I want to talk to you.

254
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,680
You're not scared of sleeping alone, are you?

255
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,359
What's with him?

256
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,079
Why is it so lively there?

257
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
<i>We're having a party here.</i>

258
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,139
What are you eating?

259
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:07,168
Seafood.

260
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,160
A rainy day with a table of seafood,
how free and easy.

261
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm really envious.

262
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,400
What did you eat?

263
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:17,664
I…

264
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,839
I had dumplings.

265
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,136
<i>With zucchini and egg filling, right?</i>

266
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,239
Yes.

267
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,959
Then why the hell are you envious?

268
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,400
Isn't that your favorite?

269
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,376
Hello.

270
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,280
<i>Oh, no. Did it get water in it?</i>

271
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,792
<i>It's so cold.</i>

272
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:46,976
Hello.

273
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,060
The battery must be dead again.

274
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,920
Always forgetting to charge the phone on time.

275
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:02,060
What's wrong?

276
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,599
Who were you calling?

277
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,180
My classmate.

278
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,500
Don't lie.

279
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,740
We're all your classmates,

280
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,479
but we've never seen you talk
to anyone like this.

281
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:13,520
Yeah, "sleeping alone"

282
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,000
and "forgetting to charge the phone".

283
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,576
I think you're clearly in love.

284
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:17,664
My younger brother.

285
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,820
Where did you get a younger brother from?

286
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,479
How come I haven't heard of it?

287
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,599
My elder brother, okay?

288
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,040
Eat, eat, eat.

289
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,199
Who is that?

290
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,839
The one who came to see you yesterday.

291
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,520
He stayed here all night?

292
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,280
Yes, according to the person
on duty last night.

293
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,479
<i>He's too cunning for his age.</i>

294
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,280
<i>Let's see how long you can hold out.</i>

295
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,120
Mr. Mo, do you have time today?

296
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,208
Yes.

297
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,439
But I'm not in the mood.

298
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,260
What would put you in the mood?

299
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,760
If you want to chat with me,

300
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,599
shouldn't you tidy yourself up first?

301
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:58,700
<i>Hello, the phone you have dialed
is switched off.</i>

302
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Duo.

303
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,479
Wu Bi.

304
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,719
Bi, you haven't come to see me for two days.

305
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,560
No, and I haven't been home these two days.

306
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,439
You weren't at home, and neither was Su Yu.

307
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,359
I'm so bored on my own.

308
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,319
Hasn't Su Yu come here?

309
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,392
No.

310
00:29:35,392 --> 00:29:37,760
You two went to have fun together without me.

311
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,199
Who said we were having fun together?

312
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,560
Su Yu said so.

313
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,380
My mom called him,

314
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,079
and he said you two were together.

315
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,800
Good morning, Mr. Mo.

316
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,159
If I keep ignoring you like this,

317
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,560
will you wait until you die?

318
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,136
I don't know.

319
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:18,816
Come in.

320
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,560
Mr. Mo, I am…

321
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:49,920
This is top-quality Dongding Oolong.

322
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,239
I know who you are.

323
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,119
I've seen your student ID card.

324
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:07,300
Even though I've cut ties
with the Wu family for many years,

325
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,920
the news about Wu Zhenghao

326
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,040
doesn't escape my ears.

327
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,599
You really live up to being Xiao San's son,

328
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,260
as persistent as she is.

329
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,800
I know you have a prejudice against her.

330
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,680
No matter how you judge her,

331
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,368
I accept it.

332
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,880
You're wrong.
I don't have a prejudice against her.

333
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,060
Not only that,

334
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,479
I actually feel sorry for her.

335
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,800
Because in that incident years ago,

336
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,599
she was just an innocent victim who was used.

337
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,528
Being used?

338
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,359
I know the purpose of your visit.

339
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,119
I just didn't expect you

340
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,520
to be the first person to come to me.

341
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,680
I thought it would be Wu Bi.

342
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:28,386
