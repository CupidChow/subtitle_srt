 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:09,849
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,437
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:17,643
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:22,275
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:28,023
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:32,206
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:35,200
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:39,964
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:49,736
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:57,832
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:02,284
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:06,892
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:11,148
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:16,150
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,681
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,345
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:25,116
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,559
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:31,160
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,460
   
   

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,476
   

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,620


26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,060
 Do you guys know we have a new MD? 
   

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,300
An external hire.

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,820
What's the story?

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,880
No idea.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,660
Zhi Tong.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,620
There's a new MD at the company. Did you hear about it?

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,820
Parachuted in?

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,940
What about Director Dai? Wouldn't she be promoted to MD?

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,620
After the Jia Fan incident, no way she was getting promoted.

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,820
It's not entirely her fault, though.

36
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,293
But someone has to take the fall for this.

37
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:15,440
Let's not discuss it.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,880
We peons shouldn't worry about it.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,020
They say the new MD used to teach at Qingbei University.

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,560
Maybe you know him.

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,900
Well, what's his name?

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,020
Qin Chang. Ring any bells?

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,000
Is Professor Qin coming to Hetai?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,660
You do know him.

45
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,260
So is he strict?

46
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,980
I took only his elective. He's okay.

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,853
Is he good-looking?

48
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:40,940
- Yes, handsome. 
 - Why are you laughing?

49
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,360
Isn't it good that he's hot?

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,260
An Qi, Sister Qin Yu, we have a meeting in ten minutes.

51
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,540
- Got it. 
 - All right.

52
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,860
Off to the gallows again.

53
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm leaving.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,160
- Good luck. 
 - Thanks.

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,020
I'm leaving, too.

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,060
Professor Qin.

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,100
Hello, Missy.

58
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,760
Hey, you must have read my mind.

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
How did you know I'm at Hetai?

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,240
Professor Qin is coming to Hetai. Did you know?

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,780
Which Professor Qin?

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,960
Qin Chang.

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,780
 He's parachuting in as our new Managing Director. 

64
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,440
Aren't you coming up?

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,260
Are you asking me out to dinner?

66
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,580
No.

67
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,360
You stood me up last night.

68
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,340
Fine.

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,640
Since you're being so sincere...

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,580
What are you saying?

71
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,700
Did you just run into Professor Qin?

72
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,340
Then remember to pick me up tonight.

73
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,680
Let's have dinner tonight.

74
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
Sorry, Professor Qin.

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
You just heard.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,260
I have plans tonight.

77
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,920
All right then.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,640
Next time.

79
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,440
 He came to Shanghai, wearing the tie I gave him. 

80
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,600
 A farewell gift. 

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,220
Hey.

82
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,440
What's his deal?

83
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,180
He asked me out twice, then just disappeared.

84
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,920
Are you usually at the office?

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,280
Is he really that busy?

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,780
I'm just a junior employee.

87
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,920
How often do I get to see him?

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,340
Honestly, you shouldn't play so hard to get.

89
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,880
He came all the way to Shanghai, and you're avoiding him.

90
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,180
I was thinking of saying yes if he asked me out one more time.

91
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,060
My dear, some things you can do only once.

92
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,640
Fine then. Stop lecturing me.

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,460
Will you shop with me tonight?

94
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,600
I've got work to finish.

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,420
I'll dine with you if you accompany me during overtime.

96
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,500
- I'll leave it here. 
 - All right.

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,880
There are a few more documents.

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,640
Ding Zhi Tong.

99
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Professor Qin?

100
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,900
I heard you joined Hetai.

101
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,180
I haven't run into you until now.

102
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,120
How's it going? Are you adjusting well?

103
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,500
Quite well.

104
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,780
Everyone has been helpful.

105
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Keep it up. Just let me know if you need anything.

106
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,640
Director Qin.

107
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,260
I'm having dinner with Song Ming Mei at Raffles tonight.

108
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,160
Thanks.

109
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,640
What's wrong?

110
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,520
Something came up. I might have to go.

111
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,580
Wait, Gan Yang isn't here.

112
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,860
And I'm free only tonight to ease your loneliness,

113
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,960
but you leave me?

114
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,100
It's an emergency.

115
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,480
- And if I stay, I'll become a third wheel. 
 - What?

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,460
You two set me up?

117
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,420
No. Can I go now?

118
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,040
Director Qin.

119
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,140
Stay for dinner.

120
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,220
No, thanks.

121
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,500
You two enjoy. I'm leaving.

122
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,260
Bye bye.

123
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,180
Just to clarify, I didn't ask Tong Tong to invite you.

124
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,720
I asked her to invite you.

125
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,920
What? You're not happy I'm in Shanghai?

126
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,460
Of course, I am.

127
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,760
Then why have you been avoiding me?

128
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,340
Because you didn't tell me you were coming.

129
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,320
Don't girls like surprises?

130
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,140
So you kept it from me to surprise me?

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,900
Well, can I skip this kind of surprise next time?

132
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,640
Then next time I ask you out, will you say yes?

133
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,040
Depends.

134
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,200
Waiter.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,450
   

136
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,700
 Tong Tong. 
   

137
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,760
   

138
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,160
 Just wait for me a little longer. 

139
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,620
 I'll be back after my exams. 

140
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,940
Just focus on your exams.

141
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,740
 Gan Yang. 

142
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:27,217
   

143
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,140
 Tong Tong! 

144
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,700
 I miss you! 

145
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,270
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

146
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,680
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

147
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,580
♫  I wish I could stay with you  ♫

148
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,600
♫  To feel the lingering warmth of love  ♫

149
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,900
♫  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  ♫

150
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,740
♫  When it comes to love  ♫

151
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,180
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

152
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,680
 Tong Tong! 

153
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,940
 Tong Tong! 

154
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,540
 I'm back. 

155
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,300
Gan Yang?

156
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,540
 Why didn't you tell me you were returning? 

157
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,860
It was supposed to be next week.

158
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,100
 But I finished my exams. 

159
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,900
 The lab is getting new equipment so here I am. 

160
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,220
By the way,

161
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,140
CEO Liu is coming to Shanghai tomorrow for a shoe exhibition.

162
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,620
Is CEO Liu coming to Shanghai tomorrow?

163
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,080
Yes.

164
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,840
Do you want to meet her?

165
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,160
I'm not ready.

166
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,740
You don't need to be.

167
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,820
You're perfect just the way you are.

168
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,080
But it'll be my first time meeting her.

169
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,860
Relax.

170
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,740
My mom will like you.

171
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,300
All right.

172
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,980
Really.

173
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,900
Cousin!

174
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,540
What are you doing here?

175
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,080
So this is where you work?

176
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,060
Nice. Fancy place.

177
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,500
You must earn a lot.

178
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,300
- Let's talk somewhere else. 
 - No.

179
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,640
Let's talk here.

180
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,760
When are you repaying the money you owe us?

181
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,060
I worked out a deal with your mom.

182
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,260
I'll repay a portion every month.

183
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,180
God, those measly payments are nothing.

184
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,660
You need to pay back the rest today.

185
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,940
Does your mom know about this?

186
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,960
Of course, she does. She sent me here.

187
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,140
Then I'll call her.

188
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:54,940
Why bother?

189
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,900
- Pay up. 
 - Let go.

190
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,060
- Let go! 
 - Let go of her!

191
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,840
What are you doing?

192
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,660
You hit me?

193
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,300
Everyone, come see this!

194
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,400
This woman owes my family 200,000 yuan.

195
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,760
- Isn't that your love rival? 
 - A whopping 200,000 yuan!

196
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,300
Instead of repaying the money, she had someone hit me.

197
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,960
- Everyone, say if this is right! 
 - When did I hit you?

198
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,180
Didn't you?

199
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,260
So many people are watching!

200
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,380
You're still denying it?

201
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,980
- Don't think I don't know what you... 
 - Tong.

202
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,500
Don't let this escalate.

203
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,620
I have some savings.

204
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,500
Repay him and get rid of him.

205
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,320
Our colleagues are watching. This will ruin your reputation.

206
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,860
No, thank you.

207
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,780
Don't think I don't know why you want money.

208
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,900
More gambling, right?

209
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,980
Forget it.

210
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,340
I won't give you a single penny!

211
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,860
It's none of your business what I do with the money.

212
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,780
A debt is a debt!

213
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,860
The IOU clearly states I owe your mom, not you!

214
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,380
You won't pay?

215
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,940
Fine.

216
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,520
I'm not leaving here.

217
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,120
Lie there all you want.

218
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,220
Hello, 110 (Police)? Someone's causing trouble here.

219
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
Just you wait. This isn't over.

220
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,740
Ding Zhi Tong!

221
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,460
What are you doing here?

222
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,580
None of your business.

223
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,680
Since you won't pay up, I'll tell Gan Yang right now.

224
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,540
Go ahead.

225
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,260
I was just wondering how to break it to him.

226
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,460
I get it.

227
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,140
You want me to tell Gan Yang for you.

228
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,860
If he finds out, forget ¥200,000.

229
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,140
He could cover ¥2 million for you, right?

230
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,460
Wow, you figured me out.

231
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,600
Well, I won't tell him! I won't give you what you want!

232
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,540
Suit yourself.

233
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,120
You...

234
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
Two million?

235
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,680
Guess she landed a sugar daddy.

236
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,300
I'll be rich!

237
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,620
Tong Tong.

238
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Want some fruit?

239
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,040
Check this out: the dress and the coat.

240
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,020
Will this work for tomorrow?

241
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,420
Is that a new dress?

242
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,860
I got it just for this.

243
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,940
Elders like girls to look neat

244
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,420
so I went with a white dress.

245
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,500
Do you think white is not good?

246
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,860
I could switch to red, blue, or yellow.

247
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,060
Let me check what colors I have. I'll show you...

248
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,460
Tong Tong.

249
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,020
Are you nervous?

250
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,240
Isn't it obvious?

251
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,620
Tell me what kind of person CEO Liu is.

252
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,520
"CEO Liu"?

253
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,980
She's the best.

254
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,780
Ever since I was young, no matter what I liked,

255
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,540
she would like it, too.

256
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,420
No matter what decision I made,

257
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,940
she'd support me unconditionally.

258
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,600
Do you know who ran with me first?

259
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,420
CEO Liu?

260
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,340
Yes, it was her.

261
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,380
Tong Tong, don't worry.

262
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
Then what's your dad like?

263
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,100
You rarely mention him.

264
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,560
My dad?

265
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,360
I'll tell you about him another time.

266
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,120
By the way, have you seen Xu Chen Xi recently?

267
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,860
No.

268
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,300
She said she's visiting her family.

269
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,940
Why?

270
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,320
Nothing. I was just asking.

271
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,060
I'll pick up my mom at the airport tomorrow afternoon,

272
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,880
then drive to your office in the evening.

273
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,140
Don't trouble yourself.

274
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,700
CEO Liu rarely comes.

275
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,140
Just spend time with her.

276
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,760
I'll meet you both after work.

277
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,420
Really?

278
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,920
Tong Tong, you're the best.

279
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,220
   

280
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,180
I've never seen you leave work so early.

281
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,420
Do you have plans for the evening?

282
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,500
With your boyfriend?

283
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,860
No wonder you were so busy and even skipped lunch.

284
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,800
So you have a date.

285
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,980
All right, I'm off.

286
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,260
Have fun on your date. See you tomorrow.

287
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,160
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Bye.

288
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,800
I'm grabbing a cab now.

289
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,100
Should be there in half an hour.

290
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,260
Mom, she's on her way.

291
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,900
Should we wait in the private room?

292
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,940
It's fine here.

293
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,060
We're just early. It's okay.

294
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,020
Mom, you know what, I offered to pick her up,

295
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,380
but she insisted I spend time with you instead.

296
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,300
She's thoughtful, right?

297
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,500
- Yes. 
 - You'll like her when you meet her.

298
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,900
You're my son.

299
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,620
I trust your judgment.

300
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,700
Yang Yang, tell me how you two met.

301
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,780
 Thank you. 

302
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,580
Then Tong Tong answered the phone and...

303
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,340
Then she said she couldn't deliver it,

304
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,860
but I said it was okay, I'd give her...

305
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
So she brought the flash drive over.

306
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,860
He Jin!

307
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,860
I made myself clear yesterday.

308
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,260
I won't give you a yuan.

309
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,000
Sister (cousin), listen to yourself.

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,380
Well, I was just joking yesterday.

311
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,220
Do you really think I care

312
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,380
about a lousy ¥200,000?

313
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,880
What do you want then?

314
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,180
Nothing much.

315
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,500
Just meeting my future brother-in-law.

316
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,260
What brother-in-law?

317
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,180
Acting? Drop the act.

318
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,280
I know you're dating some rich guy.

319
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,560
Let me be honest with you.

320
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,680
I have a chance to make a killing now,

321
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,820
but I need a little investment.

322
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,600
Just ¥1 million should cover it.

323
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,320
Are you even hearing yourself?

324
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,720
A million?

325
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,880
That is pocket change for rich folks like them.

326
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,940
You wouldn't understand.

327
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,320
Are we eating here?

328
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,760
Let's go.

329
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,480
That's him, right?

330
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,120
- Your boyfriend, right? 
 - Give it back to me!

331
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,100
Hey, what are you doing?

332
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,860
Is the phone okay?

333
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,580
Ding Zhi Tong, you're being ridiculous.

334
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,520
- Go wherever you want. 
 - Ding Zhi Tong.

335
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,220
- Sir, let's go. 
 - Ding Zhi Tong! You can't run forever!

336
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,460
Follow that car in front.

337
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,820
 Hello, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

338
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,810
 Hello, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

339
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,840
 The subscriber you have dialed...­ 

340
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,060
Mom,

341
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,460
I still can't reach her.

342
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,640
Can't get through to her?

343
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,620
She's usually punctual.

344
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,420
She must be held up at work.

345
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,820
Yang Yang, it's getting dark.

346
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,100
Why don't you go meet her?

347
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,940
Check at her office.

348
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,500
All right.

349
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,900
Let me take you back to the hotel first.

350
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,100
Don't trouble yourself.

351
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,260
Just go.

352
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,820
When you reach her, let me know you're both okay.

353
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,140
All right.

354
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,980
Mom, I'm sorry.

355
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,340
Yang Yang, it's okay.

356
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm sure she's wonderful.

357
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,580
She must have a good reason.

358
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,340
Go now. Don't waste time.

359
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,540
Okay, I'm leaving.

360
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,880
All right.

361
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,400
- Be careful. 
 - Yes.

362
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,100
Excuse me.

363
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,060
Hello. May I ask whom you're looking for?

364
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,360
Have you seen Ding Zhi Tong from Investment Banking?

365
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,520
"Ding Zhi Tong"?

366
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,400
- Yes. 
 - She has already left.

367
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
All right.

368
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
Tong Tong!

369
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,940
Tong Tong?

370
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,340
Tong Tong?

371
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,420
Gan Yang.

372
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,340
♫  The time and time  ♫

373
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,060
I'm just glad you're okay.

374
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,400
That's what matters.

375
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,244
Are you okay?

376
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,960
You're soaked. What happened?

377
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,560
Gan Yang.

378
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,880
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,760
I didn't mean to stand you up today.

380
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,220
- I... 
 - It's okay. I know.

381
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's not talk about it.

382
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,900
Go inside, change your clothes, and take a shower.

383
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,980
Don't catch a cold.

384
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,960
Let's talk later.

385
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,880
All right?

386
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,540
Go on.

387
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,940
Mom,

388
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,860
Tong Tong ran into some unexpected trouble.

389
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,940
It's just resolved.

390
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,880
She feels terrible and keeps apologizing to you.

391
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
It's all handled now.

392
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,480
Let me talk to her for a moment.

393
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,760
Sure.

394
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Tong Tong wants to talk to you.

395
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,740
Auntie, I'm so sorry about today.

396
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,000
 It's okay. 

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,820
 Don't overthink it. 

398
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,360
 Your safety is all that matters. 

399
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,020
Auntie, are you available tomorrow?

400
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,680
I'd like to treat you to dinner as an apology.

401
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,120
Actually, tomorrow won't work.

402
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,060
I need to stop by the venue, then head back.

403
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,900
Mom, what's so urgent?

404
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,180
Is everything okay at home?

405
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,500
Nothing serious.

406
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,920
All right.

407
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,480
I'll see you off tomorrow then.

408
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,860
There's no need. You don't need to send me off.

409
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,120
I'll just take a cab.

410
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
You focus on work.

411
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,340
Okay, let me know when you get home.

412
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,780
Bye, Auntie.

413
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,820
Bye, Tong Tong.

414
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,620
I'll visit you again when I have time.

415
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
 Bye bye. 

416
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,360
It's fine.

417
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,420
It's all good now.

418
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,620
Tong Tong.

419
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,000
I made you some ginger tea.

420
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
You were caught in the rain.

421
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,200
You should have some.

422
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,200
I wasn't sure if you like the taste of ginger.

423
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,080
I added some cola and brown sugar.

424
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,860
Try it.

425
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,020
Is it okay?

426
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,280
Gan Yang.

427
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,260
Thank you.

428
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,460
Don't mention it.

429
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,640
It's what I should do.

430
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,500
You know,

431
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,140
thank you for letting me meet you.

432
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,420
What's wrong?

433
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,120
Actually,

434
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,080
there's something I've never told you.

435
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,540
Is that why you couldn't make it today?

436
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,320
When I was in middle school, my dad was diagnosed with a serious illness.

437
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,500
We spent all our savings, sold our house,

438
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,380
and borrowed from relatives,

439
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,800
but still couldn't save him.

440
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,500
My mom is a really good person.

441
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,240
Whenever something happened to our relatives, she was always the first to help.

442
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,320
But when we needed help and money,

443
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,200
everything changed.

444
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,860
 A few relatives did lend us money, 

445
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,620
 but they'd show up constantly demanding repayment. 

446
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,220
Actually,

447
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,500
I understand they want their money back,

448
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,400
but the things they said

449
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,840
were really hurtful.

450
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,660
I work like crazy to clear these debts.

451
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,800
Not just me, my mom does, too.

452
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,400
She was diagnosed with health issues a few years ago,

453
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,700
but she still goes out to be a street vendor behind my back.

454
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,100
So that's why you work too hard.

455
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,940
Tong Tong.

456
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,500
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,180
I didn't know.

458
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,160
I even got upset with you for overwork.

459
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,880
I'm sorry.

460
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,340
You don't have to apologize.

461
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,200
I know you just worry and want what's best for me.

462
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,100
Do you remember our first time at the movies?

463
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,440
Yes.

464
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,060
That day,

465
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,520
I got a call.

466
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,820
It was a court summons.

467
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,860
My uncle sued me.

468
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,780
How much did you owe him?

469
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,100
With interest, it's ¥200,000 ($28,000).

470
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,700
Later, I borrowed money from my aunt

471
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,772
to pay my uncle back, just to get him to drop the lawsuit.

472
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,420
I actually made it to the restaurant today,

473
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,400
but my aunt's son followed me.

474
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,080
Did your aunt change her mind?

475
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,060
No.

476
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,700
Her son is a gambler.

477
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,520
He somehow heard you're rich.

478
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,000
He wants to extort money from you.

479
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,840
I feared he would blackmail you two.

480
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,920
So I tried to get rid of him before meeting you.

481
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,820
But he kept following me.

482
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,440
My phone fell, broke, and I couldn't contact you.

483
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,560
Did he do anything to you?

484
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,160
Really?

485
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,920
I'm fine.

486
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,120
It's just that when I finally got rid of him and got back,

487
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,320
you had already left.

488
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,480
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,820
Actually,

490
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,100
I didn't want to hide it from you.

491
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,020
I wanted to tell you after clearing the debts.

492
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,240
But I thought if He Jin found you

493
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,660
and told you all this,

494
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,440
it's better if I told you myself.

495
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

496
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,960
I could have helped you.

497
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,480
I just feel money ruins all relationships.

498
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,500
But I really,

499
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,380
really like you.

500
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,380
So I didn't want our relationship affected by that.

501
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,280
All right.

502
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,280
Tong Tong.

503
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,700
I can't stand seeing you struggle.

504
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,520
It's okay.

505
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,140
The worst is over anyway.

506
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,240
Do you fear all the trouble in my family?

507
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,020
Yes.

508
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,860
Very much so.

509
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm afraid you'll suffer...

510
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,180
get hurt...

511
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,720
or leave me.

512
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,420
 After telling Gan Yang everything, 

513
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,020
 I felt no barriers between us anymore. 

514
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,560
Come here.

515
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,860
Don't be scared.

516
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,280
I'll always be there for you.

517
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,820
Thanks.

518
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,980
What do you want to eat later?

519
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,680
Anything is fine.

520
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,000
You can check what we have in the fridge.

521
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,500
Tong Tong,

522
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,280
I want to marry you.

523
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,600
Why did you suddenly think of marriage?

524
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,640
I want to give you a home.

525
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,120
I want to give you

526
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,800
a sense of security in life.

527
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,320
I'm already happy now.

528
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,480
But can you wait a year for me?

529
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,160
Let me pay my debts first.

530
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Classmate Gan Yang, this is the least romantic proposal ever.

531
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,000
Don't worry.

532
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,100
When I officially propose, I'll make sure to surprise you.

533
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,960
How surprising?

534
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,460
You'll see.

535
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,940
All right.

536
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,200
I'll pick you up after work today.

537
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,080
That He Jin wants to meet me, right?

538
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,900
Then let him.

539
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,700
Aren't you afraid he will extort you?

540
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,620
Let's see if he's got what it takes.

541
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,340
Do you have a plan?

542
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,980
Come here, and I'll tell you.

543
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,020
- I'm off work. 
 - My dear brother-in-law!

544
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,200
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

545
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,820
Brother-in-law!

546
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,960
- Who are you? 
 - Just ignore him.

547
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,440
Hey, what are you saying?

548
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm her cousin.

549
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,540
You're her boyfriend, right?

550
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,680
What do you want?

551
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,420
Just meeting my future brother-in-law.

552
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,680
Look at this car.

553
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,240
Nice, so fancy.

554
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,520
What do you want?

555
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, I have a way to make money.

556
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,200
Normally I wouldn't share, but you're family.

557
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,900
Want to invest?

558
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,620
Sure. How much?

559
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,100
Not much.

560
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,120
Five million.

561
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,320
"Five million"?

562
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,760
You said one million before.

563
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,000
Sister, you don't get it.

564
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,660
The more you invest, the more you earn.

565
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,320
Right?

566
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
- Makes sense. 
 - See?

567
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,680
Not a huge amount.

568
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,200
But why should I trust you?

569
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Tong Tong and I are very close.

570
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,440
And we lent her money without asking for it back.

571
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,900
What?

572
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,680
- You owe him money? 
 - Oh, no.

573
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,320
- I didn't mean to hide it from you. 
 - Shut up!

574
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,960
- How much does she owe you? 
 - Over 100,000.

575
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,580
Over... over a 100,000?

576
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,780
It's not that much!

577
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,720
- I've already repaid some of it. 
 - Over 100,000.

578
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,680
- It's not that much! 
 - You owed someone that much,

579
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,620
- and you didn't tell me? 
 - What's going on?

580
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,080
- What's wrong, Brother-in-law? 
 - Let me explain.

581
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,180
- What's wrong? 
 - Don't call me that.

582
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,820
Who do you think you are?

583
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,580
First five million, then over a 100,000.

584
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,620
Do you take me for a fool?

585
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,440
I've seen many people like you.

586
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,520
And you, we're done!

587
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,920
No! You can't do this!

588
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,220
No! Listen to me.

589
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,920
- Let go! 
 - Help me!

590
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,060
Enough!

591
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,323
Fine, break up then!

592
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:43,214
Don't worry, Tong Tong.

593
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:45,300
For her lost youth,

594
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,340
emotional distress, and all that, pay up!

595
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Don't give me that. Just you wait.

596
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,480
Look.

597
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,580
I spent this on her 
    

598
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,840
during our relationship.

599
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,020
It totals ¥119,654 and 82 fen.

600
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,940
It totals ¥119,654 and 82 fen.

601
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,000
- Over 110,000? 
 - You pay this back first.

602
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,480
- I never took a fen from... 
 - Will you pay or not?

603
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,360
- Aren't you her cousin? 
 - Help me.

604
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,960
- You help pay for her. 
 - Where would I get such money?

605
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
- What does it have to do with me? 
 - Listen up.

606
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,340
If you don't pay today, I'll call the police right now.

607
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,940
- Call... 
 - You can't let him call the police.

608
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,220
- It has nothing to do with me. 
 - Don't you believe me?

609
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,160
What does it have to do with me?

610
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,440
- None of my... 
 - Don't you believe me?

611
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,920
What do I do without you? Help me.

612
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,020
- Hello, 110? 
 - You go ahead, call them!

613
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,000
Help me.

614
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,860
Yes, at Hetai Building.

615
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,840
I'm so pitiful.

616
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,160
Oh, poor me.

617
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,060
Poor me...

618
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,860
He's gone.

619
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,600
Nice acting.

620
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,100
You, too.

621
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,920
You can hold your liquor.

622
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,800
Just say the word, Director Zhang, and I'll be there.

623
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,020
Are you okay? Let me take you home.

624
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,220
- My chauffeur will be here soon. 
 - Don't bother. I already got a cab.

625
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,460
- Bye. 
 - See you around!

626
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,600
- Taking a cab isn't safe. 
 - It's really fine, Director Zhang.

627
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,620
Are you all right?

628
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,260
Who are you? Shouldn't you introduce yourself?

629
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,620
   

630
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,380
Director Qin.

631
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,460
She's drunk. Let me take her home.

632
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,200
Bye, Director Zhang.

633
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,320
Professor Qin, this tie...

634
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:38,033
looks familiar.

635
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,140
Is it the one I gave you?

636
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,240
Why do you always wear this one?

637
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,760
Let me take you home.

638
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,840
This is it.

639
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,300
I'll head up then?

640
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,540
Bye bye.

641
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,980
Bye bye.

642
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,640
 Tell me to stop. 

643
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,020
 Tell me to stop. 

644
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,580
Ming Mei!

645
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,720
What's up?

646
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,340
Did you want to say something to me?

647
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,060
Good night.

648
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,380
Stupid Qin Chang.

649
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,360
Hello?

650
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,680
Gan Yang. I think I saw your dad.

651
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,840
No way.

652
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,140
Others may not know where he is, but you should.

653
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,380
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

654
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,980
Check your phone. I sent you a photo.

655
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,100
Where did you see him?

656
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:55,930


657
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,100
- I'm back. 
 - Welcome back.

658
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,300
It smells good.

659
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,620
What's got you so happy?

660
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,800
Our private placement plan for Guanghua Energy got approved.

661
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,860
It was announced today.

662
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,880
This project will finally end.

663
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,800
Congrats on my girlfriend's first victory.

664
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,660
Chef Gan, you've made so many dishes.

665
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,720
Wash your hands and come eat.

666
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,760
Go now.

667
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,080
- Wait for me. 
 - Dinner is ready.

668
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,560
- Have more. 
 - Sure.

669
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,340
Why so many dishes today?

670
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,300
I'm going home tomorrow morning.

671
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,200
So sudden?

672
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,180
It was a last-minute decision.

673
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,840
Did something happen at your home?

674
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,800
Not really.

675
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,600
My mom said she misses me.

676
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,000
And with year-end stuff piling up,

677
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,960
she wants me to help out.

678
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,020
She threatened to disown me if I didn't go back.

679
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,920
Chinese New Year is just a week away.

680
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,200
Won't you come back for it?

681
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,040
After New Year's, I'll return a few days early.

682
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,400
I'll come straight to your home.

683
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,540
Come to my home?

684
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,200
We agreed before

685
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,460
that I'll visit your mom at Lunar New Year.

686
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,080
All right, I'll wait for you at home.

687
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,880
How long will you be gone?

688
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,600
Just over ten days.

689
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,760
Okay.

690
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,600
I'll take leave tomorrow to see you off at the airport.

691
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,120
No need.

692
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,720
You promised me, remember?

693
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,280
Focus on work and earn money.

694
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,220
I wait for you to marry me.

695
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,260
- Really? 
 - Well? Will you?

696
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,060
Yes, I will.

697
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,140
Let's eat.

698
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,600
Dig in.

699
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,980
Is this good?

700
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,970
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

701
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:09,110
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

702
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:18,060
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

703
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:24,297
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

704
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:31,360
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

705
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:38,285
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

706
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:45,285
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

707
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:52,360
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

708
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:59,360
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

709
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:05,802
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

710
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:13,087
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

711
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:20,120
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

712
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:27,116
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

713
00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:34,005
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

714
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:40,660
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

715
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:47,735
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

716
00:40:47,735 --> 00:41:00,335
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
