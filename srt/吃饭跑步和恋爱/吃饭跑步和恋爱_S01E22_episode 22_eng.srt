 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,270
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,120
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,200
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,890
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,480
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,340
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,200
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,300
   
   

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,500
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,435
   

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,750
 ­  

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,040
Lishi's family business has many internal factions.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,880
We can find a breakthrough from this.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,900
Right.

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,380
- Excuse me. 
 - Go ahead.

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,580
- Hello? 
 -  Hello, Director Ding. 

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,840
 I'm Little Li from the front desk. 

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,220
 A gentleman named Gan Yang wants to see you. 

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,680
 Is it convenient for him to come upstairs? 

34
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,800
I won't see him.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,660
- Sorry. 
 - Proceed, it's okay.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,960
From my investigation, Lishi's chief is not in good health lately.

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,760
 Why is he here? 

38
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,860
Tong Tong!

39
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,180
I have nothing to say to you.

40
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,660
Tong Tong.

41
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,260
I haven't explained things yet.

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,520
I still have a lot to say to you.

43
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,820
I don't want to hear it.

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,140
Security officer.

45
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,180
Director Ding.

46
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,360
I don't know this man. Don't let him follow me.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,460
Tong Tong.

48
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,640
- Sir. 
 - Tong Tong.

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,400
Sir, if you keep harassing Director Ding, I'll call the police.

50
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,340
   

51
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,460
Guys, I brought you afternoon tea.

52
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,160
 Thank you, Director Song. 

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,660
- It's for everyone. 
 - That's so nice, Director Song.

54
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,060
- I'll have this. 
 - It looks delicious.

55
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,100
Here, these are for you guys.

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,820
- Thank you, Director Song. 
 - Thank you.

57
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,700
Hand these out.

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,080
She doesn't appear recently divorced.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,900
- Here, this one. 
 - Director Deng, if you expect to see

60
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,240
a girl who begs you desperately not to divorce,

61
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,500
then you shouldn't have married Song Ming Mei.

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,860
Hand these all out.

63
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,740
Take the same as mine.

64
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,340
You can have this.

65
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,980
Why are you here?

66
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,900
Can't I be at my company?

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,620
I didn't know you were here. I didn't get you anything.

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,740
As if you'd get me anything if you knew.

69
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,700
What did you say?

70
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,140
Nothing. You guys can talk.

71
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,340
Director Qin, I'll leave first.

72
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,100
Director Qin, you've worked hard.

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,060
Have afternoon tea and take a break.

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,620
You're in a good mood today.

75
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,840
I'm in a good mood for sure. I signed a big order yesterday.

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,660
And when the stock transfer is completed,

77
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,060
things will fully end between me and Deng Bo Ting.

78
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,380
Then I get full control of Matching Tech.

79
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,720
It's hard not to be happy.

80
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,220
Don't you fear Deng Bo Ting and I will play tricks in valuation?

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,160
If so, does that mean I still have a place in your heart?

82
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,400
Will you?

83
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,400
Director Qin, I believe you'll separate work and personal life.

84
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,300
Maybe not.

85
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,700
 Put it here. 

86
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,740
Let's still follow our plan for publicity.

87
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,220
Okay, no problem.

88
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,260
That's all for the meeting then.

89
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,320
- Thank you, Director Xu. 
 - Thank you, Director Xu.

90
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,920
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks for your hard work.

91
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,020
 Let's go back and check. 

92
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,120
You workaholic, are you working overtime?

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,820
It's because you don't usually eat on time.

94
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,880
You must be uncomfortable now.

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,520
Do I even have time to eat?

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,460
I feel I need to clone myself to get it all done.

97
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
I bought it special from Annie's.

98
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,140
Try it.

99
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,200
What's wrong?

100
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,260
You are feeling so bad. Shall I take you to the hospital?

101
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,980
No need. I'll be fine in a while.

102
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,740
Then I'll take you home.

103
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,460
I haven't been home for several days.

104
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
I've stayed in a hotel recently.

105
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,700
- Why? 
 - It's all due to Yang He.

106
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,940
Your ex-boyfriend who doesn't eat pig intestine?

107
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,540
Did you get back together?

108
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,960
There's no way. He really wants to, though.

109
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,140
He waits for me at my door every day.

110
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Gosh. I'm so annoyed.

111
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,180
I can't beat him so I can only hide.

112
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,860
How can he do this?

113
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,040
Eat up. I'll escort you back when you finish.

114
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,640
Sorry, I made you do hard work again.

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,880
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

116
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,060
What's wrong?

117
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Just leave now. Yang He is here.

118
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,940
"Yang He"?

119
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,180
Don't let him see you!

120
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,020
Why is he like this? He keeps haunting you.

121
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,580
I'll talk to him.

122
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,280
You can't beat him. He's a boxer.

123
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,760
So what if he's a boxer?

124
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,040
Forget it.

125
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,320
But you can't keep hiding from him.

126
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,940
I have no idea. Take me back first.

127
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,260
What if he tracks you if he can't find you here?

128
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,280
Then what should I do?

129
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,500
How about staying at my house a few days?

130
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,900
Okay!

131
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,140
Your house is a good idea.

132
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,580
He won''t find me at your house.

133
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Hurry.

134
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,380
   

135
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,980
Come in.

136
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,820
Director Ding. The big boss wants a meeting at 10:30 a.m.

137
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,260
Did something come up?

138
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,340
I have no idea, but I heard of important guests.

139
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,960
I see. Thank you.

140
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,680
Then I'll take my leave.

141
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,020
 But you haven't made any progress. 

142
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,500
You must visit me next time when you come to Hong Kong.

143
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,160
I haven't been here in a while.

144
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,720
All right. Got it. Let's dine later.

145
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,360
Little Ding, come here.

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,980
President Ye.

147
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,140
CEO Gan has a project to discuss with you.

148
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,260
I've upset CEO Gan during our first project together.

149
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,540
Do you still want to join me in another project?

150
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,620
President Ye. May I have a few words with Director Ding alone?

151
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,900
No problem.

152
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,780
Little Ding, CEO Gan's project is huge.

153
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,020
I'll leave it to you, okay?

154
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,060
Okay.

155
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,640
- I'll leave first. Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

156
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,180
Just treat it as I'm pitching ideas here.

157
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,560
CEO Gan, you're already a Professional Engineer.

158
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,960
Why do you pitch at an agency like ours?

159
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,140
Before we start talking business,

160
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,160
shouldn't you know our company first?

161
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,140
Our pitch book introduces our company and team.

162
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,820
   

163
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,740
But I don't have ready-made information.

164
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,660
So I'll talk of how we got where we are today.

165
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,400
Please sit.

166
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,960
In 2018, I returned to Putian.

167
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,620
Our family company's Initial Public Offering failed

168
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,720
 on the verge of bankruptcy. 

169
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,940
 With various debts and holes in repurchasing shares, 

170
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
 the debt was ¥200 million. 
   

171
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,780
 Hello. Is Manager Fang here?  

172
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,860
 I'll reply within three days. 

173
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,340
 Hello, Director Cai. I am Gan Yang from Yongjuan Shoes. 

174
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,780
 - What did you say? 
 - Please pay the money you owe our company. 

175
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,540
 - I can't hear... 
 - We have no choice. 

176
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,700
 Go away! I can't hear clearly. 

177
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,060
 I didn't mean you, Director He. 

178
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,080
 I didn't mean you, Director He. Okay. 

179
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,740
 Director Cai! 

180
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,040
Every day, I received various debt collection calls.

181
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,120
But I still couldn't bear

182
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,800
to break up with you.

183
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,420
Right at that time,

184
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,800
my father sued me in court.

185
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,500
Hey, "Filial Son," see how badly your father was hurt.

186
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,060
It's very simple.

187
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,180
Give me the official seal and this matter is over.

188
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,920
Or I won't make it easy for you just because you're my son.

189
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,740
I've checked the law.

190
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,000
Intentionally causing bodily harm to others

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,220
can lead to imprisonment.

192
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,540
Chen Xi.

193
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,140
Take the official seal. Give it to him.

194
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,520
- Gan Yang. 
 - Go.

195
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,940
Gan Yang, are you crazy?

196
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,220
I don't want to deal with him anymore,

197
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,300
whatever they want.

198
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,700
How can you do this to your mom's hard work?

199
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,220
My mom didn't want me to deal with it anyway.

200
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,900
So you don't want to deal with this anymore?

201
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,620
Fine! Neither will I!

202
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,660
Big Brother,

203
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,840
don't spare him mercy this time.

204
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,500
This matter is settled, you know?

205
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,580
It's all done now.

206
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,720
Big Brother!

207
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,020
What are you doing, Brat? What do you want?

208
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,460
Aren't you quite agile?

209
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,740
Even faster than my second uncle.

210
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,880
It turns out you're pretending.

211
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,700
Fine.

212
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,460
You guys trick me together, right?

213
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,940
You did so many things just for money, didn't you?

214
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,300
Name a price.

215
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,180
How much do you want for stock shares you own?

216
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,480
You want to force me out, right?

217
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,980
It's not that easy.

218
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,660
It's okay if you don't agree.

219
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,860
I'll see you at the police station.

220
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,660
I've checked.

221
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,400
Forging evidence to falsely accuse others brings criminal charges.

222
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,360
So you can choose.

223
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,300
Do you want money

224
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,080
or return to prison more years?

225
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,380
Big Brother,

226
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,680
Even if we get this lousy company's seal,

227
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,580
they couldn't make money in the market.

228
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,560
Why don't we take the money and leave?

229
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,320
Brat.

230
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,400
You win.

231
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,100
Ten million and we are even.

232
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,580
Gan Kun Liang.

233
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,940
You're using our misfortune!

234
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,860
Don't you know the factory's situation?

235
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,460
Where can we get ¥10 million ($1.4 million).

236
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,660
The factory doesn't have much.

237
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,300
I know.

238
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,980
But he has.

239
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,140
I know CEO Liu

240
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,220
must have left a way out for her own son.

241
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,020
Have you no conscience?

242
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,340
Isn't he your son?

243
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,900
Right, he is my own son!

244
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,780
But he never acknowledged me as "Dad" in his heart!

245
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,880
You can force me out.

246
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,320
But you must pay the price.

247
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,080
Ten million yuan.

248
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,620
Deal.

249
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,840
But mark my words.

250
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,860
From now on, you, Yongjuan Shoes and us

251
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,220
will have no ties.

252
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,620
Fine.

253
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,180
The property you asked me to sell before

254
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,760
sold for ¥39.6 million.

255
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,520
Part of it repaid the bank.

256
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,960
Some urgent debts were also paid.

257
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,460
Only ¥9.37 million is left.

258
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,840
Yang Yang, how about...

259
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,680
Sister Mei, I know what you want to say.

260
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,440
Gan Kun Liang is a cancer tumor.

261
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,400
Keeping him will destroy the company.

262
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,060
We might as well pay to force him out.

263
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,940
- But... 
 - I'll find a way for money.

264
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,940
Sister Mei, thanks for the hard work.

265
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,420
Go back early and rest.

266
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,400
You should rest early, too.

267
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,480
Gan Yang.

268
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,640
Chen Xi, you're still here.

269
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,320
This is my savings.

270
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,540
You can take it for emergency first.

271
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,780
No way.

272
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,160
You've helped me enough.

273
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,660
I can't take the money.

274
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,500
I give it as a loan.

275
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,360
Gan Kun Liang wants ¥10 million the day after tomorrow.

276
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,780
Mei said the company's account hasn't enough.

277
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,680
Where can you get money in such a short time?

278
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,720
Sister Mei helped me sell all properties in my name.

279
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,260
I'll receive the money soon.

280
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,560
Chen Xi.

281
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,640
Can you help me sell this?

282
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,400
What's this?

283
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,720
A ring to propose to Ding Zhi Tong,

284
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,000
but now it's useless.

285
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,480
Sell it for me.

286
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,340
I used to tell you that health is all that matters.

287
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,080
Then I realized that in desperate situations,

288
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,660
people care least about their body.

289
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,900
And then?

290
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,940
Gan Kun Liang's matter was resolved,

291
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,120
but we still didn't get enough money.

292
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,900
Back then were dinner meetings daily,

293
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,800
drinking and eating with clients.

294
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,500
Finally, in October, 2018,

295
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,240
there was a turnaround.

296
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,920
- Good. 
 - Great.

297
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,200
Good.

298
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,500
Young Man, you are straightforward.

299
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,160
You have your mother's style.

300
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,860
You flattered me.

301
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,740
Little Gan,

302
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,080
is your family all right lately?

303
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,580
Thank you for your care.

304
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,640
Everything went well.

305
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,220
President Zhang, why are you speaking privately to Little Gan?

306
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,460
You can't just give your good orders to Little Gan.

307
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,300
That's right.

308
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,660
Old Wang is joking with me again.

309
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,400
I have never forgotten you in my orders.

310
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,260
- Oh, you... 
 - Right.

311
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,220
All of us here rely on you.

312
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,720
Guys, am I right?

313
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,360
President Wang, you are right.

314
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,480
Enough of the praise.

315
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,880
Today, I actually have an order.

316
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,180
I just wonder if you are bold enough to take it.

317
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,140
A new shoe surface material was released recently.

318
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,480
But it requires an OEM to buy the machines,

319
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,620
exclusive for the material.

320
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,460
What is such a delicate material?

321
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,700
Can it be promoted on a large scale in the future?

322
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,780
I can't guarantee this.

323
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,700
President Li, it depends on you guys to take it or not.

324
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,460
If interested,

325
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,260
come to my place anytime to check the samples

326
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,820
and try the machines, okay?

327
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,300
Okay.

328
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,460
I think, President Zhang's order is quite unreliable.

329
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,660
Exactly. There's no guarantee at all.

330
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,700
Who knows about the future?

331
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,100
That's not reliable.

332
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,820
Hello.

333
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,460
Hello?

334
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,000
Sister Mei.

335
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,380
Book a flight to Ningbo for me.

336
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,500
I have to check an order there.

337
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,020
How about it, Little Gan?

338
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,180
This fabric is indeed lighter and more breathable.

339
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,140
Young Man, you're very discerning.

340
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,860
Take a look.

341
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,140
So how many machines do you plan to order this time?

342
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,380
You know, I'll offer you special pricing as a friend.

343
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,880
If you don't place an order this time,

344
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,160
I'll sell them to someone else.

345
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,260
How about this, President Zhang,

346
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,620
Please wait for me for a while.

347
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,700
I'll make a phone call.

348
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,220
No problem. I'll wait for you here.

349
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,500
Thanks.

350
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,540
Hello, Wang Yi.

351
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,340
I need your help.

352
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,820
This is the lightest, most breathable, yet durable running shoes

353
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,420
I've ever tested.

354
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,040
 But bad news, 

355
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,700
to produce it uses special machines.

356
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,140
Currently, I have no method

357
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,860
 to produce it with existing machines. 

358
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,380
But this shoe is technically innovative indeed.

359
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,080
Gan Yang, you can decide.

360
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,860
The lightest, most durable running shoes are our goal,

361
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,140
but technological advancement of shoes

362
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,220
 doesn't guarantee success in the market. 

363
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,980
Let's take a risk.

364
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,340
Okay.

365
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,200
Where can we find money for 1,000 units of equipment?

366
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,180
Empty the factory for the new machines.

367
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,300
I'll solve the rest.

368
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Ever since your family's incident,

369
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,280
I've been waiting for you.

370
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,380
I didn't expect you to hang in there for so long.

371
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,620
I underestimated you.

372
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,420
I didn't come to you then because

373
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,180
I thought even our good relationship

374
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,700
can't allow an unprofitable business.

375
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,020
So have you found a way out?

376
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,060
Actually, I'm here today to borrow money from you.

377
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,020
How much?

378
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,540
Twenty million yuan.

379
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,300
It's neither too much nor too little.

380
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,060
In three years,

381
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,140
I'll give you back ¥30 million.

382
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,300
What if you can't repay me?

383
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,140
If I can't repay,

384
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,920
I really have nothing to give you either.

385
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,460
If you can't repay, then you brat

386
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,920
must work for me for free

387
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,940
for a lifetime.

388
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,700
You're worth ¥20 million.

389
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,180
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

390
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,500
 December, 2018. 

391
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,060
The economy changes dramatically.

392
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,100
Local factories in Putian closed down one by one.

393
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,900
Only I, due to these 1,000

394
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,060
specialized machines,

395
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,180
got enough orders

396
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,160
and ran a full assembly line.

397
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,940
   

398
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,780
 I repaid Dr. Chen's money within two years. 

399
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,240
   

400
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,080
 He was very interested in my business blueprint, 

401
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,780
 and he introduced me to venture capital companies. 

402
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,800
 That year, we founded LT. 

403
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,320
 Under debt pressure, 

404
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,400
 we developed new products with limited funds. 

405
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,760
 Finally, LT 1.0 running shoes were born. 

406
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,160
 Its sales exceeded expectations. 

407
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,800
 LT and shoe factories developed smoothly, 

408
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,360
 with considerable cash flow 

409
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,412
 during this period. 

410
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:20,760
   

411
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,920
 My mother's condition 

412
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,900
 also gradually got better. 

413
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,260
Mom.

414
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,960
I've already paid off the money we owed Dr. Chen

415
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,640
and obtained some investment.

416
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,240
Son, thank you for your hard work.

417
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,280
Mom.

418
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,520
Our life will only get better from here.

419
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,120
Indeed.

420
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,180
I believe it.

421
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,680
In 2023, the company lifted the debt crisis,

422
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,560
and LT is now free. 
    

423
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,720
The company began the running shoe matrix. 
    

424
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
   

425
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,080
After that, we invested in Training Box.

426
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,120
In the past six years,

427
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,140
this is what happened.

428
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,640
Can we have dinner together tonight?

429
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,500
It's getting late.

430
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,240
I still have a meeting.

431
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
Then I'll leave first.

432
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:47,450
   

433
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,580
   

434
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,840
Do you want a ticket?

435
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,260
Tickets for sale. 
    

436
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,420
Take care.

437
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,720
Hello, have you any tickets?

438
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,400
Yes, scan the code.

439
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,000
Okay.

440
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,700
Are any tickets left?

441
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,500
- Yes. 
 - Give me a discount.

442
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,820
It's already cheap.

443
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,840
Two tickets, please.

444
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,080
Okay.

445
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,640
- I paid. 
 - Okay.

446
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,120
May you be wealthy and prosper.

447
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,440
Hello.

448
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,160
Have you tickets to Xu Wei's concert?

449
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,740
Yes, the last two.

450
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,320
May you be wealthy and prosper.

451
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,460
Hurry...

452
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,140
It's about to start.

453
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,300
I like him very much.

454
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
So do I.

455
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,900
- Hurry. 
 - Wait for me.

456
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,100
   

457
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,600
   

458
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,660
   

459
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:40,850
   

460
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,975
   

461
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:15,550
   

462
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,260
Gan Yang.

463
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,020
Tong Tong.

464
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,500
You're finally here.

465
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,000
It's raining heavily. You'll get sick.

466
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,940
Do you remember?

467
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,940
We used to be like this now,

468
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,960
sitting outside.

469
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,840
The rain is too heavy.

470
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,800
You should go back.

471
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,320
Tong Tong.

472
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,100
Stay with me until the concert finishes.

473
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,420
Okay.

474
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,640
I thought you wouldn't come.

475
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,040
If I hadn't come,

476
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,440
would you keep drinking here?

477
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,100
Tong Tong,

478
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,040
I was really scared

479
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,520
that if I told you everything,

480
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,060
you still wouldn't leave me.

481
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,700
I haven't looked for you in years

482
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,040
because I thought

483
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,620
it's fine as long as you're happy.

484
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,560
I didn't want you in an abyss with me with no future.

485
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,500
Even if I'm not the one to stand by you,

486
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,880
but...

487
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,240
Now I don't want to miss it.

488
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,775
Tong Tong,

489
00:34:51,775 --> 00:34:55,120
♫  I'm free as the wind  ♫

490
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,380
Let's get back together.

491
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,320
♫  Just like your gentleness I could not hold on to  ♫

492
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,060
Okay?

493
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:04,560
♫  You push away when I reach out my hands  ♫

494
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,156
It won't work for us anymore.

495
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:10,650
♫  Just leave. Don't look back  ♫

496
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:16,225
♫  Endless drifting, thirst for freedom  ♫

497
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,420
When I came to Hong Kong, I saw Feng Sheng at the airport.

498
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,280
♫  Every storm of life I'll face alone  ♫

499
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,625
He told me everything.

500
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:29,725
♫  I give you gentleness which you refuse  ♫

501
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:34,775
♫  I reach out my hands that feel real  ♫

502
00:35:34,775 --> 00:35:40,650
♫  I give you freedom and lasting memories  ♫

503
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,642
Gan Yang,

504
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,680
we can't go back.

505
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,075
Why?

506
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,040
I believe if we both can love each other,

507
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,780
it certainly will happen.

508
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,300
Tong Tong,

509
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,780
I still love you.

510
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,140
♫  I'm free as the wind  ♫

511
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,800
Do you still love me?

512
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,375
♫  Just like your gentleness I could not hold on to  ♫

513
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:23,975
♫  You push away when I reach out my hands  ♫

514
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:28,475
♫  Just leave. Don't look back  ♫

515
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:33,625
♫  Endless drifting, thirst for freedom  ♫

516
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:39,575
♫  Every storm of life I'll face alone  ♫

517
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:46,451
♫  I give you gentleness which you refuse  ♫

518
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:47,800
I love you, too.

519
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,820
♫  I reach out my hands that feel real  ♫

520
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,640
What did you say?

521
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,750
♫  I give you freedom and lasting memories  ♫

522
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,360
♫  I give you everything, but I cannot stay  ♫

523
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,700
Nothing.

524
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,560
I said...

525
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,575
Let's listen to the song.

526
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:08,400
♫  I'm free as the wind  ♫

527
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,960
 Gan Yang, 

528
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,980
 if all those things didn't happen, 

529
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,700
 then I could love you bravely. 

530
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:47,975
   

531
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,360
 Xu Chen Xi. 

532
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,100
 I like you. 

533
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,800
 Me, too. 

534
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Gosh. It's so early in the morning.

535
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,120
If you don't sleep, I still have to.

536
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,800
Don't sleep anymore.

537
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,940
Talk with me.

538
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,400
So you explained everything to her

539
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,439
and confessed to her again, but she didn't respond?

540
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:40,580
 Yes. After all these years, 

541
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,620
do you think she has no feelings for me?

542
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,760
It doesn't make sense.

543
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Wait, don't jump to conclusions yet.

544
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,100
Could it be too shocking, and she needs time to think?

545
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,460
I'm telling you. Women are very sensitive.

546
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,380
 You need to give her time. 

547
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,560
 Now you've shocked her suddenly. 

548
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
 It must be hard for her to process. 
   

549
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,600
   

550
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,220
She asked me to dinner tonight.

551
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll hang up for now.

552
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,180
Wait, she asked you...

553
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,040
Bro, she asked you for dinner, but it's only 7 a.m. now!

554
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,520
   

555
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,030

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

558
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,435
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

559
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:39,385
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

560
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:45,622
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

561
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:52,785
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

562
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:59,610
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

563
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:06,610
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

564
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:13,685
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

565
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:20,685
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

566
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:27,227
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

567
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:34,412
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

568
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:41,545
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
  ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

569
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:48,441
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

570
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:55,330
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

571
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:01,985
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

572
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:09,160
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

573
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:21,860
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
