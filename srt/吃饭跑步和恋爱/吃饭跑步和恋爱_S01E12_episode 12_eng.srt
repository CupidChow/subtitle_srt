 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,849
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,437
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:17,543
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:21,875
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:28,023
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:32,206
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:34,800
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:40,564
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:49,736
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:57,832
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:02,284
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:06,792
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:11,148
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:16,050
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,850
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,281
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,245
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:25,116
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,550
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,060
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,360
   
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,450
   

25
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,740
Right here is good.

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,840
It's not here yet.

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,160
Excuse me.

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,320
No way... so many people are here.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,660
Let's get a cab.

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,780
No cabs.

31
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,080
That would cost 200 yuan,

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080
and cab fares aren't reimbursed for the morning.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,027
I'll cover it for you.

34
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:05,380
From now on, I'll reimburse all your taxi fares.

35
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,100
So many people are packed in like sardines in the morning.

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,420
We will be squashed before we even reach the office.

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,540
If I took cabs to and from work, I'd basically work for cab fare.

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,220
Besides, traffic is a nightmare.

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,420
Even with a cab, we will still be late.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,360
We're already here anyway.

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:29,890

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,420
 Move... move further in. 

43
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,120
 - Excuse me, please let me pass. 
 - Excuse me. 

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,140
Is this your first time on the subway?

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,860
No.

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,140
I used to take it often.

47
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,100
Casual rides don't count.

48
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,140
I mean, this is your first time enduring the morning rush, right?

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,680
Oh, I see.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,660
The last time you took the slow train with me in hard seats

51
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,160
must have been your first time doing that too, right?

52
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,720
But I enjoyed it.

53
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,840
I need to reply to a work message.

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,540
Excuse me, let me pass.

55
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,460
 Sit down. 

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,140
 Let me pass, please. 

57
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,380
Let me help you carry one.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,020
Okay.

59
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,420
I really don't want you to go.

60
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,340
I don't want to go, either.

61
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,000
Let me know when you get to the airport.

62
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm leaving.

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm going.

64
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,820
Hello?

65
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,360
Is that two-bedroom apartment I checked still available?

66
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,840
Professor Qin, this is for you,

67
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,140
a farewell gift.

68
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,020
I'm leaving today.

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,120
I came to give this to you.

70
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,960
Please take it.

71
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,520
Okay.

72
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,500
Thank you.

73
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,380
Could you give me a ride?

74
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,180
Sorry. I've made plans with a colleague.

75
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,940
I can't give you a ride.

76
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,860
Professor Qin, you misunderstood.

77
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,220
I just meant you could take me to the school gate for a cab.

78
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,020
Besides, this might be the last favor I ever ask of you.

79
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,200
We may never meet again.

80
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,120
Hop on.

81
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,600
Professor Qin, I'm going to Shanghai today.

82
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,740
You know how busy securities firms are.

83
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,080
I have to also work on the Matching app.

84
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,860
I may not return to Beijing for a long time.

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,840
You're really not going to see me off?

86
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,140
The app is great.

87
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,580
If you stay ambitious, the sky is the limit.

88
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,200
You'll meet more and better people.

89
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,760
Then I wish you a bright future, too.

90
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,460
 Look. 

91
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,980
 I've finished cooking all the food you prepped for me. 

92
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,860
 And now I've prepared enough for another seven days. 

93
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,740
 This way, don't order takeout for me anymore. 

94
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,900
 I can cook for myself. 

95
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,300
Every time I buy you something,

96
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,900
you transfer the money back to me.

97
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,820
I can't get you anything.

98
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,780
I can't talk anymore.

99
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,740
I'll go make some then go to work.

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,300
Okay, go ahead.

101
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,020
Send me photos of your cooking.

102
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,480
Bye bye.

103
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,780
I'm already so thrifty.

104
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,700
Why can't I even afford a one-bedroom apartment?

105
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,500
Tong Tong, you're already very frugal with your meals.

106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,580
Didn't you show me your records before?

107
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,500
You don't eat out meals every day

108
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,800
and spend only Â¥1,000 ($140) a month.

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,280
I don't even know how you manage that.

110
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,280
Hello?

111
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,820
I see. I'll come right over.

112
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,220
I prepared these for nothing.

113
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,620
The company just notified me of a one-week business trip.

114
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,580
Help me finish these. Don't let them go to waste.

115
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,540
- The fridge is full of them. 
 - Okay, don't worry.

116
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,920
I'll make sure to finish them.

117
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,020
You really put a lot of thought into this.

118
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,740
Of course.

119
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,960
You rented a place but haven't even told her about it.

120
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,020
It wasn't redecorated yet.

121
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,620
I want to wait until it's finished then show it to her.

122
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,100
Wasn't the place you rented already furnished?

123
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,300
Why are you redecorating it?

124
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,020
It's a finely-decorated place.

125
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,380
But it's not what Tong Tong dreams of.

126
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,580
So it'll take some time.

127
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,860
Oh, by the way.

128
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,200
I'll go to Shanghai in my free time over the next few weeks.

129
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,740
Won't you be exhausted, shuttling between cities?

130
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes,

131
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,240
but happily exhausted.

132
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,700
 I think this wall can be painted green. 

133
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,360
 It'll be easy on the eyes. 

134
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:51,855
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

135
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:56,405
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

136
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:59,475
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

137
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:04,775
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

138
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:10,100
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

139
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,060
We're very pleased with your plan.

140
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,100
- We're looking forward to working together. 
 - Likewise.

141
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,220
Good.

142
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,700
After you.

143
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:20,200
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,620
 I'm working on the report. 

145
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,920
Tomorrow...

146
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,980
I expect a meeting tomorrow.

147
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,100
It's late. Go to sleep.

148
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,520
I'm going to sleep.

149
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,570
Bye bye.

150
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,150
Bye bye.

151
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,725
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

152
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:44,155
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

153
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:48,875
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

154
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:53,075
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

155
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:57,925
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

156
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:59,875
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

157
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,305
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

158
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:04,175
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

159
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:06,855
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

160
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,525
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

161
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:15,275
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

162
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:19,155
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

163
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,860
 I'll sign the contract if it's Â¥3,000. 
   

164
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,060
 It's just Â¥300 more. 

165
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,180
 There's a big difference between Â¥3,000 and Â¥3,300. 

166
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,420
 That makes Â¥3,600 a year. 

167
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,080
 Sister, this apartment just hit the market. It's perfect for you. 

168
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,560
 Please reconsider. 

169
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,160
My budget is firm at Â¥3,000 ($416).

170
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,420
Keep looking for me, please.

171
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,740
 It's literally just Â¥300 extra. 

172
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,540
 That's nothing these days. 

173
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,553
 Come see it now. You'll change your mind. 

174
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:43,520
No, thanks. Keep searching. Thank you.

175
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,500
Shanghai rents are so expensive.

176
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,240
Back home, Â¥3,000 could get me a huge four-bedroom apartment.

177
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:55,260
- Hello? 
 -  You sure you won't move into my place? 

178
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,500
 Or do you have other plans? 

179
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,060
Didn't Gan Yang offer to rent a place for you?

180
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,060
If that's the case, why not accept his kindness and let him rent it for you.

181
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,480
His places are too expensive. I can't accept that.

182
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,740
I want to keep our finances separate.

183
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,460
You? A relationship involves two people.

184
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,840
It's difficult to keep finances separate.

185
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,420
 Stop over-complicating things. Okay? 

186
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,420
I've told you about my family situation.

187
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,199
 Beautiful Lady, do you want to buy flowers? 

188
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,300
 There's a big discount tonight. 

189
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,640
 Buy flowers; companionship is free. 

190
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,660
I'm hanging up.

191
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,520
 Beautiful Lady, do you want to buy flowers? 

192
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,620
 There's a big discount tonight. 

193
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,220
 Buy flowers; companionship is free. 

194
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,060
Beautiful Lady, do you want to buy some flowers?

195
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,380
Buy flowers and you get a free companionship service.

196
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,980
I can't afford it. I'm sorry.

197
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,620
They're super cheap.

198
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,380
Just give me a kiss, then take both me and the flowers home.

199
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,820
How about half a kiss?

200
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,060
I'll take the flowers.

201
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,420
You... you might have to stay.

202
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I'll cover the other half.

203
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,300
Is this a forced sale?

204
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,380
Well, it's too late.

205
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,640
No returns after kissing.

206
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,160
Next time, just bring yourself.

207
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,180
Were these flowers expensive?

208
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,620
Not really.

209
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,160
Tong Tong, it's just a little gesture from the heart.

210
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,460
Isn't the billboard expensive?

211
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,980
Tong Tong, don't worry about such things.

212
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,740
Do you like this surprise?

213
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,029
Yes.

214
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,380
There's another surprise. Come on. I'll take you somewhere.

215
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,340
Another one?

216
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,840
 Beautiful Lady, do you want to buy flowers? 

217
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,380
 There's a big discount tonight. 

218
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,340
Gan Yang,

219
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,700
you didn't rent this place, did you?

220
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,980
Tong Tong, do you remember?

221
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,740
This is the apartment we both loved when we first came to Shanghai.

222
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,140
Tong Tong, this is your home now.

223
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,860
No more crowded subways in the mornings.

224
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,900
You won't have to share bathrooms anymore,

225
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,860
and no more waiting for hot water.

226
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,820
You can live well, work well,

227
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,980
and have your own privacy here.

228
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,180
Gan Yang,

229
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,720
thank you for considering me so carefully.

230
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,980
But I can't afford this place.

231
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,780
You don't have to pay the rent.

232
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,140
I've already paid for a year.

233
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,140
Just settle in.

234
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,560
Please cancel the lease.

235
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,660
I don't want to spend your money.

236
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,140
Tong Tong.

237
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm your boyfriend.

238
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,300
I want to treat you well.

239
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,420
Can't you stop pushing me away?

240
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,980
I know you're good to me.

241
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,180
But spending for this place is too much.

242
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,600
I don't know how to repay you.

243
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,340
Just be well.

244
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,480
That's the best repayment.

245
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,796
But it's not fair to you.

246
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:31,420
- I don't care. 
 - But I do.

247
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,060
Gan Yang, please cancel it.

248
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,420
The rental agreement can't be canceled.

249
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,680
I've already renovated it,

250
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,880
and I've already told your current landlord.

251
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,780
He said you can terminate your current lease now.

252
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,820
Landlords aren't usually that easy to deal with.

253
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,100
I'll definitely have to pay a month's deposit.

254
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,820
Are you planning to secretly cover it for me?

255
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,980
Call him now if you don't believe me.

256
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,860
I won't.

257
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,040
If you've already renovated it,

258
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,600
you can just sublet it and get a better price. Okay?

259
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,220
Can you stop calculating the balance of everything between us?

260
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,040
Let's go inside and take a look.

261
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,240
I don't want to look.

262
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,440
I can be flexible about other things,

263
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,340
but money needs to be crystal clear.

264
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,400
The last subway is leaving soon. I should go.

265
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,560
Hey, Tong tong. Wait. Don't go yet.

266
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,520
How about this?

267
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,120
You pay me half the rent.

268
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,060
Just half,

269
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,200
because I'll be living here, too.

270
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,800
Is it fair?

271
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,260
Gan Yang,

272
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,180
do you know what is the biggest difference between us?

273
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,160
I can't even afford half.

274
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,560
I won't cancel the lease or sublet this apartment.

275
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
I hope you'll move in.

276
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,840
   

277
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,040
That's so expensive!

278
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,980
What a waste of money.

279
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,300
 Eat well. 

280
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,580
 Sleep well. 

281
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,400
 Remember to miss me. 

282
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,180
 Eat well. 

283
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,500
 Sleep well. 

284
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,440
 Remember to miss me. 

285
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,440
 Gan Yang, 

286
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,060
 do you know what is the biggest difference between us? 

287
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,900
 I can't even afford half. 

288
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,600
   

289
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,144
I'm dead tired.

290
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:44,460
I can't focus at all.

291
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,632
Why don't we go get a cup of coffee?

292
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:48,980
- Sure. 
 - Let's go.

293
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,240
Couldn't you sleep last night?

294
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,820
Don't even ask. I was up all night.

295
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,540
Why?

296
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,200
My apartment had a water leak.

297
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,320
When I got home, it was almost flooded.

298
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,800
At midnight, I had to pack and go to a hotel.

299
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,080
That serious?

300
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,920
It's so annoying.

301
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,440
The landlord wants to renovate so I have to find a new place.

302
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,460
I'm so busy. I don't even have time for that.

303
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,360
Sister Qin Yu, actually, I happen to have a place.

304
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,980
It's two subway stops away from the office. Manhattan Neighborhood.

305
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,680
It's a bit pricey, though.

306
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,200
Do you want to check it out?

307
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,580
Really? That would be great.

308
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,900
The rent isn't an issue, if it's move-in ready.

309
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,780
Manhattan? That sounds familiar.

310
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,040
They say the environment there is nice.

311
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,480
Are you subletting?

312
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,480
No. My boyfriend rented it for me.

313
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,680
I think it's too expensive so I figured I'd sublet it.

314
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,300
The apartment is really nice. You can move in right away.

315
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,980
What's wrong, Chen Xi?

316
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,320
Nothing. I'm just tidying up the desk.

317
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,120
Are you eavesdropping on us?

318
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,080
What are you talking about?

319
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Why would I eavesdrop on you?

320
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,160
Are you paranoid?

321
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,380
Just ignore her.

322
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,300
I'll get back to work. I've got so much work to do.

323
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,720
I'll be there after I make a call.

324
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,950
   

325
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,060
Hello?

326
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,920
Tong Tong.

327
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,680
I thought you'd never talk to me again.

328
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Do I seem that petty?

329
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,820
That's not what I meant.

330
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,100
I just worried you were still angry at me.

331
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,700
Not at all.

332
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,320
What are your plans for today?

333
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,060
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?

334
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,340
When are you going back?

335
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,340
I've booked a flight for after 3 p.m.

336
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,840
I'll leave the hotel at 1 p.m.

337
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,480
Then I may not make it to see you off.

338
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,660
This afternoon, I accompany Director Dai to meet a client.

339
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,320
It's okay. Focus on work.

340
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,300
Work comes first.

341
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:24,220
Can you have the apartment keys delivered to my office?

342
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,280
Tong Tong, have you changed your mind?

343
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,200
I want to check it out first.

344
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,580
You'll love it once you see it.

345
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,720
 How about this? 

346
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,060
 When will you be back at the office? 

347
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,080
I'll bring the keys and go with you.

348
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,820
Don't bother. I have many clients to meet today.

349
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,940
Don't let this distract you from your exam tomorrow.

350
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,200
Okay.

351
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,460
Then call me after you see it.

352
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,320
Then I'll get back to work.

353
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,600
Okay, bye bye.

354
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,340
Gan Yang.

355
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm here.

356
00:21:56,966 --> 00:22:00,077
I know you rented it for me.

357
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:02,320
I shouldn't have argued with you yesterday.

358
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't say that, Tong Tong.

360
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,180
I should have discussed it with you.

361
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,640
I was wrong, too.

362
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,760
Let's just forget this

363
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,740
and not bring it up again.

364
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,340
Okay?

365
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:32,580
Stay safe.

366
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,820
Call me when you land.

367
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,360
Okay, bye bye.

368
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,880
Bye bye.

369
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,880
Yes!

370
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,900
Sister Qin Yu, I've brought you some coffee.

371
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,220
Thank you. You're so kind.

372
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,220
It's nothing.

373
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,020
What's wrong?

374
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,380
Are you looking for an apartment?

375
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,920
I wasn't eavesdropping.

376
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,600
I just overheard bits while I passed by.

377
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,940
Actually, I have a realtor friend.

378
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,020
I could introduce you if needed.

379
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,720
I am looking for a place,

380
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,960
but don't need a realtor for now.

381
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,580
Zhi Tong said she has a place.

382
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,600
I want to go take a look first.

383
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,940
Since when does she have an apartment?

384
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,220
It seems her boyfriend rented it for her.

385
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,580
She thinks it's too expensive so she wants to sublet it.

386
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,940
Just as I thought.

387
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,600
What... what's wrong?

388
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,720
Nothing.

389
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,840
If you need anything, just let me know.

390
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,100
My friend will give you a discount.

391
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,940
Okay. Thank you.

392
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,060
- No worries. 
 - And for your coffee.

393
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,200
Okay. I won't disturb you anymore then.

394
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,700
 I've finally caught you. 

395
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,920
 Ding Zhi Tong, you're doomed. 

396
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,600
 We're here. 

397
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
 The layout and lighting are great, 

398
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,660
and the renovation is good.

399
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,200
It's completely move-in ready.

400
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,280
With our workload, an apartment is just a place to sleep anyway.

401
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,080
All else is just a minor issue.

402
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,820
Won't your boyfriend be upset if you sublet it?

403
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,120
I'll have to ask for forgiveness later.

404
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,700
The rent here is just too expensive,

405
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,460
nearly my entire monthly salary.

406
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,780
I really can't afford it.

407
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,747
I'll explain it to him after I've rented it out.

408
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:29,600
- All right. 
 - Let me show you around.

409
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,180
Ding Zhi Tong.

410
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,280
Gan Yang? Why are you here?

411
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,200
Sorry, this place isn't available for rent.

412
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,940
Gan Yang, isn't it a waste not to rent it out?

413
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,520
I'm not willing to do that.

414
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,700
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

415
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,820
It's okay.

416
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,920
Tong Tong, I won't look at it today.

417
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,620
You two should figure it out. I'm leaving.

418
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm sorry, Sister Qin Yu.

419
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,340
It's okay.

420
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,020
Gan Yang, I know you rented this place for me,

421
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,800
but I really can't afford the rent.

422
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,740
Did I ever ask you for rent?

423
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,620
Then what right do I have to live here?

424
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,200
You're my girlfriend.

425
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,980
What's wrong with your living in my place?

426
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,580
It's not like that.

427
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,120
I want to rely on myself and live where I can afford.

428
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,980
Then I'm more secure. Do you understand what I mean?

429
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,080
Why must you draw such strong lines?

430
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,060
Why can't you just accept my kindness?

431
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,380
It's not that I can't accept it.

432
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,300
I just don't want to rely on anyone.

433
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,060
I don't want to rely on you, living in your place.

434
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,660
Should I just rely on you and use your money for everything?

435
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,900
Ding Zhi Tong, I'm your boyfriend,

436
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,620
not some stranger. Do you understand?

437
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,652
I care about you, and I want a better life for you.

438
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:51,370
Is that wrong?

439
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,150
What are you afraid of?

440
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Tong Tong, can you tell me?

441
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,560
What are you afraid of?

442
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,860
Gan Yang,

443
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,420
I'm not afraid.

444
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,620
I just don't want this.

445
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,720
I thought...

446
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,020
we were past keeping score.

447
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,720
Turns out that was just me.

448
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,860
 Who is it? 

449
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,780
Why are you here?

450
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,540
Do you have any alcohol?

451
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,720
Well, yes. But...

452
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,800
This is all I have.

453
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,580
This will do.

454
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,700
Hey, what's going on?

455
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,260
Easy there.

456
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,780
What happened?

457
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,560
Gan Yang and I might be done.

458
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,700
Is it about money again?

459
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,540
It all comes back to money.

460
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,020
You once said

461
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,420
that 90% of life's problems could be solved with money.

462
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,160
Well, the reverse is true too.

463
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,160
So 90% of problems arise due to a lack of money.

464
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,000
You're right.

465
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,120
But do you think he did anything wrong?

466
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,620
What did he do wrong?

467
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,420
He just wanted me to have a better life.

468
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,440
But you know what, a better life

469
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,300
is also a luxury for me.

470
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,860
You? You're just too independent.

471
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,200
You should try to rely on him a little.

472
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,140
"Rely on him"?

473
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,180
I'll tell you something. Money can destroy any relationship,

474
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,380
because I've experienced that.

475
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,340
Blood relatives can turn against you over money.

476
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,600
My uncle, who used to dote on me,

477
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,940
can sue me and my mom over money.

478
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,660
And Gan Yang's money isn't his own.

479
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,580
It's from his family.

480
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,420
But Gan Yang isn't like your relatives.

481
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,060
I know he's different.

482
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,460
That's exactly why

483
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,020
I don't want money to complicate our relationship.

484
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,700
No couple avoids money issues forever.

485
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,360
Think about it.

486
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,220
When you two go out to eat, do you split every bill?

487
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,240
Is that even possible?

488
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,440
It's not the same.

489
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,200
Fine.

490
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,920
Then I'll change the question.

491
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,320
Do you love him?

492
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,640
That's what matters.

493
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,400
Disagreements are temporary.

494
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,060
Just talk to him.

495
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,480
It'll all work out.

496
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,100
You know what? There are things I can only tell you.

497
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,040
I...

498
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,340
I can't say them to him.

499
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,560
I don't know what's wrong with me.

500
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,760
Silly, it's because you love him. Right?

501
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:57,060
It's human nature to want to show your best self to your loved one.

502
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,000
I'll drink with you.

503
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,460
Come on.

504
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,740
You've been through so much.

505
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,000
Do you know what time it is?

506
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,240
Go get some sleep.

507
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,120
I can't sleep.

508
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,440
I might as well work.

509
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,800
You haven't slept since you got back.

510
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,720
Go get some sleep now.

511
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,280
I can't sleep.

512
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,480
Wasn't it just a fight?

513
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,560
What couple never fights?

514
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,060
Just give her a break and apologize. It'll be fine.

515
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:00,905
I didn't do anything wrong.

516
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:02,680
Why should I be the one to make up?

517
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Look. That attitude is dangerous.

518
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,960
Even I know that, and I was never in a relationship.

519
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,680
Whenever your girlfriend is upset, it's on you, even when it's not.

520
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,780
I just wanted to make her life easier. What's wrong with that?

521
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,560
That's what you think.

522
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,400
But your "help" might stress her out.

523
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,440
Actually, I think Ding Zhi Tong's reaction shows

524
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,240
that she likes you for you, not your money.

525
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,720
You should be happy about that.

526
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,900
I know she's independent,

527
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,860
but I can't stand seeing her struggle.

528
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,480
Her work is exhausting enough,

529
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,200
plus she must commute back and forth.

530
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,900
I can't be there for her.

531
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,340
I can't protect her.

532
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,480
So I just thought...

533
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,780
I should make sure she eats well, commutes less,

534
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,160
and is a bit more comfortable.

535
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,880
I didn't expect that...

536
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,480
to backfire.

537
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,840
It feels like she's always keeping me out.

538
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,240
It's as if I've never truly been part of her life.

539
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,540
I feel like such a failure.

540
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,180
Stop beating yourself up.

541
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,880
It's not a big problem.

542
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,800
Go get some sleep first.

543
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,480
When you wake up, call her and talk it out.

544
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,560
You'll work through this.

545
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,840
Why are you staring at me?

546
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,460
Go wait in the print room and bring these up as soon as they've finished!

547
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,980
And listen, these documents are confidential.

548
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,680
Only meeting attendees can access them. Remember that.

549
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,752
- What about these? 
 - J-Just go! I'll handle this.

550
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:36,080
- Are the materials ready? 
 - Working on it.

551
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,440
The investors will be here soon.

552
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,520
Hurry.

553
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,680
Okay.

554
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,720
Notify Industry Research of a meeting at 10 a.m. sharp.

555
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,260
Understood.

556
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,840
I see. I see.

557
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,280
I've already printed them.

558
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,800
Right.

559
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
The conference room, right?

560
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
That's a lot of stuff.

561
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,920
- Let me help you. 
 - I can do it.

562
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
These are important documents.

563
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,900
Unauthorized people can't see them.

564
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,400
I happen to represent Industry Research at this meeting.

565
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,060
Is the printer in your office broken?

566
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,440
Where is Jia Fan? Isn't this a job for the guys?

567
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,040
He's busy preparing materials, too.

568
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,800
Is Jia Fan giving you a hard time again?

569
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,460
No. Director Dai assigned this.

570
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,480
- They'll be usedâ€” 
 - Ding Zhi Tong, what are you doing?

571
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,300
- Hurry! No dawdling! 
 - Coming.

572
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,700
- Should this clause be specified in the details? 
 - Got it.

573
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,560
Director Dai, thank for your team's hard work.

574
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,640
Director Wang, you're too kind.

575
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,080
We're honored to serve so many distinguished clients.

576
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,720
Next, let's just wait for the profits to roll in.

577
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,000
Director Dai, we trust your work.

578
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,040
Well, then we will leave now.

579
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,840
- Let me see you out. 
 - All right.

580
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,880
Jia Fan, take care of the documents.

581
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,320
Okay.

582
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,720
Let's go.

583
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,880
   

584
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,680
Did you count the documents? No omissions?

585
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,360
I did. There are nine in total.

586
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,040
Gold digger.

587
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,720
Xu Chen Xi, don't go too far.

588
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,200
Don't push your luck.

589
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
Did I say something wrong?

590
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,700
Gan Yang kindly rented you a place yet you tried to sublet it behind his back.

591
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,840
If I hadn't found out, you'd have gotten away with it.

592
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,320
What else would you be but a gold digger?

593
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,560
You eavesdropped and sowed discord.

594
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,400
So exposing your true colors is sowing discord?

595
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,160
You think I would sublet it to take the monthly rent?

596
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,760
Then what?

597
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,280
Given how often Gan Yang comes to Shanghai every month,

598
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,520
how long do you think I could hide it from him?

599
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,380
If I really wanted his money, I would just move in and scheme for more.

600
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,980
That way, I'd have both the apartment and money.

601
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,720
Why would I live in constant fear?

602
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,060
Who knows what a person like you thinks?

603
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,640
Don't let jealousy blind you.

604
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,640
It only makes you petty.

605
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,580
Ding Zhi Tong, you think you're so noble?

606
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,240
Do you even know Gan Yang's research funding is tight?

607
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,320
He sold his prized shoes to rent that place for you.

608
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
He has flown back and forth 6-7 times

609
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,960
to decorate your dream home when he has no classes.

610
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,620
You don't know anything.

611
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,940
You just trample on his feelings.

612
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,480
You don't deserve him!

613
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,800
 He has flown back and forth 6-7 times 

614
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,610
 to decorate your dream home when he has no classes. 

615
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,960
â™«  Like a world with just us  â™«

616
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,680
 Then let's put the dining table here. 

617
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,280
 - Okay. 
 - We can eat watermelon together in summer. 

618
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,060
â™«  I wish I could stay with you  â™«

619
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:39,980
â™«  To feel the lingering warmth of love  â™«

620
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,380
â™«  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  â™«

621
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,020
â™«  When it comes to love  â™«

622
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:52,970
â™«  I hide but speak from the heart  â™«

623
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,560
â™«  Listen, the night sighs softly  â™«

624
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,280
â™«  The rain clouds are approaching  â™«

625
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,500
 I think this wall can be painted green. 

626
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,420
 It'll be easy on the eyes. 

627
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,770
â™«  And let you stand in the rain with me  â™«

628
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:13,930
â™«  Wind delivers the messages of my heart  â™«

629
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,130
â™«  Which line should I send?  â™«

630
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,700
â™«  Can let our story continue  â™«

631
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,320
â™«  Can let our story continue  â™«

632
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,140
â™«  I wish I could spend every  â™«

633
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,700
â™«  Dusk and dawn with you  â™«

634
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,240
 Then put a sofa here. 

635
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,152
 - in winter, we can curl up and watch movies. 
 - Okay. 

636
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:33,880
 I'll cook for you here; 

637
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,020
 you'll see me if you turn around. 

638
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,840
â™«  I wish I could stay with you  â™«

639
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,580
â™«  To feel the lingering warmth of love  â™«

640
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,990
â™«  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  â™«

641
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,710
â™«  When it comes to love  â™«

642
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:58,660
â™«  I hide but speak from the heart  â™«

643
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,900
 I can put a desk here. 

644
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,060
 Then I'll watch scenery when I tire of working. 

645
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,600
 Put an eye-protection lamp next to it. 

646
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,649
 - Perfect. 
 - Okay. 

647
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:22,755
â™«  From the ashes of my dream  â™«

648
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:24,835
â™«  Let me hold you  â™«

 I'm sorry, Gan Yang.

 "Someone" by Tia Ray

00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:39,845
â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

677
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:22,095
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:29,195
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:35,637
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

680
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:42,922
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

681
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:50,055
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™«

682
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:56,951
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«
