 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,300
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,790
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,580
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,240
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,360
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,490
   

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:49,440


26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,340
 Ding Zhi Tong, I don't know what exactly occurred 

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,840
 between you and your uncle, 

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,260
 but he purposely sent the summons to the school. 

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,020
 You know exactly his intention. 

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,260
 I'm sorry, Ma'am. 

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,940
 If this isn't handled properly, 

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,380
 it could affect your graduation. 

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,800
 When your father was sick, I lent you money because we are family. 

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,660
 In the end, your father passed away, 

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,240
 and the debt still isn't settled. 

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
 You must repay it all this time, 

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,875
 or I'll see you in court. 

38
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,500
   

39
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,220
 Was Uncle here again? 

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,860
 I told him. 

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,380
 I’ll repay him a little each month until it's done. 

42
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,980
 Just focus on your studies. 

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,820
 I'll see to the money. 

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,940
 I don't want to study anymore. 

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,700
 - I want to get a job. 
 - No way! 

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,980
 No matter how hard it gets for me, 

47
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,060
 you stay in school! 

48
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,160
 Don't think of dropping out. 

49
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:07,375
♫  I want you  ♫

50
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:21,175
♫  I miss you, miss you  ♫

51
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:27,900
♫  I love you  ♫

52
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,875
♫  I want you  ♫

53
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,975
   

54
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:37,575
♫  I wait just for you  ♫

55
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,575
   

56
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:51,950
♫  For you, for you  ♫

57
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,900
 Is she going through something? 

58
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,580
Hello, Elder Uncle. It's Tong Tong. I—

59
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,100
Hello, Auntie.

60
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,300
It's Tong Tong.

61
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,380
 I know your mother's brother is in trouble. 

62
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,300
 He wants the loan repaid two years early, 

63
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,060
 but I lack money now. 

64
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,440
 I really can't help you. 

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,400
Auntie...

66
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,660
 Tong Tong, I'll be honest. 

67
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,260
 I do have the money, 

68
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,900
 but it’s all in the bank earning interest. 

69
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,940
 That's ¥200,000. 

70
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,700
 The interest is almost ¥10,000 a year. 

71
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,020
 Don't take this the wrong way, 

72
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,740
 but if I lend it to you, I'll lose the interest. 

73
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,180
 And I don't know when I’ll get the principal back. 

74
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,740
 Also, I heard your uncle is suing you. 

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,380
Auntie, how about this?

76
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,540
I'll borrow ¥200,000 from you. I'll repay ¥10,000 every year,

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,860
¥3,000 more than the bank interest.

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,100
The bank only pays interest at maturity,

79
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,180
but I can make monthly payments.

80
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,460
Right now, it'd be ¥2,000 a month.

81
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,700
Once I get a job, I can even repay more.

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,020
I’ll repay all in two years at most.

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,540
Is that okay with you?

84
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,220
 Words aren't enough. 

85
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,380
I'm begging you, Auntie.

86
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,540
Then how about this?

87
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,880
I'll write an IOU and send you a photo of it.

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,140
 All right. 

89
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,180
 Listen, I'm helping you only because we're related. 

90
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,060
- Okay. 
 -  I wouldn't even bother for anyone else. 

91
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,300
 Oh, don't let your cousin, He Jin, know 

92
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,820
 that I'm lending you the money. 

93
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,780
 You know, if he finds out about this money, 

94
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,180
 he will surely covet it and gamble it away. 

95
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,780
Understood. Thank you, Auntie.

96
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,660
I'll write the IOU now.

97
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,980
 All right. 

98
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,980
 Ding Zhi Tong, wake up now. 

99
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
 You have no time for a relationship right now. 

100
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,240
 Focus on making money. 

101
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,420
Tong Tong, you got your computer fixed?

102
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,940
Gan Yang helped me with it.

103
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,980
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

104
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,940
No.

105
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,220
 He basically replaced all the hardware. 

106
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,160
Here's the money for Ding Zhi Tong's computer repair and replaced parts.

107
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,050
Did she send you to me?

108
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,340
Why doesn't she repay me herself?

109
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,060
We're all adults.

110
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,940
Her message is very clear.

111
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,860
Please don't bother her from now on.

112
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,020
What's your relationship with her?

113
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,180
Take the money.

114
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,972
- Done. 
 - Thanks.

115
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:06,580
Thank you.

116
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,150
   

117
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,690
Hello?

118
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,700
Tong Tong, what's the matter?

119
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,780
Mom, why did it take you so long to answer?

120
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,180
I-I was dancing in the park.

121
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,420
It's too crowded and noisy. I couldn't hear you.

122
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,780
I got my salary this month.

123
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,520
Guess how much I got?

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,220
- Is it 2,500? 
 - It's 3,000.

125
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,640
Really 3,000?

126
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,760
That much?

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,100
My boss said I did well this month.

128
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,940
Besides the ¥2,500 salary,

129
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,660
I got a ¥500 bonus.

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,100
I'll repay ¥2,000 to Aun...

131
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,920
I mean, repay ¥2,000 to Uncle and send ¥500 to you.

132
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,460
No need. I haven't even spent all the money you gave me last month.

133
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,780
 I don't need money this month. 

134
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,520
 Besides, ¥500 isn't enough for you. 

135
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Use the extra money to treat yourself to a nice dress. Don't skimp.

136
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,460
I'm doing fine. Don't worry.

137
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,820
Ma'am, how much for the pancake?

138
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,660
One moment, please.

139
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,220
Mom, are you selling pancakes on the street again?

140
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,340
No. I was just passing someone's stall.

141
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,700
Then let's have a video call now?

142
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,180
I’m just at home with nothing to do.

143
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,820
Thought I'd give it a try.

144
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,060
Consider that as killing time.

145
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,180
Mom, the doctor said you need rest.

146
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,780
Pack everything at once,

147
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,500
or I'll take leave and come help you.

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,060
All right, I got it.

149
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,780
I'm packing up now.

150
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,100
Keep your word.

151
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,580
Okay, all right. I got it.

152
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,140
Hold on, please.

153
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,700
Mom, we will have a better life someday.

154
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,580
Once I start earning more, I’ll take you on a trip,

155
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,860
all over the country.

156
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,720
 All right then. 

157
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,500
 I'm hanging up. 

158
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,540
The call is expensive.

159
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,500
Okay, bye bye.

160
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,080
Ma’am, your daughter is so good to you.

161
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,780
- Sorry about that. 
 - No worries.

162
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,780
Things will get better for us.

163
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,940
Ding Zhi Tong!

164
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,100
Senior.

165
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,460
How is it? Is the computer working well?

166
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,860
It's quite good.

167
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,020
Of course, it is.

168
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,340
Let me tell you a secret.

169
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,760
Gan Yang replaced all your laptop's parts.

170
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,300
Do you know how much it cost?

171
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,140
It was 2,000.

172
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,220
He made me promise not to tell.

173
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,100
Don't tell him I said anything.

174
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,980
But you need to appreciate what he’s done for you.

175
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,700
I need to get to the lab.

176
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,440
Bye bye.

177
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,620
Auntie, well, I really need to apologize.

178
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,080
But can I delay the first payment by a month?

179
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,060
 What? 

180
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,180
 You promised you’d start repaying this month. 

181
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,420
 You’re backing out before you’ve even started? 

182
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,100
 No wonder nobody else would lend you money. 

183
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm sorry, Auntie.

184
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,540
Something unexpected came up.

185
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,820
I'll surely start the payment next month.

186
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,420
 If you break your word again next month, 

187
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,840
 I won't lend you any money again. 

188
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,380
Understood. Thank you, Auntie.

189
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,375
   

190
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,260
Hello?

191
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,840
I have to speak to you in person. Let's meet.

192
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,720
Ding Zhi Tong.

193
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,580
Did you ask Feng Sheng to repay me for the laptop?

194
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,340
Are you distancing yourself from me?

195
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,640
I appreciate your fixing my computer, but I don't like owing people.

196
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,160
"People"?

197
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,860
Am I considered "people" to you?

198
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,640
No matter what,

199
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,220
I owe you a thank you.

200
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,500
I should go.

201
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,980
 Gan Yang, I know you're kind to me. 

202
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,000
 But I can't give you what you're looking for right now. 

203
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,260
   

204
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,980
Tong Tong.

205
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,420
Feng Sheng.

206
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,220
Thank you for helping me repay Gan Yang.

207
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,540
Did you see him?

208
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,760
Is he returning the money to me?

209
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,380
No. I saved it from my part-time job.

210
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,020
You realized he replaced my computer parts, right?

211
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,940
I’ve noticed you work hard at your part-time job.

212
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,780
I didn't want to put too much pressure on you.

213
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,340
Thanks.

214
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,500
Come on, Ding Zhi Tong.

215
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,540
We've known each other for years.

216
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,120
Do you really need to be so formal?

217
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,500
Just take it.

218
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,940
Take it.

219
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,040
By the way, have you heard back from Hetai Securities?

220
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,180
It doesn't look promising.

221
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,820
Have you applied to other companies?

222
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,080
I tried Moqi Investment.

223
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,540
I'm still waiting to hear.

224
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,580
"Moqi Investment"?

225
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,720
I thought you'd like a job in Shanghai to be closer to home.

226
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,980
I think Moqi Investment's headquarters is in Beijing.

227
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,980
They have a Shanghai Branch which isn't hiring this year.

228
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,940
Moqi Investment's salary and benefits are quite good.

229
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,500
I thought if nothing works out here,

230
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,680
I'll go to Moqi Investment first, then find how to return here.

231
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,720
It's not a bad plan.

232
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,040
What does this mean?

233
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,996
- What did you get? 
 - They're all the same.

234
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:42,780
These companies are for your mock due-diligence reports.

235
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,700
Assume we have ¥20 million in cash.

236
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,700
You have one week to conduct your mock due diligence.

237
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,260
In a week, your report decides if and how to invest.

238
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,780
Professor, only company names are included,

239
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,060
no contact information.

240
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,580
How are we supposed to reach them?

241
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,320
You have to find your own way.

242
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,620
It's also part of the assessment.

243
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,980
Guess we can't contact them.

244
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,420
There's not even a phone number.

245
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,550
Quiet.

246
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,020
   

247
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,500
Your project is quite difficult.

248
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,860
Due diligence is all about connections.

249
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,060
- You need to understand a company's core business. 
 - Thanks.

250
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,880
So it works only if you know the top executives.

251
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,280
Thank you.

252
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,780
That's my girl.

253
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,500
You don’t evade and get straight to the point.

254
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,834
- What would you like? 
 - Auntie, cauliflower, please.

255
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,500
- Sure. 
 - Me, too.

256
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,760
I tell you, Qin Chang is an oddball.

257
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,140
When I see him, I get annoyed.

258
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,900
I really don't want to attend his class anymore.

259
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,840
I hate him.

260
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,620
I want more cauliflower, please, Auntie.

261
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,820
Sure.

262
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,660
Hello, Professor Qin.

263
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,140
Hello.

264
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,620
Professor Qin, what a coincidence.

265
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,080
Would you like to join us? My treat.

266
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,480
No, thanks.

267
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,680
I owe you one then!

268
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,860
I'll make it up to you!

269
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,980
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

270
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,280
He heard it all, didn't he?

271
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,080
Isn't this awkward?

272
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,020
No big deal. Listen, you need to turn passivity into action.

273
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,540
That way, no one feels awkward, all right?

274
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,520
Got it?

275
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,640
Got it. Makes sense.

276
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,940
I got the contact info for Jiaoyang Animal Husbandry.

277
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,260
Here, take it.

278
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,840
I need to finish my due diligence report soon.

279
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,120
It's all yours. Love you.

280
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,160
I'm leaving. Bye bye.

281
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,220
Acting all weird.

282
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,160
 I appreciate your fixing my computer, 

283
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,160
 but I don't like owing people. 

284
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,120
 "People"? 

285
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,260
 Am I considered "people" to you? 

286
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,840
 Did I speak too harshly? 

287
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,900
 Will he view me as ungrateful? 

288
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,300
 We stay friends only if the debt is cleared. 

289
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,740
 I hope he understands. 

290
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,360
Tong Tong.

291
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,300
What's wrong? You seem distracted.

292
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,620
Nothing.

293
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,260
How about you? Is the due diligence report going smoothly?

294
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,080
Not doing well?

295
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,320
Wrong, it's very smooth.

296
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,760
It seems too smooth to be real.

297
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,120
They give me the info I ask for and answer all my questions.

298
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,780
In just one day, I've almost completed the due diligence.

299
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,700
In this situation, the company is either genuinely clean,

300
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,780
or they're setting a trap for you to jump into.

301
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,140
Most of the time, it's the latter.

302
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,860
Right. So after my work at their headquarters today,

303
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,460
I'll visit the ranch in person.

304
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,460
Let me know if you need any help.

305
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,660
You're the best, Tong Tong.

306
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,240
Hello?

307
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
 Is this Ding Zhi Tong? 

308
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,520
Yes.

309
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,800
 This is HR from Moqi Investment Co., Ltd. 

310
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,580
 Congratulations, you passed the initial screening. 

311
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,980
 Please come to our company's interview at 10 a.m. today. 

312
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,820
It's already 9 a.m.

313
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,000
But it's already 9 a.m.

314
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,940
 I'm sorry. We were also notified at the last minute. 

315
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,400
 Please be on time, or you will be disqualified from the interview. 

316
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,680
I-I understand.

317
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,580
I-I'll be there on time. Thank you.

318
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,100
Who gives just one hour's notice for an interview?

319
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,980
Even by taxi, it takes you 40 minutes to get there.

320
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,040
I'll hurry and dress.

321
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,580
A taxi should get me there just in time.

322
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,360
- Tong Tong, good luck! 
 - Fighting.

323
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,060
Why does Shuchi suddenly want to see us?

324
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,140
We just sent them the first-phase funding proposal yesterday,

325
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,080
yet they want to see us today. Are they changing their mind?

326
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,460
Can you have some confidence?

327
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,380
Maybe they like our project and want to increase their investment.

328
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,920
I hope so.

329
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,160
Let's do this.

330
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,940
Let's get the R&amp;D materials, then head straight to Shuchi.

331
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,460
All right.

332
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,940
Isn't that Ding Zhi Tong?

333
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,500
She seems to be in a hurry.

334
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,150
Should we check on her?

335
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,870
 ­  

336
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,140
Do you think I don't want to?

337
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,380
It's not that easy.

338
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:03,600
♫  The time and time  ♫

339
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:10,125
♫  Life and life  ♫

340
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:19,875
♫  I had it once. I lost it though  ♫

341
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,180
 I've reviewed the funding proposal you sent yesterday. 

342
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,460
The amount has far exceeded our expectations.

343
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,320
The company would never approve this.

344
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,920
We're developing midsole materials, the core component of all sneakers.

345
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,340
Shuchi specializes in sneakers.

346
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,100
I know midsole materials better than you do.

347
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,820
But, Director Zhan,

348
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,980
we're developing the latest foam technology; it’s a brand-new material.

349
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,940
This is actually an area that other companies in our industry haven't noticed yet.

350
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,020
The investment return also far exceeds that of manufacturing normal running shoes.

351
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,080
When our product succeeds, it has the potential to open up a new market area.

352
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,840
I need further discussion with the executives.

353
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,020
You're really something.

354
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,800
You convinced Director Zhan.

355
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
There shouldn't be any problems moving forward now.

356
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,660
There shouldn't be.

357
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,420
Ding Zhi Tong!

358
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,680
- What are you doing here? 
 - I had some business nearby.

359
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,580
I heard Moqi Investment scheduled interviews today.

360
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,920
I checked it out since you'd be here.

361
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,420
How did your interview go?

362
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,820
I think I did all right in the initial interview.

363
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,680
That's good.

364
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,420
Let me help you with that.

365
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,040
Let's go back to school.

366
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,780
Xiao Chen, bring me Ding Zhi Tong's resume.

367
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
Hello?

368
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,160
Yes.

369
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,480
All right.

370
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,520
Shuangwei Mountain? Not at your company?

371
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,140
Got it, I see. Thank you.

372
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,400
   

373
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:24,120
♫  I wish I could spend every dusk and dawn with you  ♫

374
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:33,770
♫  Like a world with just us and a clock without hands  ♫

375
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:40,480
♫  I wish I could stay with you to feel the lingering warmth of love  ♫

376
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,000
♫  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  ♫

377
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,140
♫  When it comes to love, I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

378
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,210
 ­Here you go. 

379
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,820
 It's midnight on the dot. Happy birthday to you. 

380
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:14,215
♫  Please don’t wake me  ♫

381
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:17,825
♫  Let me hold you  ♫

382

♫  From the ashes of my dream  ♫

383

00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:39,215
♫  Only for you  ♫

387
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:46,255
♫  I wish I could spend every dusk and dawn with you  ♫

388
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,220
Hey, Old Li, what's up?

389
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,920
 Old Qin, your student, Song Ming Mei, is truly something. 

390
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,700
 She’s already figured out most of the false information you had me give her. 

391
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,100
 That girl is really something. 

392
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,700
 She looks delicate but works like a pro. 

393
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,080
 It was already dark by the time she left the ranch. 

394
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,840
 She should be at the downtown bus station by now. 

395
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,480
 It's raining so hard, but she will be fine, right? 

396
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,780
When did you turn into such a worrier?

397
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,980
If you're done, I'll hang up.

398
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,620
Professor Qin?

399
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,700
- Are you returning to school? 
 - Get in.

400
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,180
Do you mind giving me a ride?

401
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,780
Thanks.

402
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,400
It's so hard to get a taxi in this heavy rain. I’m lucky to see you.

403
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,440
I visited Jiaoyang Ranch today.

404
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,200
I counted the number and breeds of horses at the suburban horse farm,

405
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,760
examined their production equipment,

406
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,960
and found that nothing matched their claims.

407
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,220
I almost fell for their lies.

408
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,260
   

409
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,260
I heard you asked them to deliberately give me false data.

410
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,780
Are you retaliating against me?

411
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,260
Just because I criticized you in the cafeteria?

412
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,440
Due diligence is to distinguish truth from lies.

413
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,180
I just added challenge to the process.

414
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,400
It's not just you. All got their own challenges.

415
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,400
So... don't be too full of yourself.

416
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,860
But you can't just—

417
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,640
- You'd better sit still and stop talking. 
 - Why?

418
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,380
Because you really stink right now.

419
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,640
Ding Zhi Tong.

420
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,658
Director Ma?

421
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:43,180
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

422
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,260
I'm fine. I can walk up myself.

423
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,180
The road up the mountain is rough. Get in.

424
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,720
Thank you, Director Ma.

425
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,140
Let's get out. 
     

426
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,840
Get some fresh air.

427
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,352
But the interview later...

428
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:16,100
Don't worry. We have plenty of time.

429
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,560
You can see the good scenery only if you're in the right place.

430
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,940
Same goes for the workplace.

431
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,580
If you’re in the right position, you can go further and accomplish more.

432
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,460
What do you think, Ding Zhi Tong?

433
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Director Ma, I appreciate your advice.

434
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,420
I know the climb will be tough.

435
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,540
I'm ready.

436
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,260
Your resume mentions you're from a single-parent family.

437
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,700
Your mother must have endured much to raise you on her own.

438
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,820
You must want to give her a better life soon.

439
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,020
If I get into Moqi Investment, I’ll surely work hard.

440
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,580
But have you ever thought

441
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,220
about how long it will take for you to succeed on your own?

442
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,840
Five years? Ten years?

443
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,140
But it would be different if someone could give you a hand.

444
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,480
So what do I need to do?

445
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,420
That depends on what you have to offer.

446
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
No, thanks, Director Ma.

447
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,100
I'll walk up the mountain myself.

448
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,580
Welcome to the interview session. 
    

449
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,360
Let me introduce myself.

450
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,480
I'm Ma Wen De, Moqi's Vice President and the interviewer for this round.

451
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,700
The reason we chose the mountain area is

452
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,700
to test everyone’s physical fitness

453
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,660
and teamwork skills in a team setting.

454
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,580
I will score based on your performance.

455
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,180
Only the top five scorers will be hired.

456
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,620
Please cherish this opportunity.

457
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,940
 Are you done over there? Need any help? 

458
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,180
 Help me with this. 

459
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,820
 - I don't know how to do it. 
 - Sure, I'll do it. 

460
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
 So it should be inserted. 

461
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,400
 Exactly. There we go. 

462
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,500
Director Ma, can I get a new tent?

463
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,900
The pole is broken.

464
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,580
Each person can only receive one set of tents.

465
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,660
If we replace yours, someone else will get a broken one.

466
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,000
But it was already broken. That's not fair.

467
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,460
This is what a workplace looks like.

468
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,060
Here, we care about ability, not fairness.

469
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,460
If you think it's unfair, you can just quit.

470
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,440
 She's giving up already? 

471
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,980
 That should do it. 

472
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,180
 She's back. 

473
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,740
 Why is she coming back? 

474
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,880
 - Hey, look. 
 - What is she doing? 

475
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,180
 What's in her hand? 

476
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,300
 Where did she find that? 

477
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,980
 A branch. 

478
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,100
Quit staring and get back to your tasks.

479
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,620
 - Stop gawking. 
 - Back to work. 

480
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,720
No rush. Take your time.

481
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,520
- Thank you, Director Ma. 
 - The competition hasn't officially started yet.

482
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,780
We need to attach it like this.

483
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,440
- All right. 
 - That's it.

484
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,140
Give me the nails.

485
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,740
Nails.

486
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,480
Let me help you.

487
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,840
 Lin Xiao? She's also here for the interview. 

488
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Steady it with the hand.

489
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
 Give it a try. Drive it in like this. 

490
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,020
- That's right. 
 - Director Ma, I can do it myself.

491
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,400
I really can. I... I really can.

492
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,460
It's okay. There you go.

493
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,200
Keep driving it down.

494
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,840
Director Ma, this is sexual harassment.

495
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,440
Young people these days are really something.

496
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,320
I just denied you replacement equipment, and now you’re framing me?

497
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm not framing you.

498
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,200
I saw it all.

499
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,540
You tell everyone if I did anything to you.

500
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,520
No... Nothing.

501
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,060
Director Ma was acting out of goodwill. You've misunderstood.

502
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,700
Do you have anything else to say?

503
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,500
I clearly saw what you did.

504
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,540
How could it be a misunderstanding?

505
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,420
I'll ask you again.

506
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,020
Did I sexually harass you just now?

507
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,660
All right.

508
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,620
Moqi Investment has no place for malicious characters like you!

509
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,140
You're disqualified from the interview. You can leave now.

510
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,700
Go. Get out of my sight!

511
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,580
So ill-mannered.

512
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,780
Ding Zhi Tong, why are you here?

513
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,740
Are you okay?

514
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm fine. What are you doing here?

515
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,490
Song Ming Mei told me Moqi Investment’s second interview would be on this mountain.

516
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,140
I was a bit worried.

517
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,240
After asking around,

518
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,740
I learned your interviewer Ma Wen De has a really bad reputation.

519
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,840
So I came here.

520
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,800
 Ma Wen De is a repeat offender. 

521
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,120
He's unscathed only because most victims stay silent.

522
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,580
You did the right thing today.

523
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,560
I understand Lin Xiao stayed quiet out of fear.

524
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,260
But I just can't stand Ma Wen De's tactics.

525
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,940
Well, self-preservation is human nature.

526
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,260
What's done is done.

527
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,260
Don't dwell on it.

528
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,760
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

529
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,280
Let me take you for a bite.

530
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,960
All right.

531
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,800
The fried rice here is amazing,

532
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,320
especially with a bit of chili.

533
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,200
- Shall we order two servings? 
 - Sure.

534
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,640
- Boss! 
 - Coming.

535
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,820
Two servings of fried rice.

536
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,160
- Mildly spicy. 
 - All right.

537
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,980
I want insane spicy.

538
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,240
"Insane spicy"?

539
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,860
Can you handle that?

540
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,400
I feel like trying it. Insane spicy, please.

541
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,920
- Insane spicy? 
 - Sure.

542
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,640
Then two servings, both insane spicy.

543
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,100
- "Both insane spicy"? Got it. 
 - Yes.

544
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,500
You're getting insane spicy, too?

545
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,360
I'll try it with you.

546
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,180
Ding Zhi Tong, give me your hand.

547
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,400
Why? 
    

548
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,380
This is for you.

549
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,080
 What a unique paper crane. 

550
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,880
 You gave me good fortune so I'll give you a paper crane. 

551
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,440
 Sure. 

552
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,280
 Can you teach me how to make one? 

553
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
 Of course. 

554
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
 I haven't seen one like this before. 

555
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,620
 - I'll show you. 
 - All right. 

556
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,598
 What color would you like? 

557
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:29,300
 - Red. 
 - All right. 

558
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,500
 Then I'll make a blue one. Fold it in half. 

559
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,620
 - Then? 
 - Then fold it in half again. 

560
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,040
You were very brave today.

561
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,720
This is your reward.

562
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,120
Thank you.

563
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,640
Two servings, both insane spicy. 
    

564
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,120
- Thanks, Boss. 
 - Thanks.

565
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,700
Let me try it.

566
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,900
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

567
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,880
How is it?

568
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,220
Not that spicy actually.

569
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,020
Did you choke?

570
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,500
Gan Yang.

571
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,560
Gan Yang, are you okay? 
    

572
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,200
Have some water. Here.

573
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,320
If you can't handle spice, why order insane spicy?

574
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,260
Why is it so spicy?

575
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,260
This is hilarious.

576
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,040
Don't you laugh.

577
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,560
Sir, one non-spicy fried rice, please.

578
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,280
Non-spicy? Sure.

579
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,300
Let me take this one.

580
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:29,990


581
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,270
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

582
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:41,210
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

583
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:49,460
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

584
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,697
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

585
00:39:55,697 --> 00:40:02,760
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

586
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,585
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

587
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:16,585
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

588
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:23,660
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

589
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:30,660
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

590
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:37,302
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

591
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:44,587
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

592
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:51,570
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

593
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:58,416
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

594
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:05,405
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

595
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:11,960
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

596
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,035
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

597
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:31,935
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
