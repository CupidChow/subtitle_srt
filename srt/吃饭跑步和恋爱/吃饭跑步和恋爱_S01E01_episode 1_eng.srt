 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,849
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,437
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:17,643
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:22,875
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:28,023
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:32,306
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,564
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:49,736
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:57,932
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:02,284
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:06,892
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:11,148
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:16,150
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,481
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,345
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:25,116
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,559
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,650
   

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,580
 Today is Tuesday, April 9, 2024. 
   

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,760
 It’s a clear, sunny day in Shanghai, 

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,840
 with highs of 23°C (74°F) and a low of 15°C (59°F). 

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,460
 The air quality is excellent. 

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,800
 A light long-sleeved T-shirt or jacket 

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,260
 would be perfect to wear. 

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,220
 Another beautiful morning 

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,660
 to all our listeners out there. 

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,160
 Have you gone for a jog and enjoyed a meal with your loved ones? 

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,675
   

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:29,180


36
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,640
 You've just run 10 kilometers (6.2miles). 

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,740
 Congratulations, you've reached today's exercise goal. 

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,400
   I've boarded. 
   

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,280
 See you later. 

40
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,800
 Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention, please. 

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,152
 Flight ZX366 from Hong Kong 

42
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,720
 arrived at 2:10 p.m. 

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,480
 Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? 

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,712
 Flight ZX366 from Hong Kong 

45
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:38,800
 arrived at 2:10 p.m. Thank you. 

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,500
   

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,720
   

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,460
See you in 2E.

49
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,300
Meet you soon.

50
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,220
- I'm picking up the coffee. 
 - Sure, just a moment.

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,220
   I've landed. Grab me a coffee. 

52
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,410
   

53
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,450
 ­Your attention, please. 

54
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,340
Go ahead.

55
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,100
Let me.

56
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:19,460
Thanks. 
    

57
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,580
- Hello, here's your coffee. 
 - Thank you.

58
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,940
Data...

59
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,820
I'll organize it and send it to you at once.

60
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,560
- Hi. A latte, please. 
 - Sure.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,740
You can scan to pay.

62
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,240
All right.

63
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Hello?

64
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,600
- Hello, here's your latte. 
 - Thanks.

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, I'm coming out now.

66
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,200
Excuse me. Have you seen a book around here?

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,720
Is this it?

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,120
Yes, thanks.

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,740
No problem.

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,020
   

71
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,350
   

72
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,950
   

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,980
 Sister Tong, it's time to meet Training Box's CEO Yuan. 

74
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,500
 We will make it. There is no traffic now. 

75
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,132
 I've already revised Training Box's funding proposal 

76
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:29,820
and sent it to your inbox.

77
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,900
I have read it on the plane.

78
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,620
You did a good job.

79
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,632
Once this deal closes,

80
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:44,540
you'll be promoted to Managing Director, won't you?

81
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,100
With so many competitors, how could I even hope for it?

82
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,420
Among all the candidates,

83
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,780
you joined the company the latest,

84
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,260
but you've landed many big deals.

85
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,660
And the Training Box client specifically requested you.

86
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,440
Don't get too excited yet.

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,845
Last time we met,

88
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:02,120
Yuan Chao seemed less enthusiastic about the funding.

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,800
I think their side is divided.

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
But he initiated today's meeting.

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
That's just my guess.

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,420
We will see his intent in our meeting.

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,920
Hello?

94
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,160
Gan Yang, I'm at the café.

95
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,640
Where are you?

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
Sorry?

97
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,360
I said I'm at the café.

98
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm heading to the parking lot now.

99
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,305
Let's go to Training Box.

100
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:37,905
All right.

101
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,875
♫  The time and time  ♫

102
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:50,550
♫  For life and life  ♫

103
00:06:53,425 --> 00:07:00,625
♫  I had it once. I lost it though  ♫

104
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,480
 She's back. 

105
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,020
Weren’t we meeting at the cafe?

106
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,300
Why are you at the parking lot?

107
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,800
Where's my coffee?

108
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
I forgot.

109
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,260
Let's grab it on the way back.

110
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,400
My car's parked across the street.

111
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,820
Are you okay?

112
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,560
I'm fine.

113
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,440
I ran ten kilometers today.

114
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,120
I'm a bit tired.

115
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,000
Did you try on your new shoes? How do they feel?

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,680
They're okay.

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,000
What do you mean by that?

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,240
- That's not the attitude I'm seeking. 
 - Fine.

119
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,200
In the data, let’s show a 5% increase in the rebound rate.

120
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,440
Gosh, do you realize 5%

121
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,880
means many all-nighters for me?

122
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,640
You're our Chief R&amp;D Officer at LT Capital.

123
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,720
I believe nothing can stop you, Dr. Wang.

124
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,400
Go for it.

125
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,520
Then I won't go to the office. I'll head straight to the lab.

126
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,950
   

127
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,740
   

128
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,660
CEO Yuan, it's been a while.

129
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,020
Likewise, Director Ding.

130
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,220
Sorry to make you come all the way from Hong Kong.

131
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,100
Please, have a seat.

132
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,140
You're too kind, CEO Yuan.

133
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,800
Providing excellent service to our users is what we should do.

134
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,780
Here is the revised proposal incorporating your feedback.

135
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,020
Please take a look. If you've any questions, we can answer right away.

136
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,060
Director Ding, I'm really sorry.

137
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,180
After the board meeting,

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,100
we decided to hold off the funding for now.

139
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,220
Here's the thing.

140
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,540
Although I'm the company's CEO,

141
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,820
I have to consider the shareholders' opinions.

142
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,480
The second-largest shareholder is firmly opposed to this.

143
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
It puts me in a tough spot.

144
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,940
CEO Yuan, I understand fully.

145
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,665
Since LT Capital is Training Box's second-largest shareholder,

146
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:36,140
why don't we invite LT Capital's CEO for a chat?

147
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,740
What do you think?

148
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,260
Brother, I'm telling you,

149
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,000
Yuan Chao is staging a mutiny. 
    

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,940
What happened?

151
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,500
We already agreed in the last meeting to reject more funds.

152
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,820
Yet today, he’s meeting with Gutong Securities at his office.

153
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,000
- No way. 
 - They're in his office right now.

154
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,820
Although LT is our second-largest shareholder,

155
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,300
they did invest when we were struggling.

156
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,400
His influence rivals mine.

157
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,460
I have to consider his stance.

158
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,060
Most importantly, he assured me that

159
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,860
LT Capital will provide further funding

160
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,980
if we need money.

161
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,600
Let's go.

162
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,720
We need to catch him red-handed.

163
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,180
LT Capital said they would provide funds now.

164
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,760
But have you discussed how the equity will change?

165
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,496
With your capabilities,

166
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:37,580
you could absolutely build a high-value company in this field.

167
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,980
However, do you think their capital alone

168
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,300
can make that happen?

169
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,600
CEO Yuan, CEO Gan is here.

170
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,680
I thought he wasn't coming in today.

171
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,140
I have no idea why he's back.

172
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,120
Director Ding, my apologies.

173
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,860
Something unexpected came up.

174
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,920
Shall we discuss the funding another time?

175
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
- CEO Yuan, but... 
 - I understand, CEO Yuan.

176
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,480
We will leave then.

177
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,680
Feel free to reach out anytime.

178
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
Absolutely.

179
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,080
Thank you.

180
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,400
Xiao He, see them out.

181
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,560
This way, please.

182
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,380
Take care.

183
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:22,300
   

184
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,550
CEO Yuan.

185
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,080
What brings you here? Please, have a seat.

186
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,940
Brother Yang, I just want to update you.

187
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,880
CEO Yuan, during the last shareholders' meeting,

188
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
I believe we made it clear

189
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
that we wouldn't accept funding.

190
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,520
Then why did you meet with people from Gutong behind our backs?

191
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,600
"Behind your back"?

192
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,660
Since when do I report my meetings to you?

193
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,180
- Hey, you... 
 - Sun Hao, we're not here to argue.

194
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,880
Sit down.

195
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,160
CEO Yuan,

196
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,880
it's just us three now.

197
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,580
Why not share your real thoughts?

198
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,620
I'm considering the company's long-term development.

199
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,620
Our competitors are already developing intelligent hardware

200
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,440
and expanding the gym studios.

201
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,100
I'm worried Training Box will miss this opportunity.

202
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,660
True.

203
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,260
But have you considered

204
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,500
that while expansion can bring us huge funds and short term profits,

205
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,080
it also includes enormous risks?

206
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,920
The second-largest shareholder of Training Box

207
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,200
should be in Yuan Chao's office now.

208
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,780
- Let's go back. 
 - All right.

209
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,680
Director Ding, what are you doing?

210
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,926
I left something inside. I'll go get it.

211
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,920
Please don't, Director Ding.

212
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,040
I'm sorry, but CEO Yuan is in a meeting.

213
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,120
You can't go in right now.

214
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,720
If you're in a hurry, you can leave,

215
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,920
and I'll have it delivered when the meeting ends.

216
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,080
It’s fine.

217
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,560
I'll just wait here.

218
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,720
Carry on with your work.

219
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
All right, suit yourself.

220
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,000
Sister Tong, will we just wait?

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,540
Let's wait for now.

222
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,080
All right.

223
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,200
At this stage, I think our priority

224
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
is to focus on Training Box's profitability.

225
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,520
Let's build solid revenue,

226
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,200
not just pursue inflated valuations.

227
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,020
CEO Yuan, we need to be responsible to our investors.

228
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,800
Yes, I think CEO Gan is right.

229
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,240
Even as a minority shareholder,

230
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,640
I've watched Training Box grow from the start.

231
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,800
I firmly trust CEO Gan's judgment.

232
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,620
CEO Yuan, we need to maintain a long-term perspective.

233
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:51,967
Jia Xin, it's time for my video meeting.

234
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:54,527
- Let me know when someone comes out. 
 - Understood.

235
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
CEO Yuan, please think it over.

236
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,840
We will leave now.

237
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,600
Are they gone?

238
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,860
Sorry, Sister Tong.

239
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,780
I missed them.

240
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,900
It's okay. Let's figure something out.

241
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,120
Shall we eat?

242
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,520
The convenience store's instant noodle combo

243
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,560
before my flight was really delicious.

244
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
You're so easy to please.

245
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,960
Let's go to the one near my place.

246
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,660
All right.

247
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,000
Sister Tong, are you from Shanghai?

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,560
No. Why?

249
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,200
You're based in Hong Kong and travel all over the world.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
You come to Shanghai maybe twice a year.

251
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,740
Why did you buy a home here?

252
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,200
 After we make money, let's buy a house here. 

253
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,260
 All right, let's buy one here. 

254
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,000
 Gan Yang. 

255
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,280
Sister Tong.

256
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,880
Sister Tong, what's wrong?

257
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,340
I’m fine.

258
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:00,720
♫  I miss you  ♫

259
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,200
Hao Chen, park at the convenience store ahead.

260
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,160
Got it, CEO Gan.

261
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,625
♫  I love you  ♫

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,440
Sister Tong, it's been ages since you made paper cranes.

263
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,120
Really?

264
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
I'm full, Sister Tong.

265
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,040
Nothing beats these noodles. Totally hits the spot.

266
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,840
Get some rest. Don't stay up late.

267
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,060
Yes, Sister Tong.

268
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,680
- Hello. 
 - Hi

269
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,760
Do you still have Laoshan Water?

270
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,120
Yes, how many bottles do you need?

271
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
Five or six, please.

272
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,200
Sure, just a moment.

273
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Thanks.

274
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,640
 So many paper cranes. 

275
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,720
 We used to have strings of these at home. 

276
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,560
 I hung them by the window. 

277
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,200
 When the wind blew, they looked like real flying cranes. 

278
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,160
 How beautiful. 

279
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,940
 It's her. 

280
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,820
Well, Ding Zhi Tong,

281
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,120
you didn't even tell me you were back in Shanghai.

282
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,600
We're on the same wavelength.

283
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,967
I was just about to call you.

284
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,080
 Enough chitchat. 

285
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,120
 Come to my place for dinner. 

286
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,827
Too late. I already ate.

287
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:39,920
I’ll see you tomorrow.

288
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,000
And I need a favor.

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 What is it? 

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,500
Help me find who the CEO of LT Capital is.

291
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,680
See you at the office tomorrow.

292
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,420
All right.

293
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,340
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

294

♫  I wish I could spend  ♫

329
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,140
♫  Every dusk and dawn with you  ♫

330
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
 Because I love him. 

331
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,050
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

332
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:52,340
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

333
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,760
 Goodbye. 

334
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,310
♫  To feel the lingering warmth of love  ♫

335
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,660
♫  My longing keeps knocking on the door  ♫

336
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,430
♫  When it comes to love  ♫

337
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:11,650
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

338
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,420
♫  Let us remain forever in this moment  ♫

339
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,000
Yu Lin, look who's here.

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,200
Mommy Ding, I missed you so much.

341
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,640
I missed you, too.

342
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
Look what I brought you.

343
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
What is this?

344
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
A doll!

345
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,080
- And this? 
 - KFC! I haven't had it for so long.

346
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,760
Right, let's see what we've got here.

347
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,480
Mom, can I have it?

348
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,200
Sure.

349
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,680
You always feed her snacks.

350
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,600
Once in a while won't hurt.

351
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,120
Right?

352
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
You spoil her too much.

353
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,920
Our little princess deserves to be spoiled.

354
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,160
Go ahead. Have it at the table, okay?

355
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,640
Take your doll with you.

356
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,300
Nanny, please help me out.

357
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,040
Leave it to me.

358
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
Yu Lin's getting cuter every day.

359
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,120
If you like children so much, have your own!

360
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't have the time.

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,060
Besides, it takes two to make a baby.

362
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,680
Come on. Haven't you had any romantic encounters in Hong Kong?

363
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,080
No, just clients and colleagues.

364
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,200
That ring on your finger scares everyone off.

365
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,400
What about that rich guy from your last project?

366
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,640
He seemed nice.

367
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
Why not give it a try?

368
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,660
I promised my boss I wouldn't date clients or colleagues.

369
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,940
You're something else.

370
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,440
No clients, no colleagues.

371
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,180
How long has it been since you dated anyone?

372
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,780
I don't remember.

373
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,700
That's why I'm saying you should meet more people.

374
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,000
Maybe you'll really meet someone—

375
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Let's discuss business.

376
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,520
I said to inquire about LT Capital.

377
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,720
What's the deal with them?

378
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,440
I did some digging.

379
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,960
Their official head is Old Chen.

380
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,320
He's very low-key and is an overseas Chinese.

381
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,820
But they said the actual controller is called "Forrest."

382
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,680
He's the one managing all of the company's affairs.

383
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,320
Oh, and I heard they're participating in that sports charity fund,

384
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,280
CrossFit Challenge.

385
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,220
Haven’t you been training lately?

386
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,380
Why don't you give it a try?

387
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,840
Maybe you'll meet them.

388
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,120
That's exactly what I was thinking.

389
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,260
I'll sign up, have a casual talk,

390
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,480
and find out why he's against the funding.

391
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,360
Don't play dumb with me.

392
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,160
Gan Yang's English name is also Forrest in Matching.

393
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,480
Could it be the same person?

394
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,220
No way.

395
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,040
So many people have the same English names.

396
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,000
It can't be that coincidental.

397
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,220
It's better not to be him.

398
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,420
If, I mean, hypothetically,

399
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,480
if you were to meet Gan Yang again, what would you do?

400
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,200
Kill him.

401
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,720
It's been years.

402
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Don't dwell on the past.

403
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,120
You'll be the only one suffering.

404
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,940
I'm not dwelling on the past.

405
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,140
I just can't forgive him,

406
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,540
never in this lifetime.

407
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,620
 Why are you marrying him? 

408
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,820
 Do you love him? 

409
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,480
 Or is it because you hate me? 

410
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,640
 Why would you think I'd gamble with my own happiness 

411
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,080
 just because I hate you? 

412
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,150
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

413
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:41,020
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

414
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:46,620
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

415
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,040
 If you really love him... 

416
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:54,370
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

417
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,740
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

418
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,820
 then I wish you happiness. 

419
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,540
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

420
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,350
 I love him. 

421
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:13,500
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

422
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,200
 Thanks for the blessing. 

423
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,000
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

424
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,460
 And please... 

425
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,160
 don't show up in front of me again. 

426
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,900
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

427
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:35,420
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

428
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,450
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫

429
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:47,520
♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

430
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,000
   

431
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,160
Sister Tong, I've never formally trained for CrossFit.

432
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,000
I just viewed the challenges,

433
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,040
and my brain is fried.

434
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,920
We're not here to actually compete,

435
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,320
but mainly to connect with folks from LT Capital.

436
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,800
Where are they?

437
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
I asked the staff.

438
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,360
That empty tenth lane is reserved for LT Capital.

439
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,760
They should be here soon.

440
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,480
You'll be wearing heart rate monitors

441
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,160
throughout the event.

442
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,220
The data will be displayed in real-time on that big screen.

443
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,480
If any of you have a heart rate

444
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
exceeding 180 beats per minute,

445
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,920
the red light will beep,

446
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,360
then you must pause and adjust.

447
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,100
   

448
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,380
Sister Tong, they're here.

449
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,540
It's Wang Yi.

450
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,475
   

451
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,820
Why is it so high?

452
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,300
 What's going on? 
   

453
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,720
Sister Tong, is your monitor malfunctioning?

454
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,180
I'm fine.

455
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,160
Well, this is awkward.

456
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,360
Can you still compete?

457
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,440
That guy in black looks like their boss.

458
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,360
Should we go over and say hello?

459
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,680
Not yet. Let's finish the challenge.

460
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,440
Understood.

461
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:11,460
All right. All the team members have assembled.

462
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,220
The competition officially begins.

463
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:33,320
♫  Sunrise covers everywhere I ran through  ♫

464
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,100
♫  Feeling the morning breeze  ♫

465
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,920
♫  The sweat on my forehead is the morning dew  ♫

466
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,402
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

467
00:30:42,402 --> 00:30:43,400
Let me handle this.

468
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,970
♫  It lets me release all my worries  ♫

469
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:51,600
♫  Remember to keep up with my pace in one go  ♫

470
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,475
♫  Immediately alleviate all the burdens  ♫

471
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:58,950
♫  For the brighter future, we must keep going  ♫

472
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,720
♫  Creating everything we're longing for  ♫

473
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,970
♫  Day and night  ♫

474
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,370
♫  Wait until I can reach my dreams  ♫

475
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,120
♫  Gather enough courage to embrace the thorns  ♫

476
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,150
♫  Let the global starlight shine over me  ♫

477
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,670
♫  Stay with me  ♫

478
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,150
♫  I appreciate you've been there for me  ♫

479
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:26,000
♫  Staying with me through the thick and thin of life  ♫

480
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,200
♫  Because of you, I have more courage  ♫

481
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:48,850
♫  Every place we've been became a beautiful memory  ♫

482
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,450
♫  The encounters along the journey  ♫

483
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:56,220
♫  It's the blessings of all my dreams  ♫

484
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,400
♫  Be okay  ♫

485
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,520
♫  Please hold me tight once again  ♫

486
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,420
Are you okay?

487
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:14,425
   
   

488
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,640
 If you ran into an ex you once loved deeply, 

489
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,940
 would your heart still flutter? 

490
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:28,114
 A) Show up deliberately to embarrass him. 
   

491
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:31,280
 B) Try to get back together. 

492
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,740
 C) Pass by silently and wish him well. 

493
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,460
D) Explore other possibilities.

494
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,180
I choose D. Explore other possibilities.

495
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,640
Wait.

496
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,220
Why?

497
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,520
I'm busy; no time for dating.

498
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,840
- No current relationship means no exes. 
 - Whatever.

499
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,640
Are you done yet? Give me my phone.

500
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,871
I'm leaving.

501
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:54,000
Hold on. The result will be out soon.

502
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,220
   

503
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,000
   

504
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,880
Soulmates!

505
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,940
Are you saying some quiz found my soulmate?

506
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,080
Is this how you scam users?

507
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,280
Don't say it like that. It sounds so bad.

508
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,640
Listen, out of 10,000 users,

509
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,700
this is the first time I've seen a 100% compatibility score.

510
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,840
Most only score 50% to 60%.

511
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,777
You know what, I have to take a picture

512
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:26,060
and send it to Deng Bo Ting for promotion.

513
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,320
Hurry, I'm going to my part-time job.

514
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,080
Aren't you curious what this "Forrest" looks like?

515
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,440
He's your soulmate.

516
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,360
I believe in soulmates,

517
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,060
but not ones decided by a quiz.

518
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,020
And only 10,000 users, those are the odds?

519
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,740
Doesn't that just prove you two are more destined?

520
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,220
Trust me.

521
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,280
Deng Bo Ting's algorithm is definitely reliable.

522
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,400
If you won't look, I will.

523
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,780
I'll see what he looks like.

524
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,232
You're hopeless.

525
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,192
Seriously, Missy.

526
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,040
Your phone is too slow. 
    

527
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,680
With your First-class Scholarship,

528
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,760
National Scholarship, and all those part-time jobs,

529
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,680
you're getting at least ¥20,000-30,000 ($2,700-4,100) a year.

530
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Can't you get a decent phone?

531
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,240
Imagine someone failed to inform you for a job  interview.

532
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,520
How embarrassing would that be?

533
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,680
I'll just delete a few apps.

534
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,280
It's loaded.

535
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,440
Maybe he's a cute guy.

536
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,400
Cute guys don't post their back view.

537
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,160
Since you're not interested, I'll chat with him on your behalf.

538
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,320
I'm leaving.

539
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,080
Chat, yes, right.

540
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,000
Are you sure you won't chat with him?

541
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,080
Move the chair there.

542
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,640
Be careful; the floor is slippery.

543
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,960
Ding Zhi Tong, off to work again?

544
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,460
- Come back early. 
 - Tong Tong!

545
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,525
- What are you doing? 
 - Uninstalling the "Matching" app.

546
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:34,640
Why?

547
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,860
Takes up too much storage.

548
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,152
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye bye.

549
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:40,140
Bye bye.

550
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,560
Tong Tong, are you heading out?

551
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,260
I've got class. Bye bye.

552
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,100
Bye bye.

553
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:55,500
- Off to work? 
 - Yes.

554
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,672
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

555
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm leaving.

556
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,600
♫  Since the first time we met  ♫

557
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,700
♫  My heart lost its balance  ♫

558
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,370
♫  I open my arms wide trying to take it all in  ♫

559
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,320
♫  Don’t miss out on your life again  ♫

560
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,300
♫  Let me fill in the empty spaces  ♫

561
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,250
♫  That moment you looked at me and said I love you  ♫

562
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,800
♫  Since the first time we met  ♫

563
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,970
♫  My heart lost its balance  ♫

♫  To take it all in  ♫

566
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,540
Brother, wait for me.

567
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,340
Who's that?

568
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,060
I'm asking you, who's that?

569
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:13,181
- I don't know. 
 - Then why are you staring?

570
00:37:13,695 --> 00:37:15,251
Oh, love at first sight?

571
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:17,276
It found your soulmate.

572
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,981
What soulmate?

573
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:20,587
Look at your phone.

574
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:23,172
On the Matching app, you two are the only perfect match

575
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,760
in our entire school.

576
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,100
Really? 
    

577
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,380
It's 100%?

578
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,020
You answered "no exes" on the last question.

579
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,460
And someone gave the same answer?

580
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,240
I think everyone has a soulmate,

581
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,560
but it's impossible to find one through some quiz.

582
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,320
But "Forrest" and "Get Rich" matched 100%.

583
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,640
What are the odds?

584
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,520
You seem to have a lot of free time.

585
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,680
Aren't you nervous about the competition this afternoon?

586
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,140
Not at all.

587
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,200
Then don't drop the ball onstage.

588
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,620
Relax. I won't hold you back.

589
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,880
I'll go prepare now.

590
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,500
 Do you believe in soulmates? 

591
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,320
 I didn't in the past, 
   

592
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,860
 until I met her. 

593
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,970
   

594
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:43,810

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

596
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:52,650
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

597
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:01,200
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

598
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,537
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

599
00:39:07,537 --> 00:39:14,700
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

600
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:21,425
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

601
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:28,425
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

602
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:35,500
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

603
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:42,600
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

604
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:49,242
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

605
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:56,427
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

606
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:03,460
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

607
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:10,356
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

608
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:17,245
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

609
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:23,800
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

610
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,975
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

611
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:43,375
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
