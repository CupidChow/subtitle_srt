 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,869
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,357
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:17,563
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:22,895
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,043
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:31,926
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:35,820
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,584
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:49,756
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,852
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,204
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:06,712
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:11,168
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,070
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,401
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,365
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,036
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,479
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,924
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,380
   
   

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,480
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,369

26
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,810
Hi.

27
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,740
I haven't seen you in a while.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,720
I went to Beijing on a business trip.

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,840
It seems that business trip didn't go well.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,040
You seem upset.

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,380
Not at all successful,

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,260
it hit a dead end.

33
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,720
I have no idea how to break through.

34
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,640
Did you learn to control your breathing now?

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,140
You don't seem to struggle or be breathless when you run.

36
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,540
By the way,

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,780
you know what young people say these days.

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,380
"Nothing's impossible if you're willing to give up."

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,180
Relax.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,900
Skipping a project or two won't hurt.

41
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,660
I can let go of other projects, but I must get this one.

42
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,780
Why?

43
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,420
It's confidential.

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,360
"Confidential"?

45
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,080
Then...

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,640
I'll speculate on that confidential matter.

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,200
Your forehead is broad and full.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I'd say a turnaround is coming within five days.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,100
Then I'll take that as a blessing.

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,540
If it works out, I'll treat you to a meal.

51
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,580
Deal.

52
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,000
Keep going. I have to go.

53
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,138
   

54
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:53,340
- Check this. 
 - Okay, I'll send it to you this afternoon.

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,200
- Hello, Director Ding. 
 - Director Ding.

56
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,540
Sister Tong.

57
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,460
Who sent these gifts?

58
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,980
Vivian's team sent them.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,620
They just closed a merger and are having a celebration.

60
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,760
So they gave each of us a gift.

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,380
It seems more like showing off.

62
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,480
Free gifts are always nice.

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,260
Have you checked the sales data for LT DT6.0?

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,340
All the recent numbers are here.

65
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,700
They're unstoppable.

66
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,960
They topped sales in the Â¥200-300 ($30-42) price range on launch day.

67
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,660
At this point, they already sold over 100,000 pairs across all platforms.

68
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,840
Wu Xun will be wearing these shoes to participate in Hangzhou Marathon next week.

69
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,460
They say he will break the national record.

70
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,860
If he does, the shoes' sales will more than double.

71
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,620
That's the ripple effect.

72
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,700
If other shoes sell well, they'll make more money.

73
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,140
With plenty of money, they'll be even less likely to agree to financing.

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,580
Back to work.

75
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,141
   

76
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,980
- Director Zhang. 
 - You're aware of Vivian's situation, I assume.

77
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,280
You have few major projects.

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
Only by securing Training Box, you can compete with her for Managing Director.

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,140
Last week, you said Director Gan wouldn't agree to financing.

80
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,020
So that path is blocked.

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,700
There's no way with Gan Yang.

82
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,920
We will try another way to break through.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,880
Make it quick. MD will be set next month.

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,760
I want you in that seat. Understood?

85
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,620
Thank you, Director Zhang.

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
Shuchi has been trying to poach Wu Xun again.

87
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,640
You have to watch him closely.

88
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,500
He's not as loyal as I am.

89
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,620
We've cultivated Wu Xun for five years.

90
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,920
We hired his coach, nutritionist and sent him abroad for training.

91
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,460
That's how he achieved current success.

92
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,460
If he agrees to Shuchi, that's pure ingratitude.

93
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,640
 People are unpredictable. 

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,180
Have Marketing draft a few more plans.

95
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,460
Even if Wu Xun wears Shuchi's shoes,

96
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,780
we can promote other seeded (skill advantages) players.

97
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,300
Director Gan doesn't need to bother about that.

98
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,220
I've already prepared the plans.

99
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,180
Let's just cancel this meeting.

100
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,000
Someone can't focus on this meeting.

101
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,620
What?

102
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,720
Did I miss a cue?

103
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,180
Let me see your plans.

104
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,460
I know you can multitask.

105
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,220
Let's end the Wu Xun discussion.

106
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,460
I'm exhausted.

107
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,840
I'm staying at your place tonight.

108
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,780
Fine.

109
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,912
   

110
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,300
 You know why I sought out other women? 

111
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,860
 Because I don't feel any love from you, do you understand? 

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,260
 You treat "Matching" better than me. 

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,220
 So now you're blaming your affair on me? 

114
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,580
 If I didn't love you, 

115
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,900
 would I have remained for so many years? 

116
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,780
 Or sought clients while I was pregnant? 

117
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,140
 If you felt no feeling between us, 

118
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,220
 you should have divorced me before seeing other women! 

119
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,300
 You're always wrong when you cheat! 

120
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,780
Ming Mei, why are you hiding here?

121
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,380
- I've been looking for you. 
 - Right.

122
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,980
This celebrates your return to being single.

123
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,540
Our main character can't hide, right?

124
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,820
Right. Hurry and get up.

125
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,020
Come on, get up.

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,180
Come on.

127
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,100
We're going to have fun today. Here.

128
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,640
Guys, champagne is on me tonight!

129
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,020
Ming Mei!

130
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,200
Are you okay, Ming Mei?

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,500
Ming Mei! Can anyone swim?

132
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,900
Someone, help her!

133
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,260
Ming Mei!

134
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,580
Come on! Be careful.

135
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,405
Easy does it.

136
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:36,500
 Be careful. 

137
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,440
 Take it slow. 

138
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,880
 Ming Mei? 

139
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,320
 Ming Mei? 

140
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,340
She's awake. Ming Mei, are you okay?

141
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,740
How do you feel, Ming Mei?

142
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,800
Here. Have some warm water.

143
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,020
Are you all right?

144
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,780
- Take it slow. 
 - Easy does it.

145
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,060
Who saved me?

146
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,640
Some very tall, handsome guy.

147
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,560
Where did he go?

148
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,300
He was just here.

149
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,340
It seems he already left.

150
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,000
 Ming Mei? 

151
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,900
 Ming Mei! 

152
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,040
 Ming Mei. 

153
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,440
Could I have been hallucinating?

154
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,660
That was definitely Qin Chang.

155
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,640
- Please, have a seat. 
 - Okay, thank you.

156
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,140
What can I get you?

157
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,820
Just plain congee, please.

158
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,940
Okay. Just a moment, please.

159
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,160
Professor Qin, thank you for teaching me all those workplace efficiency hacks.

160
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:02,546
- They're really helpful. 
 - You're a quick learner.

161
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:03,860
 It really is Professor Qin. 

162
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,900
 Not at all, Professor Qin 

163
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,440
 All the credit goes to you. 

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,900
 Thank you for your guidance. 

165
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,000
Professor Qin? Thank you for saving me last night.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,880
After six years, you're still so popular.

167
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,440
Excuse me, you are...

168
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,020
Your age must be affecting you.

169
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,000
No surprise you don't remember me.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
How about this? I'll introduce myself again.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,340
I'm Song Ming Mei, nice to meet you.

172
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,840
Nice to meet you.

173
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,280
Who is it?

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,420
Hello?

175
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,560
 You just woke up? 

176
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
I met a client then had a short nap.

177
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,560
I dreamed a lot. My head hurts.

178
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,240
Well, you need the right cure for your heartache.

179
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Let's not talk of my mess.

180
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,660
You didn't video call me just to check if I was awake, did you?

181
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,540
 I ran into Professor Qin. 

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,760
Professor Qin?

183
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,200
A young girl was with him,

184
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,912
 calling him Professor Qin this and that, 

185
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,880
 just like I used to. 

186
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,440
I even greeted him,

187
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,360
but he acted like he didn't know me.

188
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,272
 Well... 

189
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:30,720
It has been years. That's understandable.

190
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
So what are you thinking?

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,360
Did you feel sparks seeing him again?

192
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,340
That ship sailed long ago.

193
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,220
 I don't even know if he heard I'm divorced. 

194
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,920
I don't want him to know that I'm not doing well.

195
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,627
I even bought this huge diamond ring.

196
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,440
Seriously? That's such a huge diamond.

197
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
 It's not expensive. 

198
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,285
By the way, is your divorce finalized?

199
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:02,074
 I'm still sorting the equity split and transfers. 

200
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,880
When you've got time, check it for me.

201
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,780
No problem.

202
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,240
Hello?

203
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,480
Could you send me a thermometer and fever-reduction medicine?

204
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm not feeling well.

205
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,920
Just key in.

206
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,620
Why is it you? How did you get in?

207
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,740
I came to take your temperature, then I'll go.

208
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,240
After all these years, how did you become a hotel manager?

209
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,580
My friend owns this place.

210
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,220
He knows we're acquainted.

211
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,060
He specially told me when he heard you had a fever.

212
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,540
Please leave now.

213
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,240
Don't stay here.

214
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,420
All right, let me just take your temperature.

215
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,600
Why don't we go to the hospital?

216
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,180
No need. I'm not that fragile.

217
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,780
Just give me those pills; I'll be fine.

218
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,400
Professor Qin, it seems you don't care that much about your girlfriend after all.

219
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,900
Or do you already have a wife?

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,440
Asking about my personal life...

221
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,600
Are you still interested in me?

222
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,760
Professor Qin.

223
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm married now.

224
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,080
That's a huge diamond ring.

225
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Looks like you got all you wanted.

226
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,880
Of course.

227
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,400
I once said I'd become successful by 35.

228
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,840
Now I'm five years ahead of schedule.

229
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,320
Do you recall Matching Tech?

230
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,760
I've used it.

231
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,460
My husband and I founded it.

232
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,360
It's now worth Â¥3 billion ($416 million).

233
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,680
Impressive.

234
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,380
But why isn't he vacationing with you?

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,860
This was a friends' gathering.

236
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,880
It wouldn't be appropriate for him to come.

237
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,000
I thought you might have fought then divorced,

238
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,900
and came here to relax and party.

239
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,520
Professor Qin, he's not like you.

240
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,480
He treats me well,

241
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,780
and we never fight.

242
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,140
We have an adorable daughter.

243
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,820
We three are here.

244
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,200
Well? Isn't she cute? She takes after me.

245
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,580
Yes, she is very cute.

246
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,540
But the husband is just average-looking.

247
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,520
All right, you've taken your medicine. Get some rest.

248
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,100
If your fever doesn't subside, go to the hospital.

249
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,560
Don't worry. I can care for myself.

250
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
Then I'll leave.

251
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,660
 - Bottoms up! 
 - Bottoms up! 

252
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,540
 - Nobody leaves until we're properly drunk. 
 - Deal. 

253
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,140
 Let's see who can't drink. 

254
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,660
Wu Xun.

255
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,900
Wu Xun.

256
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,280
You're participating in the Hangzhou Marathon next week, yet you're drinking?

257
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,540
I've been training all day.

258
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,060
It's okay to have a little drink and relax.

259
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,140
Let's play dice.

260
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,220
Again.

261
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,340
You lost. Drink up.

262
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,700
Everyone, relax. Have fun.

263
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,180
- Come on. 
 - Yes, right.

264
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,440
- Come on. 
 - Let's have a toast.

265
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
- Come on. 
 - Let's exchange WeChat accounts later.

266
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,660
Come on.

267
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,540
- Keep going. 
 - Waitress.

268
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,660
- Four twos. Call or fold? 
 - Four twos?

269
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,860
- I call! 
 - Enough games.

270
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,960
Take that Martell cognac I've stored here over to him.

271
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,940
- Come on. 
 - Tell him it's from an admirer.

272
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,640
Yes, Sir.

273
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,500
Who?

274
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,360
Who is it? Some big shot?

275
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,985
An old friend.

276
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:01,060
- Come on. No? 
 - Mr. Wu.

277
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,920
- Drink up. 
 - That gentleman over there sent this to you.

278
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,260
- Drink up. 
 - For me?

279
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,580
Yes. He said he's your admirer.

280
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,780
This is really expensive.

281
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,620
- I've never drunk anything this expensive. 
 - How generous.

282
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:14,940
Cheers.

283
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,100
Finish it all.

284
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,620
- Okay. 
 - Finish it.

285
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,280
 Director Gan, if Wu Xun wins the championship again, 

286
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,680
our sales will double for sure.

287
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,820
LT relies on its own strength.

288
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,780
But as a friend, I hope he comes in first.

289
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,560
Gan Yang! Bad news.

290
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,840
- Wu Xun has had an accident. 
 - What happened?

291
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,860
Look. He sprained his ankle right after the start.

292
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,740
In interviews...

293
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,100
he blamed our shoes. 
    

294
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
He said the sole elasticity was a problem,

295
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,940
and he noticed something was off during training.

296
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,720
It's now trending on all major platforms.

297
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,445
Someone must be behind this.

298
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,320
- Where is he now? 
 - I can't reach him.

299
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,960
His phone is off. No one's home either.

300
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,600
Have you seen the news about Wu Xun?

301
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm watching it now. It's causing a stir online.

302
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,900
Some say they also sprained their ankles wearing these shoes.

303
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,940
Returns are flooding in.

304
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,560
Some even claim the data at the launch event was faked.

305
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,920
Keep following this.

306
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,700
This might be the breakthrough for Training Box.

307
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,040
Okay.

308
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,700
Director Wang, while you were abroad,

309
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,900
the situation with LT running shoes has exploded.

310
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,460
The domestic market has been affected,

311
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,300
and even overseas sales have dropped by 30%.

312
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,460
The monthly active count for Training Box has plummeted by 10%.

313
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,680
It seems more than one party is using this ankle sprain incident to target LT.

314
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,200
They've had too high of a profile in recent years,

315
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
capturing nearly 20% of the national market share.

316
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,240
Many people are observing them.

317
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,460
We just wanted Wu Xun to drink a bit more and run slower in the marathon.

318
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,180
Who knew he'd sprain his ankle

319
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,260
and blame the running shoes he endorses?

320
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,620
The public outcry erupted instantly.

321
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,840
What a pleasant surprise.

322
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,040
How's Ding Zhi Tong handling it?

323
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,980
According to Director Zhang, Director Ding has flown to five cities in three days.

324
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,300
She's already leveraged public opinion

325
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,600
to secure two minority shareholders' signing onto the Letter of Intent for Financing.

326
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,520
Good. Bold and decisive.

327
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
I knew I wasn't wrong about her.

328
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Director Wang,  Director Zhan from Shuchi Sports has been trying to meet with you.

329
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,720
Not interested.

330
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,560
He's incompetent.

331
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,000
The way he blocked Gan Yang's R&amp;D funding

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,480
became a laughingstock in the industry.

333
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,360
Understood. I'll turn him down.

334
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,740
By the way,

335
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,560
have Public Relations fan the flames regarding the ankle sprain incident.

336
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Help Ding Zhi Tong close the Training Box deal faster.

337
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,020
- Stop writing. Look at this. 
 - What's wrong?

338
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,878
   

339
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:45,780
I'm never buying LT shoes again. 
    

340
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,180
No wonder their launch data was so good. 
    

341
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,220
Turns out it was all fake.

342
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,860
If Wu Xun hadn't worn LT shoes, he could have won the triple crown this time.

343
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,700
Eco-friendly materials, my foot.

344
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,780
Just trash synthetics.

345
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,960
 My feet got injured like this because I wore their shoes. 

346
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm never buying their shoes again.

347
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,875
Garbage shoes!

348
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,280
   

349
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,900
   

350
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,620
I'm suing them for defamation!

351
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,580
We've paid them so much in advertising fees,

352
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,640
but they excuse not taking down bad videos.

353
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,200
Exactly, they call it trash.

354
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,420
They don't know anything. It's an eco-friendly synthetic.

355
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,620
What do they know? They're just talking nonsense.

356
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,920
We fix problems as they come.

357
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,200
It can't be worse than six years ago.

358
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,860
So tell us, what should we do?

359
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,960
Seeing this kind of news every day is really frustrating.

360
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,900
I've already asked some people to find Wu Xun.

361
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,360
We should have news in a few days.

362
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,160
 Director Ding, I've made my pledge to Wangs. 

363
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,620
 We're in the same boat now. 

364
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,560
 We can't let it fail. 

365
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,820
Don't worry.

366
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,080
Wang's strength is undeniable.

367
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,300
Had they stepped in earlier, LT's crisis wouldn't have escalated to this point.

368
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,140
After all, Wang holds stakes in all these media platforms.

369
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,760
True.

370
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,920
I've never doubted Wang's strength.

371
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,740
They can also provide liquid assets for Training Box

372
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,020
and drive up the stock price.

373
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,620
Just wait for your equity value to soar.

374
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,960
That's what I wanted to hear.

375
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,980
Director Ding, I'll await your good news.

376
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,780
I'll update you at every step.

377
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,680
 Do you think Ding Zhi Tong is behind the Wu Xun incident? 

378
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,740
No. She'd never resort to underhanded tactics.

379
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,660
Director Gan,  Director Xu.

380
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,820
What a coincidence!

381
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,320
You guys go ahead. I'll be leaving.

382
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,860
It appears Director Ding hasn't slept well lately.

383
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,420
You're busy persuading our minority shareholders.

384
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,700
You look haggard.

385
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,360
That can't be helped. Business is a battlefield.

386
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,380
I thought financing was hopeless.

387
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,000
Now there's a sudden opportunity; of course, I'm seizing it.

388
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,420
What opportunity?

389
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,860
You are behind all this, aren't you?

390
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
So what if I am?

391
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,880
Just look. I told you it was her!

392
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,980
She admitted it herself. Now will you believe me?

393
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,440
I benefit from this, too.

394
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,120
CEO Gan, why are you so sure I wouldn't do this?

395
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,620
I haven't forgotten.

396
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,360
I know the matrix is your dream.

397
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,440
I do want to destroy it.

398
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,240
Ding Zhi Tong, don't celebrate too soon.

399
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,760
Without our approval, you'll never get your chance.

400
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,740
Since when do you have a say in Training Box, Director Xu?

401
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,200
- She's also a shareholder. 
 - You...

402
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,980
She has the right to say that.

403
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,420
The video platform executives are arriving. I'll go greet them.

404
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,820
All right.

405
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,640
Ding Zhi Tong, whether you mean to destroy it or not,

406
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,540
I'm glad that you remember my dream.

407
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,440
Sister Tong, are you okay?

408
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,860
Let's go.

409
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:38,380
- Take care. 
 - CEO Gan is truly impressive.

410
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,500
He has such a strong presence.

411
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,540
I couldn't even speak when he stood there.

412
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Later, you should organize our company's media resources

413
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,080
and have them publish positive news about LT online over the next few days.

414
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,360
Sister Tong... you're not going soft, are you?

415
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,100
What are you thinking?

416
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,020
We just got the signatures from some shareholders.

417
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,040
LT is an important shareholder of Training Box.

418
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,960
This scandal's aftermath will surely affect Training Box.

419
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,280
Wang won't invest in a company with a bad reputation.

420
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,840
You're right, but our media reach is limited.

421
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,480
Director mentioned just now that they meet with video platform executives.

422
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,400
What we can do is just a drop in the bucket.

423
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
We will do what we can.

424
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,540
Let's meet the next shareholder.

425
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,100
Okay.

426
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,220
   

427
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,060
Here, Sister Tong.

428
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,020
With this one, we've convinced half the shareholders.

429
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,400
Now we can finally put pressure on CEO Gan.

430
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,960
After all this work, we finally have a breakthrough.

431
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,440
So does this mean we can celebrate tonight?

432
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,560
There's a new trendy entertainment place near the office.

433
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,700
They have board games, billiards, archery, and everything.

434
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,640
You guys go ahead. I won't join you.

435
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,280
But it's on me. Do whatever you want.

436
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,840
 Thanks, Sister Tong. 

437
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,780
Why aren't you coming, Sister Tong?

438
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,540
You seem a bit unhappy.

439
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,720
Is something wrong with the project?

440
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,440
I'm not unhappy.

441
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,160
It's nothing. I'm just a bit tired. I'm going home to rest.

442
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,580
You guys go ahead,

443
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,340
unless you all want to stay and work overtime.

444
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,300
Have fun. I'm leaving.

445
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,000
- Bye bye, Sister Tong. 
 - Bye bye.

446
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,520
 Yes. 

447
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,740
I had already let go.

448
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,220
I was ready to move on and start a new life.

449
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,860
But he had to show up at this moment.

450
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,360
Why does it have to be like this?

451
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,080
Why did he have to appear?

452
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,620
I hate him.

453
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,720
But I hate myself even more,

454
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,640
for still being so unhappy due to him.

455
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,399
 CEO Gan, we found him. 

456
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,240
Keep an eye on him. I'm on my way.

457
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,160
 You've already shifted the blame. 

458
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,120
You didn't expect public opinion to turn out like this.

459
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,960
I've let Gan Yang down.

460
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,520
Without him, I wouldn't be where I am today.

461
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,840
Oh, come on.

462
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,000
He's a big boss worth hundreds of millions.

463
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,300
He used you because you were valuable.

464
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,720
Look, you helped him make a lot of money.

465
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,640
If you go make changes now, LT will definitely crush you

466
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,160
and leave you with no way to recover.

467
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,960
Why?

468
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,180
I'll get the door. Think carefully.

469
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,360
Who is it?

470
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,040
Gan Yang?

471
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,560
CEO Gan?

472
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,500
Go make clarifications on all major platforms now.

473
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,620
Why should he?

474
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,720
He got injured wearing your shoes!

475
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,180
You should publicly apologize to him and compensate him.

476
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,400
Wu Xun, the night before the marathon, you went to a pharmacy

477
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,820
for bandages and medicine.

478
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,080
I have the surveillance footage.

479
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,680
Do you need me to show you more evidence?

480
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,300
I've held back from suing you for friendship's sake.

481
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,100
But if you keep this up,

482
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,760
you'll ruin not only your career but your whole life.

483
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,380
CEO Gan.

484
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,760
 At the same time, I hope that consumers 

485
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,420
 will continue to support LT's running shoe business. 

486
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,540
 I'm here now to sincerely apologize to everyone. 

487
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,100
Sister Tong, just like you said, CEO Gan resolved this quickly.

488
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,740
It's a good thing we secured those minority shareholders early.

489
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,780
With Wu Xun's clarification, this matter is settled.

490
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,400
Could he have bribed Wu Xun to change his statement?

491
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,260
Shoes are like Gan Yang's life.

492
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,340
He wouldn't fake that.

493
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,080
We've already convinced some minority shareholders.

494
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,940
Even if Gan Yang wants to veto it, he must think twice.

495
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,840
Okay. I'll get back to work.

496
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,740
   

497
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,620
   

498
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,920
   

499
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,400
Brother, your fridge is empty.

500
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,720
Why isn't there anything in it?

501
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,740
Come running with me.

502
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,460
Let me off.

503
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,780
I'm too tired. I can't move.

504
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,060
Run with me, then dinner's on me.

505
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,340
What are you waiting for? Latecomers won't get a table.

506
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,160
- Okay? 
 - Sure.

507
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,660
- Feng Sheng. 
 - To Maldives.

508
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,840
Ding Zhi Tong.

509
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,020
Let me introduce you.

510
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,860
This is my fiancÃ©e, Yu Shang Na.

511
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,020
Hello, nice to meet you.

512
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,780
I'm Ding Zhi Tong, his college classmate.

513
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,700
- I see. 
 - Shall we go in?

514
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,180
- Let's go. I've made a reservation. 
 - Let's go.

515
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,680
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

516
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,000
- I just cooked some tripe. 
 - Okay.

517
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,940
You two should have some more.

518
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,700
The food here is delicious.

519
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,120
It has authentic flavors.

520
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,400
Give her a marinated egg.

521
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,020
So is your wedding ceremony abroad?

522
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,180
Because my family is all abroad.

523
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,040
- You have to come. 
 - Of course.

524
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,140
I'm telling you in advance so you have to come.

525
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,760
Absolutely.

526
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,180
It's about the custom-made wedding dress.

527
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,020
Them again? I'll take the call.

528
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,700
It's okay. You two can catch up.

529
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,980
Okay.

530
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,920
You two make a great couple.

531
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,420
Good for you.

532
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,380
I've had enough of your public affection.

533
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,160
Stop teasing me.

534
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,300
Tell me about you. How have you been?

535
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,540
I'm doing well.

536
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,840
I'm working on the Training Box investment deal.

537
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,420
The LT Group caused such a stir recently, right?

538
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,540
I read the news.

539
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,640
It seems LT's CEO is Gan Yang, right?

540
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,700
I never thought his dad was a fraudster.

541
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,940
Has he ever mentioned it to you?

542
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,620
I heard him talk of only his mother before,

543
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,020
never his father.

544
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,940
I thought we had no secrets.

545
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,680
Turns out I never knew some things.

546
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,180
Have you seen him since?

547
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,760
Let's not mention him.

548
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,860
Fair enough.

549
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,580
It left my mind.

550
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,040
Tell me how you two met.

551
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,100
Who would go for hot pot after running?

552
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,740
I ran here mainly for the hot pot.

553
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,420
They're having a promotion today.

554
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,400
 Incentive rewards, you know. 

555
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,400
Hey, where are you going?

556
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,360
This is the place. We're here.

557
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,040
What are you doing?

558
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,120
 You're not married. 
   

559
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,740
 Your company profile says you're unmarried. 

560
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,960
 During your five years at Gutong Securities, 

561
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,480
 no one has ever seen Feng Sheng! 

562
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,920
 And he's in the U.S., not Hong Kong! 

563
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,200
 No one has ever seen his girlfriend! 

564
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,560
 We're in a secret marriage. 

565
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,680
 Do I need to explain that to you? 

566
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I need to get to the bottom of this.

567
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,180
Get to the bottom of what?

568
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
- Her parents are abroad. 
 - Right, her family is abroad.

569
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,400
So we bought a place there, planning to settle down.

570
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,415
Feng Sheng.

571
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:51,080
- It's been a while. 
 - It's been ages, Gan Yang.

572
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,180
Are you here to eat, too?

573
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,820
Yes.

574
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,215
How have you been?

575
00:30:57,215 --> 00:30:58,200
When did you get back to the country?

576
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,340
I flew to Hong Kong the other day

577
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,580
then flew back with my wifeâ€”

578
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,880
We just got back from Hong Kong.

579
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,080
This place gives free yogurt for customers.

580
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,780
Long time, no see.

581
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,360
You guys go ahead.

582
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,460
We've got things to do. We will leave.

583
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,040
Okay.

584
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,500
What about my hot pot?

585
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,060
The hot pot here isn't that great.

586
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,680
Don't come back.

587
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,960
I came out to eat and run with you.

588
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,760
Can you cheer up a bit?

589
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,240
You saw it yourself. Ding Zhi Tong is only seeing you for work.

590
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,160
But if it affects you this much,

591
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,520
if it makes you this unhappy,

592
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,000
maybe you should keep your distance.

593
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,780
I know.

594
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,000
I was thinking the same thing.

595
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,760
What do you know? What are you thinking?

596
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,940
She's doing well.

597
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,900
I shouldn't bother her.

598
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,660
Tong Tong.

599
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,040
Actually, Gan Yang came to Hong Kong to find you four years ago.

600
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,000
I didn't tell you then because I was jealous.

601
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I even lied to him,

602
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,560
saying we already got married.

603
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,100
I'm sorry.

604
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,000
It's fine.

605
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,880
Whether you lied to him or not,

606
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,040
there's no chance for me and him.

607
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,240
That's not what I meant.

608
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,540
What's wrong?

609
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,180
Haven't been sleeping well recently?

610
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,740
I'm all right.

611
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,120
Shall I drive?

612
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,940
It's okay. We're almost there.

613
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,360
Tong Tong, what's going on?

614
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,860
When did you start taking sleeping pills again?

615
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,700
I'll stop after this project ends.

616
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,160
Tell me what really happened in Beijing.

617
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,940
I didn't play the emotional card with him.

618
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,380
I knew you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

619
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,280
And what else?

620
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,200
It seems...

621
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,300
I've softened a bit.

622
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,220
Did he explain what happened after your breakup?

623
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,400
He tried. I stopped him.

624
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,480
I didn't let him explain.

625
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
I didn't want to give him the chance.

626
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,660
I was afraid I'd fall for him again.

627
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,480
I can't be with him anymore.

628
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,980
Thus, I want to push him away.

629
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,420
Yesterday, Feng Sheng and I ran into him at the hot pot restaurant.

630
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,580
I let him keep believing Feng Sheng and I are married.

631
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,480
Wait.

632
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,860
Why are you two torturing each other like this?

633
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,340
I want him to give up fully on me,

634
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,840
to exit my life for good.

635
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,700
You know what? I really want to secure the Training Box deal

636
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,160
and become MD.

637
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,120
But it appears that...

638
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,940
I want him to fulfill his dream even more.

639
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,980
Tong Tong, didn't his dream of making shoes already come true?

640
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,420
Back in college,

641
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,360
he told me his shoe matrix dream.

642
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,620
In Beijing, I accompanied him to several clients.

643
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,000
At that time, watching him move toward his dream,

644
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,340
I was truly happy for him.

645
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,760
That's why forcing this financing now

646
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,060
feels less like helping him

647
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,420
and more like destroying his dream.

648
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,080
It's okay. Don't worry about me.

649
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,280
I'll sort myself out.

650
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,920
Don't worry.

651
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,620
 Who is it? 

652
00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:20,940
Why are you here?

653
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,980
To talk to you about Tong Tong.

654
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,740
Come in.

655
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,280
I'll keep it short.

656
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,080
After you broke up with Tong Tong,

657
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,880
she couldn't sleep at night,

658
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,160
suffered insomnia and depression until she was hospitalized.

659
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,080
You should have seen her, just skin and bones.

660
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,500
She nearly lost herself completely!

661
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,760
I failed her.

662
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,120
I'm not here for a guilt trip!

663
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,600
Song Ming Mei,

664
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,580
- actually... 
 - Don't explain to me!

665
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,860
Whatever your reasons, the harm is done.

666
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,180
For so many years, she's struggled to get over it.

667
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,560
Before you reappeared,

668
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,620
she finally started eating and sleeping well.

669
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,140
Focusing on work,

670
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,560
she was soon promoted to a director.

671
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,800
When she first knew you were behind the Training Box Project,

672
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,440
she didn't want to take it on at all.

673
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,140
But her boss said she must take this project

674
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,600
to get promoted to MD.

675
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,200
Can I do anything for her now?

676
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,520
I hope you'll stay out of her life.

677
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,600
Since meeting you again, she's back to taking sleeping pills.

678
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Gan Yang, Tong Tong can live well without you.

679
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,980
Please, let her withdraw from your project.

680
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,320
â™«  The time and time  â™«

681
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,020
â™«  For life and life  â™«

682
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,780
 I hate him. 

683
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,080
 But I hate myself even more, 

684
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,940
 for still being so unhappy due to him. 

685
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,650
â™«  Love in love  â™«

686
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,200
â™«  So tell me you love me  â™«

687
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,600
â™«  I see you  â™«

688
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
Hao Chen,

689
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,300
notify all shareholders of Training Box

690
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,200
to attend a shareholders' meeting tomorrow.

691
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,550
â™«  I live through your love  â™«

692

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

694
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:01,750
â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

695
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:10,600
â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

696
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:16,837
â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

697
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:24,000
â™«  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  â™«

698
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,825
â™«  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  â™«

699
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:37,825
â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

700
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:44,900
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

701
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:51,900
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

702
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,442
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

703
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:05,727
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

704
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:12,860
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™« 
 â™«  And every time I think of it  â™«

705
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:19,756
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

706
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:26,645
â™«  Someone held my hand against all odds  â™«

707
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:33,200
â™«  Now Iâ€™m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  â™«

708
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,375
â™«  Along the road we used to run through  â™«

709
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:50,875
â™«  There is always the someone I never once forgot  â™«
