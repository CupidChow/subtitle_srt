 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,869
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,663
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:22,295
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,043
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:32,226
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:35,320
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:40,592
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:49,756
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,852
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,304
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:06,812
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,168
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,070
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,601
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,365
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,036
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,550
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,300
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,380
   
   

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,480
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,448
   

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:49,900
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ðŸ’– Heart's Journey ðŸ’– Team @Viki.com 

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,540
Director Song, first come, first served.

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,060
In addition, the way you drive is dangerous.

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,140
Professor Qin, whoever parks in this spot first gets it.

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,620
The meeting starts in ten minutes.

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,140
The nearest parking lot is five minutes away.

31
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,780
I suggest you go park first, Professor Qin.

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,980
Don't be late.

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,180
That fast?

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,540
Where did you park?

35
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,340
Call me after work today.

36
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,220
Let's leave together.

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,380
Trying to pursue me?

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Okay.

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,192
Right. Yes, exactly.

40
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:03,460
I just checked.

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,940
 Call me after work today. 

42
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,720
 Let's leave together. 

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,840
Are you saying Ding Zhi Tong hasn't dated anyone in six years?

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,920
Yet they live in the same neighborhood.

45
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Now, are they working on due diligence together

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,100
and even share an office?

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,400
Gan Yang moved his office there.

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,640
Putting all that aside, their connection is eerie.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,520
What a star-crossed pair.

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,140
Their love story is tragic enough.

51
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,000
I hope they'll get back together.

52
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,520
You're still chatting.

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,700
Guan Wen Yuan, going home so late at night,

54
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,040
won't your husband worry?

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,000
Gossip is more important than my husband.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,120
What, are you kicking me out?

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,780
No way. You two keep chatting.

58
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,460
Wang Yi, is there any good food near your place?

59
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,980
Only barbecue is open at this hour.

60
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,880
The taste is mediocre.

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,800
I don't feel like barbecue.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,940
I barely had dinner, and I'm a bit hungry.

63
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,940
- Are you the one who's hungry? 
 - Yes.

64
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,780
Some dumplings are in the fridge.

65
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,360
I'll go cook some for you.

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,720
Forget it.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,380
I just saw a post from An Ni's on "Moments."

68
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,420
Her place is still open.

69
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,140
I'll go buy your food.

70
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,820
- "An Ni"? 
 - Yes.

71
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,480
You're the best.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,640
Wang Yi, have you decided yet?

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,540
My kitchen will close.

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,580
Yes. The dish Xu Chen Xi often orders.

75
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,420
I forgot the name, but I have pictures.

76
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,600
Let me see.

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,460
That one with lemon, sweet and sour flavor, and little yellow croaker fish.

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,580
What are you looking at?

79
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,700
Hey, stop scrolling.

80
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,240
No photos of Gan Yang are on my phone.

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,480
Weren't you showing me the dishes? I just had a quick look.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,020
Then look at the dish. Don't invade my privacy.

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,140
I saw it. I know what dish Xu Chen Xi likes.

84
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,780
Zhuang, fried little yellow croakers takeout.

85
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,700
Sure, Madam Boss.

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,080
Fried little yellow croakers.

87
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,400
You're finally back.

88
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,860
- Where's Guan Wen Yuan? 
 - It smells so good.

89
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,560
She went home.

90
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,920
I messaged my mom to send you some more pig intestines.

91
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,580
Okay.

92
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,640
- Aren't you eating? 
 - I'm not hungry.

93
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,860
Then go to bed.

94
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm fine eating alone.

95
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,780
Oh.

96
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,520
 If you love someone, just woo her. 

97
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,700
 Bottling it up will drive you crazy. 

98
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,560
 Try showing Xu Chen Xi those photos and see how she reacts. 

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,160
 It's better than bottling it up inside. 

100
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,640
When I returned, I saw a really pretty calico cat with long hair.

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,880
I took some photos.

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,760
Do you want to see them?

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,540
Show me.

104
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,540
- Not this one. 
 - Stop!

105
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,900
Wang Yi!

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
- Yes, I do like... 
 - Do you threaten me?

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,600
You took all these awful photos of me.

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,500
Will you use them against me someday?

109
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,820
No. I-I think they're quite nice.

110
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,220
Is this one nice?

111
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,960
Yes.

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,340
- This one too? 
 - Definitely.

113
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,240
Delete them! All of them!

114
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
Wang Yi, I warn you; delete them all!

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,640
Or tomorrow you'll be doomed!

116
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,600
- Hey, won't you eat? 
 - I'm too furious to eat!

117
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,400
Did I handle this wrong?

118
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,720
   

119
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,260
   

120
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,980
 What's her relationship with CEO Gan? 

121
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,740
 CEO Gan would never give those shoes to just anyone. 

122
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,300
 Remember when our brand spokesperson came to the company, 

123
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,400
 really wanted a pair of shoes, 

124
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
 and threatened to end the contract, 

125
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
 but CEO Gan still refused? 

126
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
 That's right. 

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,220
 For all these years, every time we released new shoes, 

128
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,100
 CEO Gan sprayed a pair for the exhibition 

129
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,360
 and didn't give them to anyone. 

130
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,440
 Could CEO Gan have finally met his destiny girl? 

131
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,900
 Probably. 

132
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,280
 Then I'll make a reservation. 

133
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,980
 A reservation for what? 

134
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,980
 For your brand's first pair of shoes. 

135
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,380
  Sure. I promise. 

136
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,500
 Pinky swear. 

137
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
 Let's seal it. 

138
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,780
Every type of shoes I make,

139
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,940
you're always the first customer.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
Luo Hao Chen went to pick up an important client.

141
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,180
Can I get a ride with you again?

142
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,040
I need to get changed,

143
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,980
and I have other things to do.

144
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,040
CEO Gan, don't waste your time on me.

145
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,540
Wang Group really squeezes their vendors.

146
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,640
They put you on Training Box Project,

147
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,520
plus made you their finance consultant.

148
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,800
They're assigning you work so late.

149
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,120
This is Chairman Wang of Wang Group.

150
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,660
Chairman Wang, this is CEO Gan.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,140
I've heard much about you.

152
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,640
Nice to meet you.

153
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
To what do we owe the pleasure

154
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,780
of your late-night visit to LT?

155
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm here to pick up Ding Zhi Tong.

156
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm leaving.

157
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,900
Chairman Wang, I didn't expect you to do a personal pick up.

158
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,240
I don't have time for other people,

159
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,400
but Ding Zhi Tong is my friend.

160
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:46,064
Oh, by the way...

161
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,540
I heard you recently moved your office to Training Box.

162
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,440
Let me remind you,

163
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
Ding Zhi Tong will be very busy.

164
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,420
Please don't disturb her life or work.

165
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,220
What are you making today? You've prepared so much.

166
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,020
Northeastern specialty, combined cooking.

167
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,220
Who has annoyed you?

168
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,680
You're seething with anger.

169
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,700
Wang Sen from Wang Group.

170
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,120
He just picked up Tong Tong at the office entrance.

171
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,440
He warned me not to disturb her work or life.

172
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,720
He's clearly declaring war!

173
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,900
"Wang Group"?

174
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,000
The Wang Group that's trying to invest in Training Box?

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,880
Yes. Who else?

176
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,220
The head of Wang Group?

177
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,620
Your rival this time is formidable.

178
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,560
Tong Tong doesn't want luxuries.

179
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,240
So what if he's rich?

180
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,920
Proximity brings privilege.

181
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,220
This... He could use his position

182
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,560
to get close to Ding Zhi Tong.

183
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
Does Ding Zhi Tong know that Wang Sen is pursuing her?

184
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,440
Judging by her expression, probably not.

185
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,100
Then give it your all.

186
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
There's not enough food here. I'll get some more for you.

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,620
- Get plenty! 
 - Okay.

188
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,780
The camping base shows 39% compound annual growth

189
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,500
over the past five years.

190
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,300
So data and trends reveal

191
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,660
young people increasingly like camping.

192
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,580
I've never camped.

193
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,420
I don't get the appeal.

194
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,600
So I need to feel it, to decide if I invest.

195
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,060
Wang Group has a stake in over a dozen industries.

196
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,640
I thought you just went by data.

197
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,600
I have a principle.

198
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,220
I never invest in what I don't know or enjoy.

199
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,640
This barbecue setup must be for us.

200
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,680
Can you grill?

201
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,900
A little.

202
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,760
Shall we give it a try?

203
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,380
Look.

204
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,500
 I want fireflies. 

205
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,700
 - So beautiful. 
 - Some are over there. 

206
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,320
 How interesting. 

207
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,300
 So pretty. 

208
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,340
 Look. 

209
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,540
You like fireflies?

210
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,060
Not really.

211
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,960
Just reminds me of something.

212
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,060
A firefly's lifespan is only 3-7 days.

213
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,020
Glowing is the most beautiful period of their life.

214
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,960
Then their life ends.

215
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,240
Just like love, I guess.

216
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,380
Once it's missed, it's gone forever.

217
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,360
Are you referring

218
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,460
to you and Gan Yang?

219
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,060
Yes.

220
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,460
It should be ready.

221
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,660
Give it a try.

222
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,380
- Be careful. It's hot. 
 - Sure.

223
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,180
I learned how to grill during a college summer job.

224
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm not a pro, though.

225
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,620
It's delicious. Really.

226
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,820
Good job.

227
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,360
Stop flattering me.

228
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,520
It's nowhere near as good as my favorite barbecue place.

229
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,220
Which one?

230
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,700
The one near our college.

231
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,320
It's called Old Ma's Barbecue.

232
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,840
Well, is that place still around?

233
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,420
It was still there on my business trip in Beijing last year.

234
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,360
I don't know about now.

235
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,560
   

236
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,920
   

237
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,240
 When are you returning? 

238
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,048
 Let's eat together? 

239
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,300
I brought late-night snacks.

240
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,100
Will you join me?

241
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,680
Okay.

242
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,280
By the way,

243
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,562
I'm going to Beijing on Friday.

244
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:40,620
I know.

245
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,640
You're going back to Qingbei as a guest lecturer.

246
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,800
I saw all that in the alumni group.

247
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,560
The equity transaction for Matching is complete.

248
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,640
Thank you for your hard work during this time.

249
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,360
I assigned Qin Yu on new investment projects for Matching,

250
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
that you entrusted to Hetai.

251
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,220
A company of Matching's size doesn't need your attention anyway.

252
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,300
No need to personally update me on your plans.

253
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,220
Or do you want me to go to Beijing, too?

254
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,140
You're welcome to listen anytime you want.

255
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,800
   

256
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,180
What's wrong?

257
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,220
Are you not feeling well?

258
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,780
I'm furious at that jerk.

259
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,500
I've grown some nodules.

260
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,160
Deng Bo Ting?

261
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,020
You know what? When I went to him to get a document signed,

262
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,140
he was drunk and cried to me.

263
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,040
He regrets divorcing you and wants to get you back.

264
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,760
I don't need headaches.

265
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,680
And after his cheating,

266
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,908
I realized we were never truly compatible.

267
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:02,700
His personality really wasn't right for you.

268
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,960
Then whom do you think is right for me?

269
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,060
Have you ever thought

270
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,920
that the right one might be someone you've kept missing?

271
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,280
What about you?

272
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,300
Does your little girlfriend suit you?

273
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,500
She's my friend's daughter.

274
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,220
I'm just mentoring her.

275
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,840
I've had only one relationship since you went abroad.

276
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,880
But I'm single now.

277
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,940
Congratulations.

278
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,260
You have countless options again.

279
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,180
And you're free to pursue any girl you want.

280
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,300
Including you?

281
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,600
Of course, that includes me,

282
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,820
as long as you can win me over.

283
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,564
   

284
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,440
Thank you for your hard work today.

285
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,040
Get some rest early tonight.

286
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,620
See you tomorrow.

287
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,220
See you later.

288
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,560
   

289
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,700
General characteristics.

290
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,940
"The period of history which is commonly called modern"

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,510
"has a mental outlook which differs from that"

292
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,710
"of the medieval period in many ways."

293
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,540
 General characteristics. 

294
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,740
 "The period of history which is commonly called modern" 

295
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,232
 "has a mental outlook which differs from that" 

296
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:09,580
 "of the medieval period in many ways." 

297
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,400
   

298
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,160
   

299
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,725
   

300
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,660
All right, I understand.

301
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,960
We're getting manicures tomorrow at 3 p.m. All right?

302
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
 Fine. Don't be late. 

303
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,400
How could I be late?

304
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,480
Drink this before you sleep, and you'll sleep well.

305
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,780
Okay. Thank you, Wang Yi.

306
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,040
 Does Wang Yi bring you milk before bed nightly? 

307
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,940
Yes, he brings it to me every night.

308
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,040
 Xi Xi, I don't think he took awful photos 

309
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,720
to blackmail you.

310
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,740
He likes you.

311
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,840
How could that be?

312
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,980
Aside from food and research,

313
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,820
nothing else interests Wang Yi.

314
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,860
What about you?

315
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,540
Don't you feel anything for him?

316
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,780
Of course not.

317
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,460
What are you talking about?

318
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,380
I think Wang Yi is better than all your exes.

319
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,940
 He's gentle and considerate, 

320
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,800
and he fulfills your every request.

321
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,520
That's because we're best friends.

322
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,360
Sworn friends, okay?

323
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,740
You see it that way.

324
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,380
He might not see it that way.

325
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,780
All right, go to sleep now. See you tomorrow.

326
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,600
 Okay, okay. 

327
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,780
Wang Yi.

328
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,500
I need to ask you.

329
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,600
Go ahead.

330
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,940
Do you like me?

331
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,880
What did you say?

332
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,860
Guan Wen Yuan said you do.

333
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,160
We swore to be best friends for life.

334
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,040
Whoever breaks that oath will be punished by Heaven.

335
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,800
If you say it like that, who would dare like you?

336
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,460
What?

337
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,220
Stop checking your phone. I'm talking to you!

338
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,740
Whatever you say.

339
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,760
- Are you hungry? 
 - I'm not.

340
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,080
I'm going to An Ni's for food.

341
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,540
- Do you want anything? 
 - No.

342
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,420
Then go to bed.

343
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,080
Wang Yi!

344
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,160
Wait for me at home!

345
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,580
Is Xu Chen Xi at your place?

346
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,960
Get her to come out.

347
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,620
Her location isn't your business.

348
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,500
Take a good look at yourself.

349
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,780
She's out of your league.

350
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,880
Even I find you disgusting, let alone Xu Chen Xi.

351
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,000
Go home.

352
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,800
- What did you say? 
 - I said you punch above your weight.

353
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
Say that again; I dare you!

354
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,900
You go above your weight class.

355
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,100
Nice. You hit me?

356
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,400
You're punching above your weight!

357
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,860
Yang He, what is wrong with you?

358
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,180
Wang Yi, are you okay?

359
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,580
What are you doing, Yang He?

360
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,500
Do you see cameras here?

361
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,580
Harassing me was enough!

362
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,820
Now you attack my friend!

363
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,220
Are you leaving or not? I'm calling the police!

364
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,260
Xu Chen Xi, you...

365
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,120
Won't you leave?

366
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,260
Hello, 110?

367
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,100
I report an assault.

368
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,120
Wang Yi, are you okay?

369
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,360
I'm fine.

370
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,500
I'm so sorry. I'll be gentle.

371
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,280
I already told you.

372
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,480
That guy tends to be violent.

373
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,740
Yet you still went out alone to confront him.

374
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,140
I informed security before I went out.

375
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,360
Otherwise, how could I dare...

376
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,760
How could I dare to deal with him? Now it's okay.

377
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,340
With this evidence of violence, he won't dare harass you again.

378
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,580
Did you purposely get beaten up?

379
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,120
Quite clever, right?

380
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,040
Wang Yi, don't do this again.

381
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,760
It's fine. They're just superficial wounds.

382
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,060
They'd heal before I even got to the hospital.

383
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,580
Didn't you say it didn't hurt?

384
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,440
It hurts, but I can endure it.

385
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,840
Stop acting tough.

386
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,680
Be very careful when you wash your face for the next few days.

387
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,780
No water on the wounds.

388
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,220
Also, you can't eat any spicy food.

389
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,440
Avoid foods that trigger inflammation.

390
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,000
- I'll remember. 
 - And no soy sauce!

391
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
- Soy sauce will cause it to leave scars. 
 - Sure.

392
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,200
With a face this unpleasant already, what if you get scars?

393
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,333
If you end up with scars, don't blame me.

394
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,900
Also, I'll apply medicine daily for you.

395
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,580
Did you get all that? Don't eat those things.

396
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,960
No carbonated drinks either.

397
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,340
I'll remember.

398
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,980
Understood.

399
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,480
All right.

400
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,980
 Mr. Wang, happy birthday. 

401
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,900
 - Take a look. 
 - Thank you. 

402
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,060
 See if you like it. 

403
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,040
 I like it. 

404
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,220
 But you haven't even seen it, yet you say you like it. 

405
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,620
 I just know I'll like it. 

406
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,920
 You should have thrown those outdated glasses away long ago. 

407
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,460
 Try these on. 

408
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,200
 I picked them out just for you. 

409
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,480
 Wang Yi, you look cool. 

410
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,420
 Take good care of them. 

411
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,100
 I will. 

412
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,060
 I won't wait for Gan Yang. 

413
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,940
 I'm making my wish now. 

414
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,880
 Hurry, hurry. 

415
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,800
â™ª  Happy birthday to you  â™ª

416
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,140
â™ª  Happy birthday to you  â™ª

417
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,260
â™ª  Happy birthday to you  â™ª

418
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,280
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

419
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,260
Let me drive you to the office.

420
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,460
No need. I'm going to Wang Group first.

421
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,140
I'll get to LT at 11 a.m.

422
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,360
Director Ding, the chairman sent me to pick you up.

423
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,100
I'm leaving.

424
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,040
Thank you.

425
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,800
Thank you.

426
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,840
   

427
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,100
Gan Yang.

428
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,800
What are you looking at? Let's go.

429
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,130
 Â­  

430
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,380
 Ming Mei, I'm at your favorite restaurant. 

431
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,247
   

432
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:39,480
We three used to come here often.

433
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,160
When you're back, I'll bring you and our daughter here for a meal.

434
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,200
 Deng Bo Ting, can you stop these meaningless tricks? 

435
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,780
 It's over for us. 

436
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,000
 And just sign the equity transfer agreement. 

437
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,300
It's on your desk.

438
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,860
But...

439
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,600
Sir, would you like to order?

440
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,840
Catch it.

441
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,040
Let's go.

442
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,459
- Let's go out for a meal. 
 - Sure. What type of food?

443
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,500
 How about hot pot? 

444
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,640
 Sounds good. 

445
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,920
 That new place looks great. 

446
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,840
They say the movie is good.

447
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,220
Shall we watch it after class tonight?

448
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,880
Okay.

449
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
 This professor is brilliant. 

450
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
 No wonder there is a crowd. 

451
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,840
 True, but I'm exhausted. 

452
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,560
Yes, our seats are too far back.

453
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,840
Let's come earlier next time.

454
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,780
The turnout today is insane. 
    

455
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,560
This large auditorium hasn't even enough seats.

456
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,880
Maybe we should bring stools next time.

457
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,240
Professor Qin, I didn't expect you to be so popular,

458
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,040
even as a guest lecturer.

459
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,880
I was just a bit late, yet no seats were left.

460
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,220
It appears no one dares skip your lecture.

461
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,320
Or maybe my content is just really riveting?

462
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,080
Then might I have the honor

463
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,440
of sitting on your bike's backseat again?

464
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,060
With a decent excuse, I could consider it.

465
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,220
I sprained my ankle in high heels.

466
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,620
Is that your best excuse?

467
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,600
Fine.

468
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,020
- Let's go. 
 - Song Ming Mei!

469
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,840
I just knew you two were having an affair!

470
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,200
Acting like strangers at the office, right?

471
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,520
You must have manipulated the equity split. Isn't that right?

472
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,560
You went to him yourself. Are you insane?

473
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,980
Me? "Insane"?

474
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,140
Am I insane?

475
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,060
You went to the hotel with him the day after our divorce.

476
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,160
Do you accuse me of cheating? You cheated first!

477
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,500
We just happened to stay at the same hotel.

478
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,540
Two separate rooms!

479
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,900
We're all adults here.

480
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,100
Who would believe that?

481
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,400
Coincidence, my foot.

482
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,760
Fine. No point in saying anything to fools, right?

483
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,840
I might as well give you grounds to accuse!

484
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,380
Are you satisfied?

485
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,280
Song Ming Mei, you...

486
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,500
If you think Song Ming Mei and I have lied to you,

487
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,600
go to any agency to review it or sue me.

488
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,840
You're welcome to investigate as you please.

489
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,160
If you find any proof I would cheat,

490
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,920
I'll leave with nothing!

491
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,360
Deng Bo Ting, can you stop making a scene?

492
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,120
I can kick you from the company anytime at this point.

493
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,540
Threatening me?

494
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,700
Are you threatening me?

495
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,780
You've been hands-off for years.

496
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,000
Do you even know the company's structure now?

497
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,620
Do you know whom our clients are right now?

498
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,320
Let's go.

499
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm giving you a final warning,

500
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,720
I want that agreement signed by noon tomorrow.

501
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,060
Or you won't get a yuan.

502
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,540
I always keep my word.

503
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,240
Professor Qin, that kiss was purely out of anger.

504
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,060
I'm sorry.

505
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,200
Apology accepted.

506
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,600
How will you make it up to me?

507
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,660
Let me treat you to dinner.

508
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,140
How about it? I'm hungry anyway.

509
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,280
I'll pick the place.

510
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,580
Of course.

511
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,120
Whatever you say.

512
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,320
Then hold on tight.

513
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,920
Old Ma! Draft beer, please.

514
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,020
Okay. Do you need anything else?

515
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,860
- That's all for now. 
 - All right.

516
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,320
   

517
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,760
Here.

518
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,140
Despite all the changes over the years,

519
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,580
it's great that Ma's Barbecue is still here.

520
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,840
How is it?

521
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,100
Still delicious.

522
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:05,760
- Try some. 
 - Here.

523
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,260
Today, we're reuniting on campus.

524
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,480
Such a meaningful day.

525
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,480
And you did me a great favor today

526
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,520
by getting rid of Deng Bo Ting.

527
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,060
Cheers.

528
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,720
This feels great. Here.

529
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Tell me, do you hate Deng Bo Ting?

530
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,740
No.

531
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,560
Why should I hate him?

532
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,320
We were once perfect partners.

533
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,520
We even have a daughter.

534
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,080
There were so many wonderful moments.

535
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,960
If you were given the choice again,

536
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,360
would you still have left

537
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,460
six years ago?

538
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,360
Do you still remember

539
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,480
that party we attended?

540
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,420
If it weren't for you,

541
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,900
I couldn't even enter that venue.

542
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,600
Seven years ago, I had to beg you to get in.

543
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,160
But seven years later, see me now.

544
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,080
They're begging me to come.

545
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,100
If I want to go, I do. If not, I don't go.

546
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,180
What do you think I would choose?

547
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,580
I guessed your answer.

548
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,000
All right.

549
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,280
To all the choices we've made.

550
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,860
To all my choices that led to who I am today.

551
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,300
Here, have some more.

552
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,560
Don't drink anymore.

553
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,440
You've had too much.

554
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,620
I thought becoming a successful woman

555
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:07,660
would bring money and happiness.

556
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,020
But it doesn't work that way.

557
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,600
But what can I do?

558
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,460
I...

559
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,620
I'm still seeking lasting happiness.

560
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,600
Professor Qin, am I just too greedy?

561
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,500
Ming Mei.

562
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,140
You'll be happy.

563
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,760
Hello, Wang Yi.

564
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,420
Did Tong Tong schedule an interview

565
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,980
with your R and D team next week?

566
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,280
 Yes. 

567
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,800
Let's have our archery range team-building event.

568
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,760
Have her do the interview there.

569
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,720
 It's barely a couple days since you last saw her. 

570
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,940
 Getting anxious? 

571
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,160
I know she's avoiding me.

572
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,240
Although we've sorted the past, it's not easy

573
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,340
to move on from those things.

574
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,720
I understand her.

575
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,460
I want to spend more time with her

576
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,400
until she's ready to accept me.

577
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:21,240
   

578
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
You're up.

579
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,720
Have some water.

580
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,120
Thanks.

581
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,160
I'll make breakfast.

582
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,560
After we eat, let's go back to Shanghai.

583
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,300
Freshen up first.

584
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,080
Are you that nostalgic?

585
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,280
You still have that tie.

586
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,900
I like this style.

587
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,360
 Why did you suddenly take out that dress? Have some plans? 

588
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,600
I just suddenly felt like wearing an old dress.

589
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,560
I remember now.

590
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,760
It was right before graduation.

591
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,940
You specifically prepared this dress

592
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,640
for Professor Qin to take you to a party.

593
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,240
Sharp memory.

594
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,840
Speak up.

595
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,600
Why are you here?

596
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,280
Avoiding Gan Yang?

597
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,860
I'm juggling multiple projects right now.

598
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,500
Inundated doesn't even cover it.

599
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,800
I have no time to see him,

600
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,520
but it's likely for the best.

601
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,658
Each encounter means faking we're just friends

602
00:40:58,658 --> 00:41:00,160
when I actually like him.

603
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,560
- It's truly exhausting. 
 - That situation can't last long.

604
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,600
What can I do to make Gan Yang give up fully?

605
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,700
Let me think.

606
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,520
Why don't you start seeing someone new?

607
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,320
I think Wang Sen seems perfect.

608
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,600
He's a top-tier eligible bachelor.

609
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,220
Aren't you a bit tempted?

610
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,740
Now, just because a guy is around me,

611
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,520
you think he likes me?

612
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,700
Wang Sen and I are just friends,

613
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,160
strictly a client-vendor connection.

614
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,360
Well, keep lying to yourself.

615
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,960
Remember who he is. He's Wang Group's chairman.

616
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,160
Personally overseeing your projects?

617
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,880
He is creating excuses to get close to you.

618
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,040
Anyway, I've never thought that way.

619
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,080
Apart from Gan Yang, no man interests you.

620
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:58,480
Tell me, how did Gan Yang react

621
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,880
when this big shot was around you?

622
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,480
Listen, tomorrow I'm interviewing LT's R and D Team.

623
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,900
Wang Yi said it's an archery range team-building day.

624
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,880
He asked me to meet them there.

625
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,440
Tell me, do you think that involves Gan Yang?

626
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,620
That's right.

627
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,900
It's 100% his doing.

â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

631
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:42,485
â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

632
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:48,722
â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

â™«  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  â™«

634
00:42:55,885 --> 00:43:02,710
â™«  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  â™«

635
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:09,610
â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

636
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:16,685
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

637
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:23,785
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

638
00:43:23,785 --> 00:43:30,527
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

639
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:37,712
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:44,645
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™«

641
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:51,541
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:58,430
â™«  Someone held my hand against all odds  â™«

00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:04,985
â™«  Now Iâ€™m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  â™«
