 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,940
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,540
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,200
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,660
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,930
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,890
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,480
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,240
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,000
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,360
   
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,480
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,370
   

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:50,520


26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,926
You're awake.

27
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,160
Why did you bring me here?

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,320
When I repaired your computer last time,

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,720
I noticed your screensaver was the starry sky.

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,760
So I wanted to find a place where we could see the stars.

31
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,120
There are so many stars.

32
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,520
Do you like it?

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,580
I do.

34
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,160
When I was young, I often watched them with my parents.

35
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,720
And later...

36
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,580
we just didn't do it anymore.

37
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,680
Come.

38
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,320
Try it.

39
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,360
How is it?

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,840
Are you feeling better now?

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,580
I am.

42
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,140
Then let's keep shouting.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,780
I want to make a pair of running shoes that everyone likes!

44
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,840
I want a good life with my mom and to earn it by myself!

45
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,280
How do you think we will be in a few years?

46
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,660
I think you will be a successful

47
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,740
entrepreneur of domestic sports shoes.

48
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,520
By then, I'm sure you'll be a strong, financially independent woman.

49
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,280
Then...

50
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,760
Work hard, Director Gan.

51
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,040
You, too, Director Ding!

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,370
  ­ 

53
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,700
   

54
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:05,800
Hello?

55
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,360
Hello.

56
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Ding Zhi Tong.

57
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,640
I saw your post.

58
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,780
It's been shared many times.

59
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,440
I think Moqi will find you soon to resolve this.

60
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,900
You need to be mentally prepared.

61
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,740
Understood.

62
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,300
By the way,

63
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,960
no matter what happens, you can tell me right away.

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Okay.

65
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,520
Thank you.

66
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,340
Hello?

67
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,300
 Hello, I'm Moqi's HR (Human Resources). 

68
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,540
 We've seen your online post, 

69
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,480
 and we've verified with relevant personnel. 

70
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,980
 There is a misunderstanding. 

71
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,020
 We appreciate your courage and would like to hire you. 

72
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,160
 But you need to remove the post and make a clarification on this matter. 

73
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,100
So is this how you handle it?

74
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,640
 Yes, I hope you'll carefully consider this. 

75
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,660
There is no need.

76
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,520
I won't delete my post before you deal with Ma Wen De.

77
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,760
 Since that's the case, you'll receive a lawyer's letter. 

78
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,040
The matter is getting serious.

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,540
For its reputation, Moqi will surely sue you to the end,

80
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,200
and you have no definite evidence.

81
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm not concerned about the lawsuit.

82
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,020
I'm worried you won't find a job due to this.

83
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,000
After all, Moqi has quite an influence in the industry.

84
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,260
You're too impulsive.

85
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,540
Their HR took the first step to call you and reconcile.

86
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,100
It means they don't want this to become an issue.

87
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,660
You could have used this chance to ask to be in the Shanghai Branch.

88
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,460
This way, you get a job and transfer to Shanghai.

89
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,080
You don't need to jeopardize your future for Lin Xiao.

90
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,320
Ma Wen De is a repeat offender.

91
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,780
Because the previous victims kept silent,

92
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,180
he got worse and bolder.

93
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,100
If I also keep silent this time,

94
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,640
there will be more victims in the future, right?

95
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,480
That's true,

96
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,940
but have you ever thought of yourself?

97
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,740
If this matter gets serious, how will you find a job later?

98
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,600
Even so, I can't just do nothing.

99
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,820
Someone has to stand up.

100
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,600
- Bye. 
 - Bye bye.

101
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,840
Gan Yang.

102
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,320
Ding Zhi Tong, you are back.

103
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,720
I received a call from Moqi.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,200
They agreed to hire me, but on the condition that I delete the post.

105
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
I didn't agree to that.

106
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,080
Ding Zhi Tong. Has anyone ever said you're cool?

107
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
Don't you think I'm impulsive?

108
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,880
I don't think you are.

109
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,380
You're doing the right thing.

110
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,520
Think of this.

111
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,760
Since they contacted you to solve the problem,

112
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,860
that means they already know this internally.

113
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,960
This is a good start.

114
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,440
I thought you would also advise me to delete the post.

115
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,020
No, what you did was right. Why would I stop you?

116
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,120
Besides, our society is ruled by law now.

117
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Big companies like Moqi can't do things out of line.

118
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,680
Don't worry. I support you.

119
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,580
Ding Zhi Tong. I admire you for being so brave.

120
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,880
Thank you, Gan Yang.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,780
You're welcome.

122
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,820
Tong Tong!

123
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,360
Moqi issued an apology statement!

124
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,000
Ma Wen De is fired.

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,660
The police investigation took him away.

126
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,320
Yesterday, they said they'd sue you. 
    

127
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,000
I was worried all night.

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,260
Why did they suddenly issue this?

129
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,440
Here's your phone back.

130
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,120
Come in, please.

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
Lin Xiao?

132
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,920
Why are you here?

133
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm here to apologize to you.

134
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,760
On the mountain that day, I shouldn't have retreated.

135
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,340
So the statement has something to do with you?

137
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,240
After that day, Ma Wen De kept messaging me

138
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,340
so I sent our chat records to their company.

139
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,150
   

140
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,620
   

141
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,500
   
  

142
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,020
Thank you.

143
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,240
This is what I should do.

144
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Actually, I've been feeling guilty since that day.

145
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,680
Ma Wen De threatened me

146
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,520
that if I told, I'd be blacklisted in the financial industry.

147
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,520
And if I kept silent, he could let me get into Moqi.

148
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,940
So he used this trick to deal with past victims.

149
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,260
It wasn't until yesterday that someone told me,

150
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,000
then I knew Ma Wen De was a repeat offender!

151
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,240
All the girls he liked these years had no good ending.

152
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,600
I instantly realized,

153
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,460
after studying for so many years, I can't let such a person destroy my life.

154
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,120
Ding Zhi Tong, thank you for not revealing my name in your post.

155
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,940
It's fine.

156
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,360
Well...

157
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,340
Do you know the person's name who told you?

158
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,400
His name is Gan Yang.

159
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,680
You are welcome.

160
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,060
I'll go out for now.

161
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,080
Ding Zhi Tong.

162
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,060
Gan Yang.

163
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,080
Thank you for encouraging Lin Xiao.

164
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,760
Also, I received a message this morning.

165
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,300
I got the first interview's result with Hetai Securities.

166
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,220
I passed.

167
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,860
- Really? 
 - Yes.

168
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,220
Great!

169
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,440
Your efforts were worth it.

170
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,880
When I get the offer,

171
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,140
let's run together, okay?

172
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,040
All right.

173
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,200
By the way, was Hetai Securities' second interview scheduled?

174
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,280
Yes, the day after tomorrow at their Shanghai HQ.

175
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,880
I plan to go there tomorrow.

176
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,320
Is it in Shanghai?

177
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,120
Yes.

178
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,440
I'm also going to Shanghai for a marathon.

179
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,880
Shall we travel together?

180
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,200
When is your marathon?

181
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
My marathon is on...

182
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,760
tomorrow... then day after...

183
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,640
It's in three days.

184
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,420
It's perfect for me to go tomorrow.

185
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,760
But I've booked a slow train tomorrow.

186
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,880
It will take a long time.

187
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you sure about going together?

188
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,540
Sure. No problem.

189
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,480
Then it's a deal.

190
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

191
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,800
No need, I'll go to the station after work.

192
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,240
See you at the station.

193
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,700
Okay then.

194
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,800
See you tomorrow.

195
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,360
See you tomorrow.

196
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,860
All right.

197
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,400
Okay.

198
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,620
Fruits, apples,

199
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,360
oranges, blueberries,

200
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,120
cakes.

201
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,700
Okay.

202
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,560
Gan Yang, I'm starving; let's go eat. 
    

203
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,020
No.

204
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,960
What's going on?

205
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Did you rob the supermarket?

206
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,400
What are you doing?

207
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm preparing by the guide.

208
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,640
Don't touch these. They are for the trip.

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,360
It's only six hours from Beijing to Shanghai.

210
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,600
This is over the top.

211
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,840
But I'm still very moved.

212
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,200
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

213
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
I've decided not to go with you tomorrow.

214
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,360
I'll travel with Ding Zhi Tong.

215
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,880
I've refunded the high-speed rail ticket.

216
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,560
Then are these prepared for her?

217
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,420
Of course! What else?

218
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,880
By the way, we got Shuchi's payment.

219
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,600
"We got Shuchi's payment"?

220
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,000
Thank you for your hard work.

221
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,040
Hurry with the final payment for the equipment.

222
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,200
Don't delay Research and Development.

223
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,360
Leave it to me. No problem.

224
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,920
Hey, I'll take a fruit, okay?

225
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,460
No way.

226
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,860
This pile and this are both for Ding Zhi Tong.

227
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,680
I didn't expect you to be like this.

228
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,380
There is food in the kitchen. Make it yourself.

229
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,320
So you have a conscience after all.

230
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,380
Let me buy a ticket.

231
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,400
   

232
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,720
You bought new headphones?

233
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes, I just bought them.

234
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,360
You wouldn't buy them before, no matter what.

235
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,960
How did you decide this time?

236
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,560
There was an event in the store.

237
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,220
It was a good deal so I bought them.

238
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,280
Are you browsing tickets?

239
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,880
Haven't you already bought a ticket?

240
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,520
Gan Yang will go with me tomorrow.

241
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,720
I'm afraid he won't get a ticket.

242
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,720
So is he the real reason you bought headphones, Girl?

243
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,180
Have you finished your due diligence report?

244
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,280
Don't rush me, okay?

245
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,680
I'll do it when I finish the noodles.

246
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,360
Mine, mine, mine...

247
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,180
Mine, mine, mine...

248
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,480
Why did I lose it again?

249
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,800
I'll be there once I'm revived.

250
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,960
Keep up. Take the dragon and keep up.

251
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,680
Take the dragon! I'm back.

252
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,760
All of you, go there.

253
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,600
- Go get the dragon. 
 - Is it our internet speed?

254
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,660
- Get there, Guys. 
 - Stop playing.

255
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,860
It affects network speed. I can't get the ticket.

256
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,620
What are you doing? It's a ranking game!

257
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,981
So what? My ticket is more important.

258
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,740
Gan Yang, I'll fight you!

259
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,480
Will you fight me?

260
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,800
Don't touch my hair.

261
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,560
This is a precious, non-renewable resource.

262
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,740
You are annoying.

263
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,040
Just continue with your ticket.

264
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,120
Check this for me. Why can't I get a ticket?

265
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,580
Another star rating gone.

266
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,360
I got one! I got it!

267
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,680
Why should I be happy? Give me back my star!

268
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,720
   

269
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,720
   

270
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,700
   

271
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,420
   

272
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,640
   

273
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,240
- Here. 
 - Come here.

274
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,720
Okay, turn around. 
    

275
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,900
You can go.

276
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,380
- Hello? 
 - Hello, Gan Yang. Where are you now?

277
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,640
I just passed the security check.

278
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,860
Okay, it's the second check-in counter

279
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,640
and Platform 2. Don't miss it.

280
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,240
The second.

281
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,860
May I ask how to get to the second check-in counter?

282
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,560
You are in the wrong place. This is the South Station.

283
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,200
It's a ticket from Beijing Station.

284
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,120
S-South... South Station?

285
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,760
Yes. Your ticket is from Beijing Station.

286
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,700
Beijing...

287
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,960
It's over, Ding Zhi Tong. I-I'm at the wrong station.

288
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,960
Then can you reschedule your ticket? It's too late.

289
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,560
I c-can probably make it.

290
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,400
How about this? Get on the train first. Don't wait for me.

291
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,920
Get on the train first.

292
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,900
Be careful.

293
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,000
 Train D1155 from Beijing to Shanghai 

294
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,080
 will stop checking tickets now. 

295
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,280
 Train D1155 from Beijing to Shanghai 

296
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,540
 will stop checking tickets now. 

297
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,600
 Train D1155 from Beijing to Shanghai 

298
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
 will stop checking tickets now. 

299
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,380
 Passengers who did not enter the station in time, 

300
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,420
 please proceed to the ticket office to reschedule. 

301
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,440
Gan Yang!

302
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,160
Gan Yang! Here!

303
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,560
Ding Zhi Tong, I'm coming!

304
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,020
Come...

305
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,820
 Remember to reschedule. 

306
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,760
It hurts!

307
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,900
Lower your voice.

308
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,520
- Have an apple. 
 - No.

309
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,940
Have it.

310
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,760
You have it.

311
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,650
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

312
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,200
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

313
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,470
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

314
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,670
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

315
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,850
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

316
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,840
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

317
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,540
- Hello? 
 -  Hello? 

318
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,520
 What are you doing? 

319
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,220
I'm reading.

320
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,300
 The moon is so beautiful tonight. 

321
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,480
I see it.

322
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,480
- Ding Zhi Tong. 
 - Yes?

323
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,060
Ding Zhi Tong.

324
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:29,000
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

325
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
Why are you here?

326
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,680
I thought you missed the train.

327
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
I promised to travel with you.

328
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,320
How could I let you go alone?

329
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
How did you make it?

330
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,840
I checked all the stations this train passed

331
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,080
and got there early.

332
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,180
It was just the right time.

333
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,960
Then where is your seat?

334
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,040
My seat is right here.

335
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,420
Such a coincidence?

336
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,660
I'm your soulmate after all.

337
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,170
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

338
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,220
I'll get my luggage.

339
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,540
All right.

340
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,880
Thank you.

341
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,200
Young Man.

342
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
Are you sure you'll exchange your first-class sleeper for my seat?

343
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,620
Mister, I've said this to you so many times.

344
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,120
I am certain I want to exchange with you, all right?

345
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,640
Well, it's my first time seeing someone

346
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,080
who exchanges a first-class sleeper for my second-class seat.

347
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll rest assured with your word.

348
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,040
Then I'm heading over.

349
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,720
All right, thank you.

350
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,540
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

351
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,320
So that's what you call "a coincidence"?

352
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,580
My soulmate, right?

353
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,000
I just skipped the details.

354
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,610
Oh!

355
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,560
I don't know what you like to eat

356
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,880
so I just picked these.

357
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,120
There are potato chips, cookies, and instant noodles.

358
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
Oh, and a power bank.

359
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,720
- Does your phone have enough battery? 
 - Yes!

360
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,160
If your phone is out of power, you can use it now.

361
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,360
And this pillow,

362
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,120
you can use it as a waist pad or as a pillow.

363
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,240
- You can use it when you sleep later. 
 - Okay.

364
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,920
I also bought motion sickness medicine

365
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,240
- and little tomatoes... 
 - Enough, enough.

366
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,880
Let's get them if we need it later.

367
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,300
You should have a good rest first.

368
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,540
Okay.

369
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,400
You...

370
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,680
Do you always prepare so many things when taking the train?

371
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,440
It's my first time preparing them.

372
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,440
Your first time?

373
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,040
I'll get some hot water for you.

374
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Your boyfriend is handsome and so thoughtful.

375
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,860
I'm so jealous.

376
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,520
- We're not... 
 - Hey,

377
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,060
is it proper to praise someone else's boyfriend in front of me?

378
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,560
Does it matter?

379
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,400
Besides, I'm telling the truth.

380
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,300
Then tell me, who is more handsome between us?

381
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,140
Here you are.

382
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,540
- Thanks. 
 - Be careful. It's hot.

383
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,840
You didn't finish what you were saying.

384
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,260
It's the first time you prepared so many things.

385
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,380
Did you make a guide?

386
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,900
I was afraid you'd be bored along the way.

387
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:33,388
Also, I collected some jokes. I searched them on the Internet.

388
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:35,660
- Do you want to hear it? 
 - "Jokes"?

389
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,840
Sure, tell me.

390
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,463
Wait a moment. I'll review them first.

391
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,223
Do you have to review?

392
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,820
Ding Zhi Tong.

393
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,380
One day, while I slept, the phone rang.

394
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,760
I thought it was a prank call.

395
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,400
I took it and the person said,

396
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,680
"Hello, are you instant noodles?"

397
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,200
I thought it was a prank.

398
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,480
So I replied I was a ham sausage.

399
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
Then I hung up.

400
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,360
I haven't finished it yet.

401
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
Okay. You can continue.

402
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,080
The next morning after I woke, I thought about it a while and finally realized

403
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
that it was from a company,

404
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,200
asking, "Can you come for an interview?"

405
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,320
And not "Are you instant noodles?" (Sounds alike)

406
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,600
"Come in for an interview?"

407
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,100
Yes.

408
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,160
Hey.

409
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,300
I reckon you are not officially together yet, right?

410
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,340
You're not together yet?

411
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,340
We are not.

412
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,480
Since you like her, just confess your love.

413
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,580
If someone else takes her away, you will be totally frustrated.

414
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,620
I plan...

415
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,300
I plan to confess to her the day after tomorrow.

416
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,700
♫  A different kind of air  ♫

417
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,510
♫  Hovers between us  ♫

418
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,120
♫  Lemony freshness after the rain  ♫

419
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
♫  Your breathing  ♫

420
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,650
♫  Has the same rhythm as me  ♫

421
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,120
♫  A different feeling  ♫

422
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,860
♫  Your eyes  ♫

423
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,020
♫  Hold the stars that fell into dreams  ♫

424
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,680
♫  Running against the wind  ♫

425
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:54,110
♫  At the rhythm of the heartbeat  ♫

426
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,870
♫  Every shining, shining day  ♫

427
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,950
♫  Is a loving, loving day  ♫

428
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,752
Hello? My signal is weak here. Go—

429
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,300
Excuse me. She's sleeping.

430
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:12,650
♫  I will go and open my heart  ♫

431
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,150
♫  Welcome to  ♫

432
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,800
♫  My world  ♫

433
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,640
♫  Each cloud is brushed with color  ♫

434
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,030
♫  You are so unique  ♫

435
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,020
♫  You appeared in the cool season  ♫

436
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,950
♫  Like a cup of warm milk  ♫

437
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,220
♫  Waiting for you to appear  ♫

438
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,020
♫  I lie awake  ♫

439
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,970
♫  I’ve been missing you for 1,001 nights  ♫

440
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:47,300
♫  I just want to greet a sunrise in your embrace  ♫

441
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,470
♫  Over the same blue ocean  ♫

442
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,880
♫  You and I  ♫

443
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,040
 Dear Passengers, 

444
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,240
 we are now arriving at Shanghai Station, our final destination.  

445
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,640
 Please check your personal belongings and prepare to exit. 

446
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,280
Did you have a good rest?

447
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,960
Yes.

448
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,860
Is the pillow comfortable?

449
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,340
Very comfortable.

450
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,150
   

451
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,340
Hello.

452
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,680
Bro, you can do it.

453
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,853
Thank you.

454
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:54,820
Keep fighting!

455
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,280
Thank you.

456
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,540
- Bye bye. 
 - Keep fighting!

457
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,340
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye.

458
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,640
What did you talk about?

459
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,300
Oh, i-it's nothing.

460
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,060
By the way, when will you go back to Beijing? Tomorrow, how about—

461
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,100
Never mind.

462
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,420
I'll tell you after your interview.

463
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,940
Okay.

464
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,760
Then I'll accompany you there.

465
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,600
It's okay. I'll just take the metro over.

466
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,425
Okay. Then when it's over, just phone me.

467
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:37,900
All right, I'll call you when I'm done.

468
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,380
Then I'll go for now.

469
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,820
All right.

470
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,180
Ding Zhi Tong.

471
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,940
All the best.

472
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,160
Okay, good luck to you.

473
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,660
Okay.

474
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,380
This bottle is for you.

475
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,280
Remember to drink more water.

476
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,449
Thanks.

477
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:01,420
- I'm going. 
 - Okay.

478
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,820
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

479
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,250
   

480
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,740
   

481
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,740
You can wait here for a moment.

482
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,900
The interview begins soon 
    

483
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,660
Hello.

484
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,820
May I ask where the restroom is?

485
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,900
Go straight and turn left.

486
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,600
Thanks.

487
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,000
Feng Sheng! Why are you here?

488
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,900
I told you that my senior referred me for an interview.

489
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,360
Now I remember.

490
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,120
I planned to travel with you.

491
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,860
But I got held up by something in Beijing.

492
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,040
I took a high-speed train last night.

493
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,456
Are you free after the interview?

494
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:15,520
What for?

495
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm dining with my senior to thank him for his help.

496
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,840
Why not join us?

497
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,620
When the interview is over, I can show you around Shanghai.

498
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,420
There are a few places you'll definitely like.

499
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,880
I'll pass on this one.

500
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,280
I've booked my return ticket. I'm leaving this afternoon.

501
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,143
Well then.

502
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:35,200
If we both work hard and receive Hetai's offers, we will both work in Shanghai.

503
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,780
By then, there is a lot of time to explore Shanghai.

504
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,660
That's right. Let's do it!

505
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,220
Let's do it!

506
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,400
- Do your best. 
 - I will.

507
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,540
Hello?

508
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:03,060
Is the interview over?

509
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,405
How was it?

510
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:06,125
It went well.

511
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,380
What did you want to say before?

512
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,118
Will you watch my race tomorrow?

513
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:17,660
I have something very important.

514
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,000
I hope you can be there.

515
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,642
That might not work.

516
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:25,514
I've already bought my return ticket. I'm now at the station.

517
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,740
All right.

518
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,700
Be careful on your way back.

519
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
 I'll come see you back in Beijing. 

520
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,660
See you then.

521
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,220
Okay.

522
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,400
Bye bye.

523
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,720
What are you thinking of?

524
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,740
You have such a sad silhouette.

525
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,640
Don't worry about matters happening in two hours or eight kilometers away.

526
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,240
Are you planning your confession?

527
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,500
You don't have to do it during the marathon.

528
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,360
There will be many chances back in Beijing.

529
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,060
Do you think

530
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,240
maybe she guessed I would confess to her,

531
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,220
and she won't come purposely?

532
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,550
   

533
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
She said, "See you tomorrow."

534
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,960
Hi, Ding Zhi Tong. Will you come tomorrow?

535
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,800
Really?

536
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,680
Great!

537
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,120
It's just great!

538
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,460
Then I'll send you the address now.

539
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,380
Okay, see you tomorrow.

540
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
Okay. Bye bye.

541
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,280
Yes!

542
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,640
My lower back!

543
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,408
She said she would come tomorrow.

544
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,120
- Let's go. 
 - For what?

545
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,560
Go back to the hotel to prepare for tomorrow's confession.

546
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,160
No, you go back first.

547
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,834
I want to do a trial run to get a feel for it.

548
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:31,780
Then do it quickly!

549
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,630
- Don't worry. 
 - I'll be waiting for you.

550
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,220
Okay, okay.

551
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,380
Take it easy.

552
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,000
Hello, do you have any cheaper rooms?

553
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,680
Sorry, but ¥268 is already the cheapest in our hotel.

554
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,010
Thanks.

555
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:59,040


556
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,370
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

557
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,790
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

558
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:17,460
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

559
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,590
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

560
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:30,660
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

561
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:37,580
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

562
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:44,580
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

563
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:51,660
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

564
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:58,660
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

565
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:05,200
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

566
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,380
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

567
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:19,420
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

568
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:26,410
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

569
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:33,300
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

570
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,860
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

571
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:47,030
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

572
00:39:47,030 --> 00:40:00,430
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
