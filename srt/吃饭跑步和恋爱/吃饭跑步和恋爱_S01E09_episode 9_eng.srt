 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly 

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,100
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,930
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,790
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,950
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,580
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,340
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,500
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,380
   

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,380
Tong Tong.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,620
You are my first love,

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,900
and the first person who touched my heart.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,420
Coincidentally,

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,380
same here.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,740
Let's have some fish fillet congee.

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,540
Okay.

32
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,460
This is my specialty.

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,900
I think you'll like it.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,420
You have so many specialty dishes.

35
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,360
That’s right.

36
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,700
Then I'll try it.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,220
What other dishes are you good at?

38
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,500
I can make shredded potatoes with vinegar

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,460
and braised pork belly.

40
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,220
I'd like to try them all in the future.

41
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,600
Okay.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,140
Then please help me with the report. 
    

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,420
Fine.

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,100
I didn't know what to do.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,040
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

46
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,300
Rest assured.

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,540
Song Ming Mei.

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,660
- Then I'll leave. 
 - Bye bye.

49
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,100
Bye bye.

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,140
Feng Sheng?

51
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,620
Why are you here?

52
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,700
I need to see Ding Zhi Tong for something.

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,840
Is she upstairs?

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,980
Tong Tong?

55
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,020
She had already gone when I left the dorm.

56
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,740
Why don't you try to call her?

57
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,900
I was too anxious running here.

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,820
I didn't bring my cell phone.

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,600
But I have to go out and buy something.

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,340
Fine. Anyway, I'm not in a hurry.

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,660
I'll wait here.

62
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,520
- Then I'll leave you here. 
 - All right.

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,040
Bye bye.

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,980
What's wrong, Tong Tong?

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,140
Do you have any worries?

66
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,860
Nothing.

67
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,900
Don't hide it from me.

68
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,420
Since last night when Yun Ting told you about her boyfriend's issue,

69
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,500
you have been weird.

70
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,180
Are you worried

71
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,620
we will have a long-distance relationship soon?

72
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,900
I received a notice from Hetai Securities.

73
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm required to join the company a month early.

74
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,860
I may have to go to Shanghai ahead of schedule.

75
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,300
I'll visit you there often.

76
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not as simple as you think.

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,460
I may get too busy when I start work.

78
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,780
Maybe I'll travel often for work.

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,560
Even if you come to Shanghai, it's hard for us to meet up.

80
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,940
You also got Shuchi's investment.

81
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,220
You'll get busier, too.

82
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,720
Yun Ting told me about her boyfriend.

83
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,700
It was quite sweet when they met,

84
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,820
but they also fought many times due to distance.

85
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,660
I feel tired just listening to her story.

86
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,940
Tong Tong.

87
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,200
We're different from them.

88
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,120
How are we different?

89
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,860
Tong Tong.

90
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't feel the distance will be a problem for us.

91
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,620
I know you'll be busy.

92
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,380
But I will often go to Shanghai to see you.

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,180
Even if we can't meet,

94
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,140
I can go to your place and cook for you.

95
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,300
When you return and see the food,

96
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,400
you will know I've been there.

97
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,520
Besides, summer vacation is coming soon.

98
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,860
I'll be the senior next year.

99
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,360
I'll have more free time.

100
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,740
Tong Tong.

101
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,320
We will be together a long, long time.

102
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,980
Compared to it, the long-distance period

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,840
is nothing.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,480
I believe we will go through it together.

105
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:59,820


106
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,460
Feng Sheng?

107
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,860
Why is he here?

108
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,340
He must have something serious for me.

109
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,980
Don't get me wrong.

110
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,940
We are just good friends.

111
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,260
Over the years, he has indeed helped me a lot,

112
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
and I'm very grateful to him.

113
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,920
Will you be upset?

114
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,640
Is your boyfriend so stingy?

115
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,580
Since you have something serious, I'll go home now.

116
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll pick you up for work tomorrow.

117
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,220
Don't overthink things.

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,580
Good night.

119
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,260
Good night.

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,540
Hi. 
    

121
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,380
What's the matter?

122
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,300
Have you received Hetai's notice?

123
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,380
Yes.

124
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,260
And you? Have you decided where to go?

125
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,840
Yes.

126
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,060
That's great.

127
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,280
Are you in a relationship with Gan Yang?

128
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,700
Yes.

129
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,460
Wait, Tong Tong.

130
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,940
Have you thought it through?

131
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,700
You two grew up in different environments.

132
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,900
Your opinions on many things will differ.

133
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,220
Even if you can't see it now, as time passes by,

134
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,760
it will be an obstacle for you.

135
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,660
I've thought it through.

136
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,740
No matter what happens, I'll face it with him.

137
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,380
What about him?

138
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,620
Is he willing to?

139
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,140
I believe him.

140
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,300
Wait, Tong Tong.

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,440
You met each other not long ago. Do you know him well?

142
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,020
I can't say I know him fully,

143
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,400
but I believe his character.

144
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,300
It seems I'm meddling in your business.

145
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,840
Feng Sheng.

146
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,100
I know you helped me a lot,

147
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,240
and I'm very grateful.

148
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,000
But I still hope that you can find your own happiness.

149
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,680
I will strive for the happiness I want.

150
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,820
 I'm back. 

151
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,540
That's really thoughtless of you.

152
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,460
You didn't even tell me Ding Zhi Tong left.

153
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,320
I didn't dare return home.

154
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,880
It's really hard being a popular guy's roommate.

155
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,460
What popular guy?

156
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,060
I just played one round,

157
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,700
and many people added me.

158
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,380
Did you use my account again?

159
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,745
Can't you play with your own?

160
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,820
But your ranking is higher.

161
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,740
After your account was exposed, you never played again.

162
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,900
- Isn't this a waste? 
 - Listen up.

163
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,660
Don't use my account again. I have a girlfriend now.

164
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,380
Am I that kind of person?

165
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,080
You might as well put a "I'm taken; please stay away" sign on your face.

166
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,660
Go away.

167
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,340
You’re not worth my time.

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,980
 So many girls are talking to you. 

169
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,380
 Then what do I do if I go to Shanghai? 

170
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,350
"A one in six billion chance."

171
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,750
   

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,750
   

173
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,120
Tong Tong.

174
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,820
 Mom. 

175
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,220
 Why are you still knitting sweaters so late? 

176
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,260
 It's not good for the eyes. 

177
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm not that delicate.

178
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,340
It’s made of wool and warmer than most sweaters.

179
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,020
 You can wear it in winter. 

180
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,260
I have sweaters. Don't knit more. It's too much work.

181
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,500
You're about to graduate. We have to dress better at work.

182
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,780
Mom, I'll tell you some good news.

183
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,300
Hetai Securities accepted me.

184
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,660
Really?

185
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,300
I knew you would surely succeed.

186
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,060
I received the call yesterday.

187
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,820
I'll start next week.

188
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,700
Why the hurry?

189
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,880
Then where will you live?

190
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,700
How about I go to Shanghai first to find a rental for you.

191
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,940
 No need. I can arrange this. 

192
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,900
 Mom, after I start working, my salary and bonus 

193
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,060
 will repay the money in two years. 

194
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,540
 You won't have to work then. 

195
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,020
 You can rest. 

196
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,560
Let's discuss this later.

197
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,100
Get settled first.

198
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,020
Don’t be too frugal with yourself while you're there.

199
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,452
You should spend money if it's necessary.

200
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:23,020
I know.

201
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,840
I don't want you to work so hard.

202
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,920
I know what I'm doing.

203
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,520
I'll be waiting for you to give me a good life.

204
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,340
I'll take good care of myself.

205
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,440
All right.

206
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,180
Tong Tong!

207
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,320
- Have you seen Gan Yang's update in Matching? 
 - It's simply...

208
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
Auntie.

209
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,680
Hello, Auntie.

210
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,940
Ming Mei.

211
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,460
Come back with Tong Tong when you are free.

212
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,980
Okay.

213
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,180
 Okay, you guys do your stuff. 

214
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,380
Go to bed early.

215
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,720
Okay, you get an early night, too, Auntie.

216
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,000
Bye bye, Mom. Good night.

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
Goodbye, Auntie.

218
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,980
- What's wrong? 
 - Look!

219
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,140
Your boyfriend officially announced your relationship in Matching.

220
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,680
You don't even know?

221
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,720
I can't believe you. Visits on this

222
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,340
have been surging. 
    

223
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,200
What's the matter?

224
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,340
Oh, Gan Yang.

225
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,700
   

226
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,380
   

227
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,700
 Should we eat before house hunting? 

228
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,360
 Fine, do we still have time? 

229
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
 Yes. Are you hungry? 

230
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,360
- A little. 
 - What do you want to eat?

231
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,340
Gan Yang, here!

232
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,660
 Why are you here? 

233
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,100
To pick you up.

234
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,020
Pick me up?

235
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,180
We have serious business here.

236
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,380
We've no time to play around with you.

237
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,920
Isn't it just house hunting?

238
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,300
How do you know?

239
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,240
Did Wang Yi tell you?

240
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
Why did he tell you everything?

241
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,900
Forget him.

242
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,820
Why didn't you tell me you would come here?

243
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,520
We're here for serious matters.

244
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,820
There. Let me introduce her to you again.

245
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,380
This is my girlfriend, Ding Zhi Tong.

246
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,940
Hello.

247
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,740
She said hello to you.

248
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,660
Hello.

249
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,400
We have home tours in the afternoon.

250
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,640
You can go back first.

251
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,860
I brought my car.

252
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,700
Let me give you both a ride.

253
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,780
That's fine. I'll treat you to a meal another day.

254
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
 Actually, I think this one is nice. 
   

255
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,680
It's especially close to your office.

256
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,780
- I'm exhausted. 
 - Do you like it?

257
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,800
Are you guys done?

258
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,480
It's too expensive.

259
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,240
"Too expensive"?

260
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,980
You think ¥10,000 is expensive and ¥7,000 ($970).

261
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,080
Now you even think ¥5,000 ($690) is expensive?

262
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,780
Do you know which area we are in?

263
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,400
If you're tired, you can leave.

264
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,380
Don't mind her.

265
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,380
I think Miss Ding is right.

266
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
You should choose a home that fits your means,

267
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,860
and the same goes for relationships.

268
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,500
You two are not suitable.

269
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,420
Xu Chen Xi!

270
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,800
I-I'll leave.

271
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,140
Don't listen to her.

272
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,120
Her family spoiled her.

273
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,860
Have you decided yet?

274
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,500
Is there a cheaper place?

275
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,340
The complex next door is older and cheaper.

276
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,700
But its conditions are not as good as here.

277
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,740
It's okay; please take us to see it.

278
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,400
The next complex won't be much cheaper.

279
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,420
Since we are already here, we can just take a look.

280
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,120
What if it's suitable?

281
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,400
Please take us to see it.

282
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,780
Sure, this way, please.

283
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,540
Cheer up.

284
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,220
Here it is:

285
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,340
two bedrooms, living room and a bathroom.

286
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,100
Also, it has an open kitchen.

287
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,840
It's well lit.

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
You take your time. I have a call.

289
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
What do you think?

290
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,440
I think it's quite good.

291
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,960
It's better than those we saw before.

292
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,680
I think so as well.

293
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,100
I like this unit, too.

294
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,020
The lighting and apartment type

295
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,780
are no worse than the former two units.

296
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,320
And look, its decoration is very simple.

297
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,820
We’ve got space to personalize.

298
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,900
For example, the door area.

299
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,660
We can put a small chair here,

300
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,340
to change your shoes right after entering.

301
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,120
I think this wall can be painted green.

303
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,820
It’ll be easy on the eyes.

304
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,220
I just thought of this.

305
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,920
I can put a desk here.

306
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,000
Then I'll watch scenery when I tire of working.

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,880
Put an eye-protection lamp next to it. Perfect.

308
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,120
Okay.

309
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
I'll cook for you here;

310
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,440
you'll see me if you turn around.

311
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,760
Good. Then put a sofa here.

312
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,680
In winter, we can curl up and watch movies.

313
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,460
Then let's put the dining table here.

314
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,020
- Okay. 
 - We can eat watermelon together in summer.

315
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
- Good. 
 - Okay?

316
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,980
This balcony is nice.

317
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,920
Then that's it.

318
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,220
Let's rent this.

319
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,920
Wake up.

320
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,320
The budget is only ¥2,000 ($280).

321
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,760
I'll rent it for you.

322
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:47,120
- No. 
 - Why?

323
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,020
This isn't for you alone.

324
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll live here, too.

325
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,440
Then let's discuss it when you move to Shanghai.

326
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,440
It's a waste for me to live in such a big apartment.

327
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,460
And my budget is ¥2,000-2,500.

328
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,180
You don't want me to live in such a good home

329
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,360
while eating instant noodles daily, right?

330
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,340
You are right.

331
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,720
Mainly you live here.

332
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,740
It's important to find what you like.

333
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,720
It's okay; let's view others.

334
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,380
There must be a suitable one.

335
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,180
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

336
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,300
Careful.

337
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,140
Please enter.

338
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,820
My room is inside.

339
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,380
Come.

340
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,560
Come here.

341
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,700
I still think this unit is too small.

342
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,660
It's too far from your office.

343
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,720
And we haven't met your roommate.

344
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,200
What if they're not reliable?

345
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
How can I feel at ease leaving you here alone?

346
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,980
I think it's quite good here.

347
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,720
It's five minutes to the subway station.

348
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,960
It's convenient to go to work or the airport.

349
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,500
The key is it's easy for you to visit me.

350
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,200
I can afford this rent here.

351
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,300
I'll just get by for this year.

352
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,540
When I earn more next year, I'll change to a better one.

353
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,660
What if you encounter a criminal?

354
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,560
Criminals can't be here.

355
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,180
The agent said

356
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,920
the roommate is a woman.

357
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,380
Just put your mind at ease, my boyfriend.

358
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,220
Okay.

359
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,980
I'll help you clean up the house.

360
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,760
You are so great.

361
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,600
Good for you.

362
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,580
You did it swiftly.

363
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,960
How about it, Director Ding?

364
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,420
Are you satisfied?

365
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,820
- It's okay. 
 - Just okay?

366
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,160
Give me a score.

367
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,125
Four and a half stars.

368
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,066
"Four and a half"?

369
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,420
Then I'll make up for this half-star.

370
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,755
It's five stars now.

371
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:07,560
♫  A different feeling  ♫

372
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,120
I'll cook a meal for you as a reward.

373
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,300
What do you want to eat?

374
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,752
Will you cook?

375
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,140
Don't underestimate me. I'll show you what I've got.

376
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,300
- Fine. 
 - Let's go to the supermarket.

377
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,420
It's my treat.

378
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,820
For real?

379
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,340
Let's go.

380
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,680
No more than ¥100. We should strictly control it.

381
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,820
What do you want to eat tonight?

382
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,250
♫  I will go and open my heart  ♫

383
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,700
♫  Waiting for you to appear  ♫

384
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,450
 I lie awake  ♫

385
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,350
♫  I’ve been missing you for 1,001 nights  ♫

386
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,650
♫  I just want to greet a sunrise in your embrace  ♫

387
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,900
♫  Over the same blue ocean  ♫

388
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,425
♫  You and I  ♫

389
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,000
What are you doing?

390
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm shredding potatoes.

391
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,700
"Shredding potatoes"?

392
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,800
Is this shredded?

393
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,960
This is french fries.

394
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,380
Let me do it.

395
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,060
You are good.

396
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,940
This is what you call "shredded."

397
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,080
What do you want to eat?

398
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,180
Then I'll make my order.

399
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,600
- Scrambled eggs with tomatoes. 
 - What else?

400
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,240
- Shredded potatoes with vinegar. 
 - And?

401
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,580
Steamed sea bass.

402
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,060
- Anything else? 
 - And this.

403
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,540
What's this?

404
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,780
Shrimp and...

405
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,000
What? What?

406
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,120
Just do it as you like.

407
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
Fine. Then I'll start.

408
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,520
You can do it, Chef.

409
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:49,150
♫  Strolling around with you  ♫

410
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,380
♫  I wish that moment could last forever  ♫

411
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,275
♫  I don’t want to rush to the finish line with you  ♫

412
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:01,625
♫  I’m burning with anticipation  ♫

413
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:05,075
♫  Counting the days like years  ♫

414
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:09,675
♫  I’ve fallen for you without even realizing it  ♫

415
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,800
♫  Come a little closer  ♫

416
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,950
♫  Our tangled headphone cable  ♫

417
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,675
♫  Carried my longing to you for me  ♫

418
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:23,850
♫  I’ve kept everything in me  ♫

419
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,500
♫  Since the first time we met  ♫

420
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,220
♫  My heart lost its balance  ♫

421
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,800
With such a good chef boyfriend, I'll likely gain weight.

422
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,521
Try this.

423
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,180
This is what I ate.

424
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,440
- Is it tasty? 
 - Yes.

425
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,360
- Then try this. 
 - Potato strips.

426
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,660
- Is it good? 
 - Indeed.

427
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,720
I'll serve you soup.

428
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,560
Hello, I just moved here. You can call me Tong Tong.

429
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
Hello. Welcome. Just call me Xiao Li.

430
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,580
This is my boyfriend.

431
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,940
He helped me move in today.

432
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,240
I'll send him back after dinner.

433
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,320
Hello.

434
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,480
In the future, please help me take care of her.

435
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,120
It's okay. Please take your time.

436
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,240
I'll go back to my room. You guys can continue.

437
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,560
Right, then let's eat quickly.

438
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,780
After dinner, I'll send you back to the hotel.

439
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,380
I'll walk back with you.

440
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,000
Then I'll walk you back again.

441
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,960
I don't want to be away from you.

442
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Me, neither.

443
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,900
How about...

444
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,700
How about you don't come back tonight?

445
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,880
Where will I stay then?

446
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,620
We've just dated a short while.

447
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,160
I'd better come back tonight.

448
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,680
What are you thinking of?

449
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,880
I'll take you to a place tonight.

450
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,840
Have some soup.

451
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,350
   

452
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,460
   

453
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,720
Director Qin, why are you drinking alone instead of dancing?

454
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,480
Director Han, I'm no longer an executive.

455
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,660
Just call me Qin Chang.

456
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,360
Although you left, your story has spread widely in the industry.

457
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,380
Director Han, you flatter me.

458
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,360
Director Qin, you are so modest.

459
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,840
Talented people will shine wherever they go.

460
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,920
All the students you cultivated have strong abilities.

461
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,940
Your student, Song Ming Mei, has been a hit tonight.

462
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,360
If you'll excuse me.

463
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,080
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm okay.

465
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,060
How is it? Is it serious?

466
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,180
Come on. Let's continue.

467
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,800
 She still forces herself even after hurting her ankle. 

468
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,480
You even added Zhongwan's executive in WeChat.

469
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,640
There is no need to strive so hard.

470
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,980
Those at this banquet are all big shots.

471
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,100
Perhaps I can contact them in the future.

472
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,280
I mustn't offend them.

473
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,300
You are quite far-sighted.

474
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,540
Of course.

475
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,220
We young people can get ahead only by our own efforts.

476
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,700
We are unlike you, who always appears wise.

477
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,860
I've got to tough it out, no matter how hard it gets.

478
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,600
Professor Qin, today we differ that way.

479
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,360
But I believe that one day,

480
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,420
the summit will invite me to the event.

481
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:49,280
Fine.

482
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,040
I think you'll become a towering figure in the world of finance.

483
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,500
Sir, this is the cold towel you asked for.

484
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,980
Thanks. It's for her.

485
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:06,000
You sprained your ankle. Apply the cold compress.

486
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm out of wine.

487
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,540
This necklace matches you well.

488
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,160
Thanks.

489
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,020
That's really impressive.

490
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
It's okay.

491
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,740
Gan Yang. Do you go camping often?

492
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,820
Occasionally.

493
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,560
My mom took me camping when I was a child.

494
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,340
Although she was very busy then,

495
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,400
when she had time, she would take me.

496
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,600
In order to lessen her burden,

497
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,860
I learned how to cook and wash clothes

498
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,400
since childhood,

499
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,640
to cultivate my life skills.

500
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,960
Then what kind of person is your mother?

501
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,780
Well, my mother...

502
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,080
Mom is a great person.

503
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,400
She has strong work abilities.

504
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,900
Now everyone calls her CEO Liu.

505
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,320
She was born in the countryside.

506
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,180
After graduating from junior high, she strived on her own.

507
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:55,240
Her first job was shoe factory machinist for a Hong Kong businessman.

508
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,960
Later, she attended a junior college to study finance,

509
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,360
then started her own business.

510
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,360
When I started school, I learned English.

511
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,180
She asked me to read it for her.

512
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,680
I did a terrible job.

513
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,120
But she even thought I was impressive.

514
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,940
My mom once did the same.

515
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,560
- Did she? 
 - Sure.

516
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,420
All in all...

517
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,280
my mom is a fantastic person.

518
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,800
I think you two will get along.

519
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,920
Why did you bring this up suddenly?

520
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,080
Tong Tong.

521
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,840
You both are my favorite people.

522
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,300
So obviously, I want you to know her.

523
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,960
Do you know why I brought you here tonight?

524
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,340
Why?

525
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,880
Because I checked the news yesterday.

526
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,080
A meteor shower is after midnight.

527
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,600
- Shooting stars? 
 - Right.

528
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,040
It happens at midnight.

529
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,240
But you have a flight tomorrow.

530
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,800
Is it okay for you to stay up all night?

531
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,920
It's okay,

532
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,160
just for the one night.

533
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,500
Will there really be shooting stars?

534
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,000
Many clouds are here tonight though.

535
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,520
What should we do?

536
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,960
Will clouds block the view?

537
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,360
Tong Tong, I'll take you somewhere.

538
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,320
What to do?

539
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,800
- Tong Tong. 
 - What?

540
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,620
Look.

541
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,320
Fireflies!

542
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,840
Yes.

543
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,748
♫  Listen, the night sighs softly  ♫

544
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,868
♫  The rain clouds are approaching  ♫

545
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,848
♫  I can’t bear to part  ♫

546
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,628
♫  Yet still hold back  ♫

547
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:41,058
♫  And let you stand in the rain with me  ♫

548
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:45,240
♫  Wind delivers the messages of my heart  ♫

549
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,118
Tong Tong.

550
00:32:47,118 --> 00:32:50,318
♫  Which line should I send?  ♫

551
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:51,988
♫  Can let our story continue  ♫

552
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:55,508
♫  Can let our story continue  ♫

553
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:57,628
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

554
00:32:57,628 --> 00:33:02,378
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

555
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:06,423
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

556
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:11,919
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

557
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,939
♫  I wish I could stay with you  ♫

558
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:18,768
♫  To feel the lingering warmth of love  ♫

559
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:23,178
♫  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  ♫

560
00:33:23,178 --> 00:33:24,973
♫  When it comes to love  ♫

561
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:31,670
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

562
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,160
Professor Qin.

563
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,320
Good evening.

564
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,261
- Still the insane spicy set meal, right? 
 - Yes.

565
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,920
- The same as usual. 
 - Okay.

566
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,860
Professor Qin.

567
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,220
Professor Qin. Here.

568
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,000
Why are you here?

569
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,880
How is your foot?

570
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,600
Be seated.

571
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,380
After applying a cold compress just now, my foot feels much better.

572
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,280
You must care for your health.

573
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,860
Without a healthy body, you can't do anything well, you know?

574
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,950
Professor Qin., your insane spicy set meal is ready.

575
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,440
- Thanks. 
 - It's ¥35 in total.

576
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,260
Will you pay for this girl's?

577
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:44,360
No. We pay our own.

578
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,960
After all, I've never been a gentleman.

579
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,160
Thank you, Boss.

580
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,400
Enjoy your meal. I'll leave first.

581
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,600
You...

582
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
You really hold a grudge!

583
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,000
Tong Tong, you don't have to come all the way to see me off.

584
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,360
How about I see you to the airport?

585
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,080
You will work tomorrow.

586
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,580
And you didn't rest much last night.

587
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,740
Go in and rest.

588
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,960
If you see me to the airport, half your day is gone.

589
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,720
I'll return to see you after my final exam.

590
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,500
Okay?

591
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,240
Prepare well for the exam and make your way.

592
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,560
I can take good care of myself.

593
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,680
Really?

594
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,280
Really?

595
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,560
You'll be late.

596
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,660
Let's hug ten more seconds.

597
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,020
The driver thinks you'll be late.

598
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
Hurry and go.

599
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,840
Call me when you arrive at the airport.

600
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,240
Tong Tong.

601
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,460
Take good care of yourself.

602
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,180
Eat on time.

603
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,000
Remember to drink more water.

604
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,580
And your apartment is too old

605
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,480
so air it out regularly.

606
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,180
- Will you? 
 - Yes.

607
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,500
Then I'll leave.

608
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,080
Bye bye.

609
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,740
Bye bye.

I'll miss you.

612
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,530
I'll miss you, too.

 - Of course.

First, all of you, welcome to Hetai Securities.

Colleagues sitting next to me are the directors of each team.

Next, they will introduce themselves.

Hello, everyone.

Performance appraisals are every week.

Your project directors will evaluate and score your performance.

♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

663
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:26,185
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

664
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:33,010
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

665
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:39,910
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

666
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:46,985
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

667
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:54,085
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

668
00:41:54,085 --> 00:42:00,627
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

669
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:07,912
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

670
00:42:07,912 --> 00:42:14,845
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

671
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:21,841
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

672
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:28,730
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

673
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:35,385
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

674
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:42,460
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

675
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:55,260
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
