 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,840
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,020
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,300
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,800
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,660
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:49,730
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,280
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,890
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,140
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,750
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,380
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,340
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,110
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,300
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,360
   
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,120
   

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,600
Sister Qin Yu.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,780
Jeez, you scared me!

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,300
I thought you'd miss the train.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,640
Sorry, Sister Qin Yu.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,720
I won't cut it this close next time.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,520
I haven't seen my boyfriend in ages.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
I got too excited just now.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,160
I get it. Long-distance relationships are like that.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,360
When you finally meet, nothing else matters.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,950
- I'm going to the restroom. 
 - Okay.

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:08,130

36
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,840
- Hello? 
 - Tong Tong, are you on the train?

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,160
 Yes, I am. 

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,760
 I should have told you earlier, 

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
 then we could have met in the lounge. 

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,080
Tong Tong, don't dwell on it.

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,800
I was already happy seeing you just now.

42
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,300
Me, too.

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,000
After meeting investors in Hangzhou, I want to go home.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,240
 It's not far. 

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,940
I haven't been home in almost half a year.

46
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,220
 I'll be in Xiamen after that. 

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,900
And then...

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,980
Hello?

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,700
Hello?

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,460
Hey, can you hear me?

51
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,740
Gan Yang?

52
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,320
Hello, Tong Tong?

53
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,880
Hello, Tong Tong?

54
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,880
Hello? Can you hear me?

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,980
Why are you holding your phone like that?

56
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,100
There's no signal.

57
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,060
I thought standing near the door might help.

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,340
Love really makes people foolish.

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,560
We're in a tunnel.

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,220
Hello?

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,220
Hey, can you hear me?

62
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,200
Yes.

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,540
You know what, I just did something really dumb.

64
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,180
I did, too.

65
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,860
When you didn't respond to me, I thought my phone was broken.

66
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,780
Turns out it was a tunnel.

67
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,460
I actually ran to search for a signal.

68
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,520
How come we both did the exact same dumb thing?

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,420
Tong Tong,

70
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,780
Dr. Chen may regret investing in me

71
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,660
if he saw me like this.

72
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,340
   

73
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,580
I have to go.

74
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,980
I need to get back to work.

75
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,900
Sure, go ahead.

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,300
I really wish you were here,

77
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,760
then I could hug you.

78
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,620
Tong Tong, the signal was cut out.

79
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,300
What did you say?

80
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,140
Never mind if you didn't hear. I'm going to work.

81
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,400
Tong Tong, wait.

82
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,060
I really want to hug you, too.

83
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,500
Bye bye.

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Bye bye.

85
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,820
 Â­  

86
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,950
   

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,140
Coming.

88
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,100
Come on in.

89
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,700
I brought you cake and milk tea.

90
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,820
Just come over next time; you didn't have to bring anything.

91
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,620
I'm not sure about the investor's presentation.

92
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,220
Please help me review it.

93
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,000
Coffee.

94
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,540
This is Luo Wen's compiled report

95
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,300
on provincial natural gas policies.

96
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,360
Give it to Ding Zhi Tong and have her organize it.

97
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,460
Director Huang always values policy shifts.

98
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,900
He will likely ask about it this afternoon.

99
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,880
Okay, I got it.

100
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,900
Basically, those are the issues.

101
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,980
But overall, it's very good.

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,860
 Thanks, Sister Qin Yu. 

103
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,700
 Ding Zhi Tong, I did deliver the materials to you. 

104
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,280
 Just you weren't in your room. 

105
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,240
 Ding Zhi Tong, this presentation is crucial for your rating this week. 

106
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,700
 Do a good job. 

107
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,640
 One misstep, and your position at Hetai will be in jeopardy. 

108
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,940
Ms. Dai, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,860
Don't think you're safe just because Director Huang approved it.

110
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,920
There's a discrepancy in the data regarding the release time.

111
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,600
It shows you're not completely familiar with the materials.

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,520
Your rating for this week

113
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,240
is one star.

114
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,140
 Tong Tong, this is my breakfast. 

115
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
 A bowl of noodles, 

116
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,520
 some fruit, and this oyster omelet. 

117
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,060
 Tong Tong, 

118
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,560
 look how beautiful the view is from this pathway in Xiamen. 

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,780
 We should come here together next time. 

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,020
   

121
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,867
   

122
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,940
   

123
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,880
Our company has a professional R&amp;D team, composed of a few members...

124
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,420
Professor Chen, may I step out for a moment?

125
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,652
You... Whenever your girlfriend calls,

126
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:44,340
you're off like a shot.

127
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,020
Well, I have a veteran like you to hold the fort.

128
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,800
If you approve of this contract,

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I'll be completely at ease.

130
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,220
- Go on then. Hurry back. 
 - All right, I'll be right back.

131
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,420
Quality remains our top priority.

132
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,480
 Hello. 

133
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,600
Tong Tong, I know you're upset. 
    

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,340
 You don't have to hide your emotions from me. 

135
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,740
You noticed.

136
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,600
You're smiling,

137
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,920
but it doesn't seem very relaxed.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,180
 Can you tell me what happened? 

139
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,920
Ms. Dai had a client meeting in Hangzhou

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,740
 so I couldn't go home. 

141
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,220
But the client suddenly canceled,

142
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,880
and now we're going to Jinan tonight.

143
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,940
 Plus I got a one-star rating this week. 

144
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,100
They're wrapping up the meeting.

145
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,780
I'll go check.

146
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,940
Go ahead. Work comes first.

147
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,140
Okay. Bye bye.

148
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,780
 Bye bye. 

149
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,820
It's okay.

150
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,160
Being a mom means having endless worries.

151
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,180
Tong Tong.

152
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,540
Mom, I cannot make it back today.

153
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,620
My boss suddenly said we're going to Jinan.

154
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,540
 You can't come home? 

155
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,420
It's fine. Work comes first.

156
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,480
It's okay if you can't come home.

157
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,960
Isn't she coming back?

158
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,580
I told Feng Sheng you'd be back to

159
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,620
 bring his things from home. 

160
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,300
Sorry, Ms. Liu.

161
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,580
It's a last-minute change, maybe next time.

162
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,500
No worries. You're busy at work. Take care of yourself.

163
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,480
 I'll make that boy come get it himself. 

164
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,660
Mom, I think my colleague is here.

165
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,720
I must go.

166
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,120
I should get some time off after this project.

167
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
I'll come see you then. Bye bye.

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,180
It won't be done until Chinese New Year.

169
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,760
Have you almost finished packing?

170
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,860
Well, you can stop it.

171
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,500
Ms. Dai just texted, saying we will stay here tonight.

172
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,660
She asked me to change her flight.

173
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,320
We will fly to Jinan tomorrow.

174
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,740
Changed again?

175
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,060
Who knows?

176
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,500
Maybe she's meeting some client.

177
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,660
You'll have to call your mom again to change the plan.

178
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,300
I won't.

179
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,500
I don't want to disappoint her again if things change.

180
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,140
That's true. Good thing we didn't check out yet.

181
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,100
Unpack your bags.

182
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,180
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye bye.

183
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,660
Hello?

184
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,100
 Hello, is that Ms. Ding Zhi Tong? 

185
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,700
Who is this?

186
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,780
 There's a delivery at the hotel entrance. 

187
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,200
 Could you come down to pick it up? 

188
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,340
"Delivery"?

189
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,060
I-I'll be right down.

190
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,640
 Sure. 

191
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,420
Gan Yang, did you buy me something again?

192
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,200
Guess who I am.

193
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,960
Li Shuai? Zhou Jie?

194
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,780
Who is Li Shuai?

195
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,840
And who is Zhou Jie?

196
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
You know quite a few guys.

197
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Why are you here?

198
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,120
They're my childhood friends.

199
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,540
They happened to come over today.

200
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,300
Then let me meet them sometime.

201
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
I'd like to get to know them.

202
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,860
Then don't procrastinate; how about today?

203
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,500
Wait, they're real?

204
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,980
What do you think?

205
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,500
Did you believe that?

206
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,700
I did.

207
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,400
You're so gullible.

208
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,580
Put me down.

209
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,340
- Put me down. 
 - Tong Tong, I can finally hold you again.

210
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
Too many people are here. Put me down.

211
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,660
So what?

212
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,700
Can't I hold my girlfriend?

213
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,760
My colleagues stay at this hotel, too.

214
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll drive you home tonight.

215
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,960
We will have the whole night together.

216
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,980
I just need to grab my laptop. Wait for me.

217
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,200
Sure. Go ahead.

218
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,700
What's wrong?

219
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,300
I didn't even get to tell you I could go home today.

220
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,860
How did you know?

221
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,960
Or did you get Ms. Dai to change the plans?

222
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,140
 Professor Chen, 

223
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,940
 do you know Dai Bo La from Hetai Securities? 

224
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,380
 I kind of remember. 

225
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,260
 She approached me a few times. 

226
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,060
 Could you arrange to meet her in Hangzhou tonight? 

227
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,000
I asked the investor to meet with Ms. Dai.

228
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,440
My boyfriend is really amazing.

229
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,360
Then I'll go get my laptop.

230
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,215
- Wait for me. 
 - Okay.

231
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,580
Go ahead.

232
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm back.

233
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,700
Here, snacks for the road.

234
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,100
You bought so much

235
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,380
and all my favorites.

236
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,580
Thank you.

237
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,700
Don't mention it.

238
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,460
It's just what a boyfriend should do.

239
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,020
But this is so much.

240
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,860
I'll be home only an hour.

241
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,700
It's okay. You can take the leftovers back to Shanghai.

242
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,440
Okay.

243
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,534
Fasten your seat belt.

244
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:54,840
â™«  Every shining, shining day  â™«

245
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,270
Hold on tight.

246
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,206
â™«  Moon and stars share the same rhythm as you  â™«

247
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,930
â™«  Every shining, shining day  â™«

248
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:09,150
â™«  I will go and open my heart  â™«

249
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,550
â™«  Welcome to  â™«

250
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,840
â™«  My world  â™«

251
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,320
Are you sure you won't come in?

252
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,920
I'll pass. I have things to do.

253
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
All right, I'm heading in.

254
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,630
Wait.

255
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,540
â™«  Like a cup of warm milk  â™«

256
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,023
Here.

257
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,960
Are these...

258
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,840
These are for your mom.

259
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,660
I wasn't sure what to get or if she'd like them.

260
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,600
She will definitely love them.

261
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,780
Then I'll thank you on her behalf.

262
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,400
â™«  Over the same blue ocean  â™«

263
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,980
I'm off.

264
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,880
Go ahead.

265
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,220
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

266
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,820
Mom, I'm home.

267
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,400
Mom?

268
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,600
Ma'am, a pancake, please.

269
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,040
I want it with sausage and egg.

270
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,820
I'm closing up.

271
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,460
- Closing up. 
 - So early today?

272
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,220
- You usually stay open till 10:30 p.m. 
 - You often get dizzy.

273
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,600
I was afraid you couldn't handle it. I'll do it.

274
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,040
- Don't bother. 
 - Let me.

275
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,520
He Chun, you're so lucky.

276
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,440
Your daughter is beautiful, successful, and filial,

277
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
not like mine.

278
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,280
All mine does is play around.

279
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,040
My daughter is very busy usually.

280
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
After graduating from Qingbei University,

281
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,200
she joined a finance company.

282
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,040
She's always flying around and barely comes home.

283
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,440
"Qingbei University"?

284
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,520
That's impressive, so smart!

285
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,940
Then I'm lucky today

286
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,720
to have a pancake made by such a genius.

287
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,680
Sir, I'll have some tofu.

288
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,480
Coming. "Genius Special" pancake.

289
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,160
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

290
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
Boss, I'll have a five-yuan pancake.

291
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,440
Sorry, we're closed.

292
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,500
All right then.

293
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
Why did you come back suddenly?

294
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
My work was suddenly canceled.

295
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,780
If I didn't come, I wouldn't know you're selling pancakes.

296
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Have you had dinner?

297
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,520
No.

298
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,620
Let's go. I'll make your favorite chicken wings.

299
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,638
Let's close up.

300
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:35,680
- Okay. 
 - Don't worry.

301
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,240
The braised chicken wings are ready.

302
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
So much food.

303
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,900
How can we two finish it all?

304
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,720
It's okay, leftovers for me tomorrow.

305
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,320
Come on, have some chicken wings.

306
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Let's see if you've still got the touch.

307
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,540
You're making me nervous now.

308
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,560
Delicious and my mom made them too!

309
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,740
Have more then.

310
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,280
Mom, it's turning into a noodle dish.

311
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Fine, no more. Eat up.

312
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,080
Mom, let's make a deal.

313
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,400
What deal?

314
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,960
I know it's not realistic to stop you

315
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,420
from selling pancakes now.

316
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,720
Let's have three conditions.

317
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,960
First, no working on windy or rainy days.

318
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,280
Second, no working when it's too hot.

319
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,520
Lastly,

320
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,380
if you feel even slightly unwell, you stay home.

321
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,020
Deal?

322
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Fine.

323
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,960
Whatever you say.

324
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,300
You agreed too easily; I know you won't do it.

325
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,140
You know what, I added Ms. Zhang on WeChat.

326
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,700
I asked her to keep an eye on you.

327
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,260
If you break the rules, I'll take leave and come supervise you.

328
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,040
I'd lose several thousand yuan then.

329
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,340
I'll listen; I promise.

330
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,820
Now you're even threatening your mother.

331
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,420
I wouldn't dare.

332
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,460
- Are the chicken wings too salty? 
 - No.

333
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,180
- Good? 
 - Yes.

334
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,680
Don't rush back next time if you're busy.

335
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,120
Travel exhausts you.

336
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,120
Don't worry.

337
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,480
One home-cooked meal makes it all worth it.

338
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,020
And what's this?

339
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,180
Spiced beef.

340
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,340
Keep it refrigerated.

341
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,460
It's getting late. Don't see me off.

342
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,100
I'll grab a cab to the train station.

343
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Of course, I'll see you off.

344
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,420
Take care.

345
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,900
Mom, don't see me off. It's so late.

346
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,340
Let me walk you a bit farther. It's so dark.

347
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,019
I can go by myself. You should go back and rest.

348
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:33,960
All right.

349
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,320
Text me when you arrive.

350
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,880
Sure. I'm leaving.

351
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,440
- Eat properly. 
 - Got it.

352
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,700
What a coincidence.

353
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,740
I'm off today and just came back to see my parents.

354
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,480
Have you eaten?

355
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,520
Wait, that's not right.

356
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,980
Of course, she's eaten. It's so late.

357
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,140
A new Counterstrike Cosplay opened near Pujiang.

358
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,740
This week we're doing department team building there. Will you come?

359
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,700
No. Don't take that one-star rating to heart.

360
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,300
- Gan Yang. 
 - Tong Tong.

361
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,700
I thought you had things to do.

362
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,740
Why are you still waiting here?

363
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,900
I can take a cab by myself.

364
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,340
I said I was busy.

365
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,180
But I didn't say it was all work.

366
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,340
Put your stuff in the car.

367
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,540
I'll take you somewhere.

368
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,220
Where?

369
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,240
You'll see.

370
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,860
Almost there.

371
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,900
Are we there yet?

372
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,420
Almost.

373
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,940
Stop.

374
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,420
Did you make all of these?

375
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,900
Yes.

376
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,220
So this is what kept you busy?

377
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,620
One more thing for you.

378
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,080
Did you get this from making these?

379
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,260
Can you be more careful next time?

380
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,800
All right.

381
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
For me?

382
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
Let me put them on for you.

383
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,300
Do you like them?

384
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,380
Yes.

385
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,780
Do they look good?

386
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,360
Absolutely.

387
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,820
No matter what rating you get,

388
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,280
you're always the brightest star in my sky.

389
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,020
â™«  I wish I could spend every  â™«

390
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,830
â™«  Dusk and dawn with you  â™«

391
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,970
â™«  Like a world with just us  â™«

392
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,180
â™«  And a clock without hands  â™«

393
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,280
â™«  I wish I could stay with you  â™«

394
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,100
â™«  To feel the lingering warmth of love  â™«

395
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,400
â™«  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  â™«

396
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,240
â™«  When it comes to love  â™«

397
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:00,790
â™«  I hide but speak from the heart  â™«

398
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,780
â™«  Listen, the night sighs softly  â™«

399
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,800
â™«  The rain clouds are approaching  â™«

400
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,580
â™«  I canâ€™t bear to part yet still hold back  â™«

401
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,990
â™«  And let you stand in the rain with me  â™«

402
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,950
â™«  Wind delivers the messages of my heart  â™«

403
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,250
â™«  Which line should I send?  â™«

404
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,420
â™«  Can let our story continue  â™«

405
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,660
â™«  I wish I could spend every  â™«

406
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,560
â™«  Dusk and dawn with you  â™«

407
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,240
Tong Tong.

408
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:38,900
Tong Tong?

409
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,640
We're here.

410
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,760
That was fast.

411
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,960
You were sleeping so soundly.

412
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,560
I didn't want to wake you up.

413
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,600
But if you keep sleeping like this,

414
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,860
you'll be sore all over tomorrow.

415
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,240
Go upstairs now.

416
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,440
You'll be busy tomorrow.

417
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,980
Will you be okay driving back alone?

418
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,840
I can handle it.

419
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,280
With you energizing me, I'm very awake now.

420
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,800
Go inside.

421
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,880
I'll see you in Shanghai.

422
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,540
I'll be waiting for you there.

423
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,040
Okay.

424
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,540
I'm leaving.

425
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,990
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

426
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,270
â™«  Please donâ€™t wake me  â™«

427
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,570
Gan Yang.

428
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,800
I almost forgot.

429
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,700
I forgot about this.

430
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,100
It's food made by my mom. Take it.

431
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,820
All right, thank her for me.

432
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,060
I'll visit her in person next time.

433
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,530
â™«  Please let me chase the lonely star  â™«

434
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,880
Tong Tong, you forgot to take this.

435
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,490
â™«  Only for you  â™«

436
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,480
I'm really leaving now.

437
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
Bye bye.

438
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,580
 Gan Yang, something's wrong. 

439
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,280
 Running Shoes News is questioning us, 
   

440
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,080
 saying Wu Xun won due to his skills, 
   

441
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,720
 not because of the shoes he wore. 

442
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,480
 Now many people are asking me if it's just hype. 

443
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,300
Professor Chen.

444
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,040
I'm about to withdraw my investment, and you're smiling?

445
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,720
Professor Chen, I believe you'll make your own judgment.

446
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,680
I've booked tickets to Beijing.

447
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,400
I sincerely invite you to Beijing to visit Wang Yi's and my lab.

448
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,275
   

449
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,860
I believe everyone has seen our data.

450
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,160
It already surpasses the standards of some companies in the industry.

451
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,560
I'm also a marathon enthusiast myself.

452
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,820
If I wore these shoes, I definitely wouldn't win the championship.

453
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,600
Professor Chen. Try the coffee.

454
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,640
Okay.

455
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,442
Thanks.

456
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:06,380
A runner...

457
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,840
You can't believe those rumors online.

458
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,660
It's all Shuchi's doing.

459
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,820
If I believe it or not depends on whether you can handle this.

460
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,160
If you can't even handle this crisis,

461
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,840
no matter how good your tech is, I can't invest.

462
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,140
That's just throwing money away.

463
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,840
Thank you, all.

464
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,040
That's a very insightful comment.

465
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,980
Which platform should we release the video on?

466
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,740
They spread rumors on industry platforms.

467
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,860
Let's release it on public platforms.

468
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,720
Post it on Matching app and all major social media.

469
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,100
That way, more people will see it.

470
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,360
Maybe our data can attract more investment?

471
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,480
Right, Professor Chen?

472
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,320
Then we will await your decision.

473
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,120
Your company coffee is really good.

474
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,940
 A runner doesn't win championships just with good running shoes. 

475
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,800
 It also takes daily training and years of dedication. 
   

476
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,260
 I sincerely hope that those who quietly shine will gain more attention. 

477
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,000
 I also hope that our running shoes can help them 

478
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,780
 and never fail those who keep striving. 

479
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,340
Hey, look!

480
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,660
Shuchi is getting roasted online.

481
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,760
Stay calm.

482
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,400
No need to get excited over expected outcomes.

483
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Easy now.

484
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,580
Professor Chen probably won't withdraw his investment now, right?

485
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,220
They're saying you're awesome.

486
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,820
 I saw your video. 

487
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,820
   

488
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,080
 My boyfriend is incredible. 

489
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,140
You told me to stay calm, but you're grinning like a fool.

490
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,720
   

491
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,400
You wouldn't understand, as you have no girlfriend.

492
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,900
   

493
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,680
Being back in the office is the most comfortable.

494
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,700
Wait, have I been gaslighted by work?

495
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,800
How come I find the office comfortable?

496
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,520
You've been gaslighted quite badly.

497
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,880
Ding Zhi Tong, go get the bank statements for Directors Huang and Liu.

498
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,420
Got it.

499
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,180
Looks like Ms. Dai favors you.

500
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,340
Keep it up.

501
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,880
I will.

502
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,850
   

503
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,600
Go for it.

504
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,900
   

505
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,100
   

506
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,900
   

507
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,075
   

508
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,650
   

509
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,000
   

510
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,100
Hello?

511
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,240
Tong Tong, let's go to the concert.

512
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,720
I'm still at the office. Guess I can't make it.

513
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,600
But I'd rather watch with you.

514
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,800
Then I have another surprise for you.

515
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,060
I just got off the plane, and I'm in a cab now.

516
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,700
 If we start out at the same time, we should make it. 

517
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,480
Are you in Shanghai?

518
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,600
Then I'll leave now.

519
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,000
Did you get tickets?

520
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,680
Not yet.

521
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,480
 Just saw the notice after landing. 

522
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
 How about this? 

523
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,940
I'll go there first and see if anyone is reselling them.

524
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,260
Don't bother. We will listen outside.

525
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,600
 It's the same wherever we are. 

526
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,480
Okay, see you soon.

527
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,680
See you soon.

528
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,320
 One, two, three, cheese. One more. 

529
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,660
- Thanks, Sir. 
 - No problem.

530
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,060
Tong Tong.

531
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,200
Tong Tong.

532
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,920
Gan Yang.

533
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:28,000
   

534
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,700
 Since I've been with Gan Yang, 

535
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,960
 I feel like I've truly gained the courage to be free. 

536
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,960
 Meeting Tong Tong, 

537
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,080
 I realized 

538
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,440
 that her joy is my joy 

539
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,800
 and her sadness is mine, too. 

540
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,520
 I guess 

541
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,200
 this is what love is. 

542
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,060
Tong Tong, you go inside and change first.

543
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,780
Don't catch a cold.

544
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,960
I'll be right out.

545
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,340
Wait for me.

546
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,460
All right.

547
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,160
Take your time.

548
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,600
Tong Tong, where are you going so late?

549
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,080
My boyfriend came back with me.

550
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
He got soaked. I'm bringing him a towel.

551
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,340
Will you be coming back then?

552
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,980
- Yes. 
 - All right, be careful.

553
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,680
Have some water. Don't get sick.

554
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,120
Okay.

555
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,100
You should dry off, too.

556
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,040
It seems the rain won't stop anytime soon.

557
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,000
Perfect.

558
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,340
Then you'll have to stay with me a little longer.

559
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,660
I want that, too.

560
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,580
It's so late.

561
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,000
What time is your flight tomorrow?

562
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,940
At 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

563
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,320
Then you won't arrive in Beijing until the afternoon.

564
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,400
Will you make it in time for the exam?

565
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
I should arrive on time.

566
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,700
And I've already talked to Professor Hu.

567
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,720
He knows I'm busy with the lab work out of town.

568
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,520
As long as I make it before the exam starts,

569
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,920
he won't give me a hard time.

570
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,600
So you're really good with people.

571
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,460
Maybe it's because they sense my sincerity.

572
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,760
It makes them want to be friends with me.

573
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,660
I met a few engineers in Xiamen.

574
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,980
They thought I was a good guy and even gave me the bottom-line price.

575
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,040
See? This way of doing things saves much hassle.

576
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,140
That's insightful.

577
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,920
I should approach the outsourcing team like that, too.

578
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,800
I can't be like Jia Fan, just barking orders coldly.

579
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,380
Are you impressed by your boyfriend?

580
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,760
He can even inspire you at work.

581
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,340
You're the best in the world.

582
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,980
Really?

583
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,800
Then give me a kiss.

584
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,660
Sorry to interrupt. Carry on.

585
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,360
Go on. Don't mind me.

586
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,800
She's gone.

587
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,300
What's wrong?

588
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,640
What's wrong?

589
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,620
Tong Tong.

590
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,300
It's midnight.

591
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,240
You should go get some rest.

592
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,100
I'll grab a cab back to the hotel.

593
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,200
No, I'll wait with you.

594
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,960
Our place is too remote.

595
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,060
You might not get a cab.

596
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,100
Really?

597
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,180
Try calling one.

598
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,460
Pick up from here?

599
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,220
   

600
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,800
There really aren't any cabs around.

601
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,280
Forget it.

602
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,300
How about this?

603
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,500
The hotel isn't far from here.

604
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,740
I can walk back.

605
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,520
In this downpour? How could you walk back?

606
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
No big deal.

607
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,580
- Hello? 
 -  Hello, Tong Tong. 

608
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,800
 You just rushed out. 

609
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,380
 Did you bring your keys? 

610
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,760
I did.

611
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,320
My boyfriend and I are waiting in the hallway trying to get a cab.

612
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,280
We can't get one.

613
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,340
 Well... Why doesn't your boyfriend stay here tonight? 

614
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,880
 Anyway, I have to catch a flight to Shenzhen at 6 a.m. tomorrow. 

615
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,080
 You won't disturb me. 

616
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,680
Then... thanks.

617
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,360
 No problem. We should help each other out. 

618
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,980
What's up?

619
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,580
How about you don't leave tonight? You can stay here.

620
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,440
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

621
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,080
Let's go.

622
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,720
I'll make a bed on the floor for you.

623
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,760
Go take a shower first.

624
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,120
Okay.

625
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,480
Here's your towel.

626
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,640
Done?

627
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes.

628
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,180
Tong Tong, go shower.

629
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,840
It's late.

630
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,280
I'll go later.

631
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,420
The water heater only has enough hot water for one person.

632
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,880
It's fine. I'll wait.

633
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,700
If it's like this now, what about in the winter?

634
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,240
It's okay. It'll get better soon.

635
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,100
Try the bed.

636
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,600
Be careful. Are you okay?

637
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm fine.

638
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,600
Sorry,

639
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
you have to stay in this tiny place

640
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,480
when you're used to a big villa.

641
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,800
Say that again and I'll get upset.

642
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,140
Okay, I'll stop.

643
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,120
Tong Tong.

644
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,700
Come on.

645
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,320
Why are you taking photos?

646
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,060
To commemorate our first time living together.

647
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,240
Hey, we're not living together.

648
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,100
You had nowhere to go. I let you stay for a night.

649
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
I'll send you the photo.

650
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
I don't want it.

651
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,920
I'm going to shower.

652
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,620
But the water isn't hot yet.

653
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,940
Can't I

654
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,380
just brush my teeth?

655
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,840
I'm going to sleep.

656
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,440
Good night.

657
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,900
Good night.

658
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,920
Will you be okay on the floor?

659
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,320
Sure.

660
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Then you'll have to endure it one night.

661
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,380
Not a problem.

662
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,800
I'll take you to work tomorrow. Sleep now.

663
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,180
Okay.

664
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,140
Tong Tong.

665
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,940
Sleep now.

666
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,800
Tong Tong.

667
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,420
Give me your hands.

668
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,960
Gan Yang.

669
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,340
Why are you sitting on the chair?

670
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,980
I just came back from the bathroom.

671
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,540
Gan Yang.

672
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,380
Are you cold?

673
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,640
A little.

674
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,020
Are there cockroaches or mice?

675
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,700
I forgot to tell you.

676
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,600
That's just how old neighborhoods are.

677
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,560
I keep my room very clean but they still come up sometimes.

678
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,000
Did you not sleep all night?

679
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,800
If you apologize again, I'll get upset.

680
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,200
Once I get a raise,

681
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,760
I'll get a better place where you can sleep soundly.

682
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,460
Are you willing to move?

683
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,880
Of course, if I can.

684
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,660
I don't want you to always wait in hallways and bitten by mosquitoes.

685
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,260
I'm happy to stay with you, even with mosquito bites.

686
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,980
Tong Tong.

687
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,260
It's only 5 a.m.

688
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,480
Sleep a little longer.

689
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,600
Can you still fall asleep?

690
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:40,080

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

692
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:51,410
â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

693
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:59,660
â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

694
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:05,797
â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

695
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:12,960
 Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  â™«

696
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,785
â™«  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  â™«

697
00:44:19,785 --> 00:44:26,785
â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

698
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:33,860
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

699
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:40,860
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

700
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:47,302
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

701
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:54,587
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

702
00:44:54,587 --> 00:45:01,720
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™« 
 â™«  And every time I think of it  â™«

703
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:08,616
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

704
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:15,505
â™«  Someone held my hand against all odds  â™«

705
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:22,160
â™«  Now Iâ€™m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  â™«

706
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:29,435
â™«  Along the road we used to run through  â™«

707
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:41,935
â™«  There is always the someone I never once forgot  â™«
