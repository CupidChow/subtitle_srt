 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,869
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,563
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:22,895
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,143
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:31,926
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:35,920
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,584
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:49,756
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,752
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:02,204
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:06,812
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,168
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,070
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,770
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,501
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,265
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,036
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,579
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,740
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,280
   
   

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,480
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,434
   

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:50,930


26
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,120
Bro.

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,540
I'm out, too.

28
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,380
It's no fun being in Training Box without you.

29
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,360
I'll wait for you guys in Shanghai.

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,000
We will be back in Shanghai soon.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's fight together again then.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,780
I believe that day will come soon.

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,440
Don't be upset.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,600
We will come back.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,920
Wang Yi is right.

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
We will return soon.

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,440
As long as we stick together,

38
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,360
we don't fear anything.

39
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,500
Okay.

40
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,680
It's getting late.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,500
Let's go.

42
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,380
Let's go.

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,740
Gan Yang isn't easily defeated.

44
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,820
He will definitely come back.

45
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,120
It's not that easy to return.

46
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,580
All right.

47
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,140
Hello.

48
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,480
Gan Yang, tickets are ready.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
Let's go then.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay.

51
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,240
♫  The time and time  ♫

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,920
 Ding Zhi Tong. 

53
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,756
 Goodbye. 

54
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:22,720
♫  Life and life  ♫

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,860
♫  I had it once. I lost it though  ♫

56
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,760
 Goodbye. 

57
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,540
 Gan Yang. 

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,400
What's your bed number and name?

59
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,140
Song Ming Mei. Bed 6.

60
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,700
All right.

61
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,780
All done. The chemo meds are in.

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,280
Let us know if you feel any discomfort.

63
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
Please tell me your bed number and name again.

64
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,320
Song Ming Mei. Bed 6.

65
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,860
All right.

66
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,015
   

67
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,040
Am I done with the IV?

68
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,500
How do you feel?

69
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,400
Any discomfort?

70
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,160
It's not as scary as they say online.

71
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,020
Chemotherapy isn't that terrifying.

72
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,480
Look, I'm fine.

73
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,540
Can you pass me the mirror?

74
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,340
Do I look beautiful?

75
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,460
Gorgeous.

76
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,780
What's wrong?

77
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you okay?

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,260
Nurse!

79
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,120
Nurse!

80
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,240
I'm fine.

81
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,420
I'm okay.

82
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,880
Just messing with you.

83
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,680
You're sure you're okay?

84
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,320
Just joking.

85
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,940
I'm hungry.

86
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,520
Please don't joke like that again, okay?

87
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,140
What do you want to eat?

88
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,700
Hey, don't be angry.

89
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm craving wontons from across the street.

90
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,700
Wait here. I'll go get them.

91
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,500
Are you all right?

92
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,960
I didn't want you to see me like this.

93
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
It's okay.

94
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,620
- You were promoted to S.A. 
 - What are you guys looking at?

95
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,740
 Sister Tong. 

96
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,420
Sister Tong, have you read the company document?

97
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,740
- I've been promoted to S.A. 
 - Congratulations.

98
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,860
Congratulations to you, too, Sister Tong.

99
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,260
- To me? 
 - Yes. You've been promoted to MD.

100
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,700
Didn't you read the company email?

101
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,720
   
    

102
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,380
See, I didn't lie to you.

103
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,640
   

104
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,860
How so?

105
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,380
I quit Training Box.

106
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,100
You did.

107
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,280
But when you quit,

108
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,620
the project was almost finished.

109
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,380
Both sides were satisfied with your valuation.

110
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,820
The signing went smoothly too.

111
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,940
So we unanimously agreed you should be M.D. You earned the promotion.

112
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
Congratulations, Ding Zhi Tong.

113
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,780
 Congratulations, Sister Tong. 

114
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,020
Thank you, all. Thank you, Director Zhang.

115
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,560
Let's celebrate tonight.

116
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,140
Sure.

117
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,680
Back to work.

118
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,786
Excuse me, who's Ding Zhi Tong?

119
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:29,540
- It's me. 
 - There's a delivery for you.

120
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,460
Ding Zhi Tong, right? Here you go.

121
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,320
- Thanks. 
 - No problem.

122
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,165
♫  Only after the burning, the fireworks come  ♫

123
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,865
♫  Beauty always comes with its cost  ♫

124
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:40,541
♫  Every fall brings scars but also gives me  ♫

125
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,600
♫  A strong armor  ♫

126
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,240
 Tong Tong. 

127
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,140
 Congratulations. 

128
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,020
 Gan Yang. 

129
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,800
 You know, 

130
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,000
 becoming M.D. has always been my dream. 

131
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,340
 But now that I've achieved it, 

132
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
 I can't seem to be happy about it. 

133
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,490
 Why aren't you happy? 

134
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,840
♫  Joy and sorrow will eventually become  ♫

135
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,940
♫  A moment of memory  ♫

136
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,390
♫  But I want too much  ♫

137
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,500
♫  How can I stop?  ♫

138
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,990
Gan Yang.

139
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,220
♫  I accept  ♫

140
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,460
How have you been?

141
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,940
♫  The gap of losing after every gain  ♫

142
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:36,990
♫  The story twists and turns, but it isn't a fairy tale  ♫

143
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:44,515
♫  I matter most, and everything else comes behind  ♫

144
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:48,340
♫  I'm glad flowers once bloomed on my path  ♫

145
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,290
♫  But they are not worth looking back  ♫

146
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:59,940
♫  I allow moments of weakness, pain and struggle  ♫

147
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,565
♫  If I can't forget, just let it be  ♫

148
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:11,040
♫  After taking some wrong turns  ♫

149
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,920
♫  Then I know where to go  ♫

150
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,880
 Gan Yang, I miss you so much. 

151
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,480
♫  I'll arrive by myself  ♫

152
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,260
You're here early.

153
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,720
Morning.

154
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,840
- What's wrong? 
 - You're trying to scald me?

155
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,834
I'm really sorry.

156
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,760
You know, it's too cruel to show affection in front of him.

157
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,960
Let's tone it down a bit.

158
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,080
Have some water.

159
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,560
Didn't you say he fell asleep only at 7 a.m.?

160
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,760
What's wrong with you?

161
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,940
Don't you need sleep?

162
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,580
I dozed off a bit last night but couldn't really sleep.

163
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,600
I didn't want to waste time so I came back.

164
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,100
You still need rest then.

165
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,780
Take some melatonin.

166
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,320
No, thanks. I have a meeting with Design at 9 a.m.

167
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,900
Don't worry about me.

168
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm in good shape.

169
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,540
I can't stop thinking of the design, R&amp;D, and the production line.

170
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,120
I'm just too hyped to sleep.

171
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,600
I'll have Luo Hao Chen reschedule the meeting to afternoon.

172
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,940
Take the melatonin and go to sleep now.

173
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,140
Really, no need.

174
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,580
You know the serious result of disobeying Xi.

175
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,780
I advise you to listen to her.

176
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
Go to sleep now.

177
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,060
All right.

178
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,780
I can't win against you two.

179
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,900
I'll take one and nap on the couch.

180
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,880
Wake me up before the meeting.

181
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,820
Come in.

182
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,180
The Zhongya new energy project needs your signature.

183
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,520
Sure.

184
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,560
Didn't sleep well again last night?

185
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,540
I heard sour dates help with sleep.

186
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,820
Why don't you try them?

187
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,940
I've tried all kinds of sleeping pills.

188
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,500
They only let me sleep for two hours.

189
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,400
I dare not take too many.

190
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,240
With all that coffee during the day, no wonder you can't sleep at night.

191
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,720
This vicious cycle can't continue.

192
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,980
Maybe you should try traditional Chinese medicine?

193
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,940
I've seen both TCM and Western doctors.

194
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,300
It's okay. It's a mental thing.

195
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,580
It'll get better.

196
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,540
Go ahead with your work.

197
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,520
I'll be leaving.

198
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,680
Let's talk.

199
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,120
Do you have feelings for me?

200
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes.

201
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,200
But I don't feel that way.

202
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,520
I know you don't like me now.

203
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,580
But that doesn't mean you never will.

204
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,080
Hello, Ma'am.

205
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,840
Here's your coffee.

206
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,700
Enjoy, Sir.

207
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,520
This is the very coffee you ordered last time.

208
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
I still remembered.

209
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,000
Actually, I never liked coffee before.

210
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,380
I found it too bitter.

211
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,800
It seemed useless except for keeping me awake.

212
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,272
I started drinking it

213
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:35,240
because Gan Yang once prepared a surprise for me at a café.

214
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,880
I started to like coffee because of him.

215
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,360
So...

216
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,152
If I give you enough time,

217
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:48,832
maybe you will start to like something else

218
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,520
and replace coffee.

219
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,980
Not just coffee,

220
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,380
the breathing technique I taught you when we first met,

221
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,700
running, the food I like, and learning to live well,

222
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,020
Gan Yang taught me all these.

223
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,000
So I think a relationship isn't just about memories,

224
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,640
but becoming more like that person.

225
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,120
But those memories are in the past, aren't they?

226
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,580
Even so,

227
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,240
I still like Gan Yang now.

228
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,480
And I'll always like him.

229
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
Have I made myself clear?

230
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,640
Thanks for the coffee.

231
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,400
But I won't have it.

232
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,540
 Even so, 

233
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,000
 I still like Gan Yang now. 

234
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,440
 And I'll always like him. 

235
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
 Have I made myself clear? 

236
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,720
Chairman.

237
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
Ask Director Zhan from Shuchi to come see me later.

238
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,200
Got it.

239
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,720
 Ding Zhi Tong, I've got a foolproof life hack. 

240
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,920
 Do you want to try it? 

241
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,320
 What is it? 

242
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,960
 Feet slightly apart. 

243
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,780
 Hands on hips. 

244
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,780
 Take a deep breath. 

245
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,500
 What are you trying to do? 

246
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
 Head up. 

247
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
 Lastly, you shout, 

248
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,960
 "Ding Zhi Tong, come on!" 

249
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,060
 Ding Zhi Tong, come on! 

250
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,820
Ding Zhi Tong, come on!

251
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,900
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

252
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,510
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

253
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,650
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

254
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,260
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

255
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,260
♫  I wish I could stay with you  ♫

256
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,080
♫  To feel the lingering warmth of love  ♫

257
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,180
♫  My longing keeps knocking on the door  ♫

258
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,120
♫  When it comes to love  ♫

259
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:02,080
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

260
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,980
Gan Yang, look at this.

261
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,620
♫  Let us remain forever in this moment  ♫

262
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,712
   

263
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,320
Don't throw your back out. Take it easy.

264
00:21:58,343 --> 00:21:59,540
Come on, let's go.

265
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,800
Let me help you.

266
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,960
Sun Hao. Why are you here?

267
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,560
Bro, is LT really struggling this much?

268
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,080
The CEO and the R&amp;D director are doing this themselves.

269
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
Yes, it's tough.

270
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,860
How about you invest more?

271
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,120
And I'll give you another 5% stake.

272
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,560
There you go again with the sarcasm.

273
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,700
Don't listen to him. He suffers from insomnia.

274
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,240
I make him work hard so he can sleep better at night.

275
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,540
Is insomnia that easy to cure?

276
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,700
Your insomnia is especially hard to treat.

277
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,140
Go away.

278
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
So why are you here?

279
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,200
I came to see you.

280
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,920
I've missed you all so much after such a long time.

281
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,260
It's obvious he's all talk.

282
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,080
- How can you come empty-handed? 
 - Hey...

283
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,200
- Wang Yi, you... 
 - You couldn't even bring a cold drink.

284
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
- In this heat? 
 - You punk...

285
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,080
Not good!

286
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,960
- Watch out. 
 - Shuchi just launched new shoes

287
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,720
and promoted them on Training Box.

288
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,580
Take a look.

289
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,910
   

290
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,833
   

291
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,480
Yuan Chao actually partnered with Shuchi?

292
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,220
It must be Wang Sen's doing.

293
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,960
And Shuchi is directly targeting our product line

294
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
at one-third our prices.

295
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
They're after blood.

296
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Bro, what should we do next?

297
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,600
They can't keep up the price war for long.

298
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,120
But our cash flow is tight right now.

299
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,220
Let's avoid head-on collisions with them in the domestic market.

300
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,960
Chen Xi, keep the marketing going.

301
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,100
We keep highlighting our shoes' advantages.

302
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,020
Also, clear the inventory.

303
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,060
- See how long this price war can last. 
 - All right.

304
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,700
Wang Yi, at this stage, R&amp;D is all on you now.

305
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,060
Don't worry.

306
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,460
When 7.0 comes out, I'll slap them in the face again.

307
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,080
Bro, I've saved some money over the years.

308
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,440
I'm also part of LT.

309
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,860
Take it for now.

310
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,220
Thanks, Buddy.

311
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,220
- Come on. 
 - Come on.

312
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,220
Keep moving.

313
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,480
Let me help you.

314
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,300
- Then I'll go. 
 - Okay.

315
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,700
Fighting!

316
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,460
That one is heavy.

317
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,840
Be careful.

318
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,580
Sister, what do you want to eat? I'll order.

319
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,940
Anything is fine.

320
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,400
All right.

321
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,400
   

322
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,304
   

323
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:29,020
Hello, Ming Mei, can you do me a favor?

324
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,560
What's up? Just tell me.

325
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,980
 The user profiles of Matching and Gan Yang's shoes overlap perfectly. 

326
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,440
I want you to do a marketing promotion for him.

327
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,300
Can you give me a friendly rate?

328
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,180
You're this worried about Gan Yang?

329
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,540
Why don't you just be with him? Stop struggling.

330
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,120
Worrying is one thing.

331
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,480
You know we can't be together.

332
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,260
You haven't moved on, and he still likes you.

333
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,140
How is that impossible?

334
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,040
Besides, your mother hoped you two will be together.

335
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,220
Why do you act like it's a drama and you ship us?

336
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,480
Anyway, you can't blame me for what I say or do now.

337
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,260
Why not?

338
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,060
Because I have cancer.

339
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,300
What are you saying?

340
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,720
Don't say such things. Knock on wood!

341
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,760
Stage 3 breast cancer.

342
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,820
I'm undergoing chemo for a while now.

343
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,480
 The surgery was booked for next week. 

344
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
I wasn't going to tell you.

345
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
But what if the surgery fails?

346
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,720
Then you wouldn't get to see me a last time.

347
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,140
Which hospital are you in?

348
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,300
I'll come back today.

349
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,700
 Don't joke around. 

350
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,380
Aren't you making money?

351
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,780
Don't you dare disturb me.

352
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,405
I'm perfectly happy here with Qin Chang, just us two.

353
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:44,620
Stop that.

354
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,900
Send me the hospital address, now.

355
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,980
I'm not at the hospital now.

356
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,500
Just focus on your work, okay?

357
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,220
Right now I just want to enjoy life.

358
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,740
I'm hanging up.

359
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,560
Jia Xin, book me a flight back to Shanghai.

360
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,020
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

361
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,680
Director Zhang, may I take two weeks off?

362
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,440
My friend is sick and needs care.

363
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,340
Don't worry. I'll make sure all my work is covered and not delayed.

364
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,360
Have some soup.

365
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:30,472
- Here. 
 - Mom, I want more of this.

366
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,800
It's okay, you guys eat. I'll get the door.

367
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,080
- Ms. Ding. 
 - Ma'am.

368
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,480
- Careful, it's hot. 
 - Professor Qin.

369
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,160
Long time, no see.

370
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,260
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

371
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,320
It's okay.

372
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
Stop crying.

373
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,820
If you keep being like this, I'll feel bad, too.

374
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,720
The doctor said I can't have many emotional fluctuations.

375
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,360
I've searched about your illness on Internet.

376
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
The cure rate is quite high.

377
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,680
Let's treat it as a chronic disease.

378
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,280
You'll surely get better.

379
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,300
You can't even say the word "cancer."

380
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,860
I've fully accepted it.

381
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,260
Yu Lin doesn't know yet, does she?

382
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,320
No.

383
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,220
I want to protect her.

384
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,880
But if the surgery fails,

385
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm expecting you to raise her.

386
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What are you talking about?

387
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,220
How would the surgery fail? It can only succeed.

388
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:59,540
Ming Mei, no matter what happens, I'll face it with you.

389
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,820
Well, it's all right now.

390
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,180
Why are you taking photos of the medical records?

391
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,320
For insurance claims.

392
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,220
Peel me another apple, will you?

393
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,700
Sure. Cut down on screen time.

394
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,300
   

395
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,600
   

396
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,340
   

397
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,802
   

398
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:18,960
   

399
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,760
Excuse me. Where's Ward 12, Bed 6?

400
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,800
The second one on the right.

401
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,520
You got here fast.

402
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,120
Shouldn't a pre-op patient focus on herself, not meddling?

403
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,840
Hey, you. Okay, stop looking.

404
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,280
I'm the patient here.

405
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,720
Song Ming Mei, I wish you a successful surgery.

406
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,432
The doctor just called me for an examination.

407
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,040
You two chat.

408
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:56,354
Don't. I can manage on my own.

409
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,940
Have a good talk.

410
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Did you just cry?

411
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,240
I'm going downstairs.

412
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,720
Ming Mei has been acting up lately.

413
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,740
Don't mind her.

414
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,360
I thought it was you who was sick.

415
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,220
You scared me to death.

416
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,080
I'm glad you're okay.

417
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm fine.

418
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,120
She had some tests a few days ago and dragged me along.

419
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,280
All my indicators are normal.

420
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,360
That's good.

421
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,920
Has your insomnia improved recently?

422
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,740
Much better.

423
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,760
I don't even need to take sleeping pills.

424
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,160
How about you?

425
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,940
Has Shuchi's new shoes launch impacted you?

426
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,120
You wouldn't believe me if I said no.

427
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,960
But it's fine.

428
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
We can handle it.

429
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Ming Mei's surgery is day after tomorrow.

430
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Let's talk after that.

431
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,260
All right.

432
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,140
I'm leaving.

433
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,480
Take care of yourself.

434
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,940
You, too.

435
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,480
- Keep running. 
 - Eat properly.

436
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,560
Don't worry.

437
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:37,120
I'll keep running, and I'll keep waiting for you, always waiting.

438
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,780
I'm leaving.

439
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,200
Bye bye.

440
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,900
Where's Gan Yang?

441
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,580
He left.

442
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,260
Don't do that again. It makes me feel really bad.

443
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,840
Your mother wouldn't want you to stay like this.

444
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,730
I know.

445
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,760
I still don't feel right about it.

446
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Give me some time. I'll get there.

447
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,420
All right.

448
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,260
I won't push you.

449
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,180
I was actually thinking of asking you and Gan Yang to take wedding photos with me.

450
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,040
"Wedding photos"?

451
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,140
Downstairs, I was just thinking

452
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,760
that if the surgery fails,

453
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,520
these two days would be when I'm at my best.

454
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,680
Qin Chang and I never took proper photos together.

455
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,440
We want to have wedding photos as a keepsake.

456
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,100
The surgery won't fail.

457
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,860
You two are both so confident.

458
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,880
All right. If it fails or not,

459
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,660
I want photos.

460
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,760
I want to do it right here.

461
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,260
Come on.

462
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,540
Come on.

463
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Don't worry. I'll be waiting outside.

464
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,560
Don't worry. It'll surely go smoothly.

465
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,700
   

466
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:40,800
   

467
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,460
   

468
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,880
It's done.

469
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,640
Doctor, how did it go?

470
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,240
Don't worry. The surgery was a success.

471
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,560
The tumor has been completely removed.

472
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,420
It'll probably take another half hour for her to fully wake from anesthesia.

473
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,934
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

474
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:23,820
Thank you.

475
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,260
You can go to the ward and wait.

476
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,000
- Great! 
 - Okay.

477
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,160
Qin Chang.

478
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,800
How are you feeling?

479
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,480
I'm falling for you again.

480
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,532
 The doctor said yesterday's surgery took a full eight hours. 

481
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:51,360
How was it?

482
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,800
Were you scared?

483
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,180
I was worried sick.

484
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,934
But when the doctor came out and said it was successful,

485
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:02,160
it felt like getting a second chance.

486
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,632
 Watching you hold Professor Qin's hand made me wonder 

487
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:09,000
whom I'd want to see first if I woke from surgery.

488
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,580
Knock on wood.

489
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,424
Don't curse yourself like that.

490
00:39:13,424 --> 00:39:15,125
 The new version of Matching is live. 

491
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:17,506
You promised to help me test it.

492
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,880
You've just had surgery and already think of work?

493
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,760
 Just log in and give me some feedback. 

494
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,680
Okay. I'm logging in now.

495
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,720
It's been years since I last logged in.

496
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,020
Let me think. I need to remember my password. Bye bye.

497
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,880
   

498
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,140
   

499
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,840
 Tong Tong, Old Chen agreed to lend me the money. 

500
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,380
 All the effort finally paid off. 

501
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,240
 I wish you were here with me. 

502
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,060
 Tong Tong. 

503
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:14,841
 I got drunk again last night. 

504
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:17,124
 Sitting on the office floor, 

505
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:22,684
 I felt like you were by my side. 

506
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,120
 You touched my face 

507
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,900
 and said to me, 

508
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,820
 "Since when" 

509
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,380
 "does this small thing scare you?" 

510
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,337
 I just feel so absurd. 

511
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:49,097
 I promised to protect you, 

512
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,440
 but it turns out I'm the coward here. 

513
00:40:55,445 --> 00:41:00,645
 Tong Tong, I know you deleted your Matching account. 

514
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,980
 But every time I miss you, 

515
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,560
 I still log in to look. 

516
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,680
 Tong Tong. 

517
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,720
 My stomach acts up again. 

518
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,640
 I ran into a high school classmate at the hospital. 

519
00:41:19,737 --> 00:41:22,097
 He was shocked to see me. 

520
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:26,745
 He asked me why I was so frail 

521
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:32,146
 and if I still ran. 

522
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,025
 I dreamed of you again last night. 

523
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:39,218
 In the dream, you said to me, 

524
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:43,398
 "Gan Yang, promise me." 

525
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:46,091
 "You'll keep running." 

526
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:50,440
 Gan Yang, you have a really big appetite. 

527
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,772
 It's three times of mine. 

528
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,740
 If you eat like this, won't you become a plump middle-aged man? 

529
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,140
 With all my exercise, what I eat turns into muscle. 

530
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,640
 Feel it. 

531
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,200
 All right. Then promise me you'll never stop running. 

532
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,840
 You keep running. 

533
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,200
 All right, I promise I'll keep running. 

534
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:25,740
 I promise you I'll keep running, 

535
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,240
 and running 

536
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,200
 until no distance is left between us. 

537
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,460
 Tong Tong, we live only once. 

538
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,560
 I hope you can let go of the past 

539
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,900
 and love the one you're meant to love. 

540
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,880
 Ding Zhi Tong, 

541
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,920
 it's time for you to run once more for Gan Yang. 

542
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:33,260


543
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,020
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

544
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:44,155
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

545
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:52,105
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

546
00:43:52,105 --> 00:43:58,242
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

547
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:05,205
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

548
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:12,230
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

549
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:19,230
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

550
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:26,305
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

551
00:44:26,305 --> 00:44:33,305
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

552
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:39,847
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

553
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:47,132
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

554
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:54,140
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

555
00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:01,061
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

556
00:45:01,061 --> 00:45:08,050
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

557
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:14,705
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

558
00:45:14,705 --> 00:45:21,780
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

559
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:34,380
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
