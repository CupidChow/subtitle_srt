 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,869
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart 

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,357
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:17,563
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:22,095
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:27,943
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:32,226
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:35,320
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:40,584
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:49,756
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,752
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:02,104
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:06,712
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:11,068
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:16,070
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,501
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,265
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,036
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,579
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,940
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,280
   
   

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,480
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,356
   

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,820
So, Director Wang, what would you say

26
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,820
are LT's competitive edges in the market?

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
I believe they mainly lie in two aspects:

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,140
First, we have a professional, highly-skilled team

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,780
with extensive industry experience and sharp market insight.

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,000
Second, we are people-oriented and customer-centered.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,300
We continually strive to meet our customers' expectations and needs.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,520
These two factors give us strong core competitiveness.

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:23,020
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ðŸ’– Heart's Journey ðŸ’– Team @Viki.com 

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,940
Are you done?

35
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,620
Just waiting on Liu Dong now.

36
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,060
Xiao Zhang.

37
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,820
When is Liu Dong coming?

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,020
He went to the lab.

39
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,900
He said he had new ideas and would come in an hour.

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,418
That's still an hour away.

41
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:38,460
Sorry about that.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,820
How about a quick round while we wait?

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,100
You guys go ahead.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,380
I'll wait here for a bit.

45
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,460
Come on, how boring.

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,820
This game needs an even number of players.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,380
Come join us.

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,720
Yes, Director Ding, join us.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,980
I don't know archery.

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,620
It's fine.

51
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,220
I can teach you.

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,820
You'll learn right away. It's easy.

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,700
As usual, we will draw lots for teams.

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,660
 The same. 

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,860
You two are still in sync.

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,040
You're a team then.

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,040
Turn your body sideways.

58
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,560
Feet shoulder-width apart.

59
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:40,260
Good. Now take the bow.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,080
Hold it with your left hand.

61
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:47,760
Yes. Grip it here.

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,820
Take an arrow out.

63
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,740
The arrow goes here.

64
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,700
Place it on this.

65
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,060
Secure the arrow in its place.

66
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,080
You should hear a click.

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,840
The different-colored part faces outward.

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,980
Good.

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,140
Use three fingers to hold the arrow, like this.

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,340
So you want to get rid of Gan Yang?

71
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,860
Yes.

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,220
Weâ€™re not on the same page.

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,560
He believes Training Box should stay a sleek, compact premium app.

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,040
But I believe it should operate on a membership system

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,380
that's tied to offline gyms.

76
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,920
It could surely reach a market value of hundreds of billions.

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,060
Didn't Gan Yang agree?

78
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,400
He thinks if we do that, it'll drive users away

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,040
and cost us our lead.

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,500
Although I founded Training Box,

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,420
most shareholders side with him now.

82
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,940
If I push for expansion,

83
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,460
I fear they'll sideline me.

84
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Gan Yang wants equal capital increase.

85
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,880
That won't dilute his stake in Training Box.

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,240
You can't get rid of him.

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,040
His office is right at Training Box.

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,620
He's keeping an eye on you.

89
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,360
Yet you could come meet me?

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Keeping an eye on me?

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,200
He's not there for me,

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,760
but for Gutong Securities' Ding Zhi Tong.

93
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,460
They meet at the archery range this afternoon.

94
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,860
How's the practice going?

95
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
All right, let's start the game.

96
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,140
Here's how it works.

97
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,200
Pick a number between one and ten,

98
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
and write it down in your phone.

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
Don't share with others, then shoot.

100
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,180
If your arrow lands on your chosen number, you win.

101
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,060
Otherwise, you lose. The loser drinks sour lemon water.

102
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,380
This game tests your chemistry and archery skills.

103
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,960
Ready? Let's begin.

104
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,680
Okay.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,340
CEO Gan hit the second ring.

106
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,780
Director Ding missed the target.

107
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,860
Now, reveal your numbers.

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,160
Two.

109
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,380
Two?

110
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,920
You still are in sync after all these years.

111
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Just not a great aim.

112
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,980
I'm going to the restroom.

113
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
You lost. Don't forget the lemon water.

114
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Chairman Wang,

115
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,600
you have time for a round, too?

116
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm here for Ding Zhi Tong.

117
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,740
I need to discuss a project with her.

118
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,680
A real project or just an excuse?

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,740
Does it matter?

120
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,120
- Can you shoot? 
 - If I remember correctly,

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm the record holder in this archery range.

122
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,020
   

123
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,260
All right.

124
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,560
How about we have a round?

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,060
Sure.

126
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,220
Then let me get ready.

127
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,100
Since we're competing, let's make it interesting.

128
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Whoever loses stays away from Ding Zhi Tong.

129
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,340
No deal.

130
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,940
I don't gamble with someone I love.

131
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,240
Is anyone using this bow?

132
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,100
Ding Zhi Tong! Move!

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,760
Watch out!

134
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,100
Never point a drawn arrow at people! Don't you know?

135
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,820
Sorry.

136
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,380
- Wh-What's wrong with you? 
 - Get out!

137
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Even for an accident, CEO Gan should teach him a lesson.

138
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,860
R&amp;D demands care and focus.

139
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Chairman Wang, what brings you here?

140
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,220
To pick you up.

141
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,300
Pack your things.

142
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,480
We need to address an urgent project.

143
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,100
Let me grab my stuff.

144
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,140
Wang Yi, we will reschedule.

145
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,480
Sure.

146
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,440
Thank you.

147
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,500
I'll be leaving then.

148
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,740
You lost.

149
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,180
I don't care,

150
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,440
as long as Tong Tong is safe.

151
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,260
I thought it's a project to discuss.

152
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,306
Why are we here?

153
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,740
Let's check it out.

154
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,790
   
   

155
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,240
"Old Ma's Barbecue"?

156
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,860
Chairman Wang, you're here. Have a seat.

157
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,520
We've reserved a table for you; food is ready.

158
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,660
Have a seat.

159
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,060
Sit.

160
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,620
Miss, you're so lucky.

161
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,360
Chairman Wang specifically asked me to bring everything from Beijing.

162
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,620
He said it was a must to keep the original flavor.

163
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,660
Try it. It's the same taste as before.

164
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,300
There are some skewers. I'll be right back.

165
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,280
Chairman Wang, thanks for your kindness.

166
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,520
But I don't deserve such a reward for my work.

167
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,120
I still need to push harder.

168
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
Letâ€™s not discuss work at the table.

169
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,940
Try it. See if it tastes different.

170
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,680
Here.

171
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,040
Let me know if you need anything.

172
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
All right.

173
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
Come on.

174
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,600
Eat this while it's hot.

175
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,760
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

176
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,520
Chairman Wang, if this isn't work, I'll head back.

177
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,960
Let's meet at the office tomorrow.

178
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,980
I'll take you home.

179
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,680
It's fine. I'd like to walk alone.

180
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,500
Thank you, Chairman Wang.

181
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,020
Fang Ying. To Manhattan Neighborhood.

182
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,720
I'll drop something off for Ding Zhi Tong.

183
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,060
Why are you eating instant noodles here?

184
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,880
Because I'm hungry, of course.

185
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,740
Perfect. I'm starving, too.

186
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,640
Here, have some meat.

187
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,940
No. I would buy it myself if I wanted it.

188
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,960
It's almost midnight.

189
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,560
Buy one sausage, get one free.

190
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,040
Here.

191
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,920
Thanks.

192
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,020
Turn around.

193
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,400
Okay, I got it.

194
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
I'll handle it at the office soon.

195
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,280
About half an hour. All right.

196
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:30,340
Let's talk later.

197
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,680
Hello, CEO Gan. The chairman wants a word with you in the car.

198
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,280
This way, please.

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,025
   

200
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
Chairman Wang.

201
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,360
What do you want to talk to me about?

202
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
Something simple.

203
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,720
If you agree to give up Ding Zhi Tong and leave her life completely,

204
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,840
I'll help you reach your dreams.

205
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
And if I refuse?

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,700
I can bankrupt LT.

207
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,000
You know I have that power.

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,320
Then my answer is no.

209
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,040
Don't refuse so quickly.

210
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,560
Think about it.

211
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,100
It wasnâ€™t easy climbing out of Â¥200 million ($28 million) debt

212
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
to get here now.

213
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,920
Are you sure you want to give up LT for Ding Zhi Tong?

214
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,240
Who said I'm giving it up?

215
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,720
I want both Ding Zhi Tong and LT.

216
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,440
By the way, Chairman Wang.

217
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,040
I should thank you for something.

218
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,320
If not for you,

219
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,660
Ding Zhi Tong and I wouldn't have reunited.

220
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,580
I wouldn't have had the chance to pursue her again.

221
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,520
So thank you.

222
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,240
If you can prevent Gan Yang

223
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,180
from securing enough funds for the equal capital increase,

224
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,440
I'll buy out all his shares.

225
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,720
 It's your decision. 

226
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,560
Deal.

227
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,820
Intellectual Property just called.

228
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,200
When applying for a patent for the new material,

229
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,600
they found it was already registered.

230
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,700
Their data and research videos were almost identical to ours.

231
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,160
Our data has been leaked.

232
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,920
Wang Yi, notify the factory

233
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,800
to stop producing all materials for the new shoes now.

234
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,720
But we've invested so much in R&amp;D and stockpiled raw materials.

235
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,000
Now without the patent, we can't produce the shoes.

236
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,120
We don't have funds for equal capital increase in Training Box.

237
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,340
Notify all directors to attend a meeting. Now.

238
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,020
- All right. 
 - Got it.

239
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,960
I heard about the patent issue.

240
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,360
What happened?

241
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,160
Have you eaten?

242
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,712
- Not yet. 
 - Then let's grab a bite.

243
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,512
We can talk while we eat.

244
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,380
Okay.

245
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,280
I've developed a habit over the years.

246
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,440
Whenever I hit a wall

247
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,720
and can't find a solution, I tell myself this.

248
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,060
What is "this"?

249
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,860
"It is what it is."

250
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,160
"Let's eat first."

251
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,480
Or "It is what it is."

252
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,420
"Let's go for a run."

253
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,560
After eating or running,

254
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,980
I'll think how to fix things.

255
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,960
Is LT's situation very dim?

256
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,160
Wang Yi and his team spent years on this patent.

257
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:28,000
At this point, all our time and investment are totally wasted.

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,840
All raw materials we bought are wasted as well.

259
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,200
- You've already purchased materials? 
 - Yes.

260
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,900
The whole company was very confident about the new sneakers.

261
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,120
Here.

262
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,760
After multiple rounds of discussions with Production and Sales Teams,

263
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,120
we decided on mass production.

264
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,320
So we ordered materials in bulk.

265
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,600
Will there be much financial pressure?

266
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,240
Will it affect daily operations?

267
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,600
That's why we need a solution promptly.

268
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,320
What if you sell the materials?

269
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
Would that help?

270
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
I've already contacted buyers.

271
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,960
Hope we can sell them soon.

272
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,420
Gan Yang,

273
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,600
can you be honest with me?

274
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,320
Don't worry.

275
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,000
We will figure it out.

276
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,500
This is nothing

277
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,000
compared to six years ago.

278
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,600
Tong Tong,

279
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,940
I survived the past,

280
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,700
and Iâ€™ll overcome this as well.

281
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,140
Have you found out who did it?

282
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,500
Although, there is no concrete proof,

283
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,740
it's not hard to know.

284
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,240
Think who would benefit most from this?

285
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,940
The Wang Group.

286
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,180
That's basically...

287
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,380
the situation.

288
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,340
The funding gap is that big?

289
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,760
Everyone,

290
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,320
due to my negligence and poor management,

291
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,840
the company has suffered heavy losses.

292
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,460
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,840
Business is like that.

294
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,480
The highs and lows are just part of it, right?

295
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
Don't blame yourself too much.

296
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,220
But what's the plan now?

297
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,000
I've contacted buyers.

298
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,560
We will sell backlog of materials immediately

299
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,800
to recoup some funds.

300
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,840
Over the years, I've weathered worse storms than this. Right?

301
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,080
- Right. 
 - Exactly.

302
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,200
Don't worry.

303
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,360
We believe in you.

304
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,480
Just go do that.

305
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,840
Yes, CEO Gan, we believe in you.

306
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,080
Yes, CEO Gan, go ahead. We all support you.

307
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,240
Thank you, all.

308
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,460
I won't... let you down.

309
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,320
You just said you believed in me.

310
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,820
Why are you sighing now?

311
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,180
If I had known this would happen,

312
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,680
I never would have donated my entire fortune.

313
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,480
At least it could have covered our losses today.

314
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,800
Well, why don't you call

315
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,480
to see if you can get the money back?

316
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,800
You punk, are you messing with me?

317
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,240
I...

318
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,840
Please don't smash this.

319
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,480
We can't afford replacements.

320
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,840
The company is broke right now.

321
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,700
Okay.

322
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,600
You can still joke around.

323
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,840
That's good.

324
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,820
It means you've got a plan.

325
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,920
This was supposed to be my nest egg.

326
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,100
It's not much, but it can help a little.

327
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,900
Just take it.

328
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,560
Dr. Chen.

329
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,820
Thank you, Old Chen.

330
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,340
Don't do this hugging stuff. It's disgusting.

331
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,380
Get off.

332
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,480
Old Chen, we might be broke right now,

333
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,880
but we won't dig into your life savings.

334
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,320
With me here, LT won't fall.

335
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,840
You're quite arrogant, Boy.

336
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
I like it.

337
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,480
But listen,

338
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,835
you have to tell me all that happens.

339
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:50,796
Don't shoulder it yourself. Understand?

340
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,092
All right, enough lecturing.

341
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:55,540
- I'll walk you out. 
 - It's fine.

342
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,680
- Get back to work. 
 - I'll see you out.

343
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,120
Don't bother. I'm leaving.

344
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,800
- All right, bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

345
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,480
Gan Yang!

346
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,080
- Have you found Wang Yi? 
 - No, I've searched the whole company.

347
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,820
He's not answering his phone or text messages. I'm worried sick.

348
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,420
Will he do something drastic?

349
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,360
No. If anyone is about crack, it's not him.

350
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,760
Then where could he be?

351
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,080
I know where he is.

352
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
Wang Yi.

353
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,180
What are you doing here?

354
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,240
Why did you drink so much?

355
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,340
We were all worried sick. What happened to you?

356
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,840
Actually...

357
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,180
Actually, Gan Yang reminded me to register sooner.

358
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,200
But I kept putting it off,

359
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,680
thinking I'd finish my current tasks first.

360
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,200
Just one day.

361
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,000
Just one day late.

362
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,140
Now our work was stolen.

363
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,980
It's all my fault.

364
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,460
Sorry, everyone.

365
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,600
Wang Yi, this isn't on you.

366
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
It's on me.

367
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,600
I knew you were swamped.

368
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,000
I should have had someone else do it.

369
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,620
So it's not your fault.

370
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,920
Don't blame yourself.

371
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
No, it's my fault.

372
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,080
I should have reminded you.

373
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,320
Don't comfort me.

374
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,320
Now you're drinking? You can't handle it.

375
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,760
Gan Yang, let me drink.

376
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,320
I'm feeling... really bothered.

377
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,620
It's weighing on me, Gan Yang!

378
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,360
Fine.

379
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,800
You want to drink, right?

380
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,040
- I'll join you. 
 - What are you doing?

381
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,140
Your stomach can't take it! You'll need the hospital again.

382
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,680
Are you insane, Gan Yang?

383
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,440
You wanted to drink so I'll drink with you.

384
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,620
I didn't ask you to!

385
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,100
I'm drinking alone! Alone!

386
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,640
You two still at it?

387
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,940
Xu Chen Xi!

388
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,680
What do we do?

389
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,860
Hello?

390
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:09,465
Okay, I got it.

391
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,900
Something came up at work. I have to go.

392
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,800
Xu Chen Xi is in your care.

393
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,160
Wait, that's not right.

394
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,760
I should be the one who's drunk.

395
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,920
I feel so awful.

396
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
Don't drink so much again.

397
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,680
Am I on a boat?

398
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,160
Why is it wobbling?

399
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,260
Easy there.

400
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,120
Promise me you won't drink so much again.

401
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,020
- Wang Yi. 
 - Yes?

402
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,520
- Wang Yi. 
 - Here.

403
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,020
Wang Yi.

404
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,740
I'm here.

405
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,280
I don't want you to be unhappy.

406
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:03,060
I hope you come to me first when you're sad.

407
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,380
I'll always be there for you.

408
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,390
All right.

409
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,520
I want pig intestines.

410
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:21,541
Let's go home and eat.

411
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,955
I'm leaving.

412
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:39,300
- I'm off work. 
 - Bye bye.

413
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,740
Come in.

414
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,280
You haven't left yet?

415
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,740
You look a bit tired.

416
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,940
I bought you some coffee.

417
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm leaving. Don't work too late.

418
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,560
Okay.

419
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,820
Thanks.

420
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,320
   

421
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,480
Professor Qin, thank you so much.

422
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,260
You're so busy but still made time

423
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,797
to join me at Yu Lin's school event.

424
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,354
It's nothing. I should thank you.

425
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:24,354
It's been ages since I had such a relaxing break.

426
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,160
Mom, I like Uncle Qin.

427
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,020
Can he be my dad?

428
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,860
Well, tell him yourself.

429
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,740
I like you, too.

430
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,000
What's wrong? You've been yawning a lot.

431
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,640
Since Old Deng left, work's been piling up.

432
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,700
I'm exhausted.

433
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,741
Let's go to the hospital for a checkup.

434
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:55,683
Already scheduled, I'll go tomorrow.

435
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:57,209
I'll come with you.

436
00:30:57,209 --> 00:31:00,969
No, just a routine checkup. It'll be fine.

437
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,360
The car is here. I'll take you home.

438
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,260
Mom, can Uncle Qin come home for dinner with us?

439
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,360
He's too busy with work.

440
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,120
Let's not bother him, okay?

441
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,000
What do we do?

442
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,900
Your mom said I can't come.

443
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,120
Then I'm inviting you to dinner tomorrow.

444
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,040
- Is that okay? 
 - Is that okay?

445
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,260
Fine. See you tomorrow.

446
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,480
Push with me.

447
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,480
Let's go, hooray!

448
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,360
It's so late.

449
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,160
He's still not back yet.

450
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Gan Yang!

451
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,260
Gan Yang.

452
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,080
Gan Yang?

453
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,003
Gan Yang!

454
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:50,580
Why are you making such a racket? People want to sleep!

455
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,600
Sorry.

456
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,840
His lights have been on, but no one answered the door.

457
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,740
I'm worried what might have happened.

458
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,000
Gan Yang!

459
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,360
Gan Yang, come out!

460
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,700
Why don't you phone him?

461
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,960
Maybe he's not home.

462
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,000
I tried.

463
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,600
But no one answered.

464
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,140
Could something really have happened?

465
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,020
Gan Yang. Gan Yang!

466
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,520
If it's that serious, should I call the police?

467
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,660
Yes, please. Thank you.

468
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,120
- Come on, call them. 
 - All right.

469
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,020
Gan Yang, I'll call the police if you don't come out!

470
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,055
Gan Yang! Gan...

471
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:20,760
Tong Tong, why are you here?

472
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,020
You finally came out.

473
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
Your girlfriend was worried sick.

474
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,240
Sorry about that. False alarm.

475
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,940
Let's go.

476
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,000
- What happened? 
 - You scared me.

477
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,100
What took you so long to open the door?

478
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,120
Why didn't you answer your phone?

479
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,540
I accidentally fell asleep while taking a bath.

480
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,420
My phone was charging in the room.

481
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,420
Do you know how dangerous that is?

482
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,860
I worried something happened.

483
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,540
Sorry, sorry.

484
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,100
You must have panicked.

485
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,400
Are you that worried about me?

486
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,660
Of course not.

487
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,760
How did you hurt your foot?

488
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,080
Just an accident, it's nothing.

489
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,765
â™«  I wish I could spend every  â™«

490
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:05,575
â™«  Dusk and dawn with you  â™«

491
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:10,995
â™«  Like a world with just us  â™«

492
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,665
This might sting.

493
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:15,225
â™«  And a clock without hands  â™«

494
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:17,125
â™«  I wish I could stay with you  â™«

495
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,420
â™«  To feel the lingering warmth of love  â™«

496
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,860
How did it happen?

497
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,220
I broke a glass and got a cut.

498
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,000
Put on a band-aid.

499
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,285
Help me tear one open.

â™«  I hide but speak from the heart  â™«

501
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,880
Done.

502
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,380
This cut is a quite deep.

503
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,880
Remember to disinfect it for two days.

504
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,760
Don't get it wet.

505
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,020
Thanks.

506
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,929
Are you cold?

507
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,960
I'll get you a jacket.

508
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,350
â™«  Please let me chase the lonely star  â™«

509
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,800
â™«  Through this unaligned universe  â™«

510
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,310
â™«  Through this unaligned universe  â™«

511
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,750
â™«  Only for you  â™«

512
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,970
â™«  I wish I could spend every  â™«

513
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:28,070
â™«  Dusk and dawn with you  â™«

514
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,160
 - Done. 
 - All right. 

515
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,820
 Be careful. 

516
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,840
 It looks quite nice. 

517
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,380
Here.

518
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,040
It's chilly. Don't catch a cold.

519
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,460
I just heard you coughing.

520
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,600
Are you ill?

521
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,080
It's nothing.

522
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,840
Much occurred at the company lately.

523
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,940
I might not have slept well.

524
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,000
Do you have any ginger at home?

525
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,260
Ginger.

526
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,120
Is this...

527
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,440
Ginger tea.

528
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,660
Be careful. It's hot.

529
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
Is it okay?

530
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,320
Tastes just like the ginger tea I made you seven years ago.

531
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
You actually remember.

532
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,660
Have some more.

533
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,960
Gan Yang.

534
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,520
I know LT is struggling.

535
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,480
But you really need rest.

536
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,040
You can't ruin your health.

537
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,300
Do you remember my saying the same thing to you seven years ago?

538
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,760
I didn't expect the other way around now.

539
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:13,152
It's all my fault.

540
00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:14,893
If not for me,

541
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,914
you wouldn't have agreed to raising capital,

542
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:19,194
and none of this would have happened.

543
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,620
Sorry.

544
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,300
Tong Tong.

545
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,080
This has nothing to do with you.

546
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,980
I didn't agree to the investment for you.

547
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,920
LT didn't end up in this situation

548
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,200
due to you.

549
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,480
Don't blame yourself.

550
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,280
Have some more.

551
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,620
Okay.

552
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,680
This is the first time you've asked me out.

553
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,940
Honestly, I'm quite happy.

554
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,620
Was the LT patent issue your doing?

555
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,720
Is that why you asked me out today?

556
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,380
Yes.

557
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,840
Fine.

558
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,620
Then before I answer,

559
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,880
I want to ask you in what capacity are you questioning me.

560
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,340
As Gan Yang's ex-girlfriend

561
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,980
or my investment consultant?

562
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,200
Does it make a difference?

563
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,120
If it's the former, I have no obligation to tell you.

564
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,860
And the latter?

565
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:45,390
If it's the latter,

566
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,600
then we're in this together.

567
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,160
I'll tell you the truth.

568
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,320
So you admit you did it?

569
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,148
Business is a battlefield.

570
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:55,120
If you want to blame someone,

571
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,260
blame Gan Yang's poor management.

572
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,040
Good excuse, Chairman Wang.

573
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,000
If this had happened to anyone other than Gan Yang,

574
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,220
would you have cared as much?

575
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,200
Of course, I would.

576
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,501
I can't accept my client acting so despicably

577
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:16,386
or playing dirty.

578
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:20,067
I thought we got along and shared similar ideas.

579
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,361
I even considered you a friend.

580
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:24,282
Clearly, I was wrong.

581
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:26,220
We're nothing alike.

582
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,220
What's that supposed to mean?

583
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,620
I'm withdrawing from Training Box.

584
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,520
I won't work on this project anymore.

585
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,100
Do you know how vital this is to become Managing Director?

586
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,840
Are you sure you want to quit now?

587
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,860
That is my business,

588
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,060
not your concern.

589
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,881
The results are in.

590
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,121
It's breast cancer.

591
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:11,241
"Breast cancer"?

592
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:15,040
Although cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes,

593
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,160
there's still hope with prompt treatment.

594
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,397
Hello?

595
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:28,460
Are the results out?

596
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,900
How is it?

597
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,940
They're out.

598
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,121
Everything's fine.

599
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:33,902
I just finished up here.

600
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:34,980
I'll pick you up.

601
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,036
 Don't bother. 

602
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,504
Let's meet at the restaurant later.

603
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:39,364
I'm hanging up.

604
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,040
Do you remember this place?

605
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,440
Ming Mei.

606
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,120
Ming Mei?

607
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,260
Are you okay?

608
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,000
You seem distracted today.

609
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,620
Yes.

610
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,220
It's still the same as it was six years ago,

611
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,980
hasn't changed a bit.

612
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,320
We sat right here, and you told me

613
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,880
you wanted to become a successful business woman before 35,

614
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,020
then move to the United States.

615
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,980
You actually remember all that.

616
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,020
It's been six years.

617
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,420
You've achieved your dream.

618
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,720
I know you've never regretted that decision,

619
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,780
but I have.

620
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,420
Ming Mei...

621
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,120
I'm not feeling well.

622
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,460
I'm going to the restroom.
