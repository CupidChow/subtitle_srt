 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,860
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,450
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,660
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,090
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,140
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,220
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,820
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,580
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:49,750
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:57,850
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,200
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,910
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,160
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,070
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,500
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,260
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,030
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,550
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,800
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,380
   
   

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,480
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,776
   

25
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:42,380

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,540
This is for you.

28
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,240
Thanks.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,000
Come on in.

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,960
Nice place you've got here.

31
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,700
Have a seat.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,260
Sure.

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,520
Did you make all this?

34
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,340
I learned it recently.

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I wasn't sure if your taste had changed.

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,160
I made what you used to like.

37
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,820
Give it a try.

38
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,500
Thanks.

39
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,740
It tastes great.

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,020
Glad to hear that.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,140
You should have some, too.

42
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,880
Delicious.

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,120
- Yesterday, I... 
 - Today, I...

44
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,300
Go ahead.

45
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,980
I invited you here today

46
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,440
to say that I forgive you.

47
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,460
All these years, I couldn't let go of

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,700
our breakup.

49
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,360
I hated that our breakup had no explanation.

50
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,960
But I'll let it go now.

51
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,140
If you had told me back then,

52
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,020
I might not have broken up with you right away.

53
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,220
But eventually, we both would have suffered.

54
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,740
After all, I couldn't even handle owing Â¥200,000,

55
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,760
let alone Â¥20 million.

56
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,880
Tong Tong.

57
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,640
I thought of telling you the truth.

58
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,560
But when I recall  the day I came home

59
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,020
to find a disaster in my family,

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,860
then my mom said

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,280
she wished I hadn't returned,

62
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,020
that I should have my own life.

63
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,040
Then I thought,

64
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,960
you deserve your own life.

65
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,080
Thank you, Gan Yang.

66
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,020
What do you want to say?

67
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,480
Gan Yang,

68
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,460
let's just stay friends.

69
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,740
â™«  The time and time  â™«

70
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,640
â™«  Life and life  â™«

71
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:29,420
â™«  I had it once. I lost it though  â™«

72
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,200
 It sounds like he's had a tough time these years, too. 

73
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,940
 So what did he say about just being friends? 

74
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,980
He said...

75
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,460
it's impossible for him to be just friends with me.

76
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,660
Tong Tong, actually I went to see him.

77
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,740
I told him of your insomnia

78
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,580
 and to stay out of your life for good. 

79
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,080
 Now I think he kept you off Training Box Project 

80
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,020
due to that.

81
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,920
So that's how it was.

82
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,920
Did you tell him what happened after you two broke up?

83
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,680
No.

84
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,940
 Hey, why didn't you tell him? 

85
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,140
Tong Tong, you don't have to carry all burdens alone.

86
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,960
 You should let him know about that. 

87
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,299
I don't want him to know.

88
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:35,460
 Someone as kind as him would just blame himself. 

89
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,140
I don't even know what to say to you.

90
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,200
 Mom! 

91
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,340
 Mom. 

92
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,380
Hello, Wang Yi?

93
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
Let's talk when I return. I must go.

94
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,980
   

95
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,420
- Director Zhang. 
 - Take a seat.

96
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,520
When did you get here?

97
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,820
Just got back from Shanghai this morning.

98
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,420
I'm going to inspect our L.A. branch in two days.

99
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
Swamped doesn't even describe it.

100
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,640
Great power brings great responsibility.

101
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,220
You wanted to see me?

102
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,380
Here's the thing.

103
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,980
I now handle Training Box Project,

104
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,860
but you see I'm stretched too thin.

105
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,620
I reached out to Training Box.

106
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,600
They want you back onboard.

107
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,700
I...

108
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,000
But I remind you, Training Box's situation is messy.

109
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,080
Shareholders and investors majorly disagree.

110
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,980
It's understandable if you say no.

111
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,180
Coincidentally, Wang Group sent over this proposal.

112
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,800
They specifically requested you.

113
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,140
   

114
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,400
Here's my advice:

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,980
If you really don't want to go back,

116
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,600
just use the Wang Group Project to decline Training Box.

117
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,300
Director Zhang, can I consider and get back to you?

118
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,920
Of course.

119
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,527
Let me know once you've decided.

120
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:14,020
- Got it. 
 - Then I'll go.

121
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,740
Don't bother seeing me off.

122
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
- Think it through. 
 - Yes.

123
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,260
   

124
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,180
   

125
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,380
   

126
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,320
Sorry, I was held up at the office.

127
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,080
No worries.

128
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,280
If you're busy, you don't have to come.

129
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,060
I can grab a quick bite alone.

130
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,420
Absolutely not.

131
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,640
I still owe you for helping me at the bar.

132
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,680
And since you're in Hong Kong, I should at least play host,

133
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,220
even though I'm not a local.

134
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,420
What would you like to order?

135
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,980
You pick.

136
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,400
I don't feel like deciding today.

137
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,400
Does something bother you?

138
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,680
Can you help me figure it out?

139
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,940
There are two projects:

140
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,700
Project A is flawless and brand new.

141
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,640
Project B is an old one I poured my heart into.

142
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,480
Which would you choose?

143
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Which benefits you more?

144
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,540
Project A, I guess.

145
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,960
Then go with Project A.

146
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,080
But I want to pick Project B.

147
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,000
May I ask, what's your connection to it?

148
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,380
The second-largest shareholder is my ex.

149
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,520
So you're hung up on this project

150
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,240
because you want him back?

151
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,220
That's not it.

152
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,820
I really want this project to succeed.

153
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,640
Also, I...

154
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,540
want to contribute to his dream.

155
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Tell Gutong Securities

156
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,980
I want Ding Zhi Tong as Wang Group's long-term finance consultant.

157
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,360
Also, cancel all arrangements in Hong Kong.

158
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,300
I'll return to Shanghai tomorrow.

159
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,880
Any response from Gutong yet? 
    

160
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,660
- Not yet. 
 - Urge them.

161
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,440
Got it.

162
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,420
CEO Gan.

163
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,400
Just send me financial statements of the past three years.

164
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,160
CEO Gan.

165
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,100
 All right, cake time! 

166
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,060
- Really? 
 - Thanks.

167
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,920
And here's some coffee. Please distribute them.

168
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,020
- And these. 
 - Thanks.

169
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,960
- And these egg tarts. 
 - Thank you.

170
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,620
Here, take this. It looks good.

171
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,960
It's insanely hard to get.

172
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,320
- Do you want to try this? 
 - I'd rather have that.

173
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,240
Here, take this prettier rainbow one.

174
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Agreed. It does look good.

175
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,820
Sister Tong, want some coffee?

176
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,520
Who ordered all this?

177
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,560
CEO Gan did.

178
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,800
This pastry is only available in Xujiahui (Shanghai district).

179
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,060
You can't order it here.

180
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,840
Training Box people say CEO Gan rarely enters this floor.

181
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Why is he suddenly working here?

182
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
Probably for due diligence.

183
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,000
I think it's for Sister Tong.

184
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,160
Don't say that.

185
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,040
Not enough work to keep you busy?

186
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,400
Still have time for gossip?

187
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,932
Then give me Training Box's revenue report before tomorrow.

188
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,360
- I'll review it. 
 - Sister Tong, have mercy.

189
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,080
Get back to work.

190
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,120
   

191
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,760
   

192
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,580
   

193
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,120
   

194
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,500
   

195
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,520
   

196
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,500
   

197
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,900
   

198
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,240
   

199
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,360
   

200
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,580
   

201
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,380
"Just friends."

202
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,840
   

203
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,280
   

204
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,800
   

205
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,840
   

206
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,320
Read this document.

207
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,300
   

208
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,080
   

209
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,440
Here it is. The latest shock absorption and slip resistance data.

210
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,320
Leave it on my desk. I'll review it tomorrow morning.

211
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,960
- But we're in a hurry... 
 - No overtime tonight.

212
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,740
Everyone,

213
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,680
sorry about that.

214
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,320
Our company doesn't encourage overtime.

215
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,240
By the national initiative, we're saving energy.

216
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,480
Time to turn off lights.

217
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,800
Xu Chen Xi, I heard something funny.

218
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,760
Gan Yang actually said our company doesn't encourage overtime,

219
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,220
and we keep the national initiative.

220
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,740
Everyone, save your work and rest early.

221
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,580
 We're off work. 

222
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,780
- Let's hurry home. 
 - Let's go.

223
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,980
Tong Tong. 
    

224
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,560
Are you okay?

225
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm fine.

226
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,860
Did you sprain your ankle?

227
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
No.

228
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
Let's go; let's sit there for a bit.

229
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,680
Slow down.

230
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,320
Go easy.

231
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,020
Just sit for a bit.

232
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,460
You've scraped your skin.

233
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,880
Really, I'm fine.

234
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,200
New shoes are in the company showroom.

235
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,080
I'll get them now. Wait for me.

236
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,720
Wait for me!

237
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,660
I'm back.

238
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,140
Here.

239
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,380
- Come on. 
 - I can do it myself.

240
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,220
Let me help.

241
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,600
Come on.

242
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,480
How are they? Do they fit?

243
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,420
I recall you wear size 37.5 sneakers.

244
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,580
Thanks. Perfect fit.

245
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,240
How much are these shoes?

246
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,360
I'll pay you.

247
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,880
Don't worry about it.

248
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,480
Consider it your due diligence on our product.

249
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,440
No need to be so precise.

250
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
With the spray painting,

251
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
Â¥1,000 should cover it, right?

252
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,840
I...

253
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,480
   

254
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,260
You still have my number.

255
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,640
I have a good memory.

256
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,000
I recall important clients' numbers.

257
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,220
I remember yours, too.

258
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,520
Thanks.

259
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,480
I have to go now.

260
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,360
What are you doing here?

261
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,440
What's wrong?

262
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,600
My stomach is acting up.

263
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
I forgot to eat dinner.

264
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,080
How did you suddenly get a stomachache?

265
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,800
Why didn't you eat?

266
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,960
I'll take you to the hospital.

267
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,040
Got any food in your car?

268
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,160
My car... I don't keep food in my car.

269
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,200
Do you want to go nearby for a quick bite?

270
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,960
Don't bother.

271
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,560
A supermarket is ahead on the left.

272
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,160
We can buy food there.

273
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,000
All right.

274
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,120
Does your stomach still hurt?

275
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,580
How about eating bread?

276
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,480
Don't bother. I'm feeling better.

277
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,180
Really?

278
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,060
- Then we... 
 - We're already here.

279
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,160
Can you accompany me to shop?

280
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,760
I'll grab groceries to cook at home.

281
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,000
I think... you barely ate, too.

282
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Would you like to join me?

283
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,880
One of these.

284
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,080
And this one.

285
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,880
This too. Do you want anything else?

286
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,520
- I don't need anything... 
 - Need milk, right?

287
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,800
Let me check. Okay.

288
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,240
- I still have some at... 
 - Let's get two.

289
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,580
Let's get three.

290
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Do you want anything else?

291
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,080
No, I'm good.

292
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,960
Let's check that aisle.

293
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,360
 I was thinking after paying off the debts, 

294
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,800
 I want to eat with you, run with you, 

295
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,180
 watch movies with you, and enjoy life with you. 

296
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,040
Tong Tong, where's the oyster sauce?

297
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,960
Should be on the right side of the fridge. Check there.

298
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,900
I'll get it for you.

299
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,120
Gan Yang.

300
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,040
I feel you tricked me.

301
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,360
What did I trick you out of?

302
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,880
First you faked a stomachache to get in my car,

303
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,160
then refused to go to the hospital,

304
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
insisted on the supermarket,

305
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,240
and ended up making me buy all this stuff.

306
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,020
That's unfair.

307
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,680
You picked every single item yourself.

308
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,760
Remember?

309
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,560
You wanted ten packs of instant noodles.

310
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,880
I talked you out of it.

311
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,040
I mean you lured me into buying so much

312
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,200
that I can't carry them alone.

313
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,320
So downstairs, you said I couldn't carry them all,

314
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,360
then helped me bring it up.

315
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,400
It's normal for me to help you with that.

316
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,380
You're welcome.

317
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,400
Then you had stomachache again at my door

318
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,080
and insisted on making noodles.

319
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,720
I really thought you wanted noodles.

320
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,560
Now look, you're making soup.

321
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,560
I'm talking to you!

322
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,840
It's a bit bland.

323
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,640
You know how particular I am about food.

324
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,720
Homemade noodles require soup.

325
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,200
Makes perfect sense, right?

326
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,940
Yes. Everything makes sense.

327
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,000
Then kicking out a liar like you makes sense.

328
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:35,500
Stop chopping.

329
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,880
- Go away. 
 - Tong Tong.

330
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,800
- Out. 
 - Tong Tong.

331
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,572
- Tong Tong. 
 - Get out or I'll call police.

332
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:44,320
Tong Tong.

333
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,860
- Bye bye. 
 - Tong Tong.

334
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,960
Tong Tong.

335
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,560
I haven't even changed my shoes.

336
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,040
And I'm wearing your apron.

337
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,200
Your shoes. Give me back my apron.

338
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,920
Okay.

339
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,560
Tong Tong.

340
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,080
The soup needs ten more minutes.

341
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,120
You bought so much at once.

342
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,960
Refrigerate leftovers, especially the veggies...

343
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,680
I know. Just go.

344
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,741
Tong Tong, won't you invite me for a bite?

345
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:16,780
I worked on this meal, you know.

346
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,720
No way! You wish.

347
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,560
Go home.

348
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,240
Tong Tong.

349
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,920
I've waited so many years.

350
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,040
One meal won't make a difference.

351
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,360
Gan Yang, you...

352
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,460
What Gan Yang?

353
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,980
It smells good.

354
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,060
So much food.

355
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,160
Gan Yang made these?

356
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,920
You brought wine?

357
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,560
How did Deng Bo Ting upset you?

358
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,440
I don't know what got into him.

359
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,920
He already agreed to property division.

360
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,840
Now he suddenly wants an extra Â¥10 million.

361
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,880
 Fine. 

362
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,420
 Ten million it is. 

363
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,280
 This is huge. Don't you want to think it over more?  

364
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,040
 You're right about one thing. 

365
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,000
 I love my career more than you. 

366
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,040
 Take the ten million and leave with your mistress. 

367
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,600
 Stay out of my sight. 

368
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,280
 I've already broken up with her. 

369
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,600
 I couldn't care less about you two. 

370
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
 Then Â¥10 million isn't enough. 

371
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,820
 I want Â¥20 million. 

372
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,360
 Deng Bo Ting, you think this is a market? 

373
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,660
 Since when do you bargain like this? 

374
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,640
 I don't want a divorce. 

375
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,560
 Let's get back together. 

376
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,720
 Think of when we built Matching in college together... 

377
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,680
 You forgot us first! 

378
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,120
 Reconciliation is off the table. 

379
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,360
 All right. Then at least think of our daughter. 

380
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,600
 She needs her father. 

381
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,720
 Why didn't you consider your daughter before cheating? 

382
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,320
 Deng Bo Ting, 

383
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,040
 don't make me despise you. 

384
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,960
 Twenty million 

385
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,920
 or I'm not signing. 

386
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,940
 Do you know what? 

387
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,700
He dared to use Matching and Yu Lin to threaten me.

388
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,720
He knows they're your weak spots.

389
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,200
Matching and Yu Lin were created by you both.

390
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,560
What was he thinking before?

391
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,720
Now we're divorcing,

392
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,740
he suddenly wants to cherish them.

393
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,760
Exactly.

394
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,560
People regret only after loss.

395
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,820
What was he thinking before?

396
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,440
What about you and Gan Yang?

397
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,320
What's the story there?

398
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,200
Bankruptcy,

399
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,320
debt, restricted life,

400
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,880
not everyone can handle awful pressure.

401
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,760
He even faced potential jail time back then.

402
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,000
Think about it.

403
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,360
With your personality, what would you choose?

404
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
I would face it with him.

405
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,360
But who knows if we'd be happy together

406
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,640
or just make each other miserable.

407
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,520
I might have gone insane.

408
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,840
So now that you're back...

409
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,720
Same thinking as before.

410
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,960
I'll wrap up this project and leave.

411
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm almost thirty.

412
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,480
There's more to life than romance.

413
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,520
Once Gan Yang

414
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,640
realizes I'm not responding,

415
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,780
he will give up pursuing me.

416
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,580
   

417
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,880
 You can start eating when the cheese melts. 

418
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,040
 I specially developed this method. 

419
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,760
 Try it. 

420
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,780
 Then I will try it. 

421
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,920
Be happy.

422
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,340
Ding Zhi Tong.

423
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
What a coincidence. You also go for night runs?

424
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,701
Yes, I started recently.

425
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:18,100
- Want to join me? 
 - Sure.

426
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,640
I've never told you what I do.

427
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,440
Actually, I...

428
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,840
What's wrong?

429
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,760
That's CEO Lin from Qidu Tech.

430
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,120
My boss has always wanted to meet him.

431
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,320
Can't believe I just ran into him here.

432
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,960
Should we go say hi?

433
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,240
Dressed like this to say hi?

434
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,000
That's obviously a private club.

435
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
We can't just randomly walk in.

436
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Let's give it a try.

437
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,020
Thank you.

438
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:20,800
See? We're in.

439
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,120
Hand over the real estate project entirely

440
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,520
to Director Zhang.

441
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,160
It's beneficial for them and us,

442
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,360
a win-win situation.

443
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,380
- Right? 
 - Sure, no problem.

444
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,240
Wow, look who's here.

445
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,960
To what do we owe the pleasure?

446
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,680
Just out running with a friend and passed by.

447
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,660
This is my friend, Ding Zhi Tong,

448
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,120
the best director at Gutong Securities.

449
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm Ding Zhi Tong of Gutong Securities.

450
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,625
Chairman Wang's friend looks young and promising.

451
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,840
Chairman Wang, you brought a friend?

452
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
- Chairman Wang... 
 -  It's CEO Zhang from Youyi. 

453
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,520
 Plus CEO Lin from Qidu. 

454
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,180
 They're big shots who keep a low profile. 

455
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,205
 Is he Wang Sen? 

456
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,820
 Send it to me later. 

457
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,680
 Sure, thank you. Make sure to check it out. 

458
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,160
So if I'm not mistaken,

459
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,120
Chairman Wang, you investigated my history with Gan Yang

460
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,080
before assigning me to Training Box Project.

461
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,600
I was right about you.

462
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,700
You're very smart.

463
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,680
And our first meeting was planned, right?

464
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,360
I admit, at first,

465
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,360
I wanted to use your relationship with Gan Yang.

466
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,640
Then I realized

467
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,520
you're even smarter and more capable than I thought.

468
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,080
So I believe even without your relationship to Gan Yang,

469
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,840
you could still secure Training Box Project.

470
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,600
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

471
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Actually, I wanted to reveal my identity to you today.

472
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,000
I sincerely want to be friends with you.

473
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,560
So did you lie to me about anything else?

474
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,640
Nothing.

475
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,420
Thank you for your honesty.

476
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,165
But if there's a next time, you can be only a client,

477
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:01,325
not my friend.

478
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,460
I don't think

479
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,420
anyone has dared talk to me like this in years.

480
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,520
Anyway, thanks for helping me

481
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,800
meet so many potential clients tonight.

482
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,360
You are welcome.

483
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,340
Then I'll be going.

484
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,540
Why aren't you asleep yet?

485
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,860
   

486
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,060
Hello?

487
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,765
Why aren't you asleep?

488
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:39,165
Why did you send equations?

489
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,700
Although I got full marks in advanced math in college,

490
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,720
this stuff still puts me to sleep every time.

491
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,320
So I sent it to you if it helps you, too.

492
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,360
Sorry.

493
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,280
I also got full marks in math.

494
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,140
This stuff gets me too excited, and I can't sleep.

495
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
Then maybe an English philosophy book,

496
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,180
it should put you to sleep.

497
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:05,754
Hold on.

498
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,660
Go to bed. Don't worry about me.

499
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,266
I can't sleep, either.

500
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:16,541
And since I'm the one who kept you up...

501
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,080
I should take responsibility.

502
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,120
Here we go.

503
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,620
Chapter One.

504
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,160
The Rise of Greek Civilization.

505
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
In all history,

506
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,800
nothing is so surprising or so difficult to account for

507
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,420
as the sudden rise of civilization in Greece.

508
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,760
Much of what makes civilization had already existed

509
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,960
for thousands of years in Egypt

510
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,260
and had spread thence to neighboring countries.

511
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,280
What they achieved in art and literature

512
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,960
is familiar to everyone.

513
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,160
 What they did in the purely intellectual realm 

514
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,460
 is even more exceptional. 

515
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:37,730
Good morning.

516
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,820
Morning.

517
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,840
I bought you tofu pudding and dumplings at Baozheng Road,

518
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,800
your old favorites.

519
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,520
No free meals.

520
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
You should eat them, CEO Gan.

521
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,700
Actually, I want to hitch a ride to the office.

522
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,660
We go the same way.

523
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,340
Give me a ride, please?

524
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,825
Sure, let's eat then get in the car.

525
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,565
All right.

526
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:30,820
I'll go get tissues from the car.

527
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,520
Okay.

528
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:41,660

- Gan Yang! 
 - Yes?

530
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,700
Bye bye!

531
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,540
Hey! 
    

532
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,880
   

533
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,720
   

534
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,565
Keep Ding Zhi Tong's schedule packed.

535
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:10,514
Make sure she is busy as our consultant

536
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,755
and stays away from Training Box.

537
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:13,550
Yes, Sir.

538
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,690
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

539
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:26,675
â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

540
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:34,825
â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

541
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:41,062
â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

542
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:48,125
â™«  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  â™«

543
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:54,950
â™«  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  â™«

544
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:01,950
â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

545
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:09,025
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

546
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:16,025
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

547
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:22,667
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

548
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:29,852
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

549
00:40:29,852 --> 00:40:36,885
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™« 
 â™«  And every time I think of it  â™«

550
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:43,781
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

551
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:50,770
â™«  Someone held my hand against all odds  â™«

552
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:57,325
â™«  Now Iâ€™m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  â™«

553
00:40:57,325 --> 00:41:04,500
â™«  Along the road we used to run through  â™«

554
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:17,300
â™«  There is always the someone I never once forgot  â™«
