 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:09,869
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart 

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,663
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:21,795
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,043
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:32,426
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:35,020
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:40,584
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:49,756
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,852
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,304
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:07,012
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:11,168
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,170
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,870
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,501
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,265
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,036
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,400
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,380
   
   

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,480
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,480
   

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,800
   

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:54,890


27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,040
The food is here.

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,080
Shall we eat?

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm a bit tired.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,940
I want to go back and rest first.

31
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,120
All right.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,820
I'll take you.

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,720
Great.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,160
Mom, will you always be with me?

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,860
Why the sudden question?

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,980
My classmate's grandpa passed away.

37
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,140
They say he went to Heaven and won't return.

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,160
Of course, I will.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,580
I will always be with you, okay?

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,740
Pinky promise then.

41
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,480
I want to be with Mom forever, never to be apart.

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,720
Deal.

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,860
My sweet Yu Lian.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,920
I also want to be with you forever,

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,660
never to be apart. All right?

46
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,680
Time for bed.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,621
I'll sleep with you tonight.

48
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,301
Lie down.

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
- Dr. Zhao, I've sent you the test report. 
  - Received. 

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,860
Please review the diagnosis.

51
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,800
 No problem. 

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,200
All right.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,280
Thanks for your help, Dr. Zhao.

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,900
 No worries. 

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,380
Have you made up your mind?

56
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,500
This project is in its final stage.

57
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you sure you want to quit now?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,820
Then I can't help you with the promotion to MD. 
    

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm sure.

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,640
I respect your choice.

61
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,180
Thank you, Director Zhang.

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,260
Ding Zhi Tong.

63
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,560
What a coincidence.

64
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,580
It's raining. We can't go for a run.

65
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,780
Congratulations on your promotion to MD.

66
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,960
LT is withdrawing from the Training Box Project.

67
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,860
How funny.

68
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm withdrawing, too.

69
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,300
But you just finished due diligence.

70
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,660
How come it's so sudden?

71
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,840
What about your promotion?

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,580
No rush.

73
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,200
There will be other opportunities.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,960
I can take it slow.

75
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,460
So if you're not doing Training Box Project,

76
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,360
will you go back to Hong Kong?

77
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,620
Not immediately.

78
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,220
I have some things to see to.

79
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,860
What things?

80
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,380
Have you sold all the backlogged materials?

81
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,860
Not yet.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,260
I approached several buyers at once.

83
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,400
But their offers are too low.

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm still working on it.

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,760
What's up?

86
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,440
Let's collaborate.

87
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll connect you with buyers.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,640
After all these years in the securities company,

89
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,620
I've built decent connections.

90
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,780
Deal.

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,240
Since we've known each other for years,

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,320
can you ease the consulting fee?

93
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,760
I'll think about it.

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,980
I'm in such a tough spot. Will you really charge me?

95
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,460
Absolutely.

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,360
Don't you remember? I'm a money-grubber.

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,860
That's funny.

98
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Now, so am I.

99
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Wish you a pleasant cooperation.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,800
Me, too.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,600
Yes, see these cherry tomatoes.

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,420
Feed me.

103
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,320
- Is it good? 
 - Yes, amazing.

104
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,860
I knew you'd like it.

105
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,640
Try this one then.

106
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,300
Try this.

107
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,820
Ding Zhi Tong.

108
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,660
- Does it taste good? 
 - Yes, delicious.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
All right, speak. When did you two start?

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,580
Just a couple days ago.

111
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,900
Wang Yi, did I do something wrong?

112
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,960
Why are you treating me like this?

113
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,180
- No, it's just that we... 
 - I'm not asking you.

114
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,220
Answer me!

115
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,720
Gan Yang.

116
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,820
How could they do this to me?

117
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,320
What do they mean by this?

118
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,000
Seriously, what do they mean?

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,540
Enough! We just didn't tell you we're dating.

120
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,780
Why are you acting like we cheated on you?

121
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,200
Exactly. Shouldn't you b-be... happy for us?

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,840
My two closest friends are dating behind my back!

123
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,280
How would you feel if it were you?

124
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
- We... 
 - We...

125
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
- Would you be angry? 
 - Sure.

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,580
Would you?

127
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,740
Would you?

128
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,460
- We... 
 - We...

129
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,120
You what?

130
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,580
Yes. We're together now.

131
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,700
We're dating.

132
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,820
What can you do about it?

133
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,200
That's right.

134
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,140
What can you do about it?

135
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,540
Fine.

136
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,700
Waiter!

137
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,600
Two portions of your best dishes to go.

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
- All of them? 
 - All of them. Put it on their tab!

139
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,040
- All right. 
 - Wait, all of them?

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,460
- Hey. 
 - Yes, two portions of everything.

141
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,760
Can you two even finish all that?

142
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,340
None of your business.

143
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,840
- All right, okay. 
 - Fine.

144
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,100
As long as you're happy.

145
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,120
- Are you laughing? 
 - Whatever makes you happy.

146
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,900
You're laughing, too!

147
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,060
What do you mean by this?

148
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,460
Now you're kissing?

149
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,600
Do it again.

150
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,180
Do it again. I dare you!

151
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,780
- All right. 
 - Still kissing?

152
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,440
- Stop it. 
 - Stop watching.

153
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,020
Let's not watch, out of sight, out of mind.

154
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,440
It's okay. Stop watching.

155
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,920
Out of sight, out of mind.

156
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,820
Oh, come on, you two.

157
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,500
   

158
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,400
   

159
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,400
   

160
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,040
Chairman Wang, congratulations on getting what you wanted

161
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,000
and securing Training Box.

162
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,680
CEO Gan, thanks for your concession.

163
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,720
Hope you won't regret your decision.

164
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,980
Don't worry, Chairman Wang.

165
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,800
What I deem truly important,

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,700
I will never let it go.

167
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,380
It's funny.

168
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,700
I always get what I want.

169
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,620
Chairman, I've contacted all the companies Director Ding reached out to.

170
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,980
They've agreed not to purchase LT's materials.

171
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,160
Got it.

172
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,500
Chairman, I don't understand one thing.

173
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,640
Are you wondering that since LT withdrew from Training Box

174
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,500
and has nothing to do with Wang's,

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,100
why I am still targeting them?

176
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,400
Yes.

177
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,360
Do you know why Gan Yang left Ding Zhi Tong six years ago?

178
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,420
Because his family's company was ¥200 million in debt,

179
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,620
on the verge of bankruptcy.

180
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,600
If...

181
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,300
I put him in the same position as six years ago,

182
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,740
no...

183
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,160
even worse than six years ago...

184
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,060
what choice do you think he will make?

185
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,300
I see.

186
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,980
He gave up Ding Zhi Tong once.

187
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,420
He will give her up a second time.

188
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,300
I will take my leave.

189
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,420
 These companies seem to have all banded together. 

190
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,820
They were all very interested before,

191
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,540
but now suddenly no one is buying.

192
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,280
Is someone targeting LT?

193
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,060
You noticed, too.

194
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,500
Is it Wang's?

195
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,180
Why would he come after you?

196
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,760
You've already withdrawn from Training Box.

197
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,060
He wants something more precious from me.

198
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,280
"Something more precious"?

199
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,920
He won't get his way.

200
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,800
That's good.

201
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,800
I plan to move the company out of Shanghai.

202
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
"Move out of Shanghai"?

203
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,980
Then where to?

204
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,320
Putian,

205
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,300
my hometown.

206
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,500
LT's shoe factory is there.

207
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,100
That's where LT started.

208
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,500
When are you moving?

209
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,400
I plan to make the moving announcement today.

210
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,500
Putian is too far from Shanghai.

211
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,720
Will this cause a mass shift in staff

212
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
and trigger widespread resignations?

213
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,260
For now, it's the only way I can think of

214
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,280
that's most cost-efficient.

215
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,900
The production line must keep running no matter what.

216
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,660
Maybe you should reconsider.

217
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,380
I've reached out to other buyers.

218
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,900
I should hear back soon.

219
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,520
Don't bother.

220
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,340
The funding gap this time is too large.

221
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,900
Regardless if sell the materials or not...

222
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,340
we have to move out of Shanghai.

223
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,520
But...

224
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,180
Don't worry.

225
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,280
I believe we will be back soon.

226
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,580
   

227
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,720
What's going on?

228
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,500
Everyone is here today.

229
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Why did they suddenly gather everyone?

230
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,980
No idea. With such a big group,

231
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,940
it must be important.

232
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,460
Obviously.

233
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,140
But what exactly?

234
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,620
Right, what's the important thing?

235
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,780
Exactly.

236
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,540
Are layoffs coming?

237
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,800
 "Layoffs"? 

238
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,820
- No way. 
 - Why not?

239
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
Everyone, quiet down.

240
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,140
Listen up.

241
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,580
I believe you all know the company's situation.

242
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,780
Thanks for your hard work over the years.

243
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,260
After discussion,

244
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,900
we've decided to move the company to Putian.

245
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,460
 To Putian? 

246
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,200
- That's so far. It's in Fujian. 
 - Exactly.

247
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
That's so far.

248
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,360
- Right. Why is it so sudden? 
 - When can we come back?

249
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,860
Exactly. Will we get pay cuts if we move?

250
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,920
Indeed.

251
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,260
Why is this happening?

252
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,640
I understand everyone's concerns.

253
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,620
If you choose to go or not is entirely up to you.

254
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,740
Should we go?

255
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,380
We promise that everyone

256
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,620
who goes will have their salary and benefits unchanged.

257
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,900
My family lives here.

258
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,620
What if we don't go?

259
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,140
Those who stay will get severance pay.

260
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,420
We will give recommendation letters

261
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,040
to help place all in other companies.

262
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,900
Please raise your hand if you're willing to move to Putian with us.

263
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,020
Don't feel pressured.

264
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,980
Whatever you decide,

265
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,600
we respect everyone's decision.

266
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,280
I'll go.

267
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,560
Me, too.

268
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,178
- I'm in. 
 - Count me in.

269
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:13,880
- I'll go. 
 - Me, too.

270
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,014
- I'm in. 
 - Count me in.

271
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,720
Thank you for trusting in me.

272
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,240
I promise everyone that within a year,

273
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,440
our company will move back to Shanghai!

274
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,620
 Great! 

275
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:05,780
 - Let's do it! 
 - Let's go! 

276
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,860
 We can do it. 

277
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,940
- We can do it. 
 - Let's go!

278
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,100
Thanks, everyone, for your support in LT.

279
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,500
In the next few days, let's pack up

280
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,900
and prepare to move to Putian.

281
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,420
Just let me know if you need help.

282
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,320
After we all move to Putian,

283
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,860
- let's get work done! 
 -  Let's get it done! 

284
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,400
 - Let's kill it! 
 - Let's do it! 

285
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,020
 Let's do it! 

286
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,740
 - Give it your all! 
 - Go! 

287
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,600
   

288
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,860
How come you're here?

289
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,040
Did you come to see me?

290
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,060
Where are you going? I'll go with you.

291
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,780
No, thanks. What I'll do is fairly wild.

292
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,300
You sure you want in?

293
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,500
Absolutely.

294
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,340
Bring it on.

295
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,920
Hello, a glass of water, please.

296
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,359
Hey, Beautiful, I've been watching you all night.

297
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,500
May I have the honor of a drink with you?

298
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,360
Sure. Cheers.

299
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,900
Sorry. She doesn't drink.

300
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,280
What are you doing?

301
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,420
My fun isn't done yet.

302
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,680
I booked the whole place.

303
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,860
Let me dance some more.

304
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,960
Where are you taking me?

305
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,240
Wait, what are you doing?

306
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,440
I'm not done having fun yet.

307
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,780
I want to go back for fun.

308
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,980
Ming Mei, you're not actually enjoying this.

309
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,000
Others are having a blast, but you're not happy at all.

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
I am.

311
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,100
Remember what I told you last time?

312
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,300
Yes.

313
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,640
You said you regretted it.

314
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,300
What?

315
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,240
Do you regret not stopping me six years ago?

316
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,900
No.

317
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,700
Then what?

318
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,820
At the airport back then,

319
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,700
I wanted to say I'd wait for you.

320
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,160
But in the end, I didn't say anything.

321
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,140
I've never regretted letting you go.

322
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,300
I wanted you to become whom you always wanted to be.

323
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,640
If I had another chance,

324
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,000
I will certainly tell you,

325
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,020
"I'll wait for you forever."

326
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,540
No matter what happens,

327
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,720
I'll always be there for you.

328
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,540
You...

329
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,560
So don't be afraid.

330
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,200
I know of your illness

331
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,280
and have already contacted the doctor.

332
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,500
I custom made this ring just for you.

333
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,120
Three diamonds.

334
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,840
The main one is you,

335
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,320
and the little purple ones are me and Yu Lin.

336
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,540
We will always be with you.

337
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,400
We will always be there for you.

338
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,180
Song Ming Mei.

339
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,000
Will you marry me?

340
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
I will.

341
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,000
Or how many six-year cycles must I wait?

342
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,358
Coming!

343
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,038
Who is it?

344
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,680
Tong Tong?

345
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,220
I found a buyer.

346
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,420
What?

347
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,780
Weilan agreed to the purchase.

348
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,020
They'll buy all your materials at the agreed price,

349
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,440
but payment will be in installments.

350
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,020
Really?

351
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,840
That's wonderful, Tong Tong!

352
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm leaving.

353
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,640
Tong Tong!

354
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,780
Tong Tong.

355
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,900
What's wrong?

356
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,160
I'm just tired.

357
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,760
How about breakfast together tomorrow morning?

358
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,740
Tong Tong.

359
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,580
 Ding Zhi Tong, you can't do this. 

360
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,460
   

361
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:48,280
 Hi, Tong Tong. 

362
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,260
What are you doing?

363
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,420
Still sleeping?

364
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,700
What is it?

365
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,900
Open the door for me.

366
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm at your doorstep.

367
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,060
I made breakfast for you.

368
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,900
Gan Yang.

369
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,540
Let's not see each other again.

370
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,727
Why?

371
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,740
What happened?

372
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,580
Let's talk in person.

373
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,060
I'm not home.

374
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,972
I have to leave Shanghai for a few days.

375
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,180
 Where are you now? 

376
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,440
 - I'll come to you. 
 - No need. 

377
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,560
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

378
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,840
I don't have anything to say.

379
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,620
I've said all I wanted to say.

380
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,760
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

381
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,200
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

382
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,560
Then what was last night's kiss about?

383
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,940
Your feelings for me are clear.

384
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
Tong Tong,

385
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
what do you fear?

386
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,440
I've already contacted the buyer.

387
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,300
You just handle the rest.

388
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,300
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

389
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,000
Gan Yang.

390
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,980
Goodbye.

391
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,100
Hey, Tong Tong, don't hang up.

392
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,646
 Hello? 

393
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:34,710
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

394
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,540
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

395
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:49,420
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

396
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:56,300
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

397
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:02,850
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

398
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:10,160
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

399
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,800
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫

400
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,760
Don't you have your own office?

401
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,160
Go elsewhere to show off your affection.

402
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,580
Like we want to be here.

403
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,000
Bro, everyone is packing up.

404
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,500
This is the only quiet place left.

405
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,020
What's wrong?

406
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,640
Didn't Ding Zhi Tong already resolve the materials issue?

407
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,040
What's going on between you two?

408
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,080
Who am I supposed to ask?

409
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,420
You two haven't gotten back together yet?

410
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,680
You'd better hurry.

411
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,380
We're leaving for Putian soon.

412
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,660
It will be very inconvenient for her to come visit you.

413
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,040
Like I don't want to.

414
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,020
Really? Did Ding Zhi Tong say no?

415
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,140
That doesn't make sense.

416
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,440
You two were inseparable the other day.

417
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,560
She helped you sell the materials and even quit the Training Box Project.

418
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,440
She clearly still likes you.

419
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,120
You all think so, too?

420
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,900
Of course, she does.

421
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,300
With my female intuition, for sure.

422
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,300
She has feelings for me but keeps pushing me away.

423
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,320
What does that mean?

424
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,440
No idea.

425
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,920
But it makes no sense.

426
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,060
You've already cleared up the past.

427
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,520
She shouldn't be treating you like this.

428
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Do you not know a secret of Ding Zhi Tong's?

429
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,680
Secret I don't know...

430
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,440
I must not know a past event.

431
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,020
Song Ming Mei.

432
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,040
Gan Yang?

433
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,980
What are you doing here?

434
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,380
Are you sure you want to know?

435
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,000
Even if it means you two will never be together after you find out?

436
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,340
What exactly happened?

437
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,520
Answer my question first.

438
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,460
I know she's been suffering lately.

439
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,520
But if it's due to me,

440
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,700
whatever it is,

441
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,320
I don't want her to carry it alone.

442
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,000
That answer proves she didn't love the wrong man.

443
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,160
Can you tell me now?

444
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,120
Tong Tong kept saying not to tell you this.

445
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,640
If you had asked me earlier, I wouldn't tell you.

446
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,460
But so much occurred lately.

447
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,440
I believe we should live in the moment.

448
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,660
You never know which will come knocking first: tomorrow or tragedy.

449
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,380
What do you mean?

450
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,500
After you broke up, events happened to Tong Tong.

451
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,840
Do you know where she is now?

452
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,820
No.

453
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,060
She's in her hometown

454
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,360
visiting her mother's grave.

455
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,860
When did that happen?

456
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,540
Remember when she went to Putian to find you?

457
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,200
 When you broke up with her, that day her mother died. 

458
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,640
 She didn't get to meet her mother one last time. 

459
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,720
 Losing her closest family destroyed her. 

460
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,960
 She locked herself away, starving and silent for days. 

461
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,360
 I was so worried, but I was stuck overseas. 

462
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,180
 Feng Sheng was her lifeline then. 

463
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,520
 When she fainted at home, he found her in time 

464
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,920
 and took her to the hospital. 

465
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,160
 Later, she accepted his proposal from gratitude. 

466
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,560
 But when she knew she couldn't love him, 

467
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,800
 she ended the engagement 

468
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,400
 and left for Hong Kong alone. 

469
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,500
 And you know the rest. 

470
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,400
   

471
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,200
Aunty,

472
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,780
I'm sorry.

473
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,580
I came to visit you late.

474
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,160
Back then, I thought breaking up with Tong Tong

475
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,980
was to save her,

476
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
but I didn't know so much happened

477
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,420
that she kept blaming herself

478
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,920
and felt guilty until now.

479
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,400
I'm sorry.

480
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,340
It's all my fault.

481
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,160
Tong Tong,

482
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm sorry.

483
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,940
Because of me, you've endured so much these years.

484
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,980
On the night we split up,

485
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,160
after I left your place,

486
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,800
I planned to go straight home.

487
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,900
But it was very late.

488
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,180
There were no return buses.

489
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,760
I had to stay in Putian for the night,

490
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,560
to catch the first bus the next morning.

491
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,400
Then I spiked a fever.

492
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,660
 Hello, Mom? 

493
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,440
 Tong Tong! 

494
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,100
 Didn't you say you're coming home? 

495
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,360
 Why didn't you answer the phone all night? 

496
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
 I was worried sick. 

497
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,620
 I've got a fever. 

498
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,480
 How did you get a fever? 

499
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
 Where are you? 

500
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,040
 It's okay. 

501
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,560
 I'll be home soon. 

502
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,220
 Tong Tong? 

503
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,260
 Tong Tong! 

504
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,600
She must have been really worried.

505
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,800
She couldn't reach me when she needed me most.

506
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,520
Mom.

507
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,060
I'm sorry.

508
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,580
The neighbor found her the next morning.

509
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,400
Then she was taken to the hospital.

510
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,800
But when I woke up,

511
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,960
it was already noon the next day.

512
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,823
Thank goodness you're awake, Young Lady.

513
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:47,320
You scared me to death.

514
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,860
I thought you were dead.  Are you okay?

515
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,420
What's the date today?

516
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,760
Well, the thirteenth.

517
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,520
You were supposed to check out yesterday.

518
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,920
I'm glad I came in to look.

519
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,180
When I came in, I saw you fainted here.

520
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,680
It scared me to death.

521
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,320
Where's my phone?

522
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,200
It's charging right here.

523
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,020
I was going to call your family,

524
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,040
but your phone was off.

525
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,480
Okay, I'm glad you're awake.

526
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
I'll get back to work.

527
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,360
Remember to extend your stay later.

528
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,180
   

529
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:20,720
- Hello? 
  - Ding Zhi Tong, come to the hospital now. 

530
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,580
 Something happened to your mother. 

531
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,440
Tong Tong!

532
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,920
Your mother...

533
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,980
Mom!

534
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,440
Mom.

535
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,560
 I rushed to the hospital as fast as I could, 

536
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,480
but I still didn't get to

537
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,800
meet her one last time.

538
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,180
Tong Tong,

539
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,720
I just learned all this.

540
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,400
If back then,

541
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,400
I had been honest with you,

542
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,800
instead of breaking up with you...

543
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,220
none of this would have happened.

544
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,080
I did blame you for a time.

545
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,180
If you hadn't suddenly broken up with me...

546
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,680
none of this would have happened.

547
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,460
But then I realized that blaming you

548
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,280
was just my avoiding the truth.

549
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,140
It had nothing to do with you at all.

550
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,980
In the end,

551
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,660
it's all my fault.

552
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,700
Ding Zhi Tong,

553
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
this wasn't on you.

554
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,180
You can't keep shouldering all the guilt.

555
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,380
The year after we broke up,

556
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,940
I rejected everything related to you.

557
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,700
I feared triggering memories.

558
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,800
Until we met again later,

559
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,820
I repeatedly told myself to hate you,

560
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,060
but I just couldn't do it.

561
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,320
I also tried convincing myself to let go of my grudges

562
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,520
and give us another chance,

563
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,140
but I still couldn't do it.

564
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,900
So you chose to keep all these from me

565
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,100
to spare me the same guilt you carried.

566
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,400
Tong Tong,

567
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,400
does this mean we really can't go back now?

568
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:32,010


569
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,770
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

570
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,615
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

571
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:50,865
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

572
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:57,002
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

573
00:42:57,002 --> 00:43:04,165
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

574
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:11,090
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

575
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:18,090
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

576
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:25,065
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

577
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:32,165
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

578
00:43:32,165 --> 00:43:38,707
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

579
00:43:38,707 --> 00:43:45,992
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

580
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:53,025
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

581
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:59,921
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

582
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:06,810
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

583
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:13,465
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

584
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:20,640
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

585
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:30,940
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
