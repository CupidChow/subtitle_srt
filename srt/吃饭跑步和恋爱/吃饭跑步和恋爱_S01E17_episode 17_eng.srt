 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,869
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,563
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:21,995
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,043
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:32,326
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:34,920
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:40,584
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:49,756
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,852
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,204
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:06,812
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,168
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,070
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,401
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,265
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,036
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,579
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:31,492
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,380
   
   

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,480
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,230

Ding Zhi Tong!

27
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,260
Ding Zhi Tong.

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,340
Ding Zhi Tong.

29
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,960
What's wrong?

30
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,780
Ding Zhi Tong, wake up.

31
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,800
You're back.

32
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,820
But I don't want you anymore.

33
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,460
Ding Zhi Tong! What's happening?

34
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,100
Ding Zhi Tong.

35
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,860
Why am I here?

36
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,900
Tong Tong. You're awake.

37
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,800
This is the hospital. You fainted.

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,940
The doctor said it was due to excess stress.

39
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,660
I need to keep myself busy.

40
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,620
Otherwise, I'll lose my mind.

41
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,719
I want to be discharged.

42
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,080
You can't. The doctor said you must stay for observation.

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,220
I've already taken care of your leave at work.

44
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,860
I want to go home.

45
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,380
Listen to me.

46
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,420
You're a patient now. Your health comes first.

47
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,680
I can do whatever you need me to do.

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,740
Can you just leave me alone for a while?

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,600
All right.

50
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,400
Thanks.

51
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,860
- One more here. 
 - Got it.

52
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,380
Thanks.

53
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,780
Tong Tong.

54
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,600
Do you still want this?

55
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,520
No.

56
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,720
Give it to me. I'll wait for you downstairs.

57
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,575
â™«  Only after the burning, the fireworks come  â™«

58
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,375
â™«  Beauty always comes with its cost  â™«

59
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:49,925
â™«  Joy and sorrow will eventually become  â™«

60
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,125
â™«  A moment of memory  â™«

61
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,475
â™«  But I want too much  â™«

62
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,060
â™«  How can I stop?  â™«

63
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,780
 - I'm back. 
 - You're back. 

64
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,950
 Smells amazing. 

65
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:08,925
â™«  I accept the gap of losing after every gain  â™«

66
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:16,275
â™«  The story twists and turns, but it isn't a fairy tale  â™«

67
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,400
â™«  I matter most  â™«

68
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,900
â™«  And everything else comes behind  â™«

69
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,725
â™«  I'm glad flowers once bloomed on my path  â™«

70
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:31,575
â™«  But they are not worth looking back  â™«

71
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:32,900
-  Who is it?  
 - It's me.

72
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,500
Let's go for a jog.

73
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,840
 Okay, just give me a minute. 

74
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,180
 Ding Zhi Tong, let's go for a run. 

75
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,850
â™«  If I can't forget, just let it be  â™«

76
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,425
â™«  After taking some wrong turns  â™«

77
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:53,900
â™«  Then I know where to go  â™«

78
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:03,375
â™«  I'll arrive by myself  â™«

79
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,750
   

80
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,840
 Gan Yang, what's wrong? 

81
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,160
 Tong Tong. 

82
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,120
 Let's go. 

83
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,620
 Be careful. 

84
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,820
 Gan Yang. 

85
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,580
 What's really going on? 

86
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,280
 Nothing. 

87
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,860
 It's just that much has 

88
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,300
 occurred at home lately. 

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,280
 I messed up my stomach from all those business dinners. 

90
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,780
 Tong Tong. 

91
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,700
 I'm sorry. 

92
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,820
 Why are you apologizing? 

93
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,460
 Back then, 

94
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,080
 I made you choose between money and me. 

95
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,860
 Looking back, I was so naive. 

96
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,660
 Now I finally understand 

97
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,520
 how essential money is. 

98
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,988
 Gan Yang. 

99
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,025
 Money matters, but your health matters more. 

100
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:58,940
â™«  I love you  â™«

101
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,240
 Everything will be okay. All right? 

102
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,375
â™«  I want you  â™«

103
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,300
 Here. 

104
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,000
 Take your medicine. 

105
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,580
 It's fine. 

106
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:33,000
â™«  I love you  â™«

107
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,175
â™«  I want you  â™«

108
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:41,800
â™«  I'm waiting for you  â™«

109
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,675
â™«  For you  â™«

110
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:58,310
â™«  For you  â™«

111
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,300
   

112
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,900
 What? 

113
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,660
Are you sure about this?

114
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,860
If you really want to get married, I'd be happy for you,

115
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,872
but if there's any other reason,

116
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:25,360
it wouldn't be fair to you or Feng Sheng.

117
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,080
I've made up my mind.

118
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,240
I'm marrying Feng Sheng.

119
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,020
 But do you love him? 

120
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,460
 Do you still believe in true love? 

121
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,840
 Feng Sheng lost his job due to me. 

122
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,720
 And now, he's the only person staying by my side. 

123
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,620
Then think it through carefully.

124
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,740
   

125
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,560
   

126
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,780
   

127
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,560
   

128
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,900
Tong Tong, are you ready?

129
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,340
It's been ages.

130
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,140
Feng Sheng,

131
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,340
I'd like to speak with her alone.

132
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,760
Then I'll wait for you over there.

133
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,860
Why are you marrying him?

134
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,280
Do you love him?

135
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,100
Or is it because you hate me?

136
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,760
What makes you think I'd gamble with my own happiness

137
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,300
just to spite you?

138
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,240
If you really love him...

139
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,700
â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

140
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,480
Then I wish you happiness.

141
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,070
â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

142
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,605
â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

143
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,365
I love him.

144
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:11,200
â™«  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  â™«

145
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,520
Thanks for the blessing.

146
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,640
â™«  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  â™«

147
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,800
And please...

148
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,900
Don't show up again.

149
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,400
â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

150
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:34,325
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

151
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:37,300
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

152
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,340
I won't.

153
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,500
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

154
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,200
Goodbye.

155
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:53,770
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

156
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,500
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™«

157
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:06,870
â™«  And every time I think of it  â™«

158
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,050
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

159
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:23,000
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

160
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,650
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

161
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:36,900
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

162
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,200
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™«

163
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,650
â™«  And every time I think of it  â™«

164
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:50,800
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

165
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,750
â™«  Someone held my hand against all odds  â™«

166
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,300
â™«  Now Iâ€™m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  â™«

167
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:11,520
â™«  Along the road we used to run through  â™«

168
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:23,250
â™«  There is always the someone I never once forgot  â™«

169
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:36,462
   

170
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,640
- Wait a moment. I'll call you. 
 - Okay.

171
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
Sister Tong, you're amazing.

172
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,500
- I didn't expect you to have such great stamina. 
 - Thanks.

173
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,380
Not bad.

174
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,060
Take it easy.

175
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,320
It's been a while.

176
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,580
Yes.

177
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,660
You two know each other?

178
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,040
We went to the same college.

179
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,960
What a coincidence! CEO Gan, hello.

180
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,240
I'm Li Jia Xin from Investment Banking of Gutong Securities.

181
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,680
I've never had the chance to meet you before.

182
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,260
Since we're here today, how about having a meal together?

183
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,380
Right.

184
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,800
If you have time, let's have a meal together.

185
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,380
Sure.

186
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,500
My phone number is still the same.

187
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,100
Do you remember it?

188
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,340
I changed mine and lost all my contacts.

189
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,960
Could you give it to me again?

190
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,200
Sure.

191
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,400
Today, Director Ding and CEO Gan really impressed me with their performance in the Cross Fit.

192
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,080
Director Ding, I wouldnâ€™t have guessed your stamina was on par with a professionalâ€™s.

193
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,460
You flatter me.

194
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,580
CEO Gan, thanks for joining us tonight.

195
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,440
This one is for you.

196
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,100
Thanks.

197
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,540
- I'm really glad today... 
 - Sorry. CEO Gan doesn't drink.

198
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,800
I'll take this for him.

199
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,540
Then I'll finish mine. You take it easy.

200
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,920
Don't drink alcohol, just water.

201
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,420
Another toast to you, I'll drink for you.

202
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,440
Seems Jia Xin isn't persuasive enough.

203
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,900
Let me toast you, CEO Gan.

204
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,000
You wouldn't turn down an old classmate, would you?

205
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,630
Of course. It's been years. We should catch up properly.

206
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,725
- Gan Yang, are you hurting your stomach again? 
 - Director Ding.

207
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:38,920
CEO Yuan, I didnâ€™t expect that besides golf,

208
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,060
youâ€™re also into Cross Fit.

209
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,140
Just trying it out.

210
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,500
But Gan...

211
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,960
CEO Gan here is a pro.

212
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,540
I had no idea you two were classmates,

213
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,720
or I would have invited you to play.

214
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,360
Better late than never.

215
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,080
I've heard there's a hierarchy in the fitness world too.

216
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,220
Weightlifters look down on cardio enthusiasts.

217
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,780
Cardio folks scoff at traditional gym-goers.

218
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,980
Traditional gym-goers dismiss yoga studios.

219
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,320
- Is that true? 
 - Director Ding, you've done your research fully.

220
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,612
Let me tell you,

221
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:10,900
the funniest part is this hierarchy isn't even one-way.

222
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,660
If you want to present it visually, it will form a pentagram.

223
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,180
Especially now, they all disregard hybrid-concept gyms like Cross Fit.

224
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,220
They think firstly, there's no heavy equipment,

225
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,860
and secondly, the annual fee is expensive.

226
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,480
Isn't that right, CEO Gan?

227
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,460
- CEO Yuan, you're right. 
 - Having a high threshold is good.

228
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,240
What appeals to me most is its community-based fitness model.

229
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,480
Training Box's introduction of this model is very creative.

230
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
But it's not just for Cross Fit.

231
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,160
Other fitness styles can use it, too.

232
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,020
Director Ding, you've hit the nail on the head.

233
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,940
- Now, no matter which direction... 
 - Easy on the drinks.

234
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,060
As long as it's a leader, CEO Gan has invested in it.

235
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,520
It's all about managing risk.

236
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,140
CEO Gan.

237
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,120
In recent years, the projects we've invested in at LT have basically focused on...

238
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,560
Sister Tong, easy on the drinks.

239
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,440
CEO Yuan, CEO Gan, Director Xu.

240
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,492
- Let me toast you again. 
 - Sit. We're all friends here, Jia Xin.

241
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,320
- Have a seat. 
 - All right.

242
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,820
I'll drink for CEO Gan.

243
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,220
Come on.

244
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,920
I'm going to the restroom.

245
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,680
Ding Zhi Tong, how were you these past years?

246
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,540
I've been doing great,

247
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,160
no need for your concern.

248
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,660
If you can't handle alcohol, drink less and go get some rest.

249
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,420
- Hello? 
  - Hello, Tong Tong. 

250
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,440
How did it go? Did all go smoothly with LT today?

251
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,920
I met their representative.

252
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,060
It was Gan Yang.

253
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,060
No way, what a coincidence!

254
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,420
 How are you now? Are you okay? 

255
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,020
Do you need me to come over?

256
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,740
Don't bother. I'm fine.

257
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,260
All right. But if anything happens, let me know at once. Got it?

258
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,080
 Got it. 

259
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,270
â™«  The time and time  â™«

260
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,570
â™«  For life and life  â™«

261
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:40,250
â™«  I had it once. I lost it though  â™«

262
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,000
â™«  Love in love  â™«

263
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,450
â™«  So tell me you love me  â™«

264
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,040
â™«  I see you  â™«

265
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,070
Wang Yi, come to my place now.

266
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,620
â™«  The moment  â™«

267
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:12,500
â™«  I live through your love  â™«

268
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,920
- Hello? 
 -  Sister Tong. 

269
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,812
CEO Gan had a stomach flare-up last night. He's hospitalized.

270
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:26,412
 Director Zhang heard that you caused him to be hospitalized, and he's very angry. 

271
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:30,260
 He wants you to go to the hospital and apologize to him now. 

272
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,960
Got it. Bye bye.

273
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,180
It's just an IV.

274
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,600
You and Wang Yi had to force me to be hospitalized.

275
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,820
If you want to attend the launch event the day after tomorrow, finish this IV today.

276
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,640
Wang Yi specifically told me to watch you.

277
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,420
Do you even know how to peel an apple?

278
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,860
Give it to me.

279
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,260
You do it.

280
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,180
Let's see you try.

281
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,880
Just give it to me.

282
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,560
Someone caused you to be hospitalized.

283
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,660
You didn't do anything about it.

284
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,080
I'm here peeling an apple for you, and you're still complaining.

285
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,100
Enough. Stop nagging.

286
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
When she's mentioned, you're like this.

287
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,260
I never realized you were so stubborn before.

288
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,380
You've had plenty of suitors over the years.

289
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,320
I think An Ni is quite good.

290
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,600
She devotes herself to making your lunch boxes every day,

291
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,060
yet you really feel nothing for her?

292
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,160
When did you become a matchmaker?

293
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,180
You think I want to meddle?

294
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,060
I fear you'll get swept by love and agree to the financing.

295
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,440
I have plans for Training Box.

296
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,220
I won't agree.

297
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,380
Fine, I'll stop.

298
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,420
But I'll say this one last thing.

299
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,580
She's already married.

300
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,640
You confirmed it yourself back in Hong Kong.

301
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,280
It's been years. When will you let go?

302
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,680
What are you holding onto?

303
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:05,900
   

304
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,340
 Set A, enjoy. 

305
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,420
 - Good morning. What would you like? 
 - The usual. 

306
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,040
 - Two to go, please. 
 - Sure. 

307
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,380
 - Have a seat. 
 - All right. 

308
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,400
 Gan Yang? What are you doing here? 

309
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,840
 How have you been? 

310
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,560
 Not bad. 

311
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,640
 Song Ming Mei got married. Did you know? 

312
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,120
 To Director Deng from Matching. 

313
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,300
 The wedding was held in the United States. 

314
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,460
 Tong Tong flew there alone. 

315
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,500
 I was too busy at work so I didnâ€™t go. 

316
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,660
 We bought that place two years ago. 

317
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,700
 We didn't think too much about it. Just wanted something cozy for two. 

318
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,200
 Now? Clearly too naive. 

319
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,320
 We didn't account for babies. 

320
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,000
 We should have gotten a bigger place. 

321
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,580
 We've been looking at houses recently. 

322
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,352
 - Tong Tong likes the one in Kowloon... 
 - Feng Sheng. 

323
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:35,320
 I have things to do. I must go. 

324
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,380
I just wanted to know

325
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,420
how she's been doing these years.

326
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,700
Then what?

327
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
You'd move on?

328
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,080
Enough. Let's eat.

329
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,500
Will you eat it yourself, or shall I feed you?

330
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,700
I can do it myself.

331
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,060
Sure, feed yourself.

332
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,140
Let's see you try.

333
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,600
All right. Stop making a mess here.

334
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,360
Let me do it.

335
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,780
 Open your mouth. 

336
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,780
Could you be gentler?

337
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,240
Are you intubating me or feeding me?

338
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,320
I am being gentle already, okay?

339
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
Take it or leave it. I'm done.

340
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,400
My boyfriend is waiting for our date.

341
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,860
Boss, I'd like to discuss the Training Box Project.

342
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,680
 Any progress? 

343
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,280
No.

344
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,320
I'm in the office. Let's discuss in person. 
    

345
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,500
Okay. See you soon.

346
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,820
   

347
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,940
   

348
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,656
So you want off the Training Box Project for the company to assign someone else?

349
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:30,340
- Yes. 
 - The Wang Family's influence speaks for itself. You know this.

350
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,940
They're industry titans.

351
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,560
Their business spans multiple fields. They're our top client.

352
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,498
Chairman Wang personally requested you for this project,

353
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,940
and we won't easily replace you.

354
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,360
I know.

355
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,960
Let me remind you, Ding Zhi Tong.

356
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,660
If you offend such an important client as Wang,

357
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,840
it will greatly impact your future career development.

358
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,080
Director Zhang, do you know why Chairman Wang specified me

359
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,214
when we've never met?

360
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,120
Take a seat.

361
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,000
The chairman of Wang Capital operates in the shadows.

362
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,680
You? Not even I have met him.

363
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,700
Not a single photo exists online.

364
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,820
Do you remember the Guanghuan Energy project three years ago?

365
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,660
Despite Wang's absolute advantage, you led Xinxing's win

366
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,140
to get the investment.

367
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,520
I think Wang's chairman must have seen your ability in that.

368
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,100
Zhi Tong,

369
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,080
you're known as the company's Iron Lady.

370
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,320
You've rarely failed to close a deal in all these years,

371
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,480
But now you're talking about giving up.

372
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,580
Can you tell me why?

373
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,600
It's for some personal matters.

374
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm really curious what kind of personal matters

375
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,680
could outweigh your professional future.

376
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,160
 Exactly. 

377
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,260
 Right now, nothing matters more than being promoted to Managing Director.  

378
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,140
I'm sorry, Director Zhang.

379
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,100
I take back what I said.

380
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,620
Iâ€™ll give my best to this project.

381
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,240
And your personal matters?

382
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,680
It's nothing compared to my career.

383
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,280
Good. I believe in you.

384
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,500
All right. Thank you, Director Zhang.

385
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,400
Sister Tong, I still can't reach LT. What should we do?

386
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,680
They have a product launch in two days.

387
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,600
Shuchi, LT's biggest competitor,

388
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,640
suddenly moved their shoe launch to the same day.

389
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,800
This is clearly a direct challenge.

390
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,280
I don't know if LT will adjust their schedule.

391
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,760
He won't.

392
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,800
Prepare for the launch event. We're going there.

393
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,660
Got it, Sister Tong.

394
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,520
Didn't we already agree on this?

395
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,800
I've already arranged everything.

396
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,840
How can you just bail last minute?

397
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,040
You can't just ditch us for Shuchi.

398
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,640
Hello?

399
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,960
Since when do media outlets go back on their word?

400
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Shuchi must have offered them something.

401
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,480
First, they moved their launch to the same day as ours, right next door.

402
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,920
Now they're poaching our guests and media.

403
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,520
Let's not talk of that now.

404
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,760
Just tally confirmed attendees now.

405
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,880
Okay, I'll get right on it.

406
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,000
Should we reschedule our launch?

407
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,520
No.

408
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,320
Proceed as planned.

409
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,600
What are you doing?

410
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,040
Returning to the office.

411
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,200
They've declared war on us.

412
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,400
We need to pull ourselves together.

413
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,400
And I'll host the launch myself.

414
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,595
   

415
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,040
- Director Zhan, hello. 
 - Great job.

416
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,020
These data have been reviewed several times.

417
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,040
There shouldn't be any problems.

418
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,060
Old Liang.

419
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,540
Take notes.

420
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,708
Hardly anyone showed up to their so-called "big launch."

421
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,640
Director Zhan.

422
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,260
What a name.

423
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,720
LT.

424
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,920
CEO Gan, this must sting.

425
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,360
But I admire your courage.

426
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,475
Didn't expect the launch to still go ahead as scheduled.

427
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,112
Director Zhan.

428
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:25,680
Save your admiration for our performance.

429
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,280
Young people being too confident isn't a good thing.

430
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,800
It breeds downfall.

431
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,080
Director Zhan, you and Shuchi aren't spring chickens,

432
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,240
but see how many times you've lost to LT.

433
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,200
As they say, the older, the wiser.

434
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,880
We will see.

435
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,560
I've got a room full of people waiting.

436
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Can't play with you youth anymore.

437
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,060
Bye bye.

438
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,560
Hao Chen, don't forget what I reminded you.

439
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,000
Don't worry. Everything's ready.

440
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,300
All right, everyone, let's warmly welcome Director Zhan for his speech.

441
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,920
Next, let's welcome our main stars, LT DT6.0

442
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,580
and CEO Gan!

443
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,680
Hello, everyone, I'm Gan Yang.

444
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,120
Today I'm proud to introduce our brand new LT DT6.0.

445
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,800
We've made innovations and upgrades

446
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,460
in shoe design and technology.

447
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,240
Sister Tong, Shuchi's event next door is too packed.

448
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,520
I didn't expect

449
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,080
LT to actually hold the launch as scheduled and go head-to-head with Shuchi.

450
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,460
But compared to Shuchi's turnout, this is practically empty.

451
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,940
They're getting completely overshadowed.

452
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,800
We hope to deliver a revolutionary wearing experience and sports performance.

453
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,840
As you know, LT is a sports investment company.

454
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,080
In addition to independently developing running shoes,

455
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,920
we've also invested in sports applications like Training Box

456
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,120
to complete the matrix closed-loop of the sports industry.

457
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,320
Our newly-launched LT DT6.0 running shoes

458
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,360
will make their debut on Training Box, achieving sports data linkage.

459
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:30,740
Now, I'll detail the revolutionary advantages of LT DT6.0.

460
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,020
Please view the screen.

461
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,940
This is the performance comparison between LT DT6.0 and AN14X.

462
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,200
What you see now are authentic data for LT DT6.0.

463
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,880
I won't comment on the data

464
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,740
circulating online.

465
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,180
It's as fast as lightning.

466
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,800
Director Zhan.

467
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,060
Excuse me.

468
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,280
We've been tricked.

469
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,420
The data we got before was all fake.

470
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,440
- Really? 
 - Look at this.

471
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,000
- This. 
 - No way.

472
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,100
LT DT6.0 actually outperforms AN14X by this much.

473
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,040
- These metrics are skyrocketing. 
 - Exactly.

474
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,280
Our shock absorption outperforms theirs by 7.96%.

475
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,720
Our rebound comparison is 6.12% higher than theirs.

476
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,180
And we've surpassed them by 9.69% in durability.

477
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,960
From today on,

478
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,680
the landscape of domestic sports shoes will change.

479
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,300
Sister Tong, whom do you think leaked all that fake data online?

480
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,000
Shuchi really got hit hard by that data.

481
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,440
Who else?

482
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,260
LT themselves.

483
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,280
Gan Yang probably anticipated Shuchi's moves

484
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,880
and set this trap for them from the start.

485
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,660
CEO Gan is impressive.

486
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,640
How will we negotiate financing with them?

487
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,460
They are impressive, but we're no pushovers.

488
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,100
CEO Gan, may I ask how you determined the price for these shoes?

489
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,520
When I first started developing running shoes,

490
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,240
I was determined to make the best shoes regardless of cost.

491
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,840
But someone once told me that

492
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,540
if you can make non-runners

493
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,300
want to run

494
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,540
just by wearing your shoes,

495
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,360
that might be the meaning of making shoes.

496
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,680
 But have you ever thought, 

497
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,720
 what if someone who doesn't like running puts on your shoes and enjoys it? 

498
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,580
 You're right. 

499
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,740
That's when I realized...

500
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
I wanted to

501
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,960
make top-tier running shoes that everyone can afford.

502
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,620
The price of these shoes is affordable for all.

503
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,880
CEO Gan is incredible!

504
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,620
This is our latest release.

505
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,560
Sister Tong, CEO Gan and his team are here.

506
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,240
Director Ding.

507
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,680
The launch was a great success. Congratulations.

508
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,760
Thank you.

509
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,120
CEO Gan, do you have time later?

510
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,280
I'd like to talk to you about Training Box.

511
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,880
There's nothing to talk about. We don't agree.

512
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,400
Chen Xi.

513
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,680
Sure. But I'm busy right now.

514
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,920
Let's meet and talk later.

515
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,900
We should exchange WeChat accounts for easier communication.

516
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,140
No problem, I'll add you.

517
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,260
I'll add you.

518
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,520
CEO Gan, just let us know when you're available.

519
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,300
We will decide on the location.

520
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,340
Sure.

521
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,800
Let's go.

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

524
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,135
â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

525
00:40:55,335 --> 00:41:02,585
â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

526
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:08,722
â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

527
00:41:08,722 --> 00:41:15,785
â™«  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  â™«

528
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:22,710
â™«  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  â™«

529
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:29,610
â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

530
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:36,685
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

531
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:43,785
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

532
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:50,327
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

533
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:57,612
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

534
00:41:57,612 --> 00:42:04,590
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™« 
 â™«  And every time I think of it  â™«

535
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:11,541
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

536
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:18,430
â™«  Someone held my hand against all odds 

537
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:24,985
â™«  Now Iâ€™m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  â™«

538
00:42:24,985 --> 00:42:32,260
â™«  Along the road we used to run through  â™«

539
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:44,760
â™«  There is always the someone I never once forgot  â™«
