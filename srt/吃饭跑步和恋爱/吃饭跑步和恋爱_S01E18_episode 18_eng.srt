 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,869
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,663
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:22,295
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,043
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:32,326
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:35,220
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:40,592
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:49,756
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,852
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,304
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:07,012
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:11,268
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:16,070
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,770
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,601
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,265
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,036
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,260
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,380
   
   

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,480
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,494
   

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,503
   

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,680
Here you are.

27
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,960
Enjoy your meal.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,420
Thanks.

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,760
Director Ding, your taste has changed quite a bit from seven years ago.

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,500
Much lighter now.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
It seems you've adapted well to life in Hong Kong.

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
CEO Gan,

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,380
I hope you'll reconsider the financing for Training Box.

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,560
I heard the financial industry in Hong Kong is competitive.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,740
Director Ding rose to such a high position in just six years.

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,540
You must work incredibly hard.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,760
Every industry is competitive these days.

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,640
But rather than doing things alone, it's much wiser to join a team.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,060
You were at the launch event today.

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,720
What do you think of our new shoes?

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,760
I don't know much about shoes.

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,240
But your new model is perfect both in performance and price.

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,620
That's why i believe once it officially launches,

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,580
it will make waves in the running shoe industry.

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,080
It will be the hit of the year,

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,920
and bring stable cash flow to our company.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,240
I know Training Box isn't short on funds.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,180
The Wangs can bring lots of resources as well as capital.

49
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,560
It'll be a great help for your future business expansion.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,420
After all these years,

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,680
you remain the same in this one area.

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,000
Once you set your mind to something,

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,900
you won't give up easily.

54
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,060
The why did you suddenly decide to work in Hong Kong back then?

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,640
Director Gan, why bring that up now?

56
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,320
It's not related to our discussion.

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,420
Or is it that compared to work,

58
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,160
CEO Gan is more interested in my personal life?

59
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,900
Director Ding,

60
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,900
I've already been clear about financing matters with Training Box.

61
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,420
I won't accept the financing.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,940
It won't do any good for our company's long-term development,

63
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,540
and we don't have any financial needs.

64
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,000
Xiao Gao, I'll leave the rest to you.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,860
I'm going to meet my crush.

66
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,740
He's already here, at table seven.

67
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,060
You should have told me earlier.

68
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,780
Hurry and get the cake ready.

69
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,860
Be careful with it.

70
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,580
Okay.

71
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,360
CEO Gan, don't decide so quickly.

72
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,060
How about we have a chat with the Wangs?

73
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,120
I don't see the point.

74
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,740
In that case, I have nothing more to say.

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,600
I know you won't give up easily,

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,760
but let me remind you.

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,300
No matter what,

78
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,840
I won't accept any financing.

79
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,420
CEO Gan, you are overly confident.

80
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,600
If you accept it or not, I will secure this project.

81
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:00,060
Hello. I'm the head chef and owner of this restaurant.

82
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,120
Was the meal not to your liking?

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,260
I don't have much appetite.

84
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,740
It's not your fault.

85
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,820
Check, please.

86
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,940
Don't worry about it.

87
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,340
You're Gan Yang's friend, right?

88
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,980
His friend is my friend.

89
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,620
This one is on me.

90
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,740
You've got it wrong.

91
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,140
I'll pay for my half.

92
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,360
I'll leave the rest to you.

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,740
Is that beauty your friend?

94
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,000
Quite the personality.

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,260
Aren't you the owner here?

96
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,980
Shouldn't you be working not gossiping?

97
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,072
The owner is the owner because she works only when she feels like it.

98
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,980
Nobody can tell her what to do.

99
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,980
Tell me the truth.

100
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,060
Do you owe that beauty money?

101
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,000
Please, no. I hate owing people money.

102
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,820
Owing money isn't that bad.

103
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,260
What's worse is emotional debt to someone.

104
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,400
That is way harder to repay.

105
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,460
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,400
Take a look. I got that just for you.

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,380
I watched the launch event. 
    

108
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,120
It's a huge success. Congratulations.

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,020
Thanks.

110
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,260
Well?

111
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,220
Do you feel even a little attracted to me?

112
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,940
An Ni.

113
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,740
Okay, fine.

114
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,940
I get it.

115
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,540
We're just friends.

116
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,220
You've said that a million times.

117
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,260
But don't worry.

118
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,060
I'm not giving up.

119
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,440
This cake looks so beautiful.

120
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,900
Help me take a picture. I'm posting it.

121
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,560
An Ni,

122
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,420
thanks for the cake.

123
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,060
I still need to handle something.

124
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,900
I have to go.

125
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,225
   

126
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,460
After outsmarting others all my life, I got played by a rookie.

127
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,820
Who'd have thought that dreamer boy would trick us?

128
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,100
Does he have an R and D partner who's also at LT now?

129
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,860
Yes, his name is Wang Yi.

130
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,180
He's the R&amp;D Director at LT, in charge of all R&amp;D projects.

131
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,580
Gan Yang trusts him a lot.

132
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,780
Poach him.

133
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,360
Offer him enough money, and he will bite.

134
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,020
Got it. I'll get right on it.

135
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:41,740
   

136
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,200
The Publicity Department told me

137
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,780
that our live stream's viewership yesterday

138
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,060
was a hundred times more than Shuchi's.

139
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,320
In the end, it was just their employees watching.

140
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,020
Director Zhan looked ready to explode.

141
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,320
Here's another piece of good news.

142
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,180
The total preorders for LT DT6.0 just hit the top.

143
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,260
Guess our move paid off!

144
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,860
You two.

145
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,800
Aren't you going to explain the fake data?

146
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,640
Gan Yang, you...

147
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,420
Wang Yi. Wang Yi! I swear I'll throw this at your head!

148
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,080
- Wang Yi's not here! 
 - Stop right there!

149
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,140
Sister Tong, did you put in overtime last night to put this together?

150
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,400
I talked to CEO Gan last night.

151
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,420
He's rigid against financing.

152
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,240
Thus, I plan to bypass him

153
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
and talk to other minority shareholders.

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,540
 But even if they all agree, with their shares, 

155
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,460
it's hard for them to decide if Training Box needs financing, right?

156
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,860
CEO Gan is the second-largest shareholder of Training Box.

157
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,180
We can't cut him out entirely.

158
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,980
But we can get other minority shareholders

159
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,100
to pressure him.

160
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,020
What if he still refuses?

161
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,780
He's the leader of LT.

162
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,360
He must know the dangers of unstable morale.

163
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,520
I'll go talk to other shareholders first.

164
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,880
Tomorrow, I'll go to Xiamen to meet one of them.

165
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
You go to Nanjing to meet another.

166
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
Okay.

167
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,725
   

168
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,375
   

169
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,980
Director Ding, what brings you here?

170
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,760
Director Li, you play really well.

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
Just dabbling.

172
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,160
Have some water.

173
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,780
Thanks.

174
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,620
Director Li,

175
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,100
it's about the Training Box matter.

176
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,280
No business talk. Play a couple of games with me.

177
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,460
I don't know how to play.

178
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,900
Well, no game, no deal. Humor me.

179
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,540
CEO Gan, what brings you here?

180
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,100
You love playing, right?

181
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,860
I'll join you.

182
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,360
Let's go.

183
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,840
CEO Gan, I'll stop, all right?

184
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,372
Director Li, about Training Box...

185
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,620
Let's not talk of it. Don't you see CEO Gan is watching like a hawk?

186
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,000
Drop it. My answer is no!

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,580
You have my contact info.

188
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,100
Just let me know if you change your mind.

189
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,620
I'll leave now.

190
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,140
Director Ding.

191
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,540
I didn't agree to it.

192
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,460
   

193
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,700
 We're very sincere about this. 

194
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,980
I hope Director Deng will give it serious consideration.

195
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,460
Don't worry. I'll think it over and get back to you soon.

196
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,980
Looking forward to working with you.

197
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,340
- No problem. 
 - I'll wait for your reply.

198
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,980
Let me see you out.

199
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,240
Honey, you know Director Zhu from Hippo Tech?

200
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,180
Are you selling Matching?

201
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,540
Yes. You know, their offer is really good.

202
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,360
They'll give me shares and keep me on as the general manager.

203
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,480
You should know that once it's sold, you won't have a say anymore.

204
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,300
Yes, right.

205
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,360
I know all that.

206
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,080
But the competition in short videos is cutthroat now.

207
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,620
The industry gets tougher.

208
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,880
Now we have a chance to sell and secure the profits. Isn't that good?

209
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,300
So?

210
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,060
Will we just hand over Matching after all our hard work?

211
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,180
Once the money's in our pockets, who cares?

212
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,620
I disagree.

213
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,660
But I already gave them my word.

214
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,140
You can't expect me to go back on it now.

215
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,120
Matching isn't yours alone to decide.

216
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm a shareholder, too!

217
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,460
Yes, you are.

218
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,600
But why do you think every decision I make is wrong?

219
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,520
Song Ming Mei, do you think you're always right, and I'm always wrong?

220
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,740
Let me remind you. I'm the owner here.

221
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,440
What I say goes!

222
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,860
I'd compromise on anything else, but not this!

223
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,440
We greatly admire your skills

224
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,860
and want to invite you to join Shuchi.

225
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,660
You're asking me to betray my buddy?

226
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,720
Impossible.

227
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,340
It's not that serious.

228
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,540
We're just offering you a better prospect.

229
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,780
This contract...

230
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,660
was already stamped by Shuchi. 
    

231
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,320
If you agree, just sign here,

232
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,440
and we will transfer the money now.

233
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,460
Then we will fully utilize these areas.

234
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,020
We can set this up as an art exhibition.

235
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,100
It'll look great.

236
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,980
And we will make good use of this data.

237
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,220
Got it. Wang Yi!

238
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,780
Wang Yi, I'm calling you.

239
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,660
What are you doing?

240
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
You scared me.

241
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,560
What's wrong? You seem distracted.

242
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,900
Quiet.

243
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,720
Let me calm down.

244
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,780
Hey, are you okay?

245
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,700
Don't scare me.

246
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,540
I just turned down a huge offer from Shuchi.

247
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,860
My heart aches. I've never seen that much money in my life.

248
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,460
I likely never will again.

249
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,760
Is that all?

250
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,460
Have some dignity.

251
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,140
It's money, a lot... lot of money.

252
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,200
What are you guys doing here?

253
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,700
Wang Yi, send me the follow-up R&amp;D road map.

254
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,980
Don't talk for now.

255
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,220
Seeing your slave-driver face makes it hurt more.

256
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,140
Is it too late for me to go join Shuchi?

257
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,860
- What's wrong with him? 
 - He rejected a huge salary offer from Shuchi.

258
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,700
Now he regrets it.

259
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,660
No way. You must compensate me today.

260
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,240
I gave up a fortune for you today, Bro.

261
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,420
- "A fortune"? 
 - Yes.

262
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,660
Fine.

263
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,460
So how do you want me to compensate you?

264
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,900
Let's go out for a big meal.

265
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,960
Just a meal?

266
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,540
Sure thing.

267
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,220
Let's go now.

268
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,340
You guys figure out what to eat.

269
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,440
- Then let's go to An Ni's restaurant. 
 - I'm coming, too.

270
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,480
   

271
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,760
   

272
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,780
 I heard you were even in hospital after drinking with her. 

273
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,020
 Don't worry. I'll get revenge for you. 

274
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Wang Yi, I won't go eat with you.

275
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,780
Something came up. I'll take a rain check.

276
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,380
I'll definitely treat you another time.

277
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,860
 Hello, CEO Gan? 

278
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,940
Hi, Sun Hao.

279
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,540
Where are you? Send me your location.

280
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,591
 No need for you to handle such a small matter. 

281
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:17,300
Don't worry, Brother.

282
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,700
Since she's eager to convince the other shareholders,

283
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,369
then I'll take this chance to teach her a lesson.

284
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,600
Stay out of this.

285
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,700
 Wait for me. 

286
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,620
I'm hanging up.

287
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,025
   

288
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,460
Director Sun, you've just gone through the information about the Wangs.

289
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,300
I'm sure you know accepting financing

290
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,080
would only benefit Training Box

291
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,200
I understand.

292
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,300
I know about the Wangs, of course.

293
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,420
Such a large investment company

294
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,060
would take an interest in Training Box

295
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
and want to invest.

296
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,580
I will just say it.

297
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,040
I'll definitely agree.

298
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,940
That's wonderful.

299
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,100
Here's the Letter of Agreement.

300
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,580
We just need to sign it.

301
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,220
Director Ding, let's not rush this.

302
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,700
We're here to enjoy a meal.

303
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Director Ding, let me toast you.

304
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,100
- Come on. 
 - Then I'll finish mine. You drink as you like.

305
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,140
Director Ding, have some food.

306
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,940
Director Sun, shall we sign it now?

307
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,480
Now you're ruining the mood, Director Ding.

308
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,700
We just started drinking.

309
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,240
Director Ding,

310
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,040
surely you can humor me? (accepting a drink in respect)

311
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,820
Honestly, I didn't have a good impression of you at first.

312
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,780
But how you handle alcohol reflects your character.

313
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,180
I think you're a good person.

314
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,880
But I can't sign this.

315
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,320
Are you okay?

316
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,960
CEO Gan, you made him mess with me,

317
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,960
and now you're pretending to care?

318
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,940
I didn't ask him to do this.

319
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,360
Brother?

320
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,900
Brother, perfect timing.

321
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,580
I almost got her drunk.

322
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,700
Happy now?

323
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,180
Cut it out.

324
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,220
Go back to sleep.

325
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,660
Okay.

326
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,160
He's drunk.

327
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,680
Ignore him.

328
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,580
Even if you didn't arrange this,

329
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,060
it's quite a coincidence you always show up like this.

330
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,820
Or are you afraid I'll convince your shareholders

331
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,320
to sign the agreement?

332
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,780
From what I know,

333
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,380
you've met five of our shareholders in the past two days.

334
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,020
None of them agreed to the financing, right?

335
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,020
What do I have to fear?

336
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,700
In that case,

337
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,580
I hope you won't show up

338
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,860
when I meet the next shareholder.

339
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,780
Are you okay?

340
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,100
Thanks, CEO Gan.

341
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm fine.

342
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,500
   

343
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,840
Get in. I'll take you home.

344
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,820
Ding Zhi Tong.

345
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,880
Ding Zhi Tong.

346
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,460
I didn't expect you'd hold your liquor so well.

347
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,220
CEO Gan didn't think I actually drank all that?

348
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,740
You didn't?

349
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,660
I did,

350
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,680
but then threw up in the restroom.

351
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,100
That's not good for your health.

352
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,000
Director Gan, do you care this much about every client?

353
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,740
Rest for a bit.

354
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,180
I'll get medicine from the pharmacy ahead.

355
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,700
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

356
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,370
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

357
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,660
 Ding Zhi Tong, I'm back. 

358
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,900
 You bought so much? 

359
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,320
 I didn't know which one to get. 

360
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,500
 I just bought everything suggested. 

361
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,140
 Drink water with the medicine. 

362
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,540
 I got this, and this, 

363
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,024
 plus heat patches. 

364
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:49,615
Which do you want?

365
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,620
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

366
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,020
 Ding Zhi Tong, don't be softhearted. 

367
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,030
♫  Please  ♫

368
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,880
♫  Please don’t wake me  ♫

372
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,270

375
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,770

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:20,170

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:35,740
♫  Let us remain forever in this moment  ♫

386
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,100
Are you okay?

387
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,380
Stop running for now.

388
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,260
Take a break.

389
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,380
You probably have a side stitch.

390
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,900
Put your hands on your stomach.

391
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,660
Adjust your breathing.

392
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,340
Inhale through your nose. Exhale through your mouth.

393
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,460
In.

394
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,900
Out.

395
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,760
In.

396
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,960
Out.

397
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,380
Feeling better?

398
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
You didn't warm up, did you?

399
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,300
That's quite dangerous.

400
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,020
You should warm up before running next time.

401
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,260
And don't accelerate so suddenly.

402
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,540
Remember to adjust your breathing:

403
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,460
in through the nose, out of the mouth.

404
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,920
That way, your breathing will be more even.

405
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,920
You know a lot about running.

406
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,100
Are you a professional runner?

407
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,280
No, a friend taught me.

408
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,580
I can't reach it.

409
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,820
Can you call a staff member?

410
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,280
Don't bother.

411
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,020
Hurry up.

412
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,680
What are you waiting for? Just grab it.

413
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,560
Thank you.

414
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,940
No worries.

415
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,480
Remember to warm up before running next time.

416
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,680
Chairman, what's your first impression of Ding Zhi Tong?

417
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,100
Have you ever seen a girl lift a treadmill with her bare hands?

418
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,240
No way.

419
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,820
A treadmill is so heavy.

420
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,360
That Ding Zhi Tong girl is very interesting.

421
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,760
No wonder Gan Yang couldn't get over her after so many years.

422
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,420
But they've been apart for six years after all.

423
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,320
Can she really convince him to accept financing?

424
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,320
To deal with such a capable, resourceful opponent,

425
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,340
step one is to find his weakness.

426
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,020
Are you saying Ding Zhi Tong is his weakness?

427
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,620
For us to secure Training Box, Ding Zhi Tong may be our

428
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,340
only shot.

429
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,340
Another fruitless trip.

430
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,340
I didn't expect CEO Gan had such a significant say in Training Box.

431
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,140
No wonder Yuan Chao is wary of him.

432
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,820
Bypassing him to approach other shareholders isn't working.

433
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,380
What should we do next?

434
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,975
- Ding Zhi Tong. 
 - CEO Gan?

435
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,860
Let's talk.

436
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,880
There's nothing to discuss.

437
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,900
Don't you want to talk about Training Box?

438
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,660
Come to Beijing with me,

439
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,600
and you'll understand why I'm refusing financing.

440
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,420
Let's add each other on WeChat.

441
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,600
Otherwise, when we get to Beijing,

442
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,720
would we still communicate via our assistants?

443
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,775
   

444
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,560
Done.

445
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,600
Be careful, Yu Lin.

446
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,060
Seeing Yu Lin always drives away my foul mood.

447
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,840
That's because you haven't seen her devil mode.

448
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,180
If you're unhappy, don't go to Beijing.

449
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,280
Stay in Shanghai and help me take care of this little devil.

450
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,740
Since when do wage slaves get a say?

451
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,780
Is this project really necessary?

452
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,140
Only if I secure this project, I can be promoted to MD.

453
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,000
I can't refuse it.

454
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,380
Just quit. I'll take care of you.

455
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,320
I know you're worried about me.

456
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,960
But I don't want to concede so easily.

457
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,780
He hurt me once six years ago.

458
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,540
I won't let him block my path to MD.

459
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,940
Don't pressure yourself too much.

460
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,120
Just treat Gan Yang like any other client.

461
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,900
Even ordinary clients require tailored approaches.

462
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,800
And you know Gan Yang's preferences so well.

463
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,860
Just play the emotional card, and you'll land this deal.

464
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,460
Right?

465
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,860
You're right.

466
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,380
I'll think about it.

467
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,900
   

468
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,880
   

469
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,080
 Ten, nine, eight... 

470
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,140
 Seven, six, five... 

471
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,547
 Four, three, two... 

472
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,600
 One! 

473
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,740
 Yes! 

474
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,352
All right, everyone!

475
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:56,580
Let's celebrate

476
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,100
how LT has successfully broken the sales record

477
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,340
set by Shuchi two years ago,

478
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,860
with 17,000 pairs sold in 24 hours for a new shoe launch!

479
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,540
Now let's welcome CEO Gan to give his speech!

480
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,660
Everyone labored hard during this period.

481
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,900
Thank you, all, for your hard work.

482
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,160
Without your effort, we wouldn't have achieved today's success.

483
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,660
Dinner tonight is on me.

484
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,500
Plus,

485
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,180
an extra month's salary as bonus.

486
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,650
   

487
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,300
Since your stomach's weak, let's toast with tea instead of wine,

488
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,880
unless you want another hospital trip.

489
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,820
Can you stop mentioning it?

490
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,800
So you know how embarrassing that was?

491
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,620
But when you finally treat us, you bring us here?

492
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,120
Exactly.

493
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,060
Haven't you two forgotten

494
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,380
that this is where LT started?

495
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,780
Five or six years passed in a blink.

496
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,780
Honestly, I nearly quit so many times.

497
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,500
If Gan Yang hadn't kept pushing me,

498
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,720
I could never have fulfilled what I bragged about.

499
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,880
So you just needed whipping into shape.

500
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,180
I reminisce about the past and envision the future.

501
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,420
Can you stop interrupting?

502
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,460
Now you're all eloquent.

503
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,080
When I asked him to speak at the annual meeting,

504
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,620
he couldn't squeeze out a few sentences.

505
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,980
Right.

506
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,660
As the Chief R&amp;D Officer of LT,

507
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,220
I must maintain an air of mystery.

508
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,580
Oh, please.

509
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
When you always asked

510
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,740
Zi Han and Little Zhang to carry you in the game, where was your mystery?

511
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,380
Why don't you talk about him?

512
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,220
He's always organizing ranked matches at the office.

513
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,140
So you guys were playing games behind closed doors?

514
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,780
Or what did you think we were doing?

515
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,040
How should I know?

516
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,740
You're all so cryptic.

517
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,780
We did it at the launch event just to create a misdirection.

518
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,820
We really didn't hide it from you.

519
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,980
Then what about this time?

520
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,060
Why are you taking Ding Zhi Tong to Beijing?

521
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,900
If I wanted to hide it,

522
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,180
I wouldn't get Admin to book her ticket.

523
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,640
Then why didn't you just refuse her?

524
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
I think it's less about financing,

525
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,880
but you want to revisit old haunts with her.

526
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,180
You know what? Gan Yang has his own reasons for their matter.

527
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,260
- Let's not interfere. 
 - Shut up.

528
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,280
Here.

529
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,860
I know what you're worried about.

530
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,100
Both of you won't believe anything I say now anyway.

531
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,400
But we three worked hard to make LT.

532
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,060
Only we know how hard this journey's been.

533
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,180
- Right? 
 - Yes.

534
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,200
So I promise you; I'll never let personal feelings

535
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,420
harm the company's interests.

536
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,720
Raise your glass.

537
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,060
We three vowed to see this through together.

538
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,800
"Soon, the prince and princess got married."

539
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,640
"They traveled the world with the lion monster."

540
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,300
"No place was off-limits"

541
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,220
"because they feared nothing."

542
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,975
   

543
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,160
It's 48.5?

544
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,641
That's not my weight.

545
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,560
Hello?

546
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,860
Is that the Beiyuan Security office?

547
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,100
Why I'm calling,

548
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,000
I just asked my cousin to pick up something from my place.

549
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
But I can't reach her now.

550
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,940
Has she arrived?

551
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,480
What? She went with Director Deng?

552
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,360
Okay, I see.

553
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,940
Thank you.

554
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,640
These stores have shown interest in working with us.

555
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,620
Okay, I'll go talk to them. 
    

556
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:43,570


557
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,580
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

558
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,000
I...

559
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,540
I didn't know anyone was in here.

560
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,520
As for you, why are you hiding here?

561
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,040
Didn't Little Luo tell An Ni to cancel the food delivery?

562
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,640
I told them not to.

563
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,360
We already ordered. Gan Yang isn't here, but I can eat it.

564
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,220
You're something else.

565
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,700
Give me chopsticks. I'll try some, too.

566
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,780
This is a single serving.

567
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,380
Do you want some fruit?

568
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,320
No date with your boyfriend?

569
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,180
We broke up.

570
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,280
Another again?

571
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,200
This lasted less than two months!

572
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,300
What's the reason this time?

573
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,040
My mom sent me some braised pig intestines.

574
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,240
I saved my precious stash to share with him,

575
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,680
and he called it disgusting.

576
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,380
Your mom sent you pig intestines?

577
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,440
How could anyone hate something so delicious?

578
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,580
Exactly.

579
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,120
That's why I had to break up with him.

580
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,180
Good for you. You made the right decision.

581
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,660
Come on, have some.

582
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,360
All for me?

583
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,880
Yes. You can have it all.

584
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,100
You still have more pig intestines, right? I'll go to your place tonight for some.

585
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,540
Shuchi made a mistake trying to bribe you with money.

586
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,500
If they used food instead,

587
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,300
you might just eagerly join them.

588
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,840
You know me well.

589
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,100
This is a secret.

590
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,880
Don't tell Shuchi.

591
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,840
You think you'd leave LT building alive if that happened?

592
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,500
I was just joking.

593
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,660
I was joking about joining Shuchi,

594
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,520
but I'm serious about eating pig intestines tonight.

595
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,340
Try this.

596
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,880
This is delicious.

597
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,000
Good call on the breakup.

598
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,320
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

599

♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

600
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:43,410
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

601
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:49,647
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

602
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:56,810
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

603
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:03,635
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

604
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:10,535
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

605
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:17,710
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

606
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:24,710
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

607
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:31,152
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

608
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:38,437
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

609
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:45,470
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

610
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:52,366
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

611
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:59,355
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

612
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:06,010
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

613
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:13,185
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

614
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:25,685
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
