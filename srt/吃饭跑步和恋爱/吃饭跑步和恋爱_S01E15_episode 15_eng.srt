 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,869
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,663
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:22,295
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,143
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:32,226
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:35,920
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,584
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:49,656
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:57,852
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,304
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:06,812
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,168
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,070
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,601
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,365
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,136
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,260
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,380
   
   

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,580
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,470
   

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:51,710


26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,060
Tong Tong.

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,620
Are you leaving?

28
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I'll see you off.

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,060
Don't bother. It's still early.

30
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,960
Get some more sleep.

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,380
But I don't want you to go.

32
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,780
I don't want to leave, either.

33
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,590
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

34
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,400
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,540
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

36
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,050
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

37
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,680
♫  I wish I could stay with you  ♫

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,120
Be careful on the road.

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,870
Let me know when you arrive.

40
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,000
♫  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  ♫

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,660
I'll go then.

42
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,010
♫  When it comes to love  ♫

43
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:22,220
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,660
Tong Tong.

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,760
I'll let you know when I get there.

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,340
Okay.

47
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,982
See you after the holiday.

48
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,440
♫  Let me hold you  ♫

49
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,450
See you after the holiday.

50
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,270
Bye bye.

51
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,000
♫  Please let me chase the lonely star  ♫

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,620
♫  Through this unaligned universe  ♫

53
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,120
♫  Through this unaligned universe  ♫

54
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,600
♫  Only for you  ♫

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,720
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

56
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,320
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

57
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,680
 I'm off work now. Bye bye. 

58
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,180
Hello, Bo Ting.

59
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,280
Hey, Ming Mei.

60
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,720
Are you in Shanghai? How about dinner tonight?

61
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,370
Are you in Shanghai?

62
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,700
Yes. Are you free?

63
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,440
Not tonight, I already have plans.

64
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,280
But I'm flying to the U.S. tonight.

65
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,200
I came to Shanghai specifically to discuss Matching app.

66
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,060
 The ¥50 million ($7 million) financing you told me went through. 

67
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,220
Really?

68
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,880
But tonight...

69
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,160
All right. Tonight it is.

70
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,100
- See you then. 
 - Okay. See you soon.

71
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,160
- Hello? 
 - Hey, Professor Qin.

72
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,411
Are you off work yet?

73
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:34,380
 Something... came up tonight. 

74
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,180
Let's reschedule.

75
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay, got it.

76
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,060
Go ahead with your plans.

77
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,940
All right. Let's meet another time, bye bye.

78
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,561
   

79
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,780
Sister Mei.

80
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,320
Yang Yang? Why are you back?

81
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:11,800
What's going on in there?

82
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,480
   

83
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,760
CEO Liu and Mr. Gan are inside.

84
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,500
Enough. Don't say any more.

85
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,660
You women are always so timid.

86
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,800
What's there to worry about?

87
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
Just let me think it over, okay?

88
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,780
What's there to think about?

89
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,780
I'm your husband. Would I ever do you wrong?

90
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,160
What if we get caught?

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
Plenty of people do this.

92
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,880
Just grease...

93
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,180
Yang Yang? Come on, hurry in.

94
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,820
Yang Yang.

95
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,080
Get in here.

96
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,200
Let me see you.

97
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,480
Yang Yang, why did you return so suddenly

98
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,280
without even calling?

99
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,300
You still had a year left on your sentence.

100
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,840
How did you get out so soon?

101
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,880
Your dad had a stroke in there last year.

102
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,180
Thankfully, they saved him in time,

103
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,540
but he will be in a wheelchair the rest of his life

104
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,920
so he applied for medical parole.

105
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,080
Hey, you brat,

106
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,420
after all these years apart, you didn't even miss me, right?

107
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,960
Look at you. Such a fine-looking man.

108
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Doesn't he look just like me back then? Right?

109
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,720
What were you just saying to my mom?

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,440
- Oh, that... 
 - Nothing.

111
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,960
It's just that the midsole material company

112
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,160
got a few fines for pollution.

113
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,520
No big deal.

114
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,060
Really?

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,160
Yes. Listen, Yang, it's just a few million.

116
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,340
Just a few million we can cover.

117
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,600
"A few million"?

118
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Every yuan is hard-earned by my mom.

119
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,978
Oh, come on. Don't I have a stake in this company?

120
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:45,540
- Is that so? 
 - Yang Yang, this is the office.

121
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,800
Let's talk about this over dinner tonight.

122
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,880
Enjoy.

123
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,900
Yang Yang, here.

124
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,940
Go on, eat.

125
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,700
Have some more.

126
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,980
You eat, too, Mom.

127
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,280
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

128
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,960
Mom.

129
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,380
I just met with Sister Long Mei.

130
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,180
She told me what's been going on at home.

131
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,500
 Two years ago, the company prepared to list on the A-share market. 

132
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 Early last year, we completed the final round of financing. 

133
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,640
 The agreement stipulated that if we failed to list 

134
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
 before year end, 

135
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
 we'd have to buy back the shares 

136
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,240
 from investors at a 10% simple interest rate. 

137
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
 But since last year, 

138
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,360
 our orders have been declining. 

139
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,160
 The estimated valuation and profitability are far off 

140
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,280
 from last year's figures. 

141
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,500
What's the big deal?

142
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,640
Let's just tweak numbers a bit on the financial side

143
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,740
and write the revenue as 1.5 billion, not ¥1 billion.

144
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,680
Inflate profits from 50 million to 100 million.

145
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,860
We've got the factory and workers right here.

146
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,560
It's plausible enough.

147
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
"Tweak numbers"?

148
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,080
What kind of tweak?

149
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,060
Mom is the company's legal representative and actual controller.

150
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,660
If it goes wrong, she will take the fall.

151
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,020
Are you trying to send her to prison?

152
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,180
Is it that serious?

153
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,980
Success always comes with risks.

154
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,960
You young people just don't get it.

155
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,340
Wasn't that what you said before you went in?

156
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,940
Yang Yang.

157
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,100
You went to prison for fundraising fraud

158
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
and left Mom to clean your mess.

159
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,840
Do you know what she endured all these years?

160
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,060
Now you're out, and you want to send her in?

161
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,560
Does she owe you?

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,800
What do you mean?

163
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,540
Your mom and I are getting old.

164
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,700
Even if we make money, how much can we spend?

165
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,980
Whom do we do all this for? For you!

166
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,440
We at least have to try.

167
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
What are you doing?

168
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,940
What, am I wrong?

169
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,200
Mom, don't listen to him.

170
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,500
He never tells the truth.

171
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,400
And I don't need anything from you. Understand?

172
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,060
Fine.

173
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,380
Then what's your solution?

174
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,661
Long Mei said we're short ¥200 million ($28 million).

175
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,840
Will you cover that? You got that kind of money?

176
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,020
Old Gan, why are you even telling the boy about this?

177
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,480
You didn't even finish college, and you're trying to lecture me?

178
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,280
What do you know?

179
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,340
Yang Yang.

180
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,600
Come outside. I need to talk to you.

181
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,700
Mom.

182
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,140
Sister Long Mei and I reviewed all companies going public this year.

183
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,100
Don't even think of his idea.

184
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,860
Given the current trend,

185
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,960
you surely won't get approval.

186
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,560
Yang Yang,

187
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,380
those two Hong Kong properties are in your name.

188
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,980
You're grown up now, almost graduated,

189
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,100
and you've got a girlfriend.

190
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,340
If something happens here, I don't want you involved.

191
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,480
I'll handle it.

192
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,480
What do you mean, Mom?

193
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,900
Of course, I'll deal with family matters.

194
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,020
I'd rather you didn't know any of this.

195
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,560
Why?

196
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,920
I know you.

197
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,140
Once you know, you'll rush back.

198
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,540
You'll stay and be by my side, just like now.

199
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,620
I don't want to derail your life.

200
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,880
Mom,

201
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,580
of course, I have to come back.

202
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,640
I know you're filial.

203
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,580
But you have your own life.

204
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,200
 Here. Congratulations to you. 

205
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,760
No, to us.

206
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,500
If not your insistence on doing short videos,

207
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,760
Matching wouldn't thrive today.

208
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,540
So what is your next plan?

209
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,940
Although with this funding,

210
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,100
we can make a big breakthrough in the U.S. market,

211
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,520
I think we can't neglect the domestic market.

212
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,760
Short videos do have a huge future.

213
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
Exactly.

214
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,200
That's what I think, too.

215
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,400
But I can't be in two places at once.

216
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,920
So I hope you'll go to the U.S.

217
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,519
and manage the business there.

218
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,400
Me? Go there?

219
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,200
I know your current job is great.

220
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,160
But working for others is not as good as your own.

221
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,700
What do you say?

222
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,240
But this is too sudden.

223
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,380
I need to think it over.

224
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,360
Is this still the Song Ming Mei I know?

225
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,060
Weren't you going to become an iron lady

226
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,100
before you turned 35?

227
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,260
With your fixed salary, when will you ever get there?

228
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,220
Are you attached to your current job?

229
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,160
Of course not.

230
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
If it's not the job, then is it someone?

231
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,360
Are you in love?

232
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,040
Not yet,

233
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,940
but soon.

234
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,480
Ming Mei,

235
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,840
Matching really needs you.

236
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,900
I can't trust anyone else with it.

237
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,520
How about this? Just give me some time.

238
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll consider it and give you an answer.

239
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,780
Okay. I'll wait for your reply.

240
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,840
Cheers.

241
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,900
Have some water.

242
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,780
You see,

243
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,260
on one hand, I have this amazing career opportunity.

244
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,940
On the other, I have my hard-to-get budding romance.

245
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,200
What do you think I should do?

246
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,620
It's really a tough choice.

247
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,540
If it were you,

248
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,200
which would you choose?

249
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,780
If it were me,

250
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,560
of course, I'd want the chance to go abroad,

251
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,540
but I could never abandon family or Gan Yang.

252
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,920
Anyone would struggle with this.

253
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,660
See?

254
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,460
You don't know, either.

255
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,780
Don't think about it for now.

256
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,300
It's almost Chinese New Year.

257
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,960
Come celebrate with my family.

258
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,180
No, thanks.

259
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,500
I prefer to spend it alone at home.

260
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
All right.

261
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,580
But I think if you really want to go, you should.

262
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,600
Do you support me?

263
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,020
We can't let ourselves regret it.

264
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,020
You're the best.

265
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,960
Take this.

266
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,780
Here, take it.

267
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,220
 Dinner is ready. 

268
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,760
 Come on. 

269
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,840
Put that over there.

270
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,280
Okay.

271
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Let's raise our glasses.

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,080
Happy Chinese New Year!

273
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,280
Here, this is your lucky money.

274
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,820
Tuck it under your pillow tonight.

275
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,300
Thanks, Mom.

276
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,560
No worries.

277
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,820
Mom, Happy Chinese New Year.

278
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Wish you good health and all the best.

279
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,740
Since when do youth give elders lucky money?

280
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,140
Silly Girl, I can't accept this.

281
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,520
I don't care about others.

282
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,420
My mom gets hers.

283
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,040
No.

284
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Just take it. Take a look.

285
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,480
So much?

286
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,560
You... I can't take it. It's too much!

287
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,340
Just keep it.

288
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,880
I know you're making money now,

289
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
and you're filial, but we still have debts to pay.

290
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
I can't take this money.

291
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,700
Listen to me first.

292
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,060
I might get a bonus this year.

293
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,100
Junior analysts usually don't get bonuses.

294
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,200
But my boss said since I've been doing the work of a senior analyst,

295
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,140
I'll get a bonus this year, too.

296
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,380
Based on past years,

297
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,580
it should be about two months' salary.

298
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,740
That means by next Chinese New Year, we will pay off all our debts.

299
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,900
That's great.

300
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,540
My girl is amazing.

301
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,980
Once we've paid off our debts,

302
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,780
I'll take you to Shanghai.

303
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,620
Let's eat, play, and experience all that

304
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,900
you've missed.

305
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,260
That will cost much money.

306
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,340
That's not for you to worry about.

307
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,860
When I get rich, I'll buy a place in Shanghai

308
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,460
and move you there permanently.

309
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,980
Then you can cook for me daily, and I will enjoy your cooking.

310
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,700
You'd get sick of it.

311
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,740
I'd never get tired of your cooking.

312
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,740
You're always such a sweet talker.

313
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,900
Let's eat.

314
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
So I'll keep this?

315
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,540
Keep it.

316
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,980
- Okay. 
 - I'll dig in.

317
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,420
Eat up, go on.

318
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,700
Come on, try the hairtail fish.

319
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,420
 Okay, you have some more, too. 

320
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,020
 Hairtail (cutlassfish). 

321
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,680
 Take a sip. 

322
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,600
Mom.

323
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,640
It seems Gan Kun Liang's estimate of 200 million was conservative.

324
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,940
Yang Yang, don't worry.

325
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,700
It probably won't be that much.

326
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Besides, everything is negotiable.

327
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
But, Mom,

328
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,580
no matter what, you absolutely can't listen to him.

329
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,520
Don't worry. I won't.

330
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,344
   

331
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,560
I'll step out for a call.

332
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,220
Tong Tong.

333
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,080
Happy Chinese New Year.

334
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,920
 Happy Chinese New Year. 

335
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,900
It's snowing here. Look.

336
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,500
Isn't it beautiful?

337
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,580
Have you had your Chinese New Year's Eve dinner?

338
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,055
I did.

339
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:19,200
How about you?

340
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,240
 Me, too. 

341
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,080
I was just out setting off fireworks and almost lit my hair on fire.

342
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,940
When are you coming over?

343
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,200
There's still some family business to handle.

344
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,220
I might not make it back in time.

345
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,200
What kind of business?

346
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,425
 Something with my mom's company. 

347
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:41,620
It's not a big deal, but I have to be there in person.

348
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,220
 Can you believe my mom? 

349
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,060
 I finally come back, 

350
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,580
and she won't let me leave until this gets done.

351
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,340
You have to be there in person?

352
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,860
Does that mean there's a dividend?

353
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,080
Are you about to get millions in lucky money?

354
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,160
More than that.

355
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,240
Look at the snow view here.

356
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,300
Isn't it beautiful?

357
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:04,498
I'm covered in snowflakes.

358
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,240
♫  The time and time  ♫

359
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,320
 Look. 

360
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
♫  For life and life  ♫

361
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,260
♫  I had it once. I lost it though  ♫

362
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,920
Tong Tong.

363
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,584
I miss you so much.

364
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:32,644
I miss you, too.

365
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,570
♫  Love in love  ♫

366
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,020
♫  So tell me you love me  ♫

367
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,770
♫  I see you  ♫

368
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,190
♫  The moment  ♫

369
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,470
♫  I live through your love  ♫

370
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,190
   

371
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:08,380
Open the door!

372
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,140
 Mr. Gan, hand over the company seal, 

373
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,100
 and we will let you out. 

374
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,160
 Nonsense! 

375
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,500
 Since when do I need your permission? 

376
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,360
-  To take what's mine?  
 - Sister Mei.

377
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,620
-  Hurry up and unlock this.  
 - What's going on?

378
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,140
-  You...  
 - Please talk some sense into your dad.

379
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,435
He... he took all the company's seals

380
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:22,620
and your two uncles.

381
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,080
So CEO Liu had no choice but to lock him in.

382
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,000
Why didn't you call the police?

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,260
CEO Liu wouldn't let us.

384
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,980
Hurry!

385
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,260
Gan Kun Liang, give the seals back now. Or I'm calling the police!

386
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,940
Yang Yang, listen to me.

387
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,080
Don't listen to your mom or Long Mei.

388
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,040
These women only see things one way.

389
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,100
They know nothing.

390
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,860
 I'm doing this for the company. 

391
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,188
 Come on, open the door, Yang Yang! 

392
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,640
   

393
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:49,520
- Mr. Gan. 
 - Hello, I need to report...

394
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,340
Yang Yang,

395
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,000
you can't call the police.

396
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,620
Your father is out on medical parole.

397
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,000
If you call the police, he will return to prison.

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
After all this, will you still protect him?

399
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
He's still your dad.

400
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,772
 Liu Yong Juan, what are you scheming? 

401
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:05,520
 Open this door! 

402
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,620
Gan Kun Liang, I've told you a million times.

403
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,720
I won't let you out until you return the seals!

404
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,620
- Found it? 
 - Yes.

405
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,960
Open the door.

406
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,963
- Hurry! 
 - Let's go.

407
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:17,720
Hurry. Don't move!

408
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,380
I'm telling you, I'm taking these seals.

409
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,500
Do you hear me? Don't move!

410
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,340
- Give them back! 
 - Hey!

411
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,500
- What are you doing? 
 - Give them back!

412
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,720
Gan Kun Liang, give them back!

413
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,760
Stop him!

414
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,900
- Let go! 
 - Don't move!

415
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,360
Stop right there! Let go!

416
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,600
Let go of me!

417
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
- Let go! 
 - Gan Kun Liang! Return them!

418
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,940
- Let... 
 - Let go!

419
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,380
Mom!

420
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,260
Kun Liang.

421
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,820
- Kun Liang, are you okay? 
 - Mom!

422
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,140
- Where are you hurt? 
 - He's hurt.

423
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,680
Mom!

424
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,380
Sister Mei, call an ambulance.

425
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,860
All right.

426
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,280
Here, sit down.

427
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,865
Mom, wake up.

428
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,400
The seals!

429
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,608
   

430
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,156
   

431
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,720
Yang Yang, have some water.

432
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,280
Yang Yang.

433
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,500
Actually, your mom hasn't been well for a long time,

434
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,920
and it's been getting worse recently.

435
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,500
I've told her repeatedly to get checked out.

436
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,620
But she always says she will wait until it's settled.

437
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,540
She told me not to tell you.

438
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,300
Sister Mei,

439
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,280
I feel like such a failure.

440
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,760
I didn't know Gan Kun Liang was out of prison.

441
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,720
I had no idea things at home were this bad.

442
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,540
I didn't even know my mom was sick.

443
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,300
Yang Yang, don't say that.

444
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,940
You've always been your mom's pride.

445
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,820
Do you know how thrilled she was

446
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,080
when your design won that award?

447
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,320
She told everyone about it.

448
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,420
Doctor, how's my mom?

449
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,500
The wound on her head has been cleaned and sutured.

450
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,940
Prevent infection in the coming days.

451
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,260
Understood.

452
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,460
But she also has a severe nerve axon injury.

453
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,740
She's still in a coma.

454
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,400
When will she wake up?

455
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,260
It's hard to say.

456
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,860
She could wake soon.

457
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,160
Could be... never.

458
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,660
So... prepare yourselves.

459
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,268
 Gan Kun Liang, you're suspected of fund-raising fraud. 

460
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:43,940
 - Come with us. 
 - I didn't break any laws! 

461
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,500
 - What are you doing? 
 - Why are you arresting me? 

462
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,480
 - Yang Yang. 
 - Why are you arresting my dad? 

463
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,080
 - Yang Yang. 
 - Why are you taking my dad? 

464
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,420
 Yang Yang. 

465
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,220
 Her husband ruined me! 

466
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,700
 You darn fraud! 

467
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,729
 Give me back my hard-earned money! 

468
00:27:57,729 --> 00:27:59,340
 - Pay up! Repay me! 
 - Give it back! 

469
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,700
 Tell me when you'll repay me! 

470
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,340
 These ¥200 are for your next semester's tuition. 

471
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,820
 These ¥200 are for Grandma's expenses this month. 

472
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,040
 This ¥100 is the red envelope for Lunar New Year. 

473
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,140
 It's also for Grandma. 

474
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,240
 As for this ¥100, I promised you a Megatron toy. 

475
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,200
 So this is for Megatron. 

476
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,980
 How much is left now? 

477
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,460
 Only ¥6 left. 

478
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,240
 These last ¥6 yuan are all we have left. 

479
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,320
 From that day on, 

480
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,120
 I swore 

481
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,280
 I'd become strong enough 

482
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,240
 to protect you. 

483
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,700
 Toes forward, yes. 
   

484
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,220
 And keep your distance in a straight line, 

485
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,660
 or you'll lose balance. 

486
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,280
 Okay, don't hyperextend your knees. 

487
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,740
 Relax your shoulders. Hold it. 

488
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,960
 Shoulders down. There you go. 

489
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,440
 Weight on your hips. 

490
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,740
 Okay, hold it. 

491
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,340
 Mom, haven't you been too busy lately? 

492
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,140
 I can go running by myself. 

493
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,120
 I'll be fine. You should rest more. 

494
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,500
 I want to get stronger with my dear son, too, okay? 

495
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,540
 Otherwise, when you grow up, what will I become? 

496
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,620
 I'll just become some old lady hobbling on crutches. 

497
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,800
 No way! 

498
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,760
 How about a race? 

499
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,060
 Let's see who reaches the finish line first. 

500
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,640
 - All right. 
 - Okay, come here. 

501
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,700
 Stand right here. 

502
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,660
 Align your feet, come on. 

503
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,140
 One. 

504
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,320
 Two! 

505
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,000
 Mom! You cheated! You jumped the start! 

506
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,400
 All is fair in war! 

507
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,880
 But today, I still failed. 

508
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,980
 I know. 

509
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,960
 No matter what happens... 

510
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,220
 in your heart... 

511
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,660
 I'll always be the son you're proud of. 

512
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,240
 I'm just so disappointed in myself. 

513
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,280
 Mom. 

514
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,740
 I'm sorry... 

515
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,860
 I didn't protect you well. 

516
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,940
Yang Yang, your dad's here.

517
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,140
Close the door.

518
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,060
What are you doing here?

519
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,600
Happy now with what happened to my mom?

520
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,020
Is this how you talk to me?

521
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,620
I'm your real father.

522
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,100
Can't you see I'm injured, too?

523
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,880
Without you, my mom wouldn't be hurt.

524
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,920
Listen, if she gets worse,

525
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,080
I won't let you off.

526
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:12,880
Enough. I can't be bothered with you.

527
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,860
With your mom like this, someone else needs to run the company.

528
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,100
All right, give me the company seals.

529
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,140
I'll handle everything. Fair?

530
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,760
You just focus on taking care of your mother.

531
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,160
So this is why you came.

532
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,280
Don't think I don't know what you want the seals for.

533
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,900
To falsify the books!

534
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,880
That's illegal.

535
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,460
I won't give you the seals.

536
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,360
You can forget it.

537
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,520
Gan Yang, Gan Yang,

538
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,900
I never thought I'd have such an ungrateful son!

539
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,640
Your mother and I are husband and wife. Would I ever do her wrong?

540
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,920
Look at the company's state.

541
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,020
What do you think we should do?

542
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,480
Who should take over? You or her?

543
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,420
Me.

544
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,280
I'll take care of it.

545
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,380
You? Did I hear that right?

546
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,380
Yang Yang, we're talking about 200 million.

547
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,040
Will investors believe a boy who hasn't even graduated from university?

548
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,220
Aren't you being naive?

549
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,100
Okay, you don't trust me. Fine.

550
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,780
I just thought of someone.

551
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,360
Don't you have a girlfriend working at some securities firm?

552
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,620
Perfect. Let's hear what she thinks.

553
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,300
She will be part of our family, right?

554
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,800
Let's see how much she loves you.

555
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,780
Let's go!

556
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,400
Yang Yang.

557
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,280
Boy, do you dare to lay a hand on me?

558
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,445
Let go. Let go!

559
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:40,965
Let...

560
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,680
If you show up in front of her,

561
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,440
I won't let you off.

562
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,040
So my son does have fears.

563
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,880
Here's the deal. Give me the seals, and this ends.

564
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,920
Think about it.

565
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,520
Let go.

566
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,800
Think about it, Son.

567
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,680
Yang Yang, should you tell your girlfriend so she can be prepared?

568
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,320
Your dad means what he says.

569
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,060
No need.

570
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,940
I will never let her get involved.

571
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,540
All right then.

572
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,100
Yang Yang.

573
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,160
Are you sure about taking over the company?

574
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,080
This company is Mom's life's work.

575
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,280
I won't let it go bankrupt.

576
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,740
One more thing, Yang Yang.

577
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,780
Your mother repeatedly said not to tell you.

578
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,260
But since you've decided,

579
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,920
you should know.

580
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,420
What is it?

581
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:09,640
Fangshi Capital just sent us a repurchase notice.

582
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,740
They're demanding full repayment in one lump sum.

583
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,840
A total...

584
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,880
of ¥150 million.

585
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,300
How long is the payment deadline?

586
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,480
Fifteen working days.

587
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,680
Sister Mei.

588
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,060
Please schedule a meeting with Fangshi Capital promptly

589
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,020
to apply for an extension

590
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,240
or installment payment.

591
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,760
Okay.

592
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,040
Also, contact the bank

593
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,600
about a potential loan.

594
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,640
We need contingency plans.

595
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,440
I'll get right on it.

596
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,220
Thanks.

597
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,280
 Hello, CEO Liu. 

598
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,360
 Why hasn't last quarter's payment come through? 

599
00:35:20,654 --> 00:35:22,314
Hello.

600
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,420
I'm CEO Liu's son.

601
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,260
My name is Gan Yang.

602
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,080
She's not available now.

603
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:34,140
I'll be handling the company matters.

604
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,365
 The payment can't exceed the contract deadline. 

605
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:38,060
You're right.

606
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,579
I'll have Manager Long make the payment to you promptly.

607
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,525
 Please do it quickly. We're in a hurry. 

608
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:45,164
Sure.

609
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:46,160
Thank you.

610
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
 No problem. 

611
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,880
 Hey, Yang Yang. I've scheduled a meeting with the bank people. 

612
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,910
 Tomorrow night at 8 p.m. at Baoli Grand Hotel. 

613
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,420
Okay. You'll come with me then.

614
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,580
 By the way, CEO Liu's assistant resigned today. 

615
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,900
 The company has been in a state of panic lately. 

616
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,780
 Brace yourself. 

617
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,956
 More people might quit soon. 

618
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:21,540
Okay.

619
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,080
I understand.

620
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,587
Sister Mei, please sell off all the properties under my name.

621
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,580
Price isn't a big deal.

622
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,660
Just get the money to the suppliers first.

623
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,687
We have to keep the production line going.

624
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:38,240
But CEO Liu left these for you to marry and have babies.

625
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
Are you sure about this?

626
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,060
I won't go back to Shanghai.

627
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,020
I'll tell her later

628
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,437
not to wait for me.

629
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,740
 Oh my goodness. You finally called me. 

630
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,501
 Are you done with family matters? 

631
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:16,366
I sent you today's test data. Did you check it?

632
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:19,880
I can't focus on R and D for a while.

633
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,100
 Now on, it's all on you. 

634
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,360
Sorry.

635
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,212
 Whoa. 

636
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,821
This sudden politeness is creepy.

637
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,854
Are you hiding something from me?

638
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,043
No.

639
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,780
Just a lot happens at home.

640
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,300
You made it sound like a deathbed farewell.

641
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,100
You scared me.

642
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,260
All right, I get it. You focus on your stuff. I'll handle the R&amp;D.

643
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,620
- I'm hanging up. 
 - Bye bye.

644
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:14,685
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

645
00:38:14,685 --> 00:38:19,795
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

646
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:23,735
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

647
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:29,245
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

648
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:30,945
♫  I wish I could stay with you  ♫

649
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:36,165
♫  To feel the lingering warmth of love  ♫

650
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:40,365
♫  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  ♫

651
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:42,305
♫  When it comes to love  ♫

652
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:46,620
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

653
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,755

00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:53,745
♫  Listen, the night sighs softly  ♫

655
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:56,765
♫  The rain clouds are approaching  ♫

660
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:16,385

Probably just the wind.

CEO Liu is sick.

I need to stay and handle company matters.

Do you want me to come and stay with you?

It's not serious.

 That's a relief.

 "Someone" by Tia Ray

♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

716
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:17,625
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

717
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:23,862
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

718
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:30,925
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

719
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:37,650
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

720
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:44,750
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

721
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:51,725
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

722
00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:58,825
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

723
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:05,367
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

724
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:12,652
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

725
00:43:12,652 --> 00:43:19,730
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

726
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:26,581
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

727
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:33,470
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

728
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:40,225
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

729
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:47,200
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

730
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:59,800
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
