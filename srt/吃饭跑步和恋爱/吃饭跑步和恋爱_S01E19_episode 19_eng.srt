 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,869
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,663
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:22,895
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,143
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:32,226
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:35,920
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,584
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:49,756
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,852
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,304
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:06,912
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:11,168
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,070
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,501
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,365
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,136
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:27,579
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:31,080
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,389
   
   

23
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:36,480
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,550
   

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:50,830


26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,620
Have some water.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,740
The afternoon schedule will be packed.

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,300
You might want to rest a bit now.

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm just here to visit.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,040
It shouldn't take much energy.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,180
Have you been to Beijing since graduation?

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,180
Yes, I have. Why wouldn't I?

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,420
I didn't mean anything,

34
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,400
just asking.

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,340
Director Ding, is this how you normally are at work?

36
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,860
Rest assured, CEO Gan.

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,660
I treat all clients equally.

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,320
Then take your time to get to know the current LT in Beijing.

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,740
Through everyone's relentless efforts,

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,240
LT DT6.0 has achieved great results. 
  

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,460
We've met our projected mid-term goals.

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,860
We should be proud of this.

43
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,420
Next, we need to make even better products,

44
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,180
Improve every design aspect and material used in the shoes. 
    

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,600
So I hope our upcoming R&amp;D should focus

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,080
on perfecting every minor detail of the shoe design,

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,880
while continuing to explore midsole technology.

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,840
From uppers to insoles, even the shoelaces,

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
all should be upgraded to the most user-friendly design.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,220
I believe consumers will see our sincerity

51
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,060
if we put our hearts into this.

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,020
   

53
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,260
   

54
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,420
 Are you available to meet? 

55
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,780
Sorry.

56
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,160
I happened to see it when I woke up.

57
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,520
How has Feng Sheng been lately?

58
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,540
He's doing well. Thanks for asking.

59
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,740
Hasn't he been living in Hong Kong?

60
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,240
No.

61
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
I thought you two were...

62
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,400
CEO Gan, are you very interested in our relationship?

63
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,200
Just checking up on old friends.

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,820
Nothing wrong with seeing old friends,

65
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,720
but showing concern for an ex-girlfriend seems a bit odd.

66
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,320
The place is quiet during the daytime.

67
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,460
But at midnight, a big group of goblins appear

68
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,080
in the corners, behind the stairs, on the levels,

69
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,040
and on the ceiling.

70
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,380
Read by yourself for now.

71
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,460
Hello?

72
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,520
 Director Song, CEO Deng went to the hotel. 

73
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,420
Okay, I see.

74
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,240
Who is it?

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,060
 Sir, your laundry is done. 

76
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,000
You've got the wrong person!

77
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,200
Wait a moment.

78
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,560
In a minute!

79
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,200
Who is it?

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,500
Ming Mei, Ming Mei!

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,420
No, don't!

82
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,980
- Ming Mei, are you insane? What are you doing? 
 - Who's the crazy one?

83
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,180
What's going on here?

84
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,460
Ming Mei, let me explain.

85
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,300
"Explain"? Does this need an explanation?

86
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,640
Talk to my lawyer.

87
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,100
- Ming Mei, give me another chance. 
 - What chance?

88
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,140
Another chance to cheat?

89
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,740
You'd better sign this,

90
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,940
or don't blame my ruthlessness.

91
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,000
 CEO Gan. 

92
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,580
It's just...

93
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
Spit it out.

94
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,180
Don't be so hesitant.

95
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,620
CEO Gan.

96
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,020
Be careful of Director Ding.

97
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,140
Just now, you fell asleep on the way.

98
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,920
I saw her trying to touch your face.

99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,220
- Really? 
 - Truly.

100
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,260
I wouldn't lie to you.

101
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,220
Don't let her take advantage of you.

102
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,200
What did you say?

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,700
Then why did you make that face?

104
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
You've been quite idle lately.

105
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,380
No, I've been really busy.

106
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,080
All right.

107
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,620
Help me check on Director Ding's situation since she has arrived in Hong Kong,

108
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,880
compile it into a report, and give it to me tomorrow morning.

109
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,500
Got it.

110
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,340
CEO Gan, which aspect do you mean?

111
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,180
What do you think?

112
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,400
I see. Rest assured.

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,900
I'll go back to the group and find the HR director soon.

114
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,180
He has a wide network.

115
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,740
I'll make sure to find out everything

116
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,220
about Director Ding's work situation, marriage, and social records,

117
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,460
including any males around her—

118
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,340
All right.

119
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Focus on driving.

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,620
Let's get ready. 
    

121
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,820
Just now, the leader talked to me.

122
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,740
He's taking this very seriously.

123
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,660
CEO Gan, here's the information you requested.

124
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,260
Got them in the shortest possible time.

125
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,440
Okay, I'll give you a bonus.

126
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,260
I'll get back to work then.

127
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,580
Go ahead.

128
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:57,800
Unmarried. 
    

129
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,240
   

130
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,180
The exclusive online broadcasting rights signing ceremony

131
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,380
for the 2024 World Trail Running Tour

132
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,860
has officially started.

133
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,540
CEO Gan, please look at the camera.

134
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,180
CEO Gan, please look this way.

135
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,300
CEO Gan, a quick glance here.

136
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,800
CEO Gan, over here.

137
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,850
Thank you.

138
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,060
   

139
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,520
   

140
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,660
CEO Gan, why is LT expanding its business into event broadcasting?

141
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,540
This is a new venture for us.

142
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,280
It's also a key part of LT's sports matrix.

143
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,060
 Tong Tong. 

144
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,180
 The lab is just the first step. 

145
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,620
 I want to also create a running shoe matrix, 

146
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
 integrating online and offline. 

147
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,120
 Only then can we make shoes that truly fit everyone. 

148
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,620
 Gan Yang, you've achieved all your dreams. 

149
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,580
 Do I really have to make you bow to more capital? 

150
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
My pleasure.

151
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,500
See that? LT has grown into a biting viper right under our noses!

152
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,532
Useless Idiots!

153
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:05,300
What good are any of you?

154
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,260
Cat got your tongues?

155
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,580
I heard Wang Group in Shanghai intends to enter the sports industry.

156
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,860
Their investment in Training Box was stopped by Gan Yang.

157
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,580
If we connect with Wang Group and secure their financing,

158
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,480
crushing LT again won't be a problem.

159
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,220
Is the information accurate?

160
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,660
My classmate works at the Wang Group.

161
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,680
It's solid intel.

162
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,620
Get right on it.

163
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,700
We must get Wang Group before Gan Yang says yes to them.

164
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,600
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Go now!

165
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,180
CEO Gan.

166
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,480
- Where is Director Ding? 
 - She had plans and left.

167
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,840
She said you can call her if you need anything.

168
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, I see.

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,840
You can go back to work.

170
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,120
   

171
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,000
   

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,820
   

173
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,540
He invited me to dine at his villa.

174
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,620
 This is a great opportunity. 

175
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,200
Play the emotional card and secure the big order.

176
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,620
I don't want to go.

177
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
Why not?

178
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
It's such a good time.

179
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,800
But I think

180
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,400
it was tough work for him until today.

181
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,680
Who has it easy?

182
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,060
It was hard for you to reach this level.

183
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,860
Come on. Don't soften up so quickly, Ding Zhi Tong.

184
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,900
He's just your ordinary client now,

185
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,420
and you're just a normal person striving for promotion and a raise.

186
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,740
Let me think about it.

187
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,317
Babe, dress up and bedazzle him.

188
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,900
Bye bye.

189
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,280
 Check this out: the dress and the coat. 

190
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,620
 Will this work for tomorrow? 

191
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,860
 Welcome to "Heart-to-Heart." 

192
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,700
 Let's connect our first listener. 

193
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,180
 Hello, Host. 

194
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,680
 My boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue. 

195
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,080
 One day he invited me to a candlelit dinner, 

196
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,320
 and the next day he vanished, and I couldn't contact him. 

197
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,040
 We've been together for three years. 

198
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,840
 I really can't let go. 

199
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,000
 I want to go find him and ask why. 

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,500
 I understood your question. 

201
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,580
 I think you shouldn't rush to ask him. 

202
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,140
 Instead, ask yourself 

203
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,380
 if the hurt he caused you is salvageable. 

204
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,320
 Ding Zhi Tong, stop being pathetic. 

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,040
Sir, make a U-turn up ahead.

206
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,720
But we're not at Landing Villas yet.

207
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,980
Change of plans.

208
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,600
We're going to Qingbei.

209
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,750
♫  Only after the burning, the fireworks come  ♫

210
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,890
♫  Beauty always comes with its cost  ♫

211
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,000
♫  Every fall brings scars but also gives me  ♫

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,156
 Bamboo Shoot with Pork Soup? 

213
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,925
 I knew you'd like this. 

214
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:34,625
♫  Even with twists, I'll keep running on  ♫

215
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,175
♫  I am not scared  ♫

216
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,950
   

217
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,360
♫  I think I can hold on  ♫

218
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,000
   

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
   

220
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,140
 Congratulations on the successful signing. 

221
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,850
♫  Time will simplify everything  ♫

222
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,425
♫  Joy and sorrow will eventually become  ♫

223
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:01,325
♫  A moment of memory  ♫

224
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:04,075
♫  But I want too much  ♫

225
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:08,575
♫  How can I stop?  ♫

226
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:09,380
♫  I accept the gap of losing  ♫

227
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,340
 Ding Zhi Tong, thank you. 

228
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,300
♫  After every gain  ♫

229
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,900
♫  The story twists and turns, but it isn't a fairy tale  ♫

230
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,560
 Ding Zhi Tong. 

231
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:25,720
♫  I matter most  ♫

232
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,200
 Will you run with me? 

233
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,420
 We will be together a long, long time. 

234
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,110
 Compared to it, the long-distance period 

235
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,960
 is nothing. 

236
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:41,425
♫  I allow moments of weakness  ♫

237
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:43,180
 I believe we will go through it together. 

238
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,525
♫  Pain and struggle  ♫

239
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:54,100
♫  If I can't forget, just let it be  ♫

240
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,675
♫  After taking some wrong turns  ♫

241
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:02,250
♫  Then I know where to go  ♫

242
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,440
♫  I'll arrive  ♫

243
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,980
 Here, take the jam. 

244
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,280
 Thanks. 

245
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,910
♫  By myself  ♫

246
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,800
 Ding Zhi Tong. 

247
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,260
 Ding Zhi Tong! 

248
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,080
 Ding Zhi Tong... 

249
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,100
 Ding Zhi Tong! 

250
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,260
 Ding Zhi Tong... 

251
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:01,620
Tong Tong?

252
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,560
- Tong Tong. 
 - Sorry.

253
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,580
Here, dry yourself.

254
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,140
Thank you.

255
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,280
You're already here.

256
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,340
Why did you cancel on me?

257
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,720
I... I suddenly didn't feel like going.

258
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm married now.

259
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,180
It's not proper for just us two to dine together.

260
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,860
Is that so?

261
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,240
I don't know why you brought me to Beijing.

262
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,400
But I'm only here for the Training Box Project.

263
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
Tong Tong,

264
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,280
must you always be like this?

265
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I haven't told you something.

266
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't want to hear it.

267
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,580
It's been so many years.

268
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,720
There's no need to mention it.

269
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,980
Tong Tong.

270
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:24,389
♫  I'm free as the wind  ♫

271
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:29,157
♫  Just like your gentleness I could not hold on to  ♫

272
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:34,926
♫  You push away when I reach out my hands  ♫

273
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:39,328
♫  Just leave. Don't look back  ♫

274
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:44,392
♫  Endless drifting, thirst for freedom  ♫

275
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:48,840
♫  Every storm of life I'll face alone  ♫

276
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,380
Here, have some alcohol if you're feeling down.

277
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,900
You're Senior Ding, right?

278
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,920
I saw you on the outstanding graduates board.

279
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,660
Here.

280
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,440
♫  I give you my hands, my true feelings  ♫

281
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,463
Thank you.

♫  I give you freedom, yet memories last  ♫

283
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,020
Sister, your boyfriend is so hot.

284
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,720
Have you been together since college?

285
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,280
How many years have you been together?

286
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Did you come here today to revisit old haunts?

287
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,840
I really envy you.

288
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,320
I'm about to graduate.

289
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm going back to my hometown,

290
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,800
but my boyfriend is staying in Beijing.

291
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,240
We will probably break up.

292
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,460
How did you two escape the curse of breaking up after graduation?

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,840
We broke up, too.

294
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,820
Senior,

295
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,460
 I think you two will get back together soon. 

296
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,720
 He hasn't left yet 

297
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,420
because he's worried you'll get caught in the rain.

298
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,740
 ­  

299
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,200
Senior?

300
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Senior!

301
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,780
 Senior! Your girlfriend is really drunk. 

302
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,100
How much for the drinks? I'll pay you.

303
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,440
Don't worry about it. She paid for all the drinks.

304
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,000
Okay.

305
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,920
Tong Tong.

306
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,180
Don't touch me.

307
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,420
Come on. Sit up.

308
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,080
Come on. Let's go.

309
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,320
Stand still. I'll get your bag.

310
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
Let's go.

311
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,920
Almost there. Come on.

312
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,240
I'm fine.

313
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,900
Don't...

314
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,820
We're here.

315
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,160
It's 90511.

316
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,720
That's my birthday!

317
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,080
Why do you use my birthday as the passcode?

318
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,460
You are not allowed to use it!

319
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,920
Fine.

320
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,800
I'll change it tomorrow, all right?

321
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's go, let's not get wet.

322
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,420
Come on.

323
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
It's okay.

324
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
Tong Tong, your coat is soaked.

325
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,360
Why don't you take it off?

326
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,980
Don't call me Tong Tong.

327
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,340
If I take it off or not is none of your business.

328
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,360
You'll catch a cold in wet clothes.

329
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
I won't take it off! Not your business!

330
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't want Gan Yang to see the dress underneath.

331
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,595
Go away!

332
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:00,395
Go away.

333
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,640
I want some water.

334
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,480
Okay, I'll get you some.

335
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,960
 Will this work for tomorrow? 

336
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,800
 Is that a new dress? 

337
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,240
 I got it just for this. 

338
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,280
 Elders like girls to look neat 

339
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,620
 so I went with a white dress. 

340
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,160
You're awake.

341
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,940
Perfect timing. Food's ready.

342
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,940
Come eat some.

343
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,900
Sorry for the trouble last night.

344
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,500
It's nothing. Here, have some soup.

345
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,220
It'll help the hangover.

346
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,200
Did I say anything strange yesterday?

347
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,500
Strange words?

348
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,080
I talk nonsense when I'm drunk.

349
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,680
Whatever I said, don't take it seriously.

350
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,660
Is there something you don't want me to hear?

351
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,760
I'm afraid I might have said something inappropriate,

352
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,040
offended you, or angered you.

353
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,060
After all, you are my biggest client now, CEO Gan.

354
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,960
I've been to many places with you these past few days.

355
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,120
I think LT Group has expanded its business a bit too widely.

356
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,360
Only the factories and stores are profitable right now.

357
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
If you took external funding...

358
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,240
I didn't bring you to Beijing to hear this.

359
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,880
Then what do you want to hear?

360
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,400
Seems you've forgotten after all.

361
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,240
All the stores, factories, labs,

362
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,660
Training Box, livestream platforms,

363
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,720
and the Designer Union website,

364
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,440
all these industries together

365
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,320
make the running shoe matrix I mentioned back then.

366
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,880
I won't let any capital influence it.

367
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,320
It must continue to develop

368
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,080
as I envisioned.

369
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,340
But voting rights and board seats

370
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,240
are negotiable with the Wang Group.

371
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,460
It won't affect the matrix.

372
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,500
Ding Zhi Tong, drop this project.

373
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,820
My company also has investment and financing projects.

374
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,860
I want you to handle all of them.

375
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,900
I know you've always aimed for MD.

376
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,740
Tong Tong, I remember everything you've said.

377
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,080
In that case,

378
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,320
we have nothing more to discuss.

379
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,640
I'll go back to the hotel.

380
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,420
I have other work to do.

381
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,460
I know you didn't marry Feng Sheng.

382
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,240
And I was never with Xu Chen Xi.

383
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,560
That was all a lie

384
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,600
to push you away.

385
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,740
Tong Tong,

386
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,060
to me,

387
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,260
nothing between us has changed.

388
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,980
I've never stopped loving you.

389
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,940
Your relationship with Xu Chen Xi means nothing to me.

390
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,040
You haven't changed,

391
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,640
but I have.

392
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,360
I've already married Feng Sheng.

393
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,660
So please...

394
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,280
Stop interfering in my life!

395
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,860
You haven't.

396
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,500
You're not married.

397
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,300
Your company profile says you're unmarried.

398
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,420
During your five years at Gutong Securities,

399
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,960
no one has ever seen Feng Sheng!

400
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,160
And he's in the U.S., not Hong Kong!

401
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,420
No one has ever seen his girlfriend!

402
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,680
Am I right?

403
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,400
We're in a secret marriage.

404
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,120
Do I need to explain that to you?

405
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,480
I've often flown to the U.S. in the last few years to see him.

406
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,580
Check my flight records if you don't believe me.

407
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,300
You're lying.

408
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,140
Believe what you want.

409
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,880
You tried to touch my face in the car that day.

410
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,920
You went to the convenience store,

411
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,280
and you wore the white dress.

412
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,820
You did all this because you still love me.

413
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,780
I don't believe you feel nothing for me.

414
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,100
Seems I played my part well.

415
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,520
What do you mean?

416
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,200
What do I mean?

417
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,140
I mean it was all an act.

418
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,320
It was all fake. I was just lying!

419
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,520
It was all for the Training Box Project.

420
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,960
The white dress,

421
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,340
the "chance encounter" at the convenience store,

422
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,880
getting drunk and crazy,

423
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,400
I did all this for Training Box!

424
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,480
I wanted to soften you up!

425
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,640
I thought I'd wake to a signed financing contract

426
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,660
on the nightstand.

427
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,940
Seems I don't know you as well as I thought.

428
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,460
Your heart is harder than I realized.

429
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,560
I refuse to believe you've become like this.

430
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,760
It's been six years.

431
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,720
You think you still know me?

432
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,560
For work,

433
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,740
I'll do whatever it takes.

434
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,060
Then call Feng Sheng now.

435
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,160
Let me ask him.

436
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,820
Haven't you made enough of a scene, Gan Yang?

437
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,960
Call Feng Sheng then what?

438
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,680
Force him to divorce me?

439
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,100
Even if we divorce, it won't be you.

440
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,360
If not for Training Box,

441
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,760
I wouldn't even want to see you.

Let's go.

Are you sure this is the right way?

483
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,880
This doesn't look familiar at all.

484
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,260
All right, Missy. I'll use the navigation then.

485
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,640
To Oriental Manhattan.

486
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,660
That car behind us seems to be tailing us.

487
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,500
It's from Gan Yang's company.

488
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,880
I thought you two fought in Beijing.

489
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,920
Why is he still tailing us?

490
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,080
Just ignore him. Keep driving.

491
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,300
Let's see how long he can last.

492

493
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,249
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

494
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:15,749
Come on.

495
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,720
Gan Yang, why are you following me here?

496
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,220
Following you?

497
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,860
Do you live here?

498
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,880
So do I.

499
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
I bought it two years ago.

500
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,400
You knew this was my dream neighborhood.

501
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,840
Did you do this on purpose?

502
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,080
What did I do on purpose?

503
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,540
Ding Zhi Tong,

504
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,100
I can live wherever I want.

505
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,960
I don't need your approval.

506
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,360
If it bothers you so much, you're free to move.

507
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,780
No one is stopping you.

508
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,120
CEO Gan, you're really nostalgic.

509
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,820
Tong Tong, let's not be like him.

510
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,560
We need to move forward.

511
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,740
Don't waste your anger on someone who doesn't matter,

512
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,020
not worth it.

513
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,040
You're right.

514
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,540
Let's go.

515
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,340
Calm down.

516
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,320
Don't waste your emotions on an ex.

517
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,820
Just pretend he is like the air you don't see.

518
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,080
Or you could move in with me.

519
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,640
So you don't bump into him and be annoyed.

520
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,100
Tong Tong?

521
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,700
No need, that's too much trouble.

522
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,520
I'll just pretend he is like the air.

523
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,740
Your husband seems quite good.

524
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,960
But listen, if he ever wrongs you,

525
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,780
make sure he leaves with nothing!

526
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,300
We're finalizing it tomorrow.

527
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,820
I didn't know marrying abroad would be such a hassle.

528
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,460
Divorce would have to be done abroad too.

529
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,880
What are you talking about?

530
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,520
You can't say things like that.

531
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,420
I'm really getting a divorce.

532
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,300
He cheated on me.

533
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,360
My people and I caught him in the act.

534
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,240
I even slapped the divorce agreement in his face.

535
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,840
Really?

536
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,580
Ming Mei.

537
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,640
Help me take care of Yu Lin the next few days.

538
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
She's been asking to see you.

539
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,900
Don't worry. I'm here.

540
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,420
I'm fine.

541
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,720
It's just that I always thought I had good judgment.

542
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,980
Turns out I was wrong.

543
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,260
It's okay.

544
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:50,040


545
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:01,650
♫  For you  ♫

546
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,210
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

547
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:19,410
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

548
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:28,260
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

549
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:34,497
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

550
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:41,560
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

551
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:48,485
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

552
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:55,485
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

553
00:38:55,485 --> 00:39:02,560
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

554
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:09,560
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

555
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:16,102
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

556
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:23,320
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

557
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:30,420
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

558
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:37,316
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

559
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:44,305
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

560
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:50,760
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

561
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:58,035
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

562
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:08,030
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
