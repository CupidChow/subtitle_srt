 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,200
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,930
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,890
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,580
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,340
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,900
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,360
   
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,500
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,900
   

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,220
Director Qi, why did you put an idle person under my charge?

26
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,860
Am I in charge of idle employees?

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,640
She asked to come to your team.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,420
It's the pressure from the higher-ups.

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,460
I can't help it, either.

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,100
The regular meeting is over, but she didn't arrive yet.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,720
What is Xu Chen Xi's background?

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,560
 ­  

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,500
 As long as you tear her disguise in front of Gan Yang, 

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 and use that opportunity, 

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,160
 Gan Yang will be all yours. 

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,100
As long as she stays within the lines, I can let her stay.

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,020
But if she crosses my bottom line,

38
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,000
you know my temper.

39
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,340
I understand.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,300
But don't be too tough on her.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,420
She must have connections among higher-ups.

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,020
So we should cover her a bit to answer to the higher-ups.

43
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,580
You can flatter the higher-ups while I suffer.

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,840
You sure know how to play your cards right.

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,980
Hi, Guan Guan—

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,460
I...

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,940
Xu Chen Xi?

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,020
Why are you here?

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,540
Why can't I be here if you are?

50
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,580
What a jinx.

51
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,820
A new analyst will come soon.

52
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,660
Help her get familiar with our project

53
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,340
and help her start as soon as possible.

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,760
Okay.

55
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,540
Come in.

56
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,460


57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,700
Hello, Director Dai.

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,320
I am Ding Zhi Tong, the new junior analyst.

59
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,980
Hello, Director Dai. I am the new intern, Xu Chen Xi.

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,900
I heard you are this year's outstanding graduate from Qingbei University?

61
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,940
Yes.

62
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,220
I was also an outstanding graduate of Qingbei University.

63
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,900
I graduated ten years ago.

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,380
Ten years have passed.

65
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,860
Qingbei's teaching quality should have improved greatly.

66
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,960
Rest assured, Director Dai.

67
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,080
I'll surely work hard and live up to Qingbei's good name.

68
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,700
As expected of a Qingbei University graduate.

69
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,140
Director Dai, I'm—

70
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,260
Why I asked you two to report in so urgently

71
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,820
is because one of my accounts, a natural gas public company,

72
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,940
is doing private placement financing, and we are short a junior analyst.

73
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,180
Since you joined the team suddenly,

74
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,620
I won't arrange too much work for you.

75
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,420
Focus on this project first.

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,940
Jia Fan, assign the work.

77
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,860
This is all the information

78
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,060
about Guanghua Energy's natural gas private placement (investment).

79
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,420
Get familiar with it soon.

80
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,860
There's so much...

81
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,620
Is there any problem?

82
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,180
No.

83
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,300
   

84
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,340
   

85
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,620
   

86
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,660
   

87
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,900
   

88
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,680
   

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,760
It's impressive, isn't it?

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,120
The rebound rate is unparalleled.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,320
There is still room for improvement.

92
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,020
Stop pretending to be unimpressed.

93
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,780
A rebound rate of 80% is maxed.

94
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,580
But I think the cost is still too high.

95
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,740
Just a small piece of it cost us ¥10,000.

96
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,460
It's hard to have mass production.

97
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,500
Then let's make it a special-order product.

98
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,220
I believe as soon as it is released...

99
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,600
- countless... 
 - Wang Yi.

100
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
Did you forget our goal of making shoes?

101
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,740
Hello?

102
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,220
What's wrong? Did anything happen?

103
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,425
It's from Shuchi.

104
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:06,300
   

105
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,980
He made an appointment and was waiting for three hours.

106
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, I understand.

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,880
Director Zhan! You're back.

108
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,160
Please give me ten minutes.

109
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,940
I'd like to know why Shuchi suddenly stopped

110
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,100
funding our research and development.

111
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,140
Your R and D cost is too high.

112
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,980
It's impossible for mass production.

113
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,460
It's good for youth to have ideas.

114
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,780
But you are not professional enough.

115
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,800
We're already working on the cost issue.

116
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,060
I believe we can resolve it soon.

117
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,340
Please spare us some time.

118
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,820
"Resolve it"?

119
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,860
Yes.

120
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,540
How will you resolve it?

121
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,220
Do you really think you are a genius?

122
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,160
Without the investment from Shuchi, you are nobody. Understand?

123
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,020
Since you don't believe in us, why buy our design?

124
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,380
As a responsible enterprise,

125
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,300
maintaining a good public image is also important.

126
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,860
Do you think after we bought your design, we should manufacture it?

127
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,740
Do you know that adding a new product line

128
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,500
requires countless evaluations?

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,420
It's not child's play.

130
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,380
I've seen many college students like you!

131
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,660
Slogans are all you've got.

132
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,020
Have you really devised a realistic plan?

133
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,740
You publicly breached the contract,

134
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,500
yet you still want to maintain a good image?

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,660
You haven't made any research progress so as the investor,

136
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,620
I have the right to stop funding, understand?

137
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,820
Security! See him out.

138
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,380
I hope you won't regret it.

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,860
I've read the information about Guanghua Energy.

140
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,040
So fast? You took only two days.

141
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm a fast reader.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,300
Then read it again and check for any typos.

143
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,140
If there are, correct them.

144
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,940
All the typos have been corrected and tagged.

145
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,680
This is the latest version. Please review.

146
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,460
This version of the Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)

147
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,140
has the reporting date of December 30 last year.

148
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,500
All the financial and business data in it have expired.

149
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,460
Update all the financial and business information of Guanghua Energy.

150
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,960
I believe you know how to find data, right?

151
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,780
Get to it.

152
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,300
   

153
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Hello.

154
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,780
Tong Tong, where are you?

155
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,700
 I'm at home. 

156
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,740
 I was about to freshen up and go to bed. 

157
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,860
Are the lights in your bathroom so bright?

158
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,040
You have such sharp eyes.

159
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
I didn't mean to lie to you.

160
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm still at work doing overtime.

161
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,540
I'm afraid you might worry.

162
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,380
Why are you so busy?

163
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,240
Hetai uses the last-place elimination system.

164
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,140
They rate employees every week.

165
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,120
It lasts six months.

166
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,900
My boss, Dai Bo La, is very strict.

167
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,200
I heard if our rating isn't four stars,

168
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,100
we get kicked out of the project team.

169
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,140
I heard that's why the previous junior analyst got fired.

170
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,800
 Tong Tong, you are great at studying. 

171
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
Over the four years in college,

172
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,580
you were among the top three students.

173
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,920
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
But I joined late.

175
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,920
The private placement project is faster than a stock launch.

176
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,930
Before I came, they already finished due diligence on the project,

177
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,920
and it was established.

178
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
Now it's the second stage.

179
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,600
If I can't get the project core at this stage, my work will be in vain.

180
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,760
I don't want to just stay at the project sidelines.

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,120
In that case,

182
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,480
have you considered changing project teams?

183
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,000
That won't do. I've already inquired.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,320
My boss, Dai Bo La,

185
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,900
has many projects, high performance, and many bonuses.

186
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,460
So I must follow such a leader to make good money

187
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,040
on a good career path.

188
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,980
So money-minded.

189
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:55,660
I don't work so late every day. Today is an exception.

190
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,360
I've been going home on time so far.

191
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,240
Tong Tong, I disagree with your work style.

192
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,800
It's really tough.

193
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,560
And it's so late now.

194
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,240
It's not safe for you to go home alone.

195
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,680
Well, I just started this job.

196
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,700
I'll ease up when my boss sees my value.

197
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,200
Are you sure you won't get busier by then?

198
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,560
Wouldn't the bonus also get bigger?

199
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,320
Before you make money, care for your health.

200
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,660
Good health is required for any revolution.

201
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,540
- Got it? 
 - Okay, I'll run whenever I have time.

202
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,120
Keep up the good work, Tong Tong.

203
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,900
Don't stay up all night.

204
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,680
You, too. I miss you.

205
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,040
Remember to miss me, too. Good night.

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,600
Bye bye.

207
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,300
What time is it?

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,300
It's past 11 p.m.

209
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
Are you running this late?

210
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,360
I'll go and run a few laps.

211
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,560
If you want to sleep, go to the bedroom.

212
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,440
You might catch a cold here.

213
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,700
I'm so stressed.

214
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,360
If we don't receive new funding, our research has to stop again.

215
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't worry.

216
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
It's useless to worry.

217
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,180
Your idea is on the right track.

218
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,400
It's just on the verge of success.

219
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,860
Besides, Shuchi is not China's only shoe manufacturer.

220
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,860
We will find a way.

221
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,060
I'll go run a few laps.

222
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,840
Don't wait for me.

223
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,600
   

224
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,920
   

225
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,600
It's so late already, and she's still working overtime.

226
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,700
Just putting on a show, I reckon.

227
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,740
If you catch a cold, Gan Yang will feel sorry for you.

228
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,700
No such luck!

229
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,360
Good evening.

230
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,180
Professor Qin, what would you like today?

231
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,380
Professor Qin!

232
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,920
Professor Qin!

233
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,540
What a coincidence.

234
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,980
I ordered many dishes.

235
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,780
Why don't you sit and eat with me?

236
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,540
Do you wait for me on purpose?

237
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,820
I didn't!

238
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,260
I just wanted to try out your extremely spicy set.

239
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,980
Have a seat!

240
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,620
I don't know if you like them.

241
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,120
Try them.

242
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,120
Professor Qin.

243
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,700
Actually, there is a question I wanted to ask you long ago.

244
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,900
Go ahead.

245
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,260
You were doing really well in the financial world.

246
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,500
You're at your career peak. Why did you choose

247
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,900
to teach at our college?

248
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,160
I can't figure it out no matter what.

249
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,380
My father got sick the year before last.

250
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,260
He feared it would affect my job,

251
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,140
and he hid it from me.

252
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,020
It wasn't until his condition worsened

253
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,840
that he finally told me.

254
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,700
So I quit my job and returned to Beijing.

255
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,660
How about now?

256
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,600
Is he cured?

257
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,780
That's good.

258
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,920
But Professor Qin, have you ever considered this?

259
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,980
Even if you didn't come back,

260
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,420
your father may still have recovered.

261
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,620
Isn't it a pity to give up your bright future?

262
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,600
Not everything can be measured by money.

263
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,840
I really envy you.

264
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,260
You have a more important goal in life than money.

265
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,020
Here. Eat up.

266
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,440
Okay.

267
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,460
Yes, I'll give you feedback after reading it.

268
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,780
I'll contact you later.

269
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,940
Sister Qin Yu, my database

270
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,340
is missing an industry research report for the natural gas industry.

271
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,180
Can I ask the Industry Research Department for it?

272
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,260
It's not there?

273
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,840
I remember I saw it days ago.

274
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,680
It's not there.

275
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,420
Industry Research Department should have backups.

276
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,900
You can report to Compliance.

277
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,700
Then go see Han Tao from Financing.

278
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,320
But he is a bit hard to deal with.

279
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,740
Be careful when talking to him.

280
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,380
Got it.

281
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,780
Go there in the afternoon.

282
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,740
Their department has meetings in the morning.

283
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,880
Thank you, Sister Qin Yu.

284
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,580
You are welcome.

285
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,680
Have you finished updating the memorandum?

286
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,320
I just need the industry research report to finish it.

287
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,680
Impressive.

288
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,080
I just collected the information.

289
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,560
No technical expertise is required.

290
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,080
How about you? Have you finished investigating the investors' turnover?

291
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,040
I've completed my part for three investors, reviewed it,

292
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,820
and uploaded it to the database.

293
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,460
Then can I see the information?

294
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,800
Sure. You are also a project team member.

295
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,980
I'll send it to you now.

296
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,240
I've given you all the information for this project.

297
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
But the database lacks an industry research report.

298
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Could you give me a copy?

299
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,400
That's your problem!

300
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,320
If everyone in the company is sloppy like you,

301
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,720
and come ask me for another copy,

302
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,320
then I don't need to do anything else today,

303
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,460
and just help you?

304
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,080
Brother Tao!

305
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,840
Angry isn't good for your health. Have some coffee.

306
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,120
Don't scare our new colleagues.

307
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
Have a drink.

308
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,780
I've sent the information to your email.

309
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,340
Thanks.

310
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,920
Why did you join Hetai Securities suddenly?

311
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,220
Did something happen at Wendao Capital?

312
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,520
I just go into the industry for more experience.

313
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,220
Hetai is one of China's largest investment banks.

314
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,300
The people and things I can experience here are unmatched elsewhere.

315
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,220
I thought you always wanted to join Investment Banking Department?

316
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,560
Industry Research is also good.

317
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,200
Imran Khan from Credit Suisse

318
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,300
also switched from Industry Research to Investment Banking.

319
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,520
How about you? Is it going well in Investment Banking?

320
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm doing well.

321
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,820
I'm just a little busy.

322
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,300
I heard you work under Jia Fan.

323
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,000
Jia Fan joined the company at 27 years old.

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
This year marks his third year as a project manager.

325
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,480
It's quite critical to him.

326
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,860
What do you mean?

327
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,180
He can't get promoted further,

328
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,320
and his salary is higher than the new analyst.

329
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
If the company, in this year's second half

330
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,320
or next year's start, conducts a layoff,

331
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,660
he might be on the list.

332
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,560
So he worries most

333
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,320
that once he trains you, it will harm him.

334
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,480
Some time ago, an employee was kicked out of Dai Bo La's team.

335
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,300
He was behind it.

336
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,900
So be wary of his tricks.

337
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,600
Thank you for helping me.

338
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,320
We are old classmates, no need to thank me.

339
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,400
Maybe at times, I'll need your help.

340
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,960
Get back to work now, or he might bother you.

341
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,440
Then I'll leave first. Keep up the good work!

342
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,360
Okay.

343
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,100
Ding Zhi Tong!

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,600
We're still friends, right?

345
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,300
Of course.

346
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,260
That's good.

347
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,260
 Feng Sheng. 

348
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,960
 You didn't come for a few days. 

349
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,000
 Here you are, the handouts and notes from each subject. 

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,940
 Are these for me? 

351
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:55,200
 - Thank you. 
 - It's fine. We are friends, right? 

352
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
 - Hurry and take a look. 
 - Zhi Tong. 

353
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,960
 Please help me solve this problem. 

354
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,440
 But I don't know which to use first. 

355
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
 You can follow this. 

356
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,340
 Use this first, right? 

357
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,800
Hello.

358
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,720
Now?

359
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,960
I'll have an online meeting in 20 minutes. I can't make it over there.

360
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Can I come tomorrow?

361
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll check my time.

362
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,060
If this won't work, it'll have to be the day after tomorrow.

363
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,720
Bye bye.

364
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,800
What's wrong, Sister Qin Yu?

365
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,800
The bank asked me for a document.

366
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,040
But I'm too busy to go.

367
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,761
Can you let others fetch it for you?

368
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:52,720
Forget it.

369
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,060
Jia Fan will make a scene if he doesn't see you here later.

370
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,920
I've finished all he assigned me.

371
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,480
And he will also go out later.

372
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
He will sign a subscription agreement with Directors Dai and Zhang.

373
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,840
It's fine if I get back before he returns.

374
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,080
Then I'll leave it to you.

375
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,060
Ask for Xiao Li at the bank on Zhaohui Road.

376
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,320
I'll tell her about it in advance.

377
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,600
Okay.

378
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,920
Thank you, Zhi Tong.

379
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,580
No worries.

380
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,680
Sister Qin Yu, I'm here.

381
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,600
I'll wait for her in the lounge for a bit.

382
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,240
 Thank you for your help. 

383
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,820
Doesn't it look nice? I just bought it yesterday from Hong Kong.

384
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,340
You had such a wonderful annual vacation.

385
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,840
You went to Macao and Hong Kong.

386
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,440
You can also go there on your annual vacation. It was really fun.

387
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,720
Then I'll give you a guide. You can just follow it and have fun.

388
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,820
By the way, I brought you a local specialty. Come to my desk later for it.

389
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,360
What is it?

390
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,480
You'll know when you come get it.

391
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,245
- You're so mysterious. 
  - This accent and this person... 

392
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,120
 This information is very important. You must keep it safe. 

393
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,820
 The video was provided the day before yesterday. 

394
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,160
 But the bank staff who provided the video was on annual vacation. 

395
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,020
 Thus, bank statements provided by Director Zhang may be fake. 

396
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:21,275
   

397
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:34,520
Hello?

398
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,940
Sister Qin Yu, are Director Dai and the others still at the office?

399
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,340
They already set out to Director Zhang's Company.

400
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,680
Judging by time, they might arrive soon.

401
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,120
Is there any way to contact them?

402
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
I kept calling, but no one answered.

403
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,560
When they sign contracts with the investor,

404
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,400
Director Dai usually asks them to mute their phones.

405
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,840
What's wrong?

406
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,260
Director Zhang's bank statement may have problems.

407
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,100
Mister, is there a traffic jam?

408
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,820
 Yes, look at the congestion. 

409
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,420
 I fear we can't go within 20 minutes. 

410
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,480
Please let me out.

411
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,594
How much is it? I'll pay you.

412
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:12,160
Okay. It's 38 yuan.

413
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,360
Director Zhang, this is our agreement.

414
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,800
We sent you the electronic version for confirmation before.

415
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,940
You can check it again.

416
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,080
If there is no problem, we can sign the contract.

417
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,600
All right.

418
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,290
   

419
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,200
Director Dai! 
    

420
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
You can't sign it.

421
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,120
Fake bank statements?

422
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,060
It's a serious charge.

423
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,300
Do you have any evidence?

424
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,700
I heard it with my own ears.

425
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,660
The staff in Director Zhang's video of bank statements

426
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,400
just returned from her annual vacation in Hong Kong.

427
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,060
And she just came back yesterday.

428
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,900
We can confirm that by checking with the bank.

429
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,260
So she couldn't have pulled the statements the day before yesterday.

430
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,660
The video is surely not from the day before yesterday.

431
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,200
Is this your first day at work?

432
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,460
You let the investor make such important bank statements himself?

433
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,880
Have you lost your mind?

434
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,920
Director Dai, I'm sorry.

435
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,280
I had too much work

436
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,260
so I didn't have time to go there.

437
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,280
I gave you an assistant. Why didn't you let her help?

438
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,260
Don't think I don't know what's on your mind.

439
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,980
If this happens again, you get lost immediately.

440
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,080
Ding Zhi Tong.

441
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,900
Go on a business trip with me tomorrow.

442
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,800
I'll see you at 10 a.m. at the airport.

443
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,840
Is there any problem?

444
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,680
No. I'll arrive on time.

445
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,560
Go out.

446
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
 I've received a five-star rating. 

447
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,600
Sister Qin Yu said this is the first time that Director Dai

448
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,760
rated a new employee five stars in the first week.

449
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,320
You saved her project and her reputation.

450
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,500
Surely she would give you five stars.

451
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,760
And I can go on a business trip with them this week.

452
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
Do you know what this means?

453
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,240
It means you've entered the core project.

454
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,640
 Tong Tong. 

455
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,300
You've said it 800 times.

456
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,280
I'm just happy.

457
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm also happy for you.

458
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,600
This means your efforts are worth it.

459
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,640
But Tong Tong, I still have to say this.

460
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,220
Before doing your job well,

461
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,920
you should care well for your health.

462
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,060
It took you only 30 minutes

463
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,240
to cover a 45 minutes distance to run.

464
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,680
You are sacrificing your health.

465
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,760
But I'm all safe and sound.

466
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,720
Even if I get injured, this result is worth it too.

467
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,280
You don't take your body seriously.

468
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,840
Let's skip this topic.

469
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,760
Gan Yang.

470
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,880
Thank you.

471
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,560
If you hadn't given me shoes and taught me how to run,

472
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,760
it wouldn't have gone well.

473
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,480
So you can have half my credit.

474
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,900
Okay.

475
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,380
Tong Tong,

476
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,680
why did you believe

477
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,760
you could do the journey in 30 minutes?

478
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,480
I'll never know if it's possible unless I try.

479
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,280
My life creed is never giving up until the last moment.

480
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,380
Gan Yang.

481
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,040
Gan Yang. What are you thinking of?

482
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,860
You are right.

483
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,900
Until the last moment,

484
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,900
we should never give up.

485
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,740
Tong Tong,

486
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
thank you.

487
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,180
Why is it broken?

488
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,440
 Is Ms. Ding Zhi Tong at home? 

489
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,320
Coming.

490
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,280
- Hello. 
 - Are you Ms. Ding Zhi Tong?

491
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,560
- Yes. 
 - Please sign for this luggage.

492
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,720
I didn't buy luggage.

493
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,440
Mr. Gan Yang asked me to send this.

494
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,580
- Thanks. 
 - Welcome.

495
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:27,800
   

496
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,080
   

497
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,560
   

498
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,500
   

499
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,740
You want me to wear your shoes to run the College Marathon League?

500
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,200
- Right. 
 - I know your family produces shoes.

501
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,000
But I can't wear just any shoes for the competition.

502
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,160
It may affect my performance.

503
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,380
Anyway, I already brought my shoes here.

504
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,400
You can start wearing it while training today.

505
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,180
If you are dissatisfied within the period,

506
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,800
you can terminate our contract anytime.

507
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
I'm not a seeded player.

508
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,020
I don't even have a team behind me.

509
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,540
I don't think I'll get any good results.

510
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,760
You won't benefit from it much, right?

511
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,480
I know you are not a seeded player.

512
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,820
But if a non-seeded player can wear our shoes,

513
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,580
and win the competition, doesn't that show how good our shoes are?

514
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,780
You wear my shoes.

515
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,440
I'll help you improve your performance.

516
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,480
We benefit mutually.

517
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,940
Isn't this good?

518
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,720
Okay, I believe you.

519
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,120
The meeting is at 3 p.m. Qin Yu will do the presentation.

520
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,860
Before the meeting, you three read all the information.

521
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,960
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

522
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,345
   

523
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:53,125
♫  Feeling the morning breeze  ♫

524
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:58,875
♫  The sweat on my forehead is the morning dew  ♫

525
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:02,900
♫  It lets me release all my worries  ♫

526
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,560
   

527
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,540
 It doesn't quench the thirst like spring water. 

528
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,400
   

529
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,040
   

530
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,320
 I'm about to fly to the next city. 

531
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,560
 Our competition was a big success. 

532
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,640
 My exam results are also very good. 

533
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,800
 Hope to see you soon. 

534
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,920
You still have time to enjoy your relationship?

535
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,620
Because Wu Xun won the championship, it even brought Shuchi back to us.

536
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,120
But you rejected them. What's on your mind actually?

537
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,500
What do you mean, Brother?

538
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,240
We're short of money now.

539
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,700
We shouldn't be so demanding, okay?

540
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,000
Can you please calm down?

541
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,240
Now these brands are all rushing in.

542
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,040
If we encounter any problems then,

543
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,080
will they run away altogether like Shuchi did?

544
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,260
Good things are worth the wait.

545
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,220
Be patient.

546
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,940
Where are you going?

547
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,660
I'm going for a run.

548
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,400
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

549
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,560
Why are you following me?

550
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,600
Mister. You misunderstood.

551
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,880
I'm just looking at the rare shoes you're wearing.

552
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,740
I wondered what brand it is.

553
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,080
I wanted to see.

554
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,720
What do you mean?

555
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,620
There is a shovel-shaped carbon plate underneath your shoes.

556
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,180
But when you run,

557
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,520
it doesn't conform to the shovel-shaped carbon plate.

558
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm just curious.

559
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,220
Young Man, you sure know much about it.

560
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,200
You flatter me.

561
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,360
Can we discuss your shoes?

562
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,880
Sure.

563
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,080
Where have you been?

564
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,800
Why did you return so late?

565
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,264
I met someone.

566
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:32,540
Do you remember Dr. Chen?

567
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,160
- He specializes in researching running— 
 - Stop, listen to me first.

568
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
Do you know who came to see me today?

569
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,300
No.

570
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,000
What's going on?

571
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,380
The beauty in your major finally likes you?

572
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,840
Be serious.

573
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,240
Okay, go ahead.

574
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,600
Gan Yang. One of the world's best sports brands,

575
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,800
Didi Sports, came to our place

576
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,440
and said they would invest in us!

577
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,100
For real?

578
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,320
But I've just solved the investment problem.

579
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,260
What? When did it happen?

580
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,520
Just when I was running.

581
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,160
Y-You must have met a fraud.

582
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,820
No way.

583
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,440
Do you know Dr. Chen?

584
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,740
Dr. Chen? Which Dr. Chen?

585
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,360
Do you mean the judge of the Running Shoe Design Competition, Dr. Chen Hai Chuan?

586
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,740
Yes. That's him!

587
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,360
- Unbelievable. 
 - I just met him.

588
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,540
How can you be so lucky?

589
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,080
Did you meet such a big investor while running?

590
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,120
I just met him in the park.

591
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,320
At first, I noticed only his shoes.

592
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,740
Then we quickly chatted.

593
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,280
But as I talked, I felt he was familiar.

594
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,640
Unexpectedly, it was Dr. Chen himself.

595
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,080
When I found out, I purposely talked about R and D.

596
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,432
As we talked, he...

597
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:47,020
- Invested? 
 - He invested.

598
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,040
I never thought it would be so smooth.

599
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,400
What about Didi Sports?

600
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,180
Will we consider them?

601
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,720
I think for us...

602
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,600
Dr. Chen is more suitable as our investor.

603
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,880
He loves shoes very much.

604
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,720
Besides,

605
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,280
when we were talking,

606
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,860
he actually said our heartfelt creed.

607
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,160
He said, in his opinion, the best running shoes

608
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,980
should be made for all to wear.

609
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,400
   

610
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,960
 Tong Tong, 

611
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,520
 it's our Day 27 of being long-distance. 

612
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,320
 I'm missing you again. 

613
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,600
 [Ding Zhi Tong: It's Day 39 of being long-distance. 

614
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,360
   

615
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,420
   

616
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,080
Dr. Chen, this is your awaited guest.

617
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,220
Hello.

618
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,560
- Hello. 
 - Dr. Chen.

619
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,200
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

620
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,960
- Please, have a seat. 
 - Okay, thanks.

621
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
This one is our business plan.

622
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,000
Please take a look.

623
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:26,075
   

624
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,340
Director Dai, your flight ticket.

625
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,520
After going to Hefei, Jia Fan and I will go to Guangzhou.

626
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,340
Qin Yu, Ding Zhi Tong, you two go to Suzhou to visit Director Huang.

627
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,220
You performed well these days.

628
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,980
You do the presentation for Director Huang's project.

629
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,520
It's about your rating this week. Don't take it lightly.

630
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,800
Thank you, Director Dai.

631
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,040
Help get me a cup of coffee.

632
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,460
Okay.

633
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Same.

634
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,320
- Matcha latte. 
 - Okay.

635
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,000
Two iced Americanos and two matcha lattes.

636
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,680
Okay, please wait a moment.

637
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,100
It scanned through.

638
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:21,675
   

639
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,440
 Tong Tong. I knew you'd see it. 

640
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,800
That's why I especially left it for you.

641
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,840
But I'm not there now.

642
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,960
I transferred from Shanghai Airport three days ago.

643
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,480
I thought you were in Shanghai.

644
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,880
We will see each other soon.

645
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,880
I'll finish what I'm doing promptly.

646
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,080
All right.

647
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,880
Aren't you having exams soon?

648
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,440
Why did you come to Shanghai days ago?

649
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,840
I haven't told you the Shuchi matter.

650
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,380
 They breached the contract. 

651
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,480
 But it doesn't matter. I found a new investor. 

652
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,520
I'll buy some new equipment with them now.

653
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,180
I'll also poach some talent to establish a new laboratory.

654
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,140
So in these two months, I'll travel around the country.

655
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,940
 I also applied for the online courses. 

656
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,880
 My instructor has approved it. 

657
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,140
I advised you to sign with Shuchi.

659
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,080
See?

660
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,100
I knew you would blame yourself. So I never told you.

661
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
It's not your fault.

662
00:38:41,325 --> 00:38:42,320
   

663
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,420
Well, then you can go do your work.

664
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,080
I'm waiting for coffee.

665
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,860
Go ahead, Tong Tong.

666
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,520
Hey, Tong Tong!

667
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,640
I love you.

668
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,360
I love you, too.

669
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,800
Okay. Then you hang up first.

670
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,260
Bye bye.

671
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,380
Bye bye.

672
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,180
   

673
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,400
   

674
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,220
   

675
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,700
   

676
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,760
Hello, your coffee is ready.

677
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,320
Coming.

678
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,580
   

679
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,575
   

680
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,740
Gan Yang, do you think this cloud looks like a puppy?

681
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,580
 After we arrive, we might need to see Director Chen first, 

682
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,400
then check the machines.

683
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,780
Okay. 
    

684
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,620
It's almost time. We...

685
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,062
Tong Tong, are you also at Suzhou Station?

686
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:36,080
Where are you going?

687
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,940
 Which platform are you on? 

688
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,100
Yes, are you also here?

689
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,665
 The train is about to depart. 

690
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:45,765
 Passengers, please board the train quickly. 

691
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,300
 Tong Tong, which platform are you on? 

692
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,600
Platform 5.

693
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,921
 I'm on Platform 7. 

694
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:54,080
 What carriage are you in? 

695
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,060
I'm at Carriage 2 right now.

696
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,520
Go toward Carriage 1.

697
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,680
Walk to the front of the train.

698
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm right there.

699
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,200
 I got there. 

700
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,380
Tong Tong!

701
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,900
Tong Tong, I-I'll come to you now.

702
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,280
Don't come here.

703
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,220
My train is departing.

704
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,900
 I'll just watch you for a while. 

705
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,480
Tong Tong,

706
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,030
I miss you so much.

707
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,720
I miss you as well.

708
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,880
 I want to hug you now. 

709
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,940
 I want to hug you, too. 

710
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,600
♫  Which line should I send?  ♫

711
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,270
♫  Can let our story continue  ♫

712
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,790
♫  Can let our story continue  ♫

713
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,810
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

714
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:53,760
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

715
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,770
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

716
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:03,410
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

717
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,510
♫  I wish I could stay with you  ♫

718
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,120
 The train is about to depart. 

719
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,820
My train is leaving.

720
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,800
Take good care of yourself.

721
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,960
Bye bye.

722
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,640
Bye bye.

723
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:19,680
 Bye bye. 

724
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:43,890


725
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:50,900
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

726
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:56,835
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

727
00:42:57,835 --> 00:43:04,985
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

728
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:11,222
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

729
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:18,385
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

730
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:25,210
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

731
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:32,210
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

732
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:39,285
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

733
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:46,285
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

734
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:52,827
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

735
00:43:52,827 --> 00:44:00,012
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

736
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:07,145
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

737
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:14,041
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

738
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:20,930
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

739
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:27,585
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

740
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:34,760
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

741
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:47,460
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
