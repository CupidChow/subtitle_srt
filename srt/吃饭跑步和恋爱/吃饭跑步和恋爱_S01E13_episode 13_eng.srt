 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,849
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,437
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:17,643
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:21,775
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:28,023
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:32,306
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,564
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:49,736
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:57,832
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:02,284
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:06,892
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:11,148
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:16,150
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,581
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,245
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:25,016
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,559
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:31,300
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,360
   
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,450
   

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,580


26
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,740
Here's your breakfast and coffee.

27
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm sorry about the apartment situation.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,780
This is my apology.

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,420
What are you doing? Hey, don't bow.

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,840
Sit down.

31
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,640
You're too kind.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,160
The lines here are crazy long.

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,240
Besides, even without that incident,

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,180
I'd still need to rent a place.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,120
You still need to accept these.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,180
Otherwise, I'd feel too guilty.

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,340
All right, I won’t hold back.

38
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,940
Jia Fan.

39
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,320
Ding Zhi Tong. Come to my office.

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,200
Tomorrow's online meeting is crucial,

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,060
especially the evaluation model.

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,860
There can't be any mistakes.

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,920
The model is ready.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,200
Ding Zhi Tong helped me test it last afternoon.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,040
The data should be fine.

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,200
Good. Get back to work.

47
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,020
What's the matter?

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,440
Director Dai, can I take a day off tomorrow?

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,580
Although you're not needed for tomorrow's online meeting,

50
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,040
it's best if you stay in the office.

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,000
The project is drawing to a close,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but it's also the most hectic, error-prone time.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,680
I hope you and Jia Fan can stick it out for another two months.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,320
I know you guys have been working hard.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,080
Once the project is done, I'll give you a long vacation.

56
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,040
It's not that I want to take a break.

57
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,320
I have something important tomorrow.

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,580
Just one day. I'll be back on time the day after.

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,800
You know you're still on a six-month probation, right?

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,540
Are you sure you still want the day off,

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,720
knowing I might have to reevaluate your performance?

62
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,540
Yes.

63
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,520
I hope you won't regret it.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,240
Go ahead.

65
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,740
Thank you, Director Dai.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,600
Wang Yi.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,180
- Just wanted to let you know. 
 - Yes?

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm going to Hangzhou tomorrow.

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,000
What? You're going to Hangzhou?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,340
What about Ding Zhi Tong?

71
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,580
Why are you going to Hangzhou?

72
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,600
What?

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,900
What did you just say about Ding Zhi Tong?

74
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,000
I-I had a mental glitch.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,180
I thought you were going to Hangzhou to see Ding Zhi Tong.

76
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,480
So why are you going to Hangzhou?

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,600
I've showed our research results to Dr. Chen.

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,960
He reviewed our materials, agreed to our terms,

79
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,100
and decided to sign with us.

80
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,120
What? Really?

81
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,580
Of course.

82
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,920
You should have told me this earlier.

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,160
Well, I'm telling you now.

84
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,160
When will you be back?

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,380
Not sure yet.

86
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,200
It depends on Dr. Chen's schedule.

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,660
- All right. 
 - What's the matter?

88
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,780
What's wrong with you?

89
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,980
No, nothing.

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,000
All right, my flight is early tomorrow.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,300
I'll go pack my bag.

92
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,820
Sure.

93
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,940
Get some rest.

94
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,380
Early sleep is good for your health.

95
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:06,500
   

96
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,580
- Give it to me. 
 - What are you doing?

97
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,140
I knew you were up to something.

98
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,640
You scared me.

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,100
What's going on?

100
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,920
Ding Zhi Tong asked me to keep it a secret.

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,120
She's coming to Beijing tomorrow to surprise you.

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
Really?

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,520
What’s the point of lying?

104
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,480
She couldn't reach you on your phone so she called me.

105
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,160
Well, tell her you will see her at the airport.

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,760
Almost missed it again.

107
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,320
Hello?

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,640
 Jia Fan can't be reached. 

109
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,080
 I don't care where you are right now. 

110
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
 Get back to the office right now. 

111
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,800
You two know the evaluation model best.

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,180
If he doesn't show up,

113
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,360
 only you can step in. 

114
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,660
If you're not here by 10 a.m., don't bother coming back.

115
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,230
   

116
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,120
 Hello, the number you've dialed... 

117
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,700
 Hello, the number you've dialed... 

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,720
   

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,180
   

120
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,380
You're finally back. Director Dai was losing it.

121
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,400
Let me review the materials first.

122
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,280
Where's Jia Fan?

123
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,200
No idea. I can't reach him.

124
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
Can you send me the previous version?

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,800
Where's Jia Fan?

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,940
Still can't reach him.

127
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,320
Ding Zhi Tong, are you familiar with the model?

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
Yes.

129
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
This meeting is crucial.

130
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,320
Previously, Jia Fan had been leading the modeling work.

131
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
As a junior analyst, if you can't step in for now,

132
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
I understand.

133
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,260
But if you take on the task and fail,

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,800
you know the consequences.

135
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,980
I know.

136
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,740
Bring the files to my office.

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,625
 Sorry, Gan Yang. 

138
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,050
♫  Only after the burning, the fireworks come  ♫

139
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:51,850
♫  Beauty always comes with its cost  ♫

140
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,225
♫  Every fall brings scars but also gives me  ♫

141
00:07:57,225 --> 00:08:00,025
♫  A strong armor  ♫

142
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:03,625
♫  Even with twists, I'll keep running on  ♫

143
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,430
♫  I am not scared  ♫

144
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,625
♫  I accept the gap of losing after every gain  ♫

145
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:16,100
♫  I accept the gap of losing after every gain 

146
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:23,550
♫  The story twists and turns, but it isn't a fairy tale  ♫

147
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,475
♫  I matter most  ♫

148
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:31,075
♫  And everything else comes behind  ♫

149
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:34,950
♫  I'm glad flowers once bloomed on my path  ♫

150
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,850
♫  But they are not worth looking back  ♫

151
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,900
♫  I allow moments of weakness, pain and struggle  ♫

152
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:46,450
♫  I allow moments of weakness, pain and struggle  ♫

153
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:53,025
♫  If I can't forget, just let it be  ♫

154
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:57,700
♫  After taking some wrong turns  ♫

155
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,075
♫  Then I know where to go  ♫

156
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:10,450
♫  I'll arrive by myself  ♫

157
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,327
   
   

158
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,040
   
   

159
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,740
   

160
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,980
What's on your mind?

161
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,040
Sister Qin Yu.

162
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,480
The meeting went smoothly, didn't it?

163
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Why the long face?

164
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,440
I was just thinking

165
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,640
that Jia Fan isn't the type to skip work without a reason,

166
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,600
especially such an important meeting.

167
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
Did something happen to him?

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,340
Whatever it is, I'm afraid it's not good.

169
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,820
True.

170
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,520
Don't overthink it.

171
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm leaving.

172
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
- Hello? 
 -  Hello. Do you know Jia Fan? 

173
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
I'm his colleague. What is it?

174
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
 This is the city hospital. 

175
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,820
 Jia Fan was found unconscious in his room. 

176
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,480
 We can't reach his immediate family. 

177
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 We noticed you called him multiple times. 

178
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
 Could you come to the hospital now? 

179
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,260
I'll be right there.

180
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
Doctor, how is Jia Fan?

181
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,220
Extremely high white blood cell count with bacterial infection.

182
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,800
We suspect acute meningitis.

183
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,960
His condition is quite critical.

184
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,600
Can't you reach his family members?

185
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Not yet.

186
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,020
Doctor, how is Jia Fan doing?

187
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
Who are you?

188
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,680
His ex-girlfriend.

189
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,480
We suspect acute meningitis.

190
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,340
His condition is critical and could deteriorate at any moment.

191
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,240
How could this happen?

192
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,840
Do you have his family's contact info?

193
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,200
It's best to notify them to come here promptly.

194
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,700
   

195
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,360
After wrapping the Guanghua Project,

196
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,160
you'll have hit all your targets ahead of schedule.

197
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,880
You're truly my top performer.

198
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,180
Here's to you.

199
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,080
Thank you, Director Qi.

200
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,160
But a bottle of wine isn't enough.

201
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,920
You promised I'd be Managing Director after the Guanghua Energy deal.

202
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
Of course, I remember.

203
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,640
I've already talked to the higher-ups about the promotion,

204
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,720
but they seem to have other considerations.

205
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
What do you mean?

206
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Is anyone at Hetai more qualified than I am?

207
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,160
Calm down.

208
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,100
They’re looking to recruit externally.

209
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,160
But the person hasn't confirmed yet.

210
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,520
You just closed a big deal.

211
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,760
I'd say your chances are still strong.

212
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,201
Tell me.

213
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,960
 Director Dai, we found Jia Fan. 

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,640
He has acute meningitis.

215
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,240
 He was rushed to hospital last night. 

216
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,460
His condition is critical.

217
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,760
Take over his work.

218
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
 There's not much left on the Guanghua Energy Project. 

219
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,080
You can handle it.

220
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,780
 All right. 

221
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,680
Well, what happened?

222
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,960
Nothing. Just an employee on sick leave.

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,100
Relax.

224
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,000
Come on, cheers.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,660
Cheers.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,660
Thank you.

227
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,040
Still can't contact his family?

228
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,060
Yes,

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
but his hometown is in Shanxi.

230
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,480
It's quite far.

231
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,560
Not sure if they'll make it in time.

232
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,520
He grew up in a remote village in Shanxi.

233
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,920
He was the only college student from that village.

234
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,920
After graduating, he got a job working at a bank counter,

235
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,360
a modest income, but stable.

236
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,280
But he has two younger sisters still in school.

237
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,440
His family can't afford it and stopped paying tuition.

238
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,840
He disagreed and switched to this job.

239
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,500
He barely gets a few hours of daily sleep, just to make more money.

240
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,040
Days ago, I couldn't take it anymore.

241
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,560
I told him to get a new job.

242
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,040
He refused so we had a huge fight.

243
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,180
I broke up with him in anger.

244
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,000
I never imagined we'd meet again like this.

245
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,460
Be careful.

246
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,800
Doctor, how's Jia Fan?

247
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,460
His condition has worsened. He needs the ICU now.

248
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,000
 Turns out we're the same. 

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,860
 Jia Fan also had burdens he couldn't let go. 

250
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,120
 You worked late last night; now you're returning to work? 

251
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,980
 We finally got to go running together, but I can't even join you. 

252
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,160
 Tong Tong, that's not what I meant. 

253
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
 It's fine with me. 

254
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,280
 I'm just worried this workload will destroy your health. 

255
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,480
 What future can there be if your health breaks down? 

256
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,280
- Director Dai. 
 - Take a cab back to the office now.

257
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,640
Don't answer any calls on the way here.

258
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,040
What happened?

259
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,940
Jia Fan died.

260
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,720
I've repeated the details many times.

261
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
I couldn't reach Jia Fan.

262
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,080
The hospital called me.

263
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,100
When I arrived, he was already unconscious,

264
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,640
then he was transferred to ICU.

265
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,700
I had no contact with him during that time.

266
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,720
Is that enough?

267
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,140
You won't get anything new.

268
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,200
Let her go back and rest.

269
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,300
What is wrong with you?

270
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,400
Celebrating your success in both career and love.

271
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,520
So? At the airport, did Ding Zhi Tong—

272
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,760
Wang Yi, why did you lie to me?

273
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,640
You made me wait at the airport like an idiot.

274
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,960
Why are you doing this?

275
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,120
Why did you lie to me?

276
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,240
What... what are you saying?

277
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,880
You... you didn't see Ding Zhi Tong?

278
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,720
I didn't. She never showed up!

279
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,080
No way. I didn't lie.

280
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,240
She called me to ask about your schedule and asked me to keep it secret.

281
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,480
Really, look, I have pictures as proof.

282
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,120
See? The call record is here. 
    

283
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,620
She definitely called me.

284
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,220
That's strange.

285
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,920
Tong Tong isn't the type to lie with empty promises.

286
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,360
She has no reason to lie to you.

287
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,520
Did something happen?

288
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,360
   

289
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,920
Tong Tong, where are you?

290
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,540
Jia Fan has died.

291
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,440
Well, go home and wait for me.

292
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,260
I'm coming over.

293
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,680
Did something happen to Ding Zhi Tong?

294
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,840
Her colleague died.

295
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,700
I think she's probably scared.

296
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
I need to go to Shanghai.

297
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,760
Be careful!

298
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,960
Hello?

299
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
Where are you?

300
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,180
Director Dai gave me two days off.

301
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,080
Are you all right?

302
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,820
I'm okay.

303
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,100
Want to have dinner and talk?

304
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,540
I just want to sleep at home.

305
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,880
Sure, get some rest.

306
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,700
Don't overthink it.

307
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Don't be afraid.

308
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,900
I'm here.

309
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,900
You must be quite shaken.

310
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,240
I feel sorry and think it's unfair for Jia Fan.

311
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,460
He was so young.

312
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,920
Why don't you take a nap first?

313
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
No.

314
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,300
I want to talk to you.

315
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,420
Sure.

316
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,960
I heard...

317
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,580
some things about Jia Fan...

318
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,060
from his girlfriend yesterday.

319
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,320
I realized he was like me.

320
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,880
I wondered why he took it out on us when he couldn't get promoted.

321
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,200
But now I think if I were in his shoes,

322
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,000
I might not have acted any better.

323
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,280
No, Tong Tong.

324
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,760
You're the smartest, kindest,

325
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,640
and most principled person I know.

326
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
You'd never hurt others for your own gain.

327
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,760
Don't blame yourself.

328
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,400
I'm not blaming myself.

329
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,840
I just feel sorrow and solidarity with him.

330
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,180
Tong Tong,

331
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,000
have you thought...

332
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,040
about what I said before?

333
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,440
What's more important?

334
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,740
Money or health?

335
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,460
If you asked me back then, I'd have said money.

336
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,340
Because I thought money could buy everything.

337
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,460
But now I see you're right.

338
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,420
Without life, there's nothing.

339
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,220
You know, when I saw Jia Fan lying there,

340
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,140
I thought...

341
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,460
one day, will it be me on that hospital bed?

342
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,320
You won't be.

343
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Don't even say that.

344
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,580
Tong Tong, if you realize all this,

345
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,040
why not get a new job?

346
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,520
Because...

347
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,480
some things aren't as simple as you think.

348
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,400
I need this job.

349
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,240
I know making money is important.

350
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,320
But why push yourself this hard?

351
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,560
Gan Yang.

352
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,100
Have you ever had to beg for money?

353
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,480
My dad died young.

354
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,540
It was I and my mom since I was little.

355
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,040
She's suffered a lot and endured many hardships to raise me.

356
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,100
I work this hard for a better life for my mom.

357
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,680
I want to give her a sense of security.

358
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,480
That’s just how realistic I am.

359
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,320
Daily, I calculate how to save enough,

360
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,400
and how to repay you the rent.

361
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,080
But sometimes I think, forget it, I might as well just move in.

362
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,960
But then I hesitate and think,

363
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,560
if I don't repay you, I'll always feel burdened.

364
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,180
Tong Tong.

365
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,520
Why didn't you ever tell me any of this?

366
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,400
I know you can afford to rent a place for me...

367
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,200
and spend money on me,

368
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,880
but I don’t want our relationship built on that.

369
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,923
You understand?

370
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,240
I do.

371
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,180
I get it.

372
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,840
You want to keep our relationship genuine.

373
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,420
Right?

374
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,800
I want my life through my own efforts.

375
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,040
I might not have much time for you,

376
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,240
but I truly want to be with you.

377
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,720
Gan Yang.

378
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,600
You're the most special person I've ever met.

379
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,920
I like you very, very much.

380
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,960
All right.

381
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,660
Tong Tong.

382
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,480
I also want you to know how I think.

383
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,660
Every time I call you...

384
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,080
and find you're still working overtime, I really worry.

385
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,640
I fear it's unsafe for you to go home alone so late.

386
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,880
So I took the liberty of renting a place for you.

387
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,940
Do you understand?

388
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,460
I'm sorry.

389
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,140
I shouldn't have gotten angry with you.

390
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,840
It's okay.

391
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,240
Tong Tong.

392
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,920
It's normal for couples to have conflicts.

393
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,000
I was just a little hurt...

394
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
that you didn't share anything with me.

395
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,480
But then I realized.

396
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,100
All have their own goals.

397
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,060
Tong Tong.

398
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,680
Can you promise me one thing?

399
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,180
What is it?

400
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,700
I still hope...

401
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,280
you'll move into the place I rented.

402
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,460
Just hear me out first.

403
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,300
Please listen.

404
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,080
Tong Tong, think of it.

405
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,040
You work such long hours daily.

406
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,700
You lack time to rest when you get home.

407
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,580
And you just promised me...

408
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,320
that you'll eat well,

409
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,700
sleep well,

410
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,490
and care for yourself.

411
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,280
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

412
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,280
I'm worried you'll ruin your health due to work.

413
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,420
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

414
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,000
Then you'll truly have nothing left.

415
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,260
♫  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  ♫

416
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,000
♫  When it comes to love  ♫

417
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,450
♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

418
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,540
♫  Listen, the night sighs softly  ♫

419
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,460
♫  The rain clouds are approaching  ♫

420
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,940
♫  I can’t bear to part yet still hold back  ♫

421
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,920
♫  And let you stand in the rain with me  ♫

422
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,400
Give me a second. I'll jot something down for you.

423
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,170
Sure.

424
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,710
♫  Wind delivers the messages of my heart  ♫

425
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,010
♫  Which line should I send?  ♫

426
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,080
♫  Can let our story continue  ♫

427
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,320
♫  I wish I could spend every  ♫

428
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,970
♫  Dusk and dawn with you  ♫

429
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,080
♫  Like a world with just us  ♫

430
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,620
♫  And a clock without hands  ♫

431
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,560
♫  I wish I could stay with you  ♫

432
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,400
   

433
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,560
♫  To feel the lingering warmth of love  ♫

434
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,770
♫  How can I seal away these feelings in my heart?  ♫

435
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:34,290
♫  When it comes to love  ♫ 
 ♫  I hide but speak from the heart  ♫

436
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:38,680
I'll charge half the rent because I'll be living there, too.

437
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,440
And I'm adding a clause.

438
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,040
What clause?

439
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:50,320
   

440
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,300
   

441
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,250
   

442
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,860
So I'm the one who benefits?

443
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,060
No, I’m the lucky one.

444
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:29,200
   

445
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,080
Ding Zhi Tong, come in.

446
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,740
Enter.

447
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,880
Director Dai, you wanted to see me?

448
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,460
I've reviewed the materials for the Guanghua Energy Project.

449
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,580
You did a great job.

450
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,700
The list of permanent hires has been submitted,

451
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,112
and your name is on it.

452
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:03,820
Keep it up.

453
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,500
That's wonderful.

454
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,680
Ding Zhi Tong.

455
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,680
I hope Jia Fan's situation hasn't affected you.

456
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,460
I’ll keep my mindset in check.

457
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,280
Thank you, Director Dai.

458
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,480
You may go.

459
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,805
Hey, we agreed the lab's site would be chosen by drawing lots.

460
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:30,680
One round doesn't count. Best of three.

461
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,940
"Best of three"?

462
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,900
This isn't gambling. Why best of three?

463
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,280
Draw three times.

464
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,140
If Hangzhou still isn't it, then I'll accept it.

465
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,420
Hold on.

466
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,240
In a best of three, what do you mean by "still"?

467
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,340
You sly old fox.

468
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,980
Slip of the tongue. Two.

469
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,980
- No more tricks. 
 - All right.

470
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,060
- Your turn. 
 - Me?

471
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,260
What?

472
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,948
Hey, let me.

473
00:30:59,948 --> 00:31:03,580
- Please be Hangzhou. 
 - Please be Shanghai.

474
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,420
Hangzhou!

475
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,380
Hangzhou.

476
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,600
Hangzhou.

477
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,520
The tides have turned in my favor.

478
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,860
- In my favor. 
 - Don't get too cocky.

479
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,440
There's still one more. Come on.

480
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,920
Let's end this clean! 
    

481
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,570
   

482
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,260
What does this say?

483
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,040
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

484
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,680
I quit.

485
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,760
Tong Tong, wait for me.

486
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,100
Yes!

487
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,250
   

488
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,040
Gan Yang.

489
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,540
You're up.

490
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,860
Are you leaving right after moving in?

491
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,020
Don't want me to go?

492
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,900
Go wash up.

493
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,460
I'll take you somewhere.

494
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,540
Where?

495
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,400
Stop asking. You'll see.

496
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,980
Go.

497
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,380
So how do you like this place?

498
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,800
Why'd you bring me here?

499
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,620
Did you rent this place?

500
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,020
I secured some investment.

501
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,160
Wang Yi and I are starting

502
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,880
our own lab here in Shanghai.

503
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,340
Does that mean you'll be based here now?

504
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,620
That's right.

505
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,700
See, I knew you'd succeed.

506
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm still far from success.

507
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,960
But you're right.

508
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,240
Our company will succeed.

509
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,660
Then I'll make a reservation.

510
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,560
A reservation for what?

511
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,540
For your brand's first pair of shoes.

512
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,220
Sure.

513
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,920
I promise.

514
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,900
Pinky swear.

515
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:18,520
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

516
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,171
Let's seal it.

517
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:21,600
Seal it.

518
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,405
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

519
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,300
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

520
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,960
 Tong Tong. 

521
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,020
 The lab is just the first step. 

522
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,460
 I want to also create a running shoe matrix, 

523
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,420
 integrating online and offline. 

524
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,320
 Only then can we make shoes that truly fit everyone. 

525
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:43,255
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

526
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,925
♫  How lucky  ♫

527
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:51,405
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

528
00:33:51,405 --> 00:34:00,005
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

529
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,520
- Let's go eat. 
 - Let's go.

530
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,725
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

531
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:13,155
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

532
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:17,875
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

533
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:22,775
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

534
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:26,925
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

535
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:28,775
♫  Stay with me  ♫

536
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,405
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

537
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,175
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

538
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:36,080
♫  Burning bright  ♫

539
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,747
- You're here. 
 - Ma'am, pork belly, please.

540
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:41,260
- Come back if you like it. 
 - Thank you.

541
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:48,255
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

542
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,640
Tong Tong. I'm back.

543
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,340
Welcome back.

544
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,320
So many paper cranes.

545
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,560
How was it? Are you tired?

546
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,940
Not really.

547
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,880
I met the designer about the renovations

548
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,220
and supervised some work.

549
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,960
How's the renovation going?

550
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,980
Still a long way to go.

551
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,380
Probably won't finish before Chinese New Year.

552
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,540
Is it that complicated?

553
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,100
And ours is just a small lab.

554
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,860
Bigger ones might take more than six months.

555
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,220
How about you?

556
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,340
You're off work early.

557
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,480
I submitted my project for review.

558
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,680
I earned a perfect weekend.

559
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,220
Really?

560
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,940
Then can we go running together?

561
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,420
Why so many cranes today?

562
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,680
We used to have strings of these at home.

563
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,420
I'd hang them by the window.

564
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,060
So when the wind blows, they'd look like real cranes flying.

565
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,800
How beautiful.

566
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,140
What's the matter?

567
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,700
Nothing.

568
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,780
I'm just glad you see this place

569
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,060
as home now.

570
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,100
- Let's hang them up. 
 - Okay.

571
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,960
- This string? 
 - Hang them there.

572
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
Okay.

573
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,280
Be careful.

574
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,600
Beautiful.

575
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,740
I love this kind of life.

576
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,100
Finally a break from hectic life.

577
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,140
Being able to enjoy the view and cook with loved ones.

578
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,860
Me, too.

579
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,820
Tong Tong.

580
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,300
I'll work hard and bring your mom here

581
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,200
to live with us soon.

582
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,000
What's that smell?

583
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:03,040
My congee!

584
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,420
- What congee? 
 - I made congee.

585
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,240
- It's going to burn. 
 - "Congee"?

586
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,620
Did you cook?

587
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,640
I wanted to try.

588
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,120
It's my first time making

589
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,980
Fish Fillet Congee.

590
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,220
Be careful; it's hot.

591
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,240
How is it?

592
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,920
Quite good.

593
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,940
You've changed a lot recently,

594
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,820
cooking and making paper cranes.

595
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,300
Before, you'd spend this time glued to industry news.

596
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,100
You said it yourself,

597
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,240
"Work-life balance leads to happiness."

598
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,540
Try this.

599
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,860
Be careful.

600
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,540
How is it?

601
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,040
Give me your review.

602
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,580
Truth or a nice review?

603
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,880
Nice.

604
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,260
- Delicious. 
 - And the truth?

605
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,980
Well,

606
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,340
very delicious.

607
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,787
Really?

608
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,840
- Yes. 
 - Let me try it.

609
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,900
Let's add some salt.

610
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,808
 All of it? 

611
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:22,080
 Also pepper. 

612
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,440
 Pepper.

 just about work and money. 

619

 Taking time to eat and run with your lover

I'll pick you up tonight.

628
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,687

00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,040
- Bye. 
 - Bye bye.

Bye bye.

631
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,260
Only 100 meters left. Let's sprint!

00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,140
Wait.

633
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,160
I... I can't run anymore.

634
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,040
Really?

635
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,220
You really can't?

636
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,900
Really.

637
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,620
We had a deal.

638
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,060
The loser has to buy ice cream.

639
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,500
Gan Yang!

640
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,580
Very well, Ding Zhi Tong.

641
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,080
Now you're even lying over ice cream?

642
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,760
All is fair in war.

643
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
You really know nothing.

644
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,940


645
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,620
Tong Tong.

646
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,740
I wish we could stay like this forever.

647
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,260
But I have to go back to school next week.

648
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,360
I almost forgot.

649
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,820
You're still a little boy who hasn't graduated yet.

650
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,360
Don't worry. I, your sister, will wait for you in Shanghai.

651
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,220
Hey, what are you doing?

♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

664
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:00,702
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

665
00:42:00,702 --> 00:42:07,987
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

666
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:15,120
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

667
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:22,016
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

668
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:28,905
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

669
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:35,560
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

670
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:42,635
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

671
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:55,235
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
