 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,770
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,020
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,200
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,790
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,580
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,240
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,650
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,160
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,550
   

25
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,860
 We've arrived at the final stop. 

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,580
 The doors are opening. 

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,300
 Please watch your steps. 

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,940
 Please board at the front and exit at the back. 

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,660
 Thank you. 

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,150
♫  I wish that moment could last forever  ♫

31
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,460
Girl, are you riding again to clear your head?

32
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:04,480
All right, sit tight.

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,920
♫  I’m burning with anticipation  ♫

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,275
♫  Counting the days like years  ♫

35
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:15,540
♫  I’ve fallen for you without even realizing it  ♫

36
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,800
   

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,220
   

38
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,050
♫  Our tangled headphone cable  ♫

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,775
♫  Carried my longing to you for me  ♫

40
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:30,050
♫  I’ve kept everything in me  ♫

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,700
♫  Since the first time we met  ♫

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,875
♫  My heart lost its balance  ♫

43
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:42,375
♫  I open my arms wide trying to take it all in  ♫

44
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:47,600
♫  Don’t miss out on your life again  ♫

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,450
♫  Let me fill in the empty spaces  ♫

46
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:56,950
♫  That moment you looked at me and said I love you  ♫

47
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,740
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting so long.

48
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,140
No problem. I just got here, too.

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,020
Sit.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,980
Here, have some water.

51
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,520
Thanks.

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,140
Why did you go to the final stop?

53
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,100
- Do you have a part-time job there? 
 - No.

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,880
Sometimes, I like taking the bus to the final stop and back,

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,860
watching the scenery along the way.

56
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,020
Do you also like the feeling of watching the city pass by?

57
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,520
Does watching people bustling around give you a sense of peace?

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,740
How did you know?

59
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,380
Because I enjoy the same thing.

60
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,060
I don't like running on a treadmill.

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,960
I prefer running by the river or on the street and watching people.

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,500
I think it's a great way to relieve stress.

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,700
Then we're quite in sync.

64
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,440
Of course, we are.

65
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,020
Oh, I almost forgot this.

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,660
This...

67
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,620
I got it at a flower shop near HKEX.

68
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,720
I figured it soaked up plenty of good luck for making money; I brought it for you.

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,700
Good luck for making money? Thanks.

70
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,240
Let's go.

71
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,520
What a huge plum orchard.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,660
Right.

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,260
As a child, I loved plum jam.

74
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,340
Hello?

75
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,400
 Ding Zhi Tong, return and submit your paper. 

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,380
I'm sorry. I totally forgot it.

77
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,840
I'll go back now. Give me 30 minutes.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,440
I'm so sorry. My assignment is due today.

79
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,620
I forgot it. I must rush back to school.

80
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,020
It's fine.

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,880
My car is nearby. I'll drive you.

82
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,560
- Then... 
 - This time, you can't pay me for gas.

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,940
Okay.

84
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,360
Let's go.

85
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,180
 I'm back! 

86
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,980
I smell gossip.

87
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,180
- What's this? 
 - Who gave you the flowers?

88
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,440
- Gan Yang. 
 - They smell amazing.

89
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,620
"Gan Yang"?

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,180
It's not what you guys think.

91
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,040
Do you really feel nothing for Gan Yang?

92
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,280
You tell me, how many years would I have to work to live like him,

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,540
flying wherever he wants?

94
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,100
You're so smart.

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,540
I say five years is enough.

96
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,660
Then let's talk again in five years.

97
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,540
See if he brings me flowers then.

98
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,020
Look, all that is just material stuff.

99
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,660
You can also have that via hard work.

100
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,020
But what you two really share are your souls.

101
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,220
Exactly. Such a bond is rare.

102
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,660
You two are 100% in sync.

103
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,220
You guys are meant to be.

104
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,260
That's right.

105
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,860
You two have time for that kind of talk.

106
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,540
Soulmates are not as common as you think.

107
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,620
She says we're nagging. Fine.

108
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,880
Leave her alone.

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,660
Eat this.

110
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,940
 Look at mine. 

111
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,255
 They're so fresh. 

112
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,820
- That one is ours. 
 -  Gan Yang? Why is he here, too? 

113
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,980
Auntie, Auntie. Please let me pick more.

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,660
I came here first.

115
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,020
- Let me pick some. 
 - I saw them first.

116
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,340
- I saw them first. 
 - How could you?

117
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,680
Why are you fighting with the elderly for it?

118
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,660
You're unreasonable.

119
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,180
Let's just pick ours.

120
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,640
Ding Zhi Tong, why did you come?

121
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,100
I got a bunch of plums.

122
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,860
Let me see.

123
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,780
- You got so much? 
 - Yes.

124
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,940
Then let's keep picking.

125
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,000
- Come on. 
 - Let's go.

126
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,550
♫  Welcome to  ♫

127
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,300
♫  My world  ♫

128
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,080
♫  Each cloud is brushed with color  ♫

129
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,540
 Maybe, just like Song Ming Mei said, 

130
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,240
 although Gan Yang and I live in different worlds, 

131
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,100
 we truly are similar. 

132
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,430
♫  The warmth causes a flower to bloom  ♫

133
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,700
♫  Waiting for you to appear  ♫

134
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,500
♫  I lie awake  ♫

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,550
♫  I’ve been missing you for 1,001 nights   ♫

136
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,680
♫  I just want to greet the sunrise in your embrace  ♫

137
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,850
♫  And never say goodbye  ♫

138
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,250
♫  You and I  ♫

139
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,840
   

140
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,180
- What the heck? 
 - Li Fei, be careful. Those are all brand-new shoes.

141
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,980
If you ruin them, how can we explain to Director Gan?

142
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,380
Gan Yang's not even here right now.

143
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,060
Stop calling him Director Gan, Director Gan.

144
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,780
You just love currying favor with him.

145
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,740
No one would take such junk even if they were thrown on the street.

146
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,400
He fusses over those rotten shoes daily for data testing in R&amp;D,

147
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,780
as if he can make something good.

148
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,420
Watch what you say. Don't let him hear that.

149
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,220
Relax. I'm just venting.

150
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,700
I just don't like him,

151
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,220
acting like some famous brand doing R&amp;D?

152
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,340
Does he even know what a real brand is?

153
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,420
Like this.

154
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,780
Nice. That brand is expensive, isn't it?

155
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,820
It's from the flagship (prime) store. Good, right?

156
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,860
Oops, I'm so sorry.

157
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,940
Let me wipe that off for you.

158
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,360
Why is the label coming off?

159
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,660
It really is.

160
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,380
Wasn't that from a flagship store?

161
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,900
I used to work at that store.

162
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,140
Those logos are stitched, not glued.

163
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,980
- You might have bought a fake. 
 - Don't talk nonsense.

164
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,240
Are you okay?

165
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,000
Director Gan, do you know her?

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,960
She's my friend.

167
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,300
Li Fei,

168
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,100
apologize to her.

169
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,540
Director Gan, I've seen plenty of girls like her.

170
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,460
She's clearly after your money.

171
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,100
I'll give you a kind reminder; stay away from her.

172
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,340
I know her better than you do.

173
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,980
Apologize.

174
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,580
Hey, we're all friends.

175
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,780
I'll talk to him.

176
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,140
Apologize.

177
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,040
Right now.

178
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,920
Apologize to her.

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,860
I'm sorry. I was wrong just then.

180
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm not the one you owe an apology to.

181
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,000
What were you guys saying just now?

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,820
Nothing.

183
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,240
Ding Zhi Tong.

184
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,740
Don't be angry.

185
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,860
We just know each other well.

186
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,220
Sometimes, they speak without thinking.

187
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,540
Don't take it to heart. I'll scold them later.

188
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,520
You still defend them after all they did?

189
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,280
They act nice to your face, but do you know what they say behind your back?

190
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,900
They say you'll never make good shoes.

191
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,460
Really?

192
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,960
Yes.

193
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,340
Why are you still smiling?

194
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,860
Ding Zhi Tong.

195
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,940
What?

196
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,040
Are you concerned about me?

197
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,240
You're crazy.

198
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,300
Ding Zhi Tong, thank you.

199
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,420
Professor Qin, this is for you.

200
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,800
Your voice sounds a little hoarse.

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,600
This is good for soothing your throat.

202
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,460
Are you openly bribing me?

203
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,820
Of course not.

204
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,620
You still teach us even while you're sick.

205
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,580
I'm just showing my concern.

206
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,460
Go ahead, what do you want?

207
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,840
Then I'll be straight.

208
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,940
I'd like you to take me

209
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,660
to the finance networking event coming up.

210
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,740
It's a large-scale event. Attendees need a plus-one.

211
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,900
Well, I'm well-versed in finance, stocks, funds, trusts,

212
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,900
and whatever else you can name.

213
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,300
Besides, I'm great at socializing.

214
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,340
I swear... I swear I won't embarrass you.

215
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,960
That actually does makes sense.

216
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,700
Moreover, we have a teacher-student relationship.

217
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,220
Even if people find out, they'll only praise you

218
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,580
for being a kind, selfless teacher.

219
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,500
No one will overthink it,

220
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,240
and it'll avoid any unnecessary gossip.

221
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Given all that, you might actually be the best choice.

222
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,100
So... are you agreeing?

223
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,120
I'll consider it.

224
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,980
Thank you, Professor Qin!

225
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,380
Please think it over.

226
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,980
Yes!

227
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,280
I have to admit,

228
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,420
this feels so good.

229
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,740
It does feel nice.

230
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,606
It's all thanks to Gan Yang.

231
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:16,300
He will come later. We'd better watch our words.

232
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,540
You mean Director Gan, right?

233
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,680
Honestly, his cold face this morning scared me.

234
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,900
I really feared he'd break with us.

235
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,100
He pays a lot when we try his shoes.

236
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,660
We can't afford to offend him.

237
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,420
He won't.

238
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,860
 If he does cut ties with us, who will test all that junk of his? 

239
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,780
 Buddy, keep your voice down. 

240
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,560
 Did you forget we almost got in trouble this morning? 

241
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,140
 He's not even here yet. Relax, all right? 

242
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,840
 Rotten shoes are rotten shoes. 

243
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,520
 Why can't we say that? 

244
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,540
 You still defend them after all they did? 

245
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,180
 They act nice to your face, but do you know what they say behind your back? 

246
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,280
 They say you'll never make good shoes. 

247
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,060
We've been here awhile.

248
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,620
Gan Yang still hasn't arrived.

249
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,400
True. What's taking him so long?

250
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,440
Here he is.

251
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,820
- Director Gan. 
 - Director Gan.

252
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,980
You're finally here.

253
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,440
We've been waiting quite a while.

254
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,480
Go get changed.

255
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,660
Director Gan, the new batch of shoes are really good.

256
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,960
When the next version comes out, we're happy to test them.

257
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,100
That's not necessary.

258
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,240
I won't trouble you with such small things anymore.

259
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
Come on, we're buddies.

260
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,260
We're more than willing to help you.

261
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Director Gan, what's that in your hands?

262
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,380
This?

263
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,160
Shoes.

264
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,780
No.

265
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,180
More accurately,

266
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,140
it's the junk you were just talking about.

267
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,500
Since you clearly disdain the shoes,

268
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,420
I won't have you try them anymore.

269
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,980
I'll take the shoes back.

270
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait, if you take them, what will we wear?

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
That's your problem.

272
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,740
- Come on, hurry. 
 - Gan Yang,

273
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,260
did that girl say anything to you?

274
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,260
She has nothing to do with this.

275
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,660
- Gan Yang! 
 - Don't go after him.

276
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,500
Hello?

277
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,300
Ding Zhi Tong,

278
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,420
thank you for helping me truly see those guys.

279
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,460
Do you mean those guys on the track team?

280
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,720
Are you okay?

281
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,560
I'm fine. Don't worry.

282
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,020
They're not worth feeling bad over.

283
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,800
Exactly. I'm glad you think so.

284
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Gan Yang?

285
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Gan Yang? Why aren't you saying anything?

286
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,060
Ding Zhi Tong.

287
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,540
Thank you.

288
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,600
You've already thanked me once.

289
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,900
Don't mention it.

290
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,040
   

291
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,620
I've made comments on yesterday's assignment.

292
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,920
Can someone help hand it out?

293
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,520
I will.

294
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,020
- Thanks. 
 - No problem.

295
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,180
There's a finance networking event soon.

296
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,760
All the attendees are major players in the industry.

297
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,500
It's a great chance to gain insight at this event.

298
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,240
And you can make connections to help with future job prospects.

299
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,380
I happen to have an invitation here. 
    

300
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,800
And I can take one person with me.

301
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,460
To keep things fair, I've decided that

302
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,470
whoever ranks first in the upcoming due diligence simulation

303
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,120
can go with me.

304
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,000
Professor, can guys participate, too?

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,220
- Gender doesn't matter. 
 - Professor Qin.

306
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,860
Do you disagree with my decision?

307
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,940
Not at all.

308
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,180
In that case, move a bit more quickly, please.

309
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,460
Professor Qin.

310
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,620
Don't you have something to say to me?

311
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,380
Now that you mention it, I do.

312
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,700
I had been struggling to find someone to take with me.

313
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,560
Thanks for reminding me I can take a student.

314
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,180
You tricked me?

315
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,180
If you didn't want to take me, you could have just told me.

316
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Maybe you misunderstood.

317
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,160
First, I agreed that I'd consider it,

318
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,700
but I never promised you anything.

319
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,140
Second, you made valid points,

320
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,080
but you're not my only student.

321
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,200
And last, the simulation hasn't even started yet.

322
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,620
Are you saying you will eventually lose?

323
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you provoking me?

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,660
I swear I will win.

325
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,400
Watch and see!

326
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,540
Hurry and wash a few more.

327
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,960
Okay. Are you sure you know how to make it?

328
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,800
Of course. You've tasted my cooking before.

329
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,360
Since I can cook, I can make jam.

330
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
Are cooking and jam-making the same?

331
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,840
You'll see when you taste it.

332
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,240
It will be good too.

333
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,140
Delicious.

334
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,060
- Add more sugar. 
 - Okay.

335
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,420
I like sweet stuff.

336
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,280
- Try it. 
 - You go first.

337
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,060
- You've worked hard. 
 - I go first?

338
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,520
Yes, you get the first bite.

339
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,020
All right.

340
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,880
Well, how is it? Is it good?

341
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,940
No.

342
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,160
It's terrible.

343
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,200
No way.

344
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,960
- Let me try it. 
 - It's awful.

345
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,060
- Let me try it. 
 - You'd better not.

346
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,340
Trust me, Pal. You'd better not.

347
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,140
I don't believe you. Let me try.

348
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,400
It's really bad.

349
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,680
Just one small spoonful, okay?

350
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,500
Fine, one small spoonful.

351
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,400
Use this spoon.

352
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,480
W-Wait. This is also a spoon.

353
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,840
Who's there? Come out!

354
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,580
That darned Qin Chang. 
    

355
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,980
Old fashioned.

356
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,500
I went out of my way to impress him.

357
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Seriously, when have I ever been so humiliated?

358
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,060
You rotten man.

359
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,520
Tong Tong, perfect timing.

360
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,660
I say that Qin Chang has really gone too far!

361
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,340
Ming Mei.

362
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,900
Wait, what happened to your hand?

363
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,860
I was so clumsy.

364
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,340
I tripped on the way back.

365
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,560
It should be okay.

366
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080
Does it hurt?

367
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,580
- I'll take you to the clinic. Come on. 
 - No need for that.

368
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,100
It's so late. Let's just disinfect it.

369
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,480
- Do you have iodine? 
 - I do.

370
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,560
Come on. Sit down.

371
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,640
 Gan Yang. 

372
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,220
Gan Yang?

373
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,180
I can eat this delicious jam myself.

374
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,780
Gan Yang!

375
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,680
Why are you here?

376
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,460
I made some plum jam and brought you some.

377
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,960
I'll take this call.

378
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,320
Hello? What do you want?

379
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Where did you hide the jam?

380
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,820
- Do you even have a conscience? 
 - Shut up.

381
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,960
Wrong number.

382
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,400
You changed your ringtone?

383
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,740
I thought that song was nice so I changed it.

384
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,320
I can't believe you know archery, surfing,

385
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,260
skiing, shoe design, and you can make jam.

386
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,140
How did you know I ski, surf, and do archery?

387
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,440
I found out by accident.

388
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,460
Here, take the jam.

389
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,120
Thanks.

390
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,460
What happened to your hand?

391
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,700
Nothing.

392
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,660
The light didn't work on the path back to the dorm. I tripped and fell.

393
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,840
It's fine.

394
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,380
Thanks.

395
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,540
Oh, be sure to keep it in the fridge.

396
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,480
It tastes even better cold.

397
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,700
Okay. I'll try that.

398
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,560
- I'm going. 
 - Bye bye.

399
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,140
Bye bye.

400
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,480
The light doesn't work?

401
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,840
Gan Yang, where did you hide the jam?

402
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,940
- I ate it. 
 - I'm not talking to you anymore.

403
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,920
I didn't even get one bite.

404
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,600
Stop.

405
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
Let's go ghost hunting tonight.

406
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,320
What ghost?

407
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,920
It's okay.

408
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,520
It's just stray cats and dogs.

409
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,920
- Shut up. 
 - Be quiet.

410
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,540
Who's there?

411
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,240
I see you. Come out!

412
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,420
 Who's there? 

413
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,360
Say something.

414
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,560
Don't move.

415
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,620
Keep your voice down.

416
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,480
 We don't want anyone to see. 

417
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
Speak louder. Say it louder.

418
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
You're so bad. So annoying.

419
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,360
 Don't touch me. 

420
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,740
 Others will see. 

421
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,440
- What are you trying? 
 - What are you guys doing?

422
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,600
Why are you following Ding Zhi Tong?

423
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
I don't know what you're saying.

424
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,160
You don't know what I'm saying?

425
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,460
- Wang Yi. 
 - We knew you wouldn't admit it.

426
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,480
We already set up security cameras here.

427
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,480
If I send this video to your coach,

428
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,280
your career is over.

429
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,060
Don't, Director Gan.

430
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,200
I was wrong. Aren't we buddies?

431
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,340
I just wanted to scare her. That's all.

432
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,680
"Scare her"?

433
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,080
Li Fei, we can keep the video a secret.

434
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,800
But stalking won't just be forgiven.

435
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,820
What are you going to do?

436
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,140
 No. 

437
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,680
 Stop. I was wrong. 

438
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,420
 Director Gan, I'm sorry. 

439
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,440
I thought someone was stalking me,

440
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,720
but it was just a couple.

441
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,200
"A couple"?

442
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,920
Did you see who they were?

443
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,840
It was so awkward. Why would I stay to find out?

444
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,080
But it was right before dorm curfew.

445
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,600
Were they still on a date?

446
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,620
Don't they fear getting locked out?

447
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,560
Isn't this situation resolved? Why are we still here?

448
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,340
Look, the whole road is empty.

449
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,920
Ding Zhi Tong will surely feel scared when she passes by.

450
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,080
If someone's talking nearby, she won't fear.

451
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,720
But we can't keep doing this forever.

452
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,180
How long are we staying here?

453
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,960
Shouldn't be too long. I already reported it to the school.

454
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,080
Once they fix the streetlight, our job's done.

455
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,560
You care about her so much.

456
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,600
Why not just walk her back yourself?

457
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,020
You think I don't want to?

458
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,060
I don't want to appear too obvious and pressure her.

459
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,620
Like that, no wonder you're still single.

460
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,260
She's coming. Be ready.

461
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,300
Say something.

462
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,620
- About what? 
 - Like what you said before.

463
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,140
Come on.

464
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,700
I'm angry.

465
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,840
- Don't hug me. 
 - Louder.

466
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,240
Even louder.

467
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,980
You scoundrel.

468
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,920
- No, please. 
 - She's coming.

469
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,000
- She's here. 
 - Don't kiss me.

470
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,180
- She's right here. 
 - No.

471
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,180
What are you two doing?

472
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,820
Weren't you supposed to go that way?

473
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,720
Who said I would come that way.

474
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,740
So it was you two last night, too?

475
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,580
- No. 
 - Yes.

476
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,780
Your girlfriend is quite unique.

477
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,640
It's so embarrassing.

478
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,160
Your dorm is about to lock down, right?

479
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll walk you back.

480
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,620
Okay.

481
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,080
 So why did you ask the track team guys to test your shoes? 

482
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,300
 It's hard to run an OEM business now. 

483
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,380
 I told my mom we should transform 

484
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,220
to develop our own R&amp;D.

485
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,820
But she thinks OEM is already good enough.

486
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,420
So I started experimenting on my own.

487
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,780
I got them to try the shoes

488
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,900
to collect performance data.

489
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,540
But I never thought

490
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,520
they'd be so mean.

491
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,900
That's not your fault.

492
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,260
Don't overthink it.

493
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,180
So did you tear apart the shoes

494
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,500
for research data too?

495
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,380
Did you watch videos I posted online?

496
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,700
In the future, I want to create my own sports shoe brand

497
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,740
and build a sports science lab.

498
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,560
Wang Yi? Wang Yi is a Ph.D. student in material science here.

499
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,020
He is my research partner.

500
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,240
You know what midsole material is?

501
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,680
It's actually the core of a running shoe.

502
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,460
That's what we are working on.

503
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,460
Whether the brand works or not actually depends on that.

504
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,260
Have you ever considered

505
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,700
your main customer target group?

506
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,460
For investment in a product or a company,

507
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,900
the first detail is its target group.

508
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,860
I've thought about that.

509
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,360
Our brand mainly targets two groups:

510
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,320
First are athletes.

511
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,960
Second are running enthusiasts.

512
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,740
But our focus is tech-driven running shoes.

513
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,960
It helps athletes improve speed

514
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,620
while keeping them safe.

515
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,220
So you make shoes for people who love running.

516
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,860
But have you ever thought,

517
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,020
what if someone who doesn't like running

518
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,080
puts on your shoes and enjoys it?

519
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,100
You're right.

520
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,160
If someone who hates running starts to love it

521
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,560
after wearing the shoes I make,

522
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,820
that's very meaningful.

523
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,540
Exactly. That means your market gets wider.

524
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,980
You'll make way more money.

525
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,780
That's true.

526
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,700
Then would you help me test the shoes?

527
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,980
Me?

528
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,320
Yes.

529
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,520
Can I even do that?

530
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,980
Why can't you?

531
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,980
I'll take that as a yes then.

532
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,100
When I finish my first pair of shoes,

533
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,620
you'll be the very first one to test them.

534
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,100
Deal.

535
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,960
 Ding Zhi Tong, 

536
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,120
 you must look amazing when you run. 

537
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,020
 I'll wait for the day... 

538
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,020
 you truly want to run with me. 

539
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,740
Come on, I'll walk you back.

540
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,900
Thanks for walking me back.

541
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,060
Okay. I've arrived.

542
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,700
I'm going in.

543
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,937
Okay.

544
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:43,460
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

545
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,020
By the way,

546
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,440
I've got a mock interview at the café tomorrow afternoon.

547
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,020
Okay.

548
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,720
I see.

549
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,800
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

550
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,940
All right, see you tomorrow.

551
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,680
I'm leaving.

552
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,740
Bye bye.

553
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,620
Why are you still here?

554
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,300
Why don't you go back?

555
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,860
See you tomorrow.

556
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,220
I'm leaving now. See you tomorrow.

557
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,960
See you tomorrow.

558
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,140
Which department are you from?

559
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,200
 Why are you yelling so late? 

560
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
 Running off? 

561
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Hello. I'm Ding Zhi Tong.

562
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,500
Hello. Welcome to the interview.

563
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,020
Please, have a seat.

564
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,680
That's not quite right.

565
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,460
Press palms together.

566
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,920
Align the thumb webs, firm and steady.

567
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,420
Hold for a second without shaking.

568
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,420
Most importantly, look the person in the eye with confidence and sincerity.

569
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,020
And don't forget to smile.

570
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,140
It's just a handshake.

571
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,120
I didn't know there was so much to it.

572
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,400
It's actually the most important part of business etiquette.

573
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,880
It sets the tone for your first impression.

574
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,640
You really know your stuff.

575
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,800
When it's my turn to interview, I definitely need your advice.

576
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,720
Anytime.

577
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,520
Can I take a look?

578
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,460
Here's your lemon water. Enjoy.

579
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,400
- Thanks. 
 - Thanks.

580
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,660
What's wrong? It won't turn on?

581
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,600
Yes. It happens a lot lately. I don't know what's wrong.

582
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,100
I might really need to get it repaired.

583
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,560
Let me see. I know how to fix it.

584
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,880
Can you fix computers?

585
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,960
Then take a look for me.

586
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,632
- Sure. 
 - I really hope it can be fixed.

587
00:32:31,632 --> 00:32:33,980
I'd rather not replace it.

588
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,960
Well?

589
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,560
Is it fixable?

590
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,620
What's the issue?

591
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,760
Looks like it may have a hard drive problem.

592
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,020
"Hard drive problem"?

593
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,000
Are my files still there?

594
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:58,380
Yes. But I might need to open it up to fix it.

595
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,900
How... how about this?

596
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,300
If you don't need to use it right now,

597
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,360
I can take it home tonight, fix and return it tomorrow.

598
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Then I will have to trouble you with this.

599
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,140
Thank you.

600
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,160
No problem.

601
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,940
Gan Yang, what happened that's so important?

602
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,080
Finally, you're back.

603
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,740
Thanks for your effort. Give me your bag.

604
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,300
Sit.

605
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,960
You must be thirsty. Have some water.

606
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,280
Here.

607
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
Don't you love meat?

608
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,060
I made you a steak, medium rare.

609
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,260
All right, get to the point.

610
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,780
Do you know how to fix a laptop?

611
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,600
Take a look.

612
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,320
Whose is this? It's so old.

613
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,900
It's been used for ages.

614
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,940
It's Ding Zhi Tong's.

615
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,820
I guessed that.

616
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,500
Buddy, other people chase girls with flowers and jewelry.

617
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,380
You always do such stuff.

618
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,260
Shut up. Can you fix it or not?

619
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,460
Did you try rebooting or reinstalling the system?

620
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,080
I can't even get it to reboot, let alone reinstall anything.

621
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,340
Then I can't help you.

622
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,220
Aren't you an engineering student? Why can't you fix a laptop?

623
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,960
Who told you engineering students can fix laptops?

624
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,760
I knew you couldn't.

625
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,540
I won't waste time with you.

626
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,440
Hold on.

627
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,360
I can't fix it, but I know someone who can.

628
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,280
All right, give it a try.

629
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,492
He is a professional.

630
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:33,580
Thanks, Boss. Thank you.

631
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,500
No problem, but look, this laptop is ancient.

632
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,560
The system runs fine now, but it will only get slower.

633
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,440
It might crash completely one day.

634
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,320
Better replace it soon.

635
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:50,060
So, Boss, I want to ask this question. If I keep the same outer shell

636
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,612
but replace all the internal parts with the latest parts,

637
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:54,740
how much would that cost?

638
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,100
Seriously?

639
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,200
Boss, ignore him. Just do your work.

640
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,360
Boss, don't listen to him.

641
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,200
How much would it cost?

642
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,560
Well, it won't be cheap. Are you sure about this?

643
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,500
I'm sure.

644
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,900
All right, I'll calculate it for you.

645
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,060
Brother, you're seriously devoted.

646
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,760
Is this really my laptop?

647
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
Yes.

648
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,900
It boots up so fast now.

649
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,220
All the software runs smoothly. It feels like a brand-new one.

650
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,060
Thank you.

651
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,860
Just some minor issues.

652
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,660
What do you want to eat? Pick anything from the cafeteria, my treat.

653
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,620
Ding Zhi Tong, can you be a little more creative?

654
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,520
Who treats others in the cafeteria every time?

655
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,959
Then what do you want to eat?

656
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:04,080
Let me see. But it can't be too expensive.

657
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,360
Actually, a movie is showing.

658
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,940
It's called, "I Like You."

659
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,800
I heard it's quite good.

660
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,460
Why don't we watch it together?

661
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,420
I've already checked.

662
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,840
Twenty-five yuan per ticket. Half price for us.

663
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,580
"Us"?

664
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,960
I m-mean student discount.

665
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,280
That sounds like a deal.

666
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,760
Okay, then it's on me.

667
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,825
- I'll go get the tickets. 
 - Okay.

668
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,420
- Excuse me. 
 - Hello.

669
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,980
One large popcorn, please.

670
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,040
That'll be ¥56. You can scan here.

671
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,540
Hello, Advisor? What's going on?

672
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,760
 A court document addressed to you has arrived at my office. 

673
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,780
 It looks like a court summons. 

674
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,280
 Come pick it up. 

675
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,320
"A court summons"?

676
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,960
That must be a mistake.

677
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,820
Do you know Zhao Hai?

678
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,900
He's my uncle.

679
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,860
 You'd better come now. 

680
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,900
 If this isn't handled properly, it could affect your graduation. 

681
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,600
I understand.

682
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,000
- Ready to go? 
 - Gan Yang, I'm really sorry.

683
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,880
I can't watch the movie with you. I need to go back.

684
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm leaving now.

685
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,300
Ding Zhi Tong.

686
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,270

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

688
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:00,485
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

689
00:38:01,685 --> 00:38:08,735
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

690
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:15,072
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

691
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:22,035
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

692
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:28,960
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

693
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,860
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

694
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:43,035
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

695
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:50,035
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

696
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:56,777
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

697
00:38:56,777 --> 00:39:03,862
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

698
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:10,870
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

699
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:17,791
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

700
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:24,680
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

701
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,335
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

702
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:38,410
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

703
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:51,510
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
