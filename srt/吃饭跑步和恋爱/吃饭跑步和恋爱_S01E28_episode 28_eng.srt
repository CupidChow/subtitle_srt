 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,869
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,457
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,663
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:22,895
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,143
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:32,326
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:35,820
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,592
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:49,756
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:57,852
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:02,304
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:06,812
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,168
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,170
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,870
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,501
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,365
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,036
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,360
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
   
   

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,487
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:39,550
   

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,600
   

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,800
You fought tooth and nail to make M.D.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,320
It's a position many people dream of.

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,120
It's not just about the larger paycheck.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,840
It represents your status.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,940
Are you really giving that up so easily?

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,640
I've thought it through.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,720
Compared to being a capital intermediary,

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,700
I'd rather help people achieve their dreams,

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,100
especially someone I care about.

35
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,320
You're the youngest M.D. in the company.

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,340
The higher-ups always mention you in meetings.

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,980
You could become the youngest partner in the company.

38
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,220
I've made up my mind.

39
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,180
Director Zhang, I appreciate your kindness

40
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,540
and the company's trust.

41
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,900
   

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:41,770


43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,920
   

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,300
How much longer, Sir?

45
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,885
The car broke down. It might take a while.

46
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,020
Aiya! This is...

47
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,080
Sir, I'll get off here.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,820
Please send my luggage over.

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,440
Miss, it's still over ten kilometers away.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,040
- Thank you, Sir. 
 - Well...

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,660
   

52
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,720
What took you so long?

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,020
Well, this vehicle is worn out.

54
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,460
Let me tell you.

55
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,840
The average wet-state interface value increased to 0.36.

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Next, let's focus on cushioning and rebound.

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,940
Let's not discuss work right now.

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,060
My brain is fried.

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,660
Can you not drag me to work tomorrow?

60
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,400
If I get any free time, I'd rather be dating.

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,520
"Dating"?

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,760
What's so great about dating?

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,620
How have you been? Still having trouble sleeping?

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,320
Same as always.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
Stop.

66
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,960
Your medicine has arrived.

67
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,740
 If you ran into an ex-boyfriend you once loved deeply, 

68
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,260
 would you be attracted and act? 

69
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,940
 A) Show up deliberately and try to embarrass him. 

70
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,200
 B) Find how to get back together. 

71
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,420
 C) Pass by silently and wish him well. 

72
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,060
 D) Explore other possibilities. 

73
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,115
 I've changed my answer. 

74
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,420
 If I had an ex-boyfriend, 

75
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,140
 I'd love only him for this lifetime. 

76
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,000
   
   

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,280
 This time LT DT7.0  
   

78
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,960
is a brand-new breakthrough based on the LT DT6.0.

79
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,280
We've incorporated the newly-developed

80
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,820
STBF TVT super-critical foam technology.

81
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,840
This reduces the sole weight by 13.75%

82
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,576
while achieving over 85% energy return.

83
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
I have high hopes for the new model.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,920
I believe once it's launched, it will sell well.

85
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,020
Then what are we waiting for?

86
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,520
Let's start mass production and launch it.

87
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,640
The company has been out of Shanghai for a while now.

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,660
Everyone is itching for a comeback.

89
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,180
I can understand that.

90
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,500
But this is exactly when we need to stay level-headed.

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,780
Then how long do we have to wait?

92
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,380
Our clients are being snatched up by Shuchi right now.

93
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,020
LT DT7.0 is indeed a breakthrough in innovation.

94
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,920
But if we want it to succeed,

95
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,100
we can't just rely on professional data.

96
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,620
The key is whether consumers like it.

97
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,420
Right.

98
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,660
There have been plenty of shoes

99
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,660
with leading indicators but poor sales.

100
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,220
But how do we know if consumers like it if we don't launch?

101
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,860
So we have two options now.

102
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,840
Either

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,100
we keep producing all the old models as usual.

104
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,380
Or we stop producing all the old models

105
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,300
and put all our funds

106
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,820
into development of new ones.

107
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,860
Isn't that too risky?

108
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,260
There's no other way.

109
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,840
We can choose only one.

110
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
Without sufficient production volume,

111
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,660
it's basically impossible to turn things around

112
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,060
with a single new model.

113
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,260
I know...

114
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,520
It's risky to invest all our current funds...

115
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,340
into development of the new model.

116
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,920
It's basically a huge gamble.

117
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,000
If we win...

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,480
our company will get better and better.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,980
If we lose...

120
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,380
all our funds will be gone.

121
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,600
We might even end up in debt.

122
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,320
But the risk is indeed too high.

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,100
I want to take a gamble.

124
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,240
Guys, I know this is a tough decision to make.

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,120
So I'll give everyone three days to think it over.

126
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,260
After three days,

127
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,280
we shall vote.

128
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,340
Let's go for a run?

129
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,860
Okay.

130
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,460
Let's go.

131
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,760
Have you made up your mind?

132
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,020
Weren't you the one who said it?

133
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,720
When you can't decide, first, just eat

134
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,060
or go for a run.

135
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,740
Figure out the rest later.

136
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,620
You still remember that?

137
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,560
Of course.

138
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,320
So? Do you have your answer?

139
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,900
Actually, in your heart, you already know, right?

140
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,960
I want to roll the dice.

141
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,080
But LT

142
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,080
isn't my own life's work.

143
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,640
There are many others, too.

144
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm afraid if I lose the bet,

145
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,760
I'll drag them down with me.

146
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,060
Why would you think that?

147
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,120
Tong Tong, the road we just ran on...

148
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,720
is the one I used to pass every day

149
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,200
after we broke up.

150
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,840
Every time I passed by,

151
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,740
I asked myself

152
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,080
if I should tell you the truth.

153
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,520
Later, I realized

154
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,640
I was wrong back then

155
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,960
not to let you know

156
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,820
what had happened.

157
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
So I'm scared.

158
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm afraid this decision...

159
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,500
might be another mistake.

160
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,520
Then try the method you taught me.

161
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Seven years ago in Beijing,

162
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,900
when you took me to the mountains.

163
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,500
 I want to make a pair 

164
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,660
 of running shoes that everyone likes! 

165
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,320
 I want a good life with my mom 

166
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,560
 and to earn it by myself! 

167
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,960
These shoes will certainly be a success!

168
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,960
I will surely bring LT back to Shanghai!

169
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,680
Thank you, Tong Tong.

170
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,120
Now I know what to do.

171
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,780
Gan Yang.

172
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,020
This time,

173
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,400
whether you win or not,

174
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,660
I'll be with you.

175
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,760
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

176
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,410
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

177
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,300
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

178
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,240
What if I lose this fight?

179
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,060
No problem.

180
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,800
If you lose, you lose.

181
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,280
What if I end up broke?

182
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,060
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

183
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,420
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

184
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,220
Will you run with me?

185
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,510
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

186
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,560
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

187
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,200
I... don't run with just anyone.

188
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,300
If we run, we run for life.

189
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
Are you sure?

190
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,680
Never mind then.

191
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,735
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

192
00:13:56,735 --> 00:14:01,165
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

193
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:05,685
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

194
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:11,285
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

195
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,935
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

196
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,785
♫  Stay with me  ♫

197
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,415
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

198
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,185
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

199
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,965
♫  Burning bright  ♫

200
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:26,435
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

201
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:32,285
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

202
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:36,520
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

203
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,060
How have you been?

204
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,460
Almost fully recovered.

205
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,920
Don't worry.

206
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,980
Time to eat.

207
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,760
 Professor Qin, you got "promoted" quite fast. 

208
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,920
We will treat you to dinner when you're back in Shanghai.

209
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,380
 Okay. 

210
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,000
You and Gan Yang had better hurry.

211
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,360
Actually, we're back together.

212
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,200
Really?

213
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,640
It's only right for you two to be like this.

214
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,620
Make sure you're happy this time.

215
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,380
Don't worry. I will.

216
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,100
But speaking of Gan Yang, I'm annoyed.

217
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,360
Why?

218
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,820
 No idea what toxic motivational nonsense he's posting. 

219
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,200
 Qin Chang saw them 

220
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,180
 and now drags me out running daily. 

221
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,420
- Wait. 
 -  I'm exhausted. 

222
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,260
Running is good for you.

223
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,840
And Professor Qin is the one making you run.

224
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,140
Why blame Gan Yang?

225
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,000
Since when did you become a traitor?

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,080
 Now you're speaking up for him, not for me. 

227
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,700
If only it were that simple.

228
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,920
It would be even more annoying

229
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,300
if he sent running shoes to us.

230
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,900
 That's something he would do. 

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,460
It seems he is back.

232
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,700
Don't hang up then.

233
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,260
I'll make him apologize to you in person.

234
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,440
No need.

235
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,660
I don't want to see him.

236
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm hanging up.

237
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,580
I'm coming.

238
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:15,602
You...

239
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,940
You must be Tong Tong.

240
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,300
Yes.

241
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,600
You're Auntie Liu, right?

242
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,080
Yes, I'm Yang Yang's mother.

243
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:28,418
- Look at this, Director Xu.

244
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,533
Why are you here?

245
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:35,634
Nonsense.

246
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:37,475
Where else would I be during work hours?

247
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:40,040
But I just ran into your Auntie Liu on my way here.

248
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,160
She said she was going to your place.

249
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,360
I thought you were introducing Ding Zhi Tong to your mother.

250
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,640
You saw my mom?

251
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,200
Yes. Why would I lie to you?

252
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,380
Looks like they're really meeting the parent now.

253
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,680
They're meeting the parent.

254
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,860
What about us?

255
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,020
My parents want to meet you.

256
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,373
His eyes were so big 
    

257
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:09,300
even when he was this small?

258
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,660
Look, they're like black grapes.

259
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,480
When we went out, people thought he was a girl.

260
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
Funny, right?

261
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,400
This was him in fifth grade.

262
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,900
He participated in a 5,000-meter race

263
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,340
and won the championship.

264
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,700
He loved running even back then?

265
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,420
He was always a talented athlete.

266
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,940
You know he still loves sports even now.

267
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,780
This was him at sixteen.

268
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,320
Right after his senior high school exams.

269
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,320
Oh, you know, time really flies.

270
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,300
By the way,

271
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,180
let me show you this.

272
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,460
Look.

273
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,020
This is the stuffed toy I bought for him

274
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,180
when he was born.

275
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,740
He loved it so much.

276
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,720
He had to hold it like this every night to fall asleep.

277
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,940
 Once, I took him out and forgot to bring this puppy, 

278
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,960
 and he cried all night. 

279
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,040
Neither of us got any sleep.

280
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,420
Tossing and turning all night long.

281
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,620
Auntie, I had the exact same stuffed toy when I was little.

282
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,560
- Really? 
 - Yes.

283
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,700
You two are really meant to be.

284
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,920
You even like the same things.

285
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Tong Tong, to be honest...

286
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,340
I used to urge Yang Yang to get married.

287
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,020
I even had relatives and friends

288
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,140
set him up on blind dates.

289
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,200
But every time, he would cause trouble.

290
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,180
Once, he even went on six blind dates in one day.

291
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,660
"Six"?

292
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,720
What happened after that?

293
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,180
Yang Yang, perfect timing.

294
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,940
I was just telling Tong Tong.

295
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,600
Mom, why didn't you say you were coming?

296
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,060
You came just in time.

297
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Or were you eavesdropping outside

298
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,340
and came in only when you heard "blind dates"?

299
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,580
Yang Yang, now that I've met Tong,

300
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,980
I understand why you never

301
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,420
cooperated with blind dates.

302
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,820
Mom, you should have led with that.

303
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,600
You scared me.

304
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,260
Tong Tong, you're the first girl Yang Yang brought home.

305
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,860
I'm very happy and excited so I may have said too much.

306
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,580
If I said anything inappropriate,

307
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,040
please don't take it to heart.

308
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,760
Auntie, I'm really glad you could tell me so much.

309
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,540
Tong Tong.

310
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,480
- Yang Yang. 
 - Mom.

311
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,580
Almost seven years apart, you two are back together.

312
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,740
I'm truly very happy for you.

313
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,140
Tong Tong, I'm entrusting Yang Yang to you.

314
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,340
If Yang Yang ever bullies you, just tell me.

315
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,860
I'll deal with him for you.

316
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,420
Okay.

317
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,900
Don't you dare bully me.

318
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,380
I won't.

319
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,460
Honestly, if I were an investor, I'd invest in LT, too.

320
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,820
Oh?

321
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,180
Aside from the clear profit model

322
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,180
and impressive past achievements,

323
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,920
just see how united your team is.

324
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,240
That's the most precious thing.

325
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,800
You're all on the same page.

326
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,820
I thought you'd praise my leadership and brilliance.

327
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,720
Isn't praising your company the same as praising you?

328
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,120
Fair.

329
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,260
Chef, anything else I can help with?

330
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,760
Peel some garlic.

331
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,060
- Five cloves. 
 - "Five cloves"?

332
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,300
Make it six.

333
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,060
Six. I'll peel them all then.

334
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,160
All right.

335
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,660
- Here comes the fried rice. 
 - Here we go.

336
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,680
Try it.

337
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,400
- It's hot. 
 - Hot.

338
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,840
- Is it good? 
 - Delicious.

339
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,100
How do you know how to make this?

340
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,580
You love it, don't you?

341
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,900
I went to a night market vendor and learned how.

342
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,100
Now I can make it myself.

343
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,660
You made it better than him.

344
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,440
- Really? 
 - Yes.

345
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,840
Then try the dish I made.

346
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,900
- Okay. 
 - Bamboo Shoot with Pork Soup.

347
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,760
I've improved.

348
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,100
Really?

349
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,700
Yes. Here.

350
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,120
How is it?

351
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,340
Too salty?

352
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,740
Too bland?

353
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,580
- It's good. 
 - "Good"?

354
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,380
- Really? 
 - Yes.

355
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,140
I did it.

356
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,640
Let's just eat the fried rice.

357
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,780
Okay, let's stick to the fried rice.

358
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,260
I'll serve you.

359
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,380
Tong Tong.

360
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm going to Shanghai tomorrow.

361
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,200
I'm going to Shanghai, too.

362
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,760
Really?

363
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,660
Why are you going?

364
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,340
I'm selling my house there.

365
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,980
I said it's a huge gamble.

366
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,120
I have to go all in.

367
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,260
And you?

368
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,600
I have some things to handle.

369
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,460
- Shall we go together then? 
 - Yes.

370
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,620
Okay.

371
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,800
   

372
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,860
Tong Tong.

373
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,980
Back then, you said once you became rich,

374
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,740
you'd buy this place,

375
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,520
and enjoy life here with the person you love.

376
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,880
Eat together, run together, go to concerts together.

377
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,840
I never forgot those words.

378
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,300
So the first thing I did when I made money

379
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,620
was buy this place.

380
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,180
Over the years...

381
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,680
no matter how tough things got, returning here...

382
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,340
always made me feel better.

383
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,860
It's like you were by my side.

384
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,120
Are you having second thoughts now?

385
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,480
Yes.

386
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,620
Tong Tong.

387
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,720
If I lose this gamble

388
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,920
and end up homeless...

389
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,060
you'll have to take me in.

390
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,260
I'm afraid I can't.

391
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,940
Why not?

392
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,200
You'd let me sleep on the streets?

393
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Of course not.

394
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,820
But I sold my place, too.

395
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,380
- Why? 
 - I want to share this gamble with you.

396
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,340
I knew you wouldn't agree to it

397
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,620
so I transferred the money to Xu Chen Xi.

398
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,820
It should be spent by now.

399
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,520
Ding Zhi Tong,

400
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,060
who taught you to act first and ask later?

401
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,800
You did.

402
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,900
Before, I thought making money was most important.

403
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,020
I thought having money would definitely bring happiness.

404
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,320
But now I think

405
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,380
happiness is being with the one you love.

406
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,720
So, Gan Yang...

407
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,820
this time I want to make this gamble with you.

408
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,740
Three days are up.

409
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,900
What have you all decided?

410
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,940
Wang Yi and I have decided to go all in.

411
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,660
We have confidence in this new model.

412
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,680
Right. Worst case, we start over.

413
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,700
Losing isn't scary.

414
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,260
- Losing... 
 - Don't jinx it.

415
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,660
"Lose"? Impossible!

416
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,860
We can't lose!

417
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,420
- Right, we won't lose. 
 - Right, we won't lose.

418
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,700
We will definitely win!

419
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,620
- Exactly. 
 - We will win.

420
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,000
We've all stated our positions. What about you?

421
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,780
- Let's do it!! 
 - Let's do it!!

422
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,920
- Go for it! 
 - Let's do it!

423
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:50,260
   

424
00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:56,100
   

425
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,880
   

426
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,700
   
   

427
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,149
   

428
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:07,643
   

429
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,860
   

430
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,880
Congratulations.

431
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,400
- Yes! 
 - Great!

432
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,560
 Great! 

433
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,700
Xu Chen Xi.

434
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,900
Will you marry me?

435
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,723
 Say yes! 

436
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:26,028
 Say yes! 

437
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:32,267
 Say yes! 

438
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,200
I will.

439
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,392
Say yes!

440
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:36,020
Hooray!

441
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,873
Kiss!

442
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:59,505
 Kiss! 

443
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:03,600
 Kiss! 

444
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,304
   

445
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,840
 I can't believe how fast LT has grown. 

446
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,520
In just one year, it's back among the industry leaders.

447
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,060
It returned to Shanghai

448
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,560
and spent a fortune buying this building.

449
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,160
   

450
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,640
What are you reading?

451
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,320
It hasn't been long.

452
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,980
And Yuan Chao has turned Training Box into this mess.

453
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,780
After LT withdrew,

454
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,220
didn't Training Box partner with Shuchi?

455
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,900
They aggressively expanded their offline gym business.

456
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,680
But their market share was severely squeezed by LT.

457
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,580
With a broken capital chain,

458
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,480
they had to close more than half of their gyms.

459
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,440
Don't overthink it.

460
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,960
Yuan Chao reaped what he sowed.

461
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,720
He moved too fast.

462
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,740
He took too big of a step.

463
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,010
 ­  

464
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,120
Gan Yang.

465
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,800
You did it.

466
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,480
You really brought everyone back

467
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,360
to Shanghai in just one year.

468
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,400
Tong Tong, thank you.

469
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,340
I couldn't have done it

470
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,140
without you.

471
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:47,997
Chairman Wang.

472
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,720
You have to save Training Box.

473
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,760
It's one of your companies.

474
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,700
You can't just watch it go bankrupt, right?

475
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:05,701
CEO Yuan, we invest in countless companies yearly.

476
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:08,302
Training Box is just one of them.

477
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,500
Frankly, it's not essential to us.

478
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,203
"One of them"?

479
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:15,381
"Not essential"?

480
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:18,460
Remember what you promised me back then?

481
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,200
 - CEO Yuan... 
 - Chairman Wang. 

482
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,180
Chairman Wang.

483
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,220
- Chairman Wang! 
 - CEO Yuan.

484
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,380
Remember your promises back then?

485
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,500
- CEO Yuan, please leave. 
 - Chairman Wang!

486
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,140
Chairman Wang! Training Box will collapse at this rate!

487
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,860
 Chairman Wang! Chairman Wang! 

488
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,300
Yuan Chao.

489
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,700
Gan Yang?

490
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,420
Gan Yang, I knew you were the most loyal.

491
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,280
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

492
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,080
It was Wang Sen.

493
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,760
Wang Sen made me do it.

494
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,340
Wang Sen.

495
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,840
I knew it was you from the start.

496
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,080
Gan Yang. I'm begging you.

497
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,960
No matter what, please save Training Box, okay?

498
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm begging you.

499
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,600
Gan Yang?

500
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,680
Yuan Chao,

501
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,060
Training Box was beyond saving long ago.

502
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,840
Go turn yourself in.

503
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,020
You have to take responsibility...

504
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,160
for your mistakes.

505
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,460
   

506
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,831
   

507
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:10,000
   

508
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,220
   

509
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,085
 Thank you, everyone. 

510
00:34:20,085 --> 00:34:23,006
I hereby announce that Ding Qin Investment Co., Ltd.

511
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:24,491
is officially established today!

512
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:27,140
   

513
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,660
Do you remember what to say to Mama Ding?

514
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,300
Mama Ding, this is for you.

515
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,640
Thank you, Yu Lin.

516
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:38,700
Wishing Mama Ding and Uncle Qin

517
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,879
a thriving business... and prosperity!

518
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,820
Good Girl.

519
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,740
Thank you, Yu Lin.

520
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,360
Congratulations, CEO Ding.

521
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,920
Thank you, CEO Gan.

522
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,032
Ding Zhi Tong.

523
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:53,600
 Let's go out to celebrate later. 

524
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,660
 I know a great place. 

525
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,740
 I'll send you the details. 

526
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:01,341
- Good job. 
 - Thank you, Chairman Wang.

527
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,941
Congratulations.

528
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:06,280
- You won. 
 - Thank you, Chairman Wang.

529
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,320
Well, I hope we will have another chance to work together.

530
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,993
Looking forward to working with you.

531
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:20,073
Indeed.

532
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,740
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

533
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,900
Gan Yang, your dream is finally coming true.

534
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,780
Now more people are falling in love with running due to your shoes.

535
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,100
Congratulations.

536
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,660
But where I am today

537
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,800
came at the cost of your career dreams.

538
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,720
You could have been Gutong's M.D. by now.

539
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
That's not it.

540
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,340
To help you achieve your dream

541
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,420
showed me what I really want to do.

542
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,360
I want to help others realize their dreams.

543
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,000
That's also why I started Ding Qin Investments.

544
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,900
Tong Tong,

545
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,780
I've always regretted it.

546
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,580
If I hadn't broken up with you,

547
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,300
if we had stayed together,

548
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,260
maybe things would have turned out the same.

549
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,381
It's not the same as now.

550
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:32,121
Now I can stand beside you as your equal.

551
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:36,506
Now on, let's move forward together, shoulder to shoulder.

552
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,140
Tong Tong, wait for me.

553
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,380
Wait for me!

554
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,240
Where are you going?

555
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,740
- Tong Tong. 
 - Why are you all here?

556
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,860
To go running together.

557
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,060
- Hi, Ding Zhi Tong. 
 - Why are you guys here, too?

558
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,060
- Hi, Sister Tong. 
 - Jia Xin.

559
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,460
Why is everyone here?

560
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,340
What's going on?

561
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,500
Since when do you all run?

562
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,620
Of course, we have to.

563
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,180
- Exhausted? 
 - Yes.

564
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,700
Right.

565
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,982
Where did you go?

566
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:39,604
Tong Tong.

567
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:44,270
Do you remember what I promised you?

568
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,270
About what?

569
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,740
Will you marry me?

570
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,060
I will.

571
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:30,900

 Let's give a warm round of applause to welcome the bride! 

577
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,600
Tong Tong.

578
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:42,900
Will you...

579
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,200
Are you willing to run with me?

580
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,280
Tong Tong.

581
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,040
Do you remember when we first met?

582
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,480
 I was clueless back then. 

583
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,280
 All I could do was ask you over and over again 

584
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,320
 if you would run with me. 

585
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,740
 Later, we were a couple. 

586
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,460
 But you had to work in Shanghai. 

587
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,440
 You were worried 

588
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,960
 that distance would affect our relationship. 

589
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,340
 But we held on. 

590
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,360
 I know we've been through a lot these years. 

591
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,320
We almost lost each other.

592
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,280
But thankfully,

593
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,500
we arrived here now.

594
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,400
Getting to know you

595
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,040
and loving you

596
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,000
is the best gift I've ever had.

597
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:25,100


598
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,720
Gan Yang,

599
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:31,381
before I met you,

600
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,900
I didn't know how to live properly.

601
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,100
I didn't know how to take care of myself,

602
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,720
let alone take care of others.

603
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,840
It's you who patiently taught me

604
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,520
how to love myself,

605
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,200
to love others,

606
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,560
and accept love in return.

607
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,555
Thank you, Gan Yang.

♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

637
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:20,462
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

00:45:20,462 --> 00:45:27,525
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

639

♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫
