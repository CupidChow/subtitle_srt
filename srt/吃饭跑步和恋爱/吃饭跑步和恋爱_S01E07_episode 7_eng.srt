 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,200
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
 Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,380
♫  And just for now, I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,790
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love's tide  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,750
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,680
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,240
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,010
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,600
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,440
   

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,600
Water.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,540
I need water.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,420
- Water. 
 - What's going on with him?

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,400
Must be drunk.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,960
I'll talk to you later.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
Someone seems to be electrocuted.

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Water.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,220
I need water.

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,020
Water.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,260
Are you okay?

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,760
Water.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,160
- I need water. 
 - Pardon?

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,460
Give me water.

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,660
Give it to me.

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,180
Give me water.

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,640
I've drunk from this.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,542
Are you feeling better?

42
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,660
Who are you?

43
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,960
- I... 
 - Are you insane?

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
Why did you kick me?

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
I...

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,780
You're the insane one.

47
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,220
If not for my kick, it would keep electrocuting you!

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,580
And now you're cursing at me?

49
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,900
Are you blind or what?

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,840
I was just exhausted from running, taking a break.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,000
When was I electrocuted?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,800
I saw it with my own eyes!

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,900
Anyway, I saved you.

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,500
Since you're okay, I'm leaving.

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,400
Hey, come back!

56
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,940
Give me back my water.

57
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,560
Hey...

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,500
I hope I never see you again.

59
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,125
   

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,940
You are preparing to confess your love. Must you really drag me along?

61
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,340
I want the beef one.

62
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,440
Got it.

63
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,200
Ordering so much? Can you even finish it?

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,812
I'm not making you pay. Mind your own business.

65
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,105
This is food therapy. You get it?

66
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,600
My legs are still shaking.

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,180
Listen, your leg shaking has nothing to do with eating.

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,140
You're just weak.

69
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,060
No wonder she thought you got electrocuted.

70
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,900
Have some decency. I'm barely alive here,

71
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
yet you still make fun of me. You go too far.

72
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,140
But seriously, how did that girl even come up

73
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,240
with the electrocution idea?

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,060
I'm so angry.

75
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,640
I pray that I never meet more weirdos like her.

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
Order number 2073, your food is ready.

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
I'll go get it.

78
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,860
Is all this ours?

79
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,320
- Thanks. 
 - No problem.

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,640
Why did you order so much?

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,760
Let's go.

82
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,120
We've got all this stuff.

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,680
Let's finish eating before we go.

84
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,860
Come on, let's go.

85
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
We have many preparations to do.

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,380
Hurry.

87
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:54,200
Don't forget the flowers.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,140
I know.

89
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,320
Ding Zhi Tong uses the same ringtone.

90
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,880
What a coincidence.

91
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,400
Do you think it's a sign?

92
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,040
That my confession tomorrow will work out?

93
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,800
Love is scary.

94
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
You're hopeless.

95
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:18,520
Hello?

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,080
 You're staying an extra night in Shanghai 

97
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,040
 just to watch Gan Yang run tomorrow? 

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,360
 Yes, he invited me. 

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
He repeatedly emphasized that it's really important, and I must come.

100
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,640
Very mysterious.

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,220
Will he confess to you?

102
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,840
What are you thinking? Don't talk nonsense.

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,700
I'm serious.

104
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,732
I've read a lot of news

105
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:44,640
 about people confessing at marathons. 

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,980
I think... this has to be it.

107
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,460
 Just brace yourself. 

108
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,660
He just invited me to watch him run.

109
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,040
Stop overthinking it.

110
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,780
Where are you staying tonight then?

111
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,880
Hotels nearby are expensive.

112
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,980
I'll just crash at McDonald's.

113
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,820
 Missy, do you really have to rough it like that? 

114
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,020
It's okay. It's just one night.

115
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,420
And it's not bad here.

116
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,360
There's air conditioning, and it's safe.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,560
And most importantly, it's free.

118
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,300
 Well, take care of yourself. 
   

119
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,705
 Message me if anything happens. 

120
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:20,945
 - Okay?  
 - Yes.

121
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,740
 ­  

122
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,500
   

123
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,270
 ­  

124
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:49,425
   

125
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,980
   

126
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,800
Ding Zhi Tong?

127
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,540
Why are you here?

128
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,560
Auntie Liu said you came to Shanghai for a marathon.

129
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,880
As your childhood friend, of course, I had to come to cheer you on.

130
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,620
Who's Ding Zhi Tong?

131
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,280
- Ms. Blind? 
 - Ding Zhi Tong is...

132
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,780
Mr. Wimp?

133
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,600
- You two know each other? 
 - I don't know him.

134
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,640
Then how do we settle the score for your kicking me yesterday?

135
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,980
Let go of me, or I'll scream that you harass me.

136
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,260
So it was you who kicked him yesterday.

137
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,060
I was saving a life.

138
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,620
Well, thanks a lot. (sarcasm)

139
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
You're biting the hand that feeds you.

140
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,980
Don't get physical.

141
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,740
Let me introduce you. Let me.

142
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,220
This is my childhood friend, Xu Chen Xi.

143
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,880
And this is Wang Yi, my buddy.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,660
Xu Chen Xi, did you drive here?

145
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,020
Yes, why?

146
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,980
Then please give someone a ride to the finish line.

147
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,480
- I have something very important to do. 
 - Okay.

148
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,500
Just confess your love at the finish line.

149
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,820
Tons of people do it there every year.

150
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,340
And with so many witnesses, it's so romantic.

151
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,660
"Confess"?

152
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,340
To whom?

153
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,160
Why so nosy? Definitely not you.

154
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm not doing it at the finish line.

155
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,100
A confession is between two people.

156
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,540
Just we two are enough.

157
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,320
And doing it in front of a crowd feels like coercion.

158
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,960
I don't want to pressure her.

159
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,140
That's so considerate.

160
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,740
Where are you planning to confess then?

161
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,700
At the park near the finish line.

162
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,740
What else do you want to know?

163
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,840
Ding Zhi Tong.

164
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,560
You're here.

165
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,220
Come on.

166
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,460
Let me introduce my friends to you.

167
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,140
This is Wang Yi. You've met him before.

168
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,860
He's my buddy.

169
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,980
This is Xu Chen Xi, and this is Ding Zhi Tong.

170
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,500
Nice to meet you.

171
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,780
Nice to meet you.

172
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,080
 Runners, please prepare. 

173
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,500
 We begin at the starting line. 

174
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,540
It's about to start.

175
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,740
We will head over.

176
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,680
She will drive you to the finish line later.

177
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,580
See you at the finish line.

178
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,740
Okay, see you there.

179
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,226
All right, I'll go then.

180
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:28,140
Don't forget.

181
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,620
I know. Stop nagging.

182
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,680
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

183
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,720
   

184
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,971
- Come on!

 - Good luck.

187
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,780
Go for it!

188

Gan Yang, you've got this!

Go for it!

191
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,660
- You can do it! 
 - Come on.

192
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,900
Three.

193
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,918
Two.

194
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:15,960
One.

195
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,720
Come on!

196
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,340
   

197
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,175

♫  Sunrise covers everywhere I ran through  ♫

201

 - Give it your all!

202
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,760
You've got this!

203
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,900
Let's go to the next stop.

208

Where are they? 
    

209
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,512
Did they drop out?

210
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:12,457
No way. Let's wait a bit longer.

211
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:13,700
He's catching up to the one ahead.

220
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,240
Mr. Wimp, can you do it?

221
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,280
Do you need another kick?

222
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,680
- Come on! 
 - Go for it!

223
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,980
Let's meet them at the finish line.

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,940
Keep going! 
    

243
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,755
- Come on! 
 - Go for it!

244
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:08,820
Ding Zhi Tong?

245
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,600
Go for it.

246
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,060
Nice work.

247
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,100
Ding Zhi Tong?

248
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,120
Two hours, 41 minutes, and 13 seconds, you're amazing.

249
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,300
Where is Ding Zhi Tong?

250
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,380
Here... Have some water.

251
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,120
Take it slow.

252
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,380
Where is Ding Zhi Tong?

253
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,980
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm done. I'm exhausted.

254
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,560
Water, have some water.

255
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,600
You should have some, too.

256
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,620
Where is Ding Zhi Tong?

257
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,760
She said she had to leave.

258
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
What?

259
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,440
Don't you know what today is?

260
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,020
Why didn't you stop her?

261
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,180
Well, what could I do if she wanted to leave?

262
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Well, give me the phone.

263
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,260
- Here. 
 - Come on!

264
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,200
   

265
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,600
Hello.

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,860
Ding Zhi Tong, where are you?

267
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
On my way back to Beijing.

268
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,460
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up.

269
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
My phone is about to die.

270
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,960
All right.

271
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,120
Call me when you get there.

272
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,940
Stay safe.

273
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,540
Hello?

274
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,940
 Keep going. 

275
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,980
You're his buddy.

276
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,660
Go comfort him.

277
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,500
And you're his childhood friend. Why don't you go?

278
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,540
 Keep going. 

279
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,660
 - Come on! 
 - Go for it! 

280
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,020
 - Go for it. You can do it. 
 - Hang in there. 

281
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,820
 - Come on! 
 - Go for it! 

282
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,980
 - Almost there. 
 - You're so close! 

283
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,500
 How do you know Gan Yang? 

284
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,620
 We are from the same university. 

285
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,000
 So you came to Shanghai specifically to watch him run a marathon? 

286
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,500
 Not specifically. 

287
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,860
 I came here for an interview 

288
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,840
 and check it out while I'm here. 

289
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,440
 - Then he must have invited you. 
 - Yes. 

290
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,340
 I knew it. 

291
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,120
 Did he invite you, too? 

292
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,700
 Yes. 

293
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,220
 He's a weirdo. 

294
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,820
 He likes running; that's fine, 

295
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,380
 but he also likes others to watch him 

296
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,520
 and even run with him. 

297
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,760
 Did he invite you as well? 

298
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,980
 Did he ask you to run with him, too? 

299
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,340
 More than that. 

300
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,420
 He always pestered me to run with him. 

301
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,760
 He drove me crazy. 

302
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,980
 So did you two end up running? 

303
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,220
 Of course. 

304
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,460
 But I have no athletic talent at all. 

305
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,500
 I sprained my ankle on the first day. 

306
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,560
 For a whole month afterward, he carried me to class. 

307
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,720
 You seem to know him well. 

308
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,280
 Of course. 

309
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,740
 We grew up together. 

310
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,420
 Have you seen his shoe wall at his villa in Beijing? 

311
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:39,600
 - No. 
 - It was when I was injured 

312
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,380
 that he suddenly decided to make shoes. 

313
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,980
 He said he'd make me a pair 

314
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,800
 to prevent running injuries. 

315
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,940
 Never thought he'd actually 

316
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,540
 stick with it just for me. 

317
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,580
 So that's why he began making shoes. 

318
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,840
 You can drop me off up ahead when you can. 

319
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,380
 I won't go to the finish line. 

320
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,020
 Sure. 

321
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,440
 Thanks. 

322
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,940
 Ding Zhi Tong, why are you upset? 

323
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,200
 He just wanted a running buddy 

324
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,300
 and invited you to purely watch him run. 

325
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,840
 He never said he liked you. 

326
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,680
 This whole thing was just your imagination. 

327
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,640
 You can't blame him. 

328
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,980
   

329
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,360
 Text me when you arrive. 

330
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,150
   

331
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,630
Hey, Song Ming Mei.

332
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,220
I tried calling Ding Zhi Tong, but her phone was off.

333
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,700
Is she back from Shanghai yet?

334
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,340
No, she had something to do and stayed an extra night.

335
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,652
She will arrive in Beijing tomorrow.

336
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:27,772
Did she say what it was about?

337
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,780
She said to watch a friend run a marathon.

338
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,700
Do you know when she will arrive tomorrow?

339
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,401
 Early tomorrow morning, I think. 

340
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:37,820
Okay, I got it.

341
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,620
Thanks.

342
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,350
   

343
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,320
Tong Tong.

344
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,820
Why are you here? Waiting for me?

345
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,980
I wanted to call you yesterday to ask about your interview.

346
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,580
Your phone was off, and I worried.

347
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,600
Song Ming Mei told me you'd be back today.

348
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes, I turned it off to save battery.

349
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,225
   

350
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,100
   

351
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,680
What's up, Gan Yang?

352
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,600
Hello, Ding Zhi Tong, are you okay?

353
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,100
Why was your phone off this whole time?

354
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm fine.

355
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,880
I couldn't reach you.

356
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,620
I was worried.

357
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,600
 Are you back in Beijing yet? 

358
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,240
Tong Tong, let me get your bag.

359
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,940
Yes, I'm back.

360
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,080
Okay then. I'll hang up.

361
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,840
Bye.

362
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
Let's go.

363
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,820
Tong Tong, are you free tonight?

364
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,100
Not sure yet. Why?

365
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,480
If you're free, I'd like to treat you to dinner.

366
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,820
I got the job offer.

367
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,420
Really?

368
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,840
That's great. Which company?

369
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,060
It's a secret for now.

370
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,300
I'll tell you tonight.

371
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,580
Then let's invite Ming Mei, too?

372
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,220
- Let's go. 
 - Sure.

373
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,360
So? Did Gan Yang confess his love to you?

374
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,080
What confession?

375
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,940
He just invited me to watch him run.

376
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,300
No way. That can't be.

377
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,960
Feng Sheng invited me to dinner tonight.

378
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,080
Do you want to come?

379
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
I need to go to Jiaoyang Animal Husbandry.

380
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
I'll join you later. You go ahead.

381
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,060
But you already finished your industry research report, right?

382
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,040
I still have to confirm many details.

383
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,860
Tong Tong.

384
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
Over here.

385
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,700
Have a seat.

386
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,860
Getting the offer really makes a difference.

387
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,080
This place must be expensive.

388
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,780
It's okay.

389
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,580
Order whatever you want.

390
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,460
Don't worry about the price.

391
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,540
And where is Ming Mei sitting?

392
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,120
She called me last minute, saying something came up.

393
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,940
We will all hang out another time.

394
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,460
Hello, what would you like to order?

395
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,620
Here. Take a look first.

396
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,540
I'm fine with anything. You decide.

397
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,400
We would like two orders of the special set.

398
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,120
- Sure. 
 - Thanks.

399
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,860
Thank you.

400
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,180
Tong Tong, besides Hetai,

401
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
have you heard back from any other interviews?

402
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,080
Yes, I got a few offers.

403
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,000
But I'm still waiting on Hetai.

404
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,080
It's my top choice anyway.

405
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,520
How about you? Which company did you decide on?

406
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,600
Someone from Hetai contacted me today.

407
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,200
If all goes smoothly, I've passed their interview.

408
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,320
But they want me in their industry research department

409
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,960
as an analyst.

410
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,400
How do you decide?

411
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,180
Other than Hetai, do you know about Wendao Capital in Beijing?

412
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,840
They have a position for an investment manager.

413
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Wendao Capital is great.

414
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,360
I wanted to apply there, too,

415
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,180
but it's based in Beijing so I didn't.

416
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,680
The pay is significantly better than Hetai's, though.

417
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,900
It's 30% higher.

418
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,200
That's a great offer.

419
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,780
Yes.

420
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,740
Tong Tong, I want to wait until you've decided

421
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,820
before making my choice.

422
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,040
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

423
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,580
- No problem. 
 - Thanks.

424
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,200
Enjoy.

425
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,080
This steak looks good.

426
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,820
Have another piece.

427
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,080
I think Wendao Capital is great,

428
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,780
definitely better than Hetai.

429
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,792
Putting salary aside,

430
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:26,900
an investment manager definitely has better prospects than an industry analyst.

431
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,600
So you think I should go with Wendao Capital?

432
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,320
Yes.

433
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,580
It suits you better.

434
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,120
True.

435
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,660
I still have a few days.

436
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,480
I'll think about it.

437
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,580
Let's eat.

438
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,600
How is it?

439
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,760
This place is not bad, right?

440
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,860
What's the matter?

441
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,860
I did well in the marathon.

442
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,840
I want to treat you to a meal to celebrate.

443
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,720
Congratulations,

444
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,280
but I've already eaten.

445
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,460
I'm leaving.

446
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,140
Tong Tong, get some rest.

447
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,540
Feng Sheng.

448
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
What's your relationship with her?

449
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,640
I just confessed to her tonight and walked her back.

450
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,200
Can't you tell what we are?

451
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,800
You intentionally let me hear you at the station today, didn't you?

452
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,980
I have to admit

453
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,000
that move packed a punch.

454
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,740
The whole way back, I kept wondering

455
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,020
what was going on between you two.

456
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,280
I was afraid you were together,

457
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,400
and I feared I had missed my chance.

458
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,780
But just now,

459
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,360
your words gave me the answer.

460
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,540
You two are not boyfriend and girlfriend yet.

461
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,320
Am I right?

462
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,200
Gan Yang, don't be so full of yourself.

463
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,500
You and she are from totally different worlds.

464
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,520
She knows that better than anyone.

465
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,560
She could never be with you.

466
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,980
Just give up.

467
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,640
What kind of old-fashioned line is that?

468
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,900
How cliché.

469
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,680
By your logic, you two are from the same world.

470
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,180
Then why aren't you two together?

471
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,240
If anyone should give up, it's you.

472
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,260
We shall see.

473
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,100
Let's see.

474
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,400
Morning, Ding Zhi Tong.

475
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,440
Heading to work?

476
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,360
Let's go together.

477
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,920
Tong Tong, hop on. I'll give you a ride.

478
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,200
Let's go.

479
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,240
I'll walk by myself.

480
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,640
Don't be late, please.

481
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,160
Professor Qin.

482
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
Class starts in ten minutes.

483
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,560
Don't be late, or forget about your class credits.

484
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,740
What a coincidence. I'm actually heading to your class.

485
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,560
Mind giving me a ride?

486
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,680
I remember you saying something similar.

487
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,800
Then the next day, I became a laughingstock among students.

488
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,680
So being good to you doesn't pay off.

489
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,880
That was my fault last time.

490
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,580
I apologize.

491
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,860
Look at me. I'm injured like this.

492
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,120
You wouldn't just leave me here, would you?

493
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,780
Come on. Class starts in seven minutes.

494
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,120
Professor Qin will be late if we don't go now.

495
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,660
Professor Qin, thanks for your help.

496
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,200
Let's go.

497
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,860
So this is your opportunity?

498
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,520
Look who's talking.

499
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,940
You're no different.

500
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,480
Young men should face it.

501
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,640
You can't beat me.

502
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,660
Let's see about that.

503
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,360
Feng Sheng. Are you okay?

504
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,040
- Are you hurt? 
 - My hand hurts.

505
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,800
It hurts.

506
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,520
Luckily, it's not too serious.

507
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,960
Be more careful in the future.

508
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,680
Got it.

509
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,100
   

510
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,520
Excuse me.

511
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,880
- Thank you. 
 - Are you two okay?

512
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,740
It's nothing, just a scrape.

513
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,140
"Just a scrape"?

514
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,640
Look at my injury!

515
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,200
Can you two stop playing "Fast and Furious"? (U.S. movie)

516
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,880
At least do it where there's no one.

517
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
Sorry.

518
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,720
My bad, Ming Mei.

519
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,380
Please be gentle.

520
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,340
Let me do it. Thank you.

521
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,940
- How did you get hurt like this? 
 - Ding Zhi Tong,

522
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,040
sit here to apply medicine for her.

523
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,820
No, thanks.

524
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:33,312
From now on, whether you're biking or running,

525
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:34,580
can you both be more careful?

526
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,560
Don't involve others.

527
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,760
Song Ming Mei, I'm sorry.

528
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,840
It was my fault today.

529
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,760
If you need anything, just call me.

530
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,560
I'm leaving.

531
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,380
All right. Keep the wounds dry

532
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,400
and avoid strenuous activity.

533
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,060
You all can leave now.

534
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,740
- Thanks. 
 - Thank you.

535
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,860
Let me walk you two back.

536
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,040
I'll take you gals. My car is outside.

537
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,800
Professor Qin, Ming Mei shouldn't walk far now.

538
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,600
Please take her.

539
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,420
I'm good. I'll take Feng Sheng.

540
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,560
Sure. 
    

541
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,280
- Be careful. 
 - I'm leaving then.

542
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,600
Easy does it.

543
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,440
We're leaving.

544
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,140
Bye bye, Ming Mei.

545
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,300
Let's go.

546
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,520
Is your hand okay?

547
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,720
Yes, just a little scrape.

548
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,820
Feng Sheng,

549
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,260
I hope we always stay good friends.

550
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,200
So you walked me back just to say that?

551
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,640
Then what about you and Gan Yang?

552
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,500
You two...

553
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,800
We're just classmates,

554
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,660
and that's all.

555
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,340
Hope you really mean that.

556
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,780
I don't want you to get hurt.

557
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,520
All right, I'll walk by myself.

558
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,460
She's been so cold to me lately.

559
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,180
Today at the infirmary, she even said those things to me.

560
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,000
Does she not like me anymore?

561
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,740
Wang Yi,

562
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,160
did I just experience a breakup?

563
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,440
You have to be dating first to break up.

564
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,980
This is nothing.

565
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,040
Didn't you say Feng Sheng confessed to her?

566
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,080
Maybe they're already together

567
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,900
so she treats you like this.

568
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,640
No way.

569
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,080
Absolutely not!

570
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,560
She couldn't possibly like Feng Sheng.

571
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,080
How could she ever like him?

572
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,200
You're right. It's impossible.

573
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,240
You're kind, handsome, and loyal.

574
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,180
How could Feng Sheng compare to you?

575
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,880
If I were a girl... Even as a guy, I'd pick you.

576
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,920
Buddy, I think I need to go to her

577
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,560
and get a clear answer.

578
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,540
Even if she rejects me,

579
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,180
I deserve to know the reason.

580
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,680
What if she really does choose Feng Sheng?

581
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,180
Just wait.

582
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,520
I support you emotionally.

583
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,440
Why haven't I heard back from Hetai yet?

584
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,860
Give it more time.

585
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,060
You know securities companies love to hire PSDs:

586
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,780
poor, smart, desire.

587
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,080
You check all three boxes.

588
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,500
They'd be crazy not to hire you.

589
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,380
Hope you're right.

590
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,900
Ding Zhi Tong.

591
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,300
Ding Zhi Tong!

592
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,760
Ding Zhi Tong! Ding Zhi Tong!

593
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,660
 Ding Zhi Tong! 

594
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,120
 Tong Tong, someone is calling you. 

595
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,520
 Ding Zhi Tong. 

596
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,260
 What? 

597
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,180
Come down here.

598
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,100
 Why should I? 

599
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,200
I need to ask you something.

600
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,100
Say it over the phone.

601
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,680
Where's my phone? I left it at home.

602
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
He's drunk and trying to confess.

603
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,560
 Tell me tomorrow then. 

604
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,160
No. Come down.

605
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,820
Ding Zhi Tong! Ding Zhi Tong!

606
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,800
Do something about him. Don't let him shout like that.

607
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,760
- The whole building will hear. 
 - Ding Zhi Tong.

608
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,260
Ding Zhi Tong!

609
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,360
- Stop shouting! 
 - Don't let him shout like that.

610
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,600
- Go down. 
 - Fine, I'm coming.

611
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,480
She's on her way.

612
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,760
 Ding Zhi Tong. 

613
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
Ding Zhi Tong.

614
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,500
- What are you doing? 
 - Come here.

615
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,860
Slow down.

616
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
What are you doing?

617
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,180
Stand still.

618
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,220
Your jacket.

619
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,700
Here.

620
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,360
Did you drink?

621
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,840
A little.

622
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,700
How many fingers?

623
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,140
Two.

624
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,160
I'm not drunk.

625
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,780
All right, what do you want to say?

626
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,120
Let me think.

627
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,440
Think all you want. I'm going back.

628
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,100
Wait.

629
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,040
Why have you been ignoring me lately?

630
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,900
What... what's your relationship with Xu Chen Xi?

631
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,120
We're childhood friends.

632
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,940
Why are you asking this?

633
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,140
Do you often invite people to run with you?

634
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,920
No.

635
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,500
I want to run with only you.

636
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,960
Well, you and Xu Chen Xi are so close.

637
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,520
Have you ever invited her to run with you?

638
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,200
No. Absolutely not.

639
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,620
Wait.

640
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,560
There was a time when she kept begging to join me,

641
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,320
saying to lose weight.

642
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,520
But she sprained her ankle at once.

643
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,760
My mom kept scolding me due to that.

644
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
It was annoying.

645
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,920
She made me pick her up from school daily.

646
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,000
- Really? 
 - Yes.

647
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't you believe me?

648
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,800
If you don't, I'll call...

649
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,920
I left my phone at home.

650
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,900
Wait a moment.

651
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,860
Don't bother. Fine, I believe you.

652
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,600
I do. Stop looking for it.

653
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Is that why you've been ignoring me?

654
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,200
Just due to Xu Chen Xi?

655
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,320
I thought... I thought you liked her.

656
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,360
No.

657
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,260
We're just childhood friends, really.

658
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
I see.

659
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,260
Do you have any other questions?

660
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,640
Yes!

661
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,920
Are you dating Feng Sheng?

662
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,720
No. We're just childhood friends, too.

663
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,740
Just good friends.

664
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,880
Really?

665
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,640
Truly.

666
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,780
Good.

667
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,680
I thought you two were together.

668
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,980
That's funny.

669
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,460
I thought you and Xu Chen Xi were together, too.

670
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,260
Ding Zhi Tong,

671
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,425
do you have someone you like?

672
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:41,340
♫  Hovers between us  ♫

673
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,850
♫  Lemony freshness after the rain  ♫

674
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,760
♫  Your breathing  ♫

675
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,460
Will you run with me tomorrow then?

676
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,275
♫  Has the same rhythm as me  ♫

677
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:56,600
♫  A different feeling  ♫

678
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,080
It's getting late.

679
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,700
Let me take you back.

680
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,660
- How did you get here? 
 - I...

681
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,480
I ran here.

682
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,980
Well, do you remember Wang Yi's number?

683
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,960
I'll call him to pick you up.

684
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,944
"Wang Yi"?

685
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,200
♫  Every shining, shining day  ♫

686
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,160
I don't remember.

687
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,060
Hold this. I'll take you back.

688
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:25,549
♫  Every shining, shining day  ♫

689
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:30,450
♫  I will go and open my heart  ♫

690
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,860
Will you run with me tomorrow?

691
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,780
Let me get you home first.

692
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,440
No.

693
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,600
♫  You are so unique  ♫

694
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,140
Promise me first.

695
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,820
Promise you'll run with me.

696
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,450
♫  Like a cup of warm milk  ♫

697
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,760
♫  Waiting for you to appear  ♫

698
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Fine, I promise.

699
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,670
♫  I’ve been missing you for 1,001 nights  ♫

700
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:06,100
♫  I just want to greet a sunrise in your embrace  ♫

701
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,300
♫  Over the same blue ocean  ♫

702
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,900
♫  You and I  ♫

703

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

705
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:38,485
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

706
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:46,735
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

707
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:52,972
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

708
00:41:52,972 --> 00:42:00,035
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

709
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:06,960
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

710
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,960
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

711
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,935
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

712
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:27,835
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

713
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:34,477
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

714
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:41,862
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

715
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:48,895
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

716
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:55,791
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

717
00:42:55,791 --> 00:43:02,680
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

718
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,335
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

719
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:16,510
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

720
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:26,010
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
