 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,020
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,300
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,660
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,380
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,890
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,150
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,580
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,240
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,010
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,400
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,550
   

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,950
   

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,940
Xiao Yu, I'm here to take over your shift.

27
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,540
All right!

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,860
We sold so much of this water today.

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,560
Yes, some cute guy bought a few bottles.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,640
Surprisingly, he's just like you.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,300
You both like this kind of strange water.

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,150
   

33
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,600
   
   

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,350
   

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,060
Today, we will focus

36
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,580
on these sneakers' exceptional features.

37
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,660
From material design to performance

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,120
and aesthetics,

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,220
every detail is meticulously crafted.

40
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,380
What's wrong? What are you looking for?

41
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,660
First, in terms of materials, this brand of sneakers use...

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,220
I left my flash drive at the convenience store.

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,220
Hey, come back.

44
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,140
- Where are you going? 
 - If I go to the store for it now,

45
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,080
would it be too late?

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,860
What should we do?

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,780
Let's do this. Find that convenience store's phone number.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,940
Ask if they can deliver it to us now.

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,740
Yes, right. I'll have them bring it over.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,520
The convenience store we just went to is on...

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,150
South Xueyuan Road.

52
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,550
   

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,060
Hello, this is Linke Convenience Store.

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,216
 Hi, I was just in there shopping, 

55
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,184
 and I left my key chain. 

56
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:19,485
 Could you check for me? 

57
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,460
Where did you leave it?

58
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,620
 In the chips aisle. 

59
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:28,668
Okay, please hold. I'll look for it.

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,740
Hello, I found it.

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,420
"Found it."

62
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,580
Important files are on that flash drive.

63
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,980
I need it urgently.

64
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,700
Could you deliver it to me now?

65
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,680
Sorry. We can't leave during work hours.

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,240
You'll have to come pick it up.

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,380
You won't do it for free.

68
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,260
I'll pay you for delivery.

69
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,140
- Hold on. 
 - All right.

70
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,980
 Xiao Yu, can you help make a delivery after your shift? 

71
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,460
 But I have a date later. 

72
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,480
 You go. I'll watch the store. 

73
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,140
Hello, please hold on.

74
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,480
I'll deliver it now.

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,220
 Please leave your phone number. 

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,220
All right, thanks.

77
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,480
Okay, thank you.

78
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,300
- I'm going then. 
 - Sure.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
She's on her way.

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,940
Sir, what's going on up ahead?

81
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,300
A traffic jam. We won't be there anytime soon.

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,580
How much longer will it take?

83
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,100
Maybe at least 20 minutes.

84
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,100
Hey, it'll take me another 20 minutes.

85
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,420
Will you still make it?

86
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,740
"Another 20 minutes"?

87
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,780
We are about to go onstage.

88
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,640
In 20 minutes, it'll be too late.

89
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,860
Even if the flash drive gets here, it won't help.

90
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,480
Traffic jams are out of my control.

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,640
If I don't make it in time,

92
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,320
you still owe me the delivery fee.

93
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,720
Hello.

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,060
Please get it here.

95
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,060
You'll surely get paid.

96
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,180
I'm Gan Yang, a Finance Dept. junior at Qingbei University.

97
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,980
 If I don't pay, tell the whole university that 

98
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm a liar who breaks my word.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,560
Gan Yang from the Finance Department.

100
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,760
Okay, I trust you.

101
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,320
Really appreciate it.

102
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,420
Sir, I'll get off here.

103
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,180
- All right. 
 - How much is it? Let me transfer the fare.

104
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,260
It's ¥58 in total.

105
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,160
Done. Thank you.

106
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,280
 The next contestants should prepare. 

107
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,760
 Now, let's welcome the last group of contestants, 

108
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,990
 Gan Yang's team. 

109
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,060
 ­  

110
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,900
Judges, Contestants, and Fellow Students, good afternoon.

111
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm Gan Yang, a Finance Dept. junior at Qingbei University.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,080
I present this pair of shoes today.

113
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,300
They ensure a snug, superior fit.

114
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,380
With a certain amount of elasticity,

115
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,740
they won't cause any discomfort while running. 
    

116
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,260
Lastly, the upper material ensures durability.

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,020
 Is it her? 

118
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,420
Over here.

119
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,420
Here you are.

120
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:15,200
The delivery fee.

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,320
For the upper design,

122
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,620
I'll have my partner,

123
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,080
Wang Yi, Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from Qingbei University, to explain.

124
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,020
We will pay you after the result. Thanks.

125
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,580
- Thank you. 
 - All right.

126
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,260
I'm Wang Yi, a Ph.D. in Materials Engineering at Qingbei University.

127
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,120
Gan Yang and I designed these shoes. 
    

128
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,820
We balanced aesthetics with performance.

129
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,940
Please look at the slides.

130
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,380
For these shoes' fabric, 
    

131
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,620
we used Gore-Tex,

132
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,980
which is not only waterproof, but highly breathable.

133
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,940
For a pair of shoes, roughly size 42,

134
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,860
we kept them at just 350 grams,

135
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,420
extremely lightweight.

136
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,640
And the rebound and slip resistance

137
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
weren't compromised at all.

138
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,820
The judges have voted. The Gold Award goes to...

139
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,900
   

140
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,500
Gan Yang's Team!

141
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,480
  ­ 

142
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,140
Thanks for your help today.

143
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,680
Without your timely flash drive delivery, we may not have won.

144
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,800
No worries.

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,060
Your presentation was brilliant.

146
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,020
Congrats on the win.

147
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,160
Thank you.

148
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,340
Dude, you're not helping at all.

149
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,780
Take this. It's so heavy.

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,660
Unbelievable.

151
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,100
Only you'd drink something this awful.

152
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,560
It's actually good.

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,440
I like it, too.

154
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,900
Seriously?

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,300
I'm just thirsty.

156
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,700
Thanks for the drink.

157
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,122
I'll be going now.

158
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:33,800
- Thanks for today. 
 - You're welcome.

159
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,640
That girl biked past us this morning.

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,960
Her?

161
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,180
What are the odds?

162
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,500
That girl zoomed past us so fast!

163
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,180
I didn't even see her face.

164
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,940
I didn't make a mistake.

165
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,660
I'll bet you, she's just like all the other girls before.

166
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,940
She's regretting it after walking away

167
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,320
and is wanting your contact info.

168
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,860
I don't think so.

169
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,300
How much will you bet?

170
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,740
- Excuse me. 
 - That confident, yes?

171
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,840
I forgot about the taxi fare.

172
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,880
It was ¥58 coming here.

173
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,320
Let's say it's ¥58 to return.

174
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,280
So ¥116 ($16) in total.

175
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
How about we make it ¥200.

176
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,940
If there's traffic, it might not be enough.

177
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,320
No. You already paid me ¥300 for delivery.

178
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,760
Let's stick with ¥116.

179
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,460
Eighty.

180
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,740
One...

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,600
one, two, three,

182
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,000
four.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,700
Thanks.

184
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,420
Five hundred yuan.

185
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,840
What five hundred?

186
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,180
Did I agree to bet with you?

187
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:59,020
How were you so sure she wasn't returning for your info?

188
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,720
I just knew.

189
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,380
Sorry. We're not selling this design for now.

190
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,000
Hello, CEO Liu.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,220
- Is it CEO Liu? 
 - I was just about to call you.

192
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,660
I guess you heard I won.

193
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,660
 Congratulations on the award. 

194
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,760
 Tell me what gift you want, and Mom will give it to you. 

195
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,740
Produce 100,000 pairs of these shoes and sell them all over China,

196
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,740
then all in the nation can wear your son's design.

197
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,380
 Be realistic. 

198
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,640
Name what I can actually do.

199
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,720
 Mom, if we don't create our own brand, 

200
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,060
we won't have a future if we keep doing OEM business.

201
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,760
I entered this design competition

202
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,980
because I want our family business to transition.

203
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,180
So we can work on R&amp;D and branding.

204
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,640
Well, after you graduate, come back.

205
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,160
I'll hand the factory to you.

206
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,400
Do whatever you want with it, okay?

207
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,840
Thanks, Mom.

208
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,520
Actually, Wang Yi and I...

209
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,160
What are you doing?

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,200
I know.

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,300
We still need R&amp;D funding.

212
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,760
 Yang, R&amp;D isn't that simple. 

213
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,980
 How about this? I'll transfer you ¥100,000 ($13,700). 

214
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
 Just have fun and eat what you want.  

215
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,940
 I want you to be happy. 

216
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,060
 Understand? 

217
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,720
Thank you, Dear CEO Liu.

218
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,600
Let's talk later. I must drive.

219
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,880
Bye bye.

220
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,140
Tong Tong!

221
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,680
- Feng Sheng, what's up? 
 - Have you had dinner yet?

222
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,800
Not yet. I'll just have instant noodles.

223
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
I knew you wouldn't eat properly.

224
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,440
Health is more important than making money.

225
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,680
You're so nice.

226
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,260
It's a lot of food.

227
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,360
How much is it? I'll pay you.

228
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
Five yuan.

229
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,320
Seriously? So cheap?

230
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,840
I sent you the money.

231
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,360
So how's your interview preparation for Hetai Securities?

232
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,720
The practice questions you sent me,

233
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,000
I read most of them already.

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,240
I think it'll be fine.

235
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll reread them later.

236
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Okay, get prepared.

237
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,140
Eat while it's warm.

238
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't worry. Thanks.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,460
I'm leaving.

240
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
Good luck with the interview.

241
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,960
Got it.

242
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,120
Feng Sheng.

243
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,020
Didn't you order a ¥30 takeout?

244
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,840
Why are you having instant noodles again?

245
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280
You must be mistaken.

246
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,560
I'll just eat instant noodles for dinner.

247
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,480
Didn't he order takeout already?

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm back.

249
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,320
So this takeout is for you?

250
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,840
I just saw Feng Sheng

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,180
waiting outside a while with the takeout.

252
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,400
He's so thoughtful.

253
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,980
When will you make him your boyfriend?

254
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,260
Let's not mention that.

255
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,540
I literally have no time for dating.

256
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,560
You're back.

257
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,800
- You're all here. 
 - Perfect.

258
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,160
I ask you, do you know... Gan Yang?

259
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,320
What?

260
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Miss, are you interested in him?

261
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,160
No!

262
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,840
I heard about it.

263
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
You and Gan Yang

264
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,880
are the only two in our entire university

265
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,600
who passed the written test for Hetai.

266
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,820
No.

267
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,540
Where did you get that idea?

268
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,460
This isn't about that.

269
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,740
My senior sister Song. You know her, right?

270
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,640
She wants to buy Gan Yang's running shoe design copyright.

271
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,800
 This is for you. 

272
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,820
 - For me? 
 - Yes. 

273
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,180
 I saw you at the competition today. You seem to know Gan Yang. 

274
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,200
 So help me to persuade him. 

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,660
 "Persuade him"? 

276
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,800
 My company wants to buy his shoe design. 

277
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,080
 I'll be honest with you. 

278
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,900
 We can offer up to ¥350,000 for the design rights. 

279
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,200
 Won't he even sell for ¥350,000 ($48,000)? 

280
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,960
 He wouldn't even speak with us. 

281
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,060
 That's why I'm asking you. 

282
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,480
How can I persuade him?

283
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,600
Do you have any info?

284
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,340
Gan Yang?

285
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,040
I don't really know him that well.

286
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,580
But they say he donated a building

287
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,260
to get into our university.

288
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,460
He's definitely a shoe industry heir.

289
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,860
He's quite strange.

290
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,040
They say he's rich,

291
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,660
but he drives an old car and lives off university.

292
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,140
I heard he even grows his own vegetables.

293
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,700
Right, I've heard that, too.

294
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,800
And every day, I see him consistently

295
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,060
jog through campus at the same time, in all weather.

296
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,220
All right, enough swooning.

297
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,440
Let me make an announcement.

298
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,140
You three, clear your schedules tomorrow afternoon.

299
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,920
Deng Bo Ting and I are throwing a celebration party

300
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,660
for reaching 10,000 Matching users!

301
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,420
- Applause. 
 -  Congratulations. 

302
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,740
- Especially you. 
 - Congratulations.

303
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,120
You must come. Your soulmate will be there tomorrow.

304
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,180
My interview is tomorrow afternoon. I truly can't come.

305
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,260
You haven't joined our group events in ages.

306
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,860
Come on, just two hours.

307
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,840
Fine. I'll go.

308
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,820
That's more like it!

309
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,600
All right. I'll go then.

310
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,860
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

311
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,680
   
   

312
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,560
   

313
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,700
Oh, Director Gan, this is so much.

314
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,660
Impressive, Director Gan.

315
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,740
- As long as you enjoy it. 
 - It smells good.

316
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,160
If you like it, I'll make it for you often.

317
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,560
Just tell me what you want.

318
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,972
- Thank you, Director Gan. 
 - Thank you, Director Gan.

319
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:39,080
Oh, right. Here are two new pairs of shoes from our factory.

320
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,060
Please help me test them for data.

321
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,580
No matter the shoes, we need to run anyway.

322
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,940
- Right? 
 - Exactly. Leave it to us, Director Gan.

323
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,020
Thank you. I'll leave the shoes here.

324
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,580
- All right. 
 - And the water too.

325
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,960
- Sounds good. 
 - We will go now.

326
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,720
- Bye, Director Gan. 
 - Send me your data after testing.

327
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,380
- No problem. 
 - All right.

328
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,780
- Bye. 
 - Bye bye.

329
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,280
Based on the last test's feedback,

330
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,360
some issues were in the rebound rate.

331
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
We need to adjust this time

332
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,340
and find the causes of these issues.

333
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,160
   

334
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,220
   

335
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,120
- What's up? 
 -  Do you have time to meet me now? 

336
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,100
The girl, who brought the flash drive yesterday,

337
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,220
is actually a student here.

338
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,720
She asked if I was free now

339
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,460
to meet her.

340
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,980
You sure have many admirers.

341
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,400
Why doesn't one of them fall for me?

342
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,980
   

343
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,140
You won't meet others, but you'll meet her?

344
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,400
Are you interested?

345
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,980
No. I'm just curious why she wants to meet.

346
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,020
If your soulmate on Matching asked to meet you,

347
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,740
would you go?

348
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,300
What if she is Ding Zhi Tong?

349
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,100
No way that it's so coincidental.

350
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,740
If it really is, I'll livestream eating my shoe.

351
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,360
You said it.

352
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,700
I did. A real man never reneges his word.

353
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,500
Ding Zhi Tong.

354
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,760
What a coincidence.

355
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,720
 Allow me to formally introduce myself. 

356
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,240
 I'm Ding Zhi Tong, a senior from your department. 

357
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,640
 I've heard of you. 

358
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,500
 You're quite famous in our class. 

359
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,940
You've won the First-class Scholarship for three consecutive years,

360
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,380
and even the National Scholarship.

361
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,800
Whenever our department chair mentions you,

362
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
he always praises you.

363
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,180
He also praised you,

364
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,600
that you have a great talent for finance

365
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,660
as well as shoe design.

366
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,900
And many brands are competing

367
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,520
to buy your design's copyright.

368
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,940
I wouldn't say it's talent.

369
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,680
Since young, I have been around my family making shoes.

370
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,580
I learned it naturally.

371
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,400
I don't know much about the industry.

372
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,600
Do Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) need design work?

373
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,840
Yes, sometimes.

374
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,940
Some clients provide specifications, and we design accordingly.

375
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,980
Other times, the clients have strict control,

376
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,220
and we handle only production.

377
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,180
But no matter which process, in the end,

378
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,160
the design copyright won't belong to us.

379
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,340
With this model, even if it went public someday,

380
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,100
it won't be sustainable.

381
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,360
Everyone wants to build a brand.

382
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,540
But it's not easy to do, right?

383
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,440
Did someone ask you

384
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,740
to persuade me to sell the design copyright?

385
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
How did you know?

386
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,480
They say I'm a shoe industry heir, right?

387
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,920
Some even claim my family donated a building for my admission.

388
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,580
So when I said your family does OEM work,

389
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,840
you realized I had investigated you?

390
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,200
You're quite sharp.

391
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,980
So are you.

392
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,120
How much is your commission to close this deal?

393
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,280
Do I seem very materialistic?

394
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,620
Not at all.

395
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,600
I just think you're good at money opportunities.

396
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,360
But this time, I will disappoint you.

397
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,920
I'm not selling the design copyright for these shoes.

398
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,140
I actually expected that.

399
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,420
After all, so many people want to buy it, but you won't sell.

400
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,680
I just wanted to try. I didn't expect much.

401
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,760
By the way, have you signed up for that popular app, Matching?

402
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,380
I have. My friend is promoting it.

403
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,880
I signed up to help her out.

404
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,120
What's your username?

405
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,360
But I uninstalled it after I signed up.

406
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,240
I would add you as a friend.

407
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,020
Can I add you on WeChat? It'll be easier to stay in touch.

408
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,880
Sure, I'll scan your code.

409
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,440
All right.

410
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,980
Done. 
    

411
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,280
But I'm usually busy and don't check my phone much.

412
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,680
Okay.

413
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,200
Request sent.

414
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,980
Added you.

415
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:32,870
   

416
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,540
Why does this silhouette look so familiar?

417
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,430
    
  ­ 

418
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,440
One seaweed, two fish balls.

419
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,280
- What are you doing here? 
 - Just passing by.

420
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,720
Thought I'd drop in and see you.

421
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,440
Remember, don't be late for the afternoon celebration.

422
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,620
I remember.

423
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,780
- Don't you have class this morning? 
 - Professor Qin's class?

424
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,420
I took it in my junior year.

425
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,540
Besides, so many people want to take his class.

426
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,320
I will just let someone else have my spot.

427
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,440
Be careful. If he finds out, you might not graduate.

428
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,200
Not a chance. That girl looks a lot like me.

429
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,520
Never been caught before.

430
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,300
Give me your phone.

431
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,700
Done.

432
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,460
   

433
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,760
Ding Zhi Tong, you jinx!

434
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,900
What happened?

435
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,420
 Isn't he just a substitute lecturer? 

436
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,300
 How come he knows the students so well? 

437
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,540
 I have no idea. 

438
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,960
 He entered and instantly said I wasn't Song Ming Mei. 

439
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,420
Has he seen you somewhere before?

440
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,620
 Forget it. Don't worry about it. 

441
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,140
 - I'll handle it myself. 
 - All right, I'm off then. 

442
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,232
 - I'll handle it. 
 - Bye bye. 

443
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:04,860
 Bye bye. 

444
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,860
Hi, Professor Qin.

445
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,540
You had someone take your place.

446
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,620
I should report this and have you disciplined.

447
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,500
But since you're a senior, I won't report it this time.

448
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,420
Thank you, Professor Qin.

449
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,820
Don't thank me yet.

450
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,240
I won't report you, but I'm deducting all your participation points.

451
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,720
Study hard from now on and score at least 95 on the exam.

452
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,440
Otherwise, you won't graduate.

453
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,680
No.

454
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,660
Professor Qin, I really had no choice.

455
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,260
The company I just joined made me work all night to finish a report.

456
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,160
Look. See my dark circles.

457
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,400
I've never had someone stand in for me in class before.

458
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
This is the first time.

459
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,160
Please. Just this once.

460
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,620
Show me the all-nighter report.

461
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,620
Seriously? It's confidential.

462
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,600
My roommate can vouch for me.

463
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,540
I can sign a non-disclosure agreement.

464
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,200
It's just for participation points.

465
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,280
Is that really necessary? Why bother signing a non-disclosure agreement?

466
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,720
I've had four lectures here, and I've never seen you.

467
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,940
Did you always pull all-nighters to write reports?

468
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,400
I...

469
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,800
But I've already gotten the job offer.

470
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,280
You wouldn't want to hurt the university's employment stats, right?

471
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,840
Please give me a break this time.

472
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,440
Please? I'm begging you.

473
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,420
This is your own problem. None of my concern.

474
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,540
You old dinosaur.

475
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,540
Check this out.

476
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,600
This afternoon's party celebrates Matching's 10,000 user count.

477
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
Let's go together?

478
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,480
Don't you want to go?

479
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,500
No.

480
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,200
Aren't you curious about your soulmate "Get Rich"?

481
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:01,850
   

482
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,025
   

483
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:08,350
♫  I wish that moment could last forever  ♫

484
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,120
♫  I don’t want to rush to the finish line with you  ♫

485
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,000
This is great. Compliment me.

486
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,720
Good job! Amazing!

487
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,760
You know, I didn't sleep for two days just to organize this celebration.

488
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Look how dressed up she is.

489
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,080
She finally put on makeup. 
    

490
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,660
My future girlfriend, here I come.

491
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,200
Really? He actually showed up.

492
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,560
Welcome. Welcome, both of you.

493
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,400
Marker pens are over there. Help yourselves.

494
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,100
All right.

495
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,960
We even need to sign in.

496
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,040
    
 ♫  I’ve kept everything in me  ♫

497
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,100
   

498
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,360
♫  Since the first time we met  ♫

499
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,920
So you're Forrest?

500
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,640
Yes.

501
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,700
Please come in, both of you.

502
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,420
Have a few drinks. I won't keep you company.

503
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,140
- Help yourselves. 
 - Thanks.

504
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,240
♫  Don’t miss out on your life again  ♫

505
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,420
Ming Mei.

506
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,220
You're finally here.

507
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,550
Are you done with everything?

508
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:06,180
♫  That moment you looked at me and said I love you  ♫

509
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,820
What a coincidence.

510
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,180
Are you really from our university?

511
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,320
Such a small world.

512
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,060
Here we meet again.

513
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,660
But shouldn't seniors be interviewing or interning?

514
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,300
Why are you still working at a convenience store?

515
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,340
Since when do you care where people work?

516
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,800
I'm just eager to earn money.

517
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,840
The convenience store pays hourly with flexible hours.

518
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,300
It's easier to attend interviews.

519
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,880
I see.

520
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,160
I'll go sign in.

521
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,720
All right.

522
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,420
You were mean to me, for beauty over friendship, right?

523
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,133
♫  Enjoy our journey  ♫

524
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,250
   

525
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,420
♫  Meeting you made me feel whole  ♫

526
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,700
Don't sign in yet. Let's see if you two really have chemistry.

527
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,280
Come here.

528
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,400
Stop staring. Let's go.

529
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,020
Whom do you think is "Get Rich"?

530
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,380
♫  My heart lost its balance  ♫

531
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,640
What's going on?

532
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,480
You two seem to click. Do you know Gan Yang?

533
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,840
I guess you could say that.

534
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,640
Impressive.

535
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,660
Listen, Forrest is here. Do you want to know who he is?

536
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,360
♫  That moment you looked at me and said I love you  ♫

537
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,440
It doesn't matter who. It's not important.

538
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,180
That's not how you truly feel.

539
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,320
♫  Let’s freeze this moment  ♫

540
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,180
Come on, everyone, gather around.

541
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,580
Gather around, please. Quiet down.

542
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,000
Eyes over here.

543
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,480
To celebrate Matching reaching 10,000 users,

544
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,660
we're thrilled to have you all here at this party today.

545
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,080
Our app is called Matching so we've prepared

546
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,320
some special compatibility challenges

547
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,000
to test your chemistry.

548
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,920
All right.

549
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,480
I'll start to put you into groups.

550
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,640
I've got cards here.

551
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,840
People drawing the same number will be a team.

552
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,000
Ding Zhi Tong, you go first.

553
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,900
Who's next?

554
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,550
I'll go.

555
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,840
What did you get? Let me see.

556
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,535
Eight.

557
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:38,740
- Is it eight? 
 - It's her.

558
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,100
Eight.

559
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,660
What a coincidence.

560
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,480
Now that's what I call chemistry.

561
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,580
- Crazy coincidence. 
 - What are the odds?

562
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,620
This is...

563
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,020
- Three words. 
 - Sow a sun?

564
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,100
“Sister flowers”? (pretty biological sisters)

565
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,300
"Sister flowers."

566
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,540
- That's right. 
 - No way.

567
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,700
Your favorite fruit.

568
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,800
   

569
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,780
Color.

570
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,440
   

571
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,040
A song.

572
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,480
   

573
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,820
- Same again. 
 - That's incredible.

574
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,260
- That is crazy chemistry. 
 - I know.

575
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,660
The second game, blindfolded heart drawing.

576
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,800
You two really have great chemistry, really.

577
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,580
I didn't expect that.

578
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,160
- Come on, let's go. 
 - Ding Zhi Tong.

579
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,000
Thank you.

580
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,960
Do you like that song, too?

581
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,080
Indeed, I always listen to it when I run.

582
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,960
Do you run every day?

583
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,620
Every single day.

584
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,880
All right.

585
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,540
Since you two have such great chemistry,

586
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,040
Ding Zhi Tong, guess what Gan Yang's username is on Matching.

587
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,960
Forrest?

588
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,360
It's me.

589
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,320
Gan Yang's soulmate, "Get Rich,"

590
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,140
isn't you, is it?

591
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,640
It's not me.

592
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,340
My username is "Innocent Talk."

593
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,640
I knew it couldn't be that coincidental.

594
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,120
I almost had to livestream eating my shoe.

595
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,000
Then who is "Get Rich"?

596
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
- Get Rich! 
 - Song Ming Mei.

597
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,840
Come over here and see this.

598
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,500
It doesn't matter who "Get Rich" is.

599
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,360
What's important is... that chemistry test we just did.

600
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,325
♫  A different kind of air  ♫

601
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:40,240
♫  Hovers between us  ♫

602
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,650
♫  Lemony freshness after the rain  ♫

603
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,050
♫  Your breathing  ♫

604
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:52,275
♫  Has the same rhythm as me  ♫

605
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:56,748
♫  A different feeling  ♫

606
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,492
♫  Your eyes  ♫

607
00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:03,752
♫  Hold the stars that fell into dreams  ♫

608
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:06,312
♫  Running against the wind  ♫

609
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:11,844
♫  At the rhythm of the heartbeat  ♫

610
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:14,496
♫  Every shining, shining day  ♫

611
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:16,680
♫  Is a loving, loving day  ♫

612
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,416
♫  Moon and stars share the same rhythm as you  ♫

613
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:24,140
♫  Every shining, shining day  ♫

614
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,980
♫  I will go and open my heart  ♫

615
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,200
Actually, after our chat about shoes this morning,

616
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,660
I wanted to keep chatting.

617
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,660
You still want me to sell that shoe design, right?

618
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,120
Didn't you say I'm good at seizing every chance to make money？

619
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,160
So I thought I'd try.

620
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,740
But I have plans for that pair of shoes.

621
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
I don't want to sell it.

622
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,640
I know. You want to keep them

623
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,620
to upgrade your family's business.

624
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,160
But I'm guessing your parents didn't agree.

625
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,280
How did you guess?

626
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,960
I...

627
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,560
Just a hunch.

628
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,760
"A hunch"?

629
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,120
Actually, OEM and branding

630
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,800
are totally different paths.

631
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
So it's normal for your parents to have concerns.

632
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
After all, plenty of companies

633
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,200
spend hundreds of millions without success.

634
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,280
My senior, Song Wei Wei, her company is an established domestic brand

635
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,200
with rich experience in brand management.

636
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,920
I think you can at least talk with them.

637
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,320
It doesn't have to be selling the copyright.

638
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,880
You could explore collaboration

639
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,360
and learn brand philosophy.

640
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,640
It's just a suggestion.

641
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,020
You decide for yourself.

642
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,380
Hey, slow down! I'm talking to you.

643
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,880
How did your date with your soulmate go?

644
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,200
I just checked.

645
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Gan Yang's birthday is tomorrow.

646
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,360
Did he invite you?

647
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,440
Please.

648
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,760
That wasn't a date.

649
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,800
I asked him to walk with me

650
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,320
to discuss his shoe design copyright.

651
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,520
This is about making money. I don't have time for romance.

652
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,420
So you don't plan to tell him you're "Get Rich," right?

653
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Hey, I have my convenience store shift soon.

654
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,560
Let me have a moment.

655
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,360
Just go to do your work.

656
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,720
I'm just curious. What's the big deal?

657
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,820
Fine, whatever.

658
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,580
   

659
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,840
Tong Tong, just take it.

660
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,360
You really helped me out this time, Tong Tong.

661
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,320
Just accept it.

662
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,200
Hey, you've helped me a lot before, too.

663
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,680
And honestly, I didn't do much.

664
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,920
I just talked to him.

665
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,000
I really can't take this bonus.

666
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,280
Gan Yang agreed to sell the design copyright to us.

667
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,280
This is what I promised you. Take it.

668
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,080
Senior Sister, I said I wouldn't take it.

669
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,280
How about this?

670
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,240
You could treat me at the cafeteria later.

671
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,200
Thank you.

672
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,525
   
   

673
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,660
I'm still curious.

674
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,660
Who convinced you to change your mind so suddenly?

675
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,280
Are you talking to me?

676
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,760
Well, whom else would I talk to?

677
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,040
- Where are you going so late? 
 - For a run.

678
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,480
But it's almost your birthday.

679
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Exactly. So I'm celebrating it with a run.

680
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,120
I'm leaving.

681
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:49,775
   

682
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,970
   

683
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,010
 ­  

684
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,680
I can repay Uncle ¥2000 this month. 
    

685
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,520
Once I start working full-time, 
    

686
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,480
 I can quickly repay my debt to Uncle. 

687
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,525
   
   

688
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,550
   

689
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:12,275
   

690
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,440
It's midnight on the dot.

691
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,560
The cake is half-price.

692
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Happy birthday to you.

693
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,380
Thank you.

694
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,920
How did you know it was my birthday?

695
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,520
Oh, right.

696
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,860
It's on my Matching profile.

697
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,680
I... I didn't mean to run over here.

698
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,720
I didn't know you had a night shift today.

699
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,120
I was out for a run, when it suddenly started raining

700
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,520
so I came in for shelter.

701
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,780
We're out of birthday candles.

702
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,060
Let's use a lighter instead.

703
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,000
Happy birthday.

704
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,020
Make a wish.

705
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,960
I've always wondered why you wear only one earbud.

706
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,040
And I've never known what you're listening to.

707
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,920
Is that your birthday wish?

708
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,740
Will it come true?

709
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,100
Blow out the candle.

710
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,040
Sit. I'll tell you.

711
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,620
All right.

712
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,580
Delicious.

713
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,600
There's no sound.

714
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,920
This one is broken.

715
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,020
That's why it's tied up.

716
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,720
So you wear only one earbud

717
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,760
because the other is broken?

718
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,360
Yes.

719
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,080
But I still have one that works.

720
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,820
Saves money.

721
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,420
What are you listening to?

722
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:45,025
   

723
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,660
Ding Zhi Tong.

724
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,320
Your username isn't "Innocent Talk" on Matching.

725
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,100
♫  I'm free as the wind  ♫

726
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,600
♫  Just like your gentleness I could not hold on to  ♫

727
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,525
You are her.

728
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:17,950
♫  You push away when I reach out my hands  ♫

729
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:23,000
♫  Just leave. Don't look back  ♫

730
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,760
♫  Endless drifting, thirst for freedom  ♫

731

Ding Zhi Tong.

732
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,840
♫  Every storm of life I'll face alone  ♫

733
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,260
Will you join me in running?

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

736
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,085
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

737
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:07,735
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

738
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:13,972
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

739
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:21,135
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

740
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:27,860
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

741
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:34,860
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

742
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:41,935
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

743
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:48,935
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

744
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:55,677
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

745
00:41:55,677 --> 00:42:02,862
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

746
00:42:02,862 --> 00:42:09,895
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

747
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:16,791
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

748
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:23,680
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

749
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,335
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

750
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:37,410
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

751
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:50,010
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
