 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,840
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,270
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,300
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,200
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,570
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:49,730
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,280
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,890
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,240
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,150
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,850
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,680
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,240
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,110
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,260
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,360
   
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,540
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,469
   

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,460
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,100
 Morning. 

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,680
 Morning. 

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,752
Morning, Sister Qin Yu.

29
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:50,460
Morning.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
I've got some good news. Do you want to hear it?

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,960
What good news?

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,480
I heard we're getting a bonus this year.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,300
Isn't that the case for every company?

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,040
This time, it's different.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,511
I heard our team's bonus is going to be big this year.

36
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,840
Really? How much?

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,320
Come here.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,060
I don't know.

39
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,520
I really don't know the exact number.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,960
But it's definitely a lot more than last year.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,840
Just wait and see!

42
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,480
   

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,840
   

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,900
   

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
Sister Mei,

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,620
why is this?

47
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,040
- See this. 
 - I'll check it out.

48
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,450
   

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,550
   

50
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,050

Ding Zhi Tong.

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
Hello. 
    

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,660
Is Manager Fang here?

55
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,580
What's wrong? Why aren't you eating?

56
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,020
Nothing.

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,850
   

58
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:19,380
   

59
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,820
 Cheers. 

60
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,480
Thank you.

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,780
 Sorry, the number you have dialed is not available. 

62
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,100
- Director Zhang, it's nice to meet you. 
 - This is Director Gan.

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
- A toast to you. 
 - Glad to meet you.

64
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
   

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,700
   

66
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,300
   

67
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,860
 Gan Yang. 

68
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:37,467
Hey, Tong Tong.

69
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,560
 Are you busy today? 

70
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,640
Tong Tong.

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,820
I miss you so much.

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,760
Me, too.

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,640
Were you drinking?

74
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,700
Just a little.

75
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,280
A business dinner again?

76
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,604
Did you see the message I sent earlier?

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,840
I just saw it.

78
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,140
What good news?

79
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,220
I'm getting a bonus!

80
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,540
And I heard it will be a lot.

81
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,360
Once I get the money, I could pay off my debts.

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,260
That's good.

83
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,580
Good for you.

84
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,660
What's your plan once your debts are paid?

85
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,060
Before, I always just thought,

86
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,860
"Make money; repay the debts."

87
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,820
I've never thought beyond that.

88
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,940
But now?

89
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,660
After paying off the debts, I want to eat with you,

90
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,120
run with you, watch movies with you,

91
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,800
and enjoy life with you.

92
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,120
I can already feel happiness in the air.

93
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,292
Not "I"...

94
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,284
 It's "we." 

95
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,084
 Do you see that? 

96
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,560
I do.

97
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,860
Oh, by the way.

98
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,300
Do you remember when you bought me some flowers?

99
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,200
I said you were wasting money.

100
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,458
 Are they pretty? 

101
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,800
â™«  I miss you  â™«

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,660
Yes.

103
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,500
So pretty.

104
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,540
Gan Yang,

105
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,860
we will always be together, right?

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,280
â™«  I want you  â™«

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,000
Tong Tong.

108
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,001
 Stay well. 

109
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:08,500
â™«  I miss you  â™«

110
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,950
 I love you so much. 

111
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,400
â™«  I love you  â™«

112
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,460
Fine.

113
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,360
I love you, too.

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,375
Hang up.

115
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,520
â™«  I'm waiting for you  â™«

116
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
Bye bye.

117
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:39,675
â™«  For you  â™«

118
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:45,325
â™«  For you  â™«

119
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,540
Why did you come here so early?

120
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,940
I was thinking I would order the food first.

121
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,800
This is the first time you've asked me out since I came to Shanghai.

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,700
- Of course, I had to be early. 
 - Oh, please.

123
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,780
I invited you out once, remember?

124
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,420
That time just didn't work out.

125
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,660
Okay, fine.

126
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,180
Then let's just say, we finally made it.

127
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,400
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

128
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,180
Professor Qin, I have something to say to you.

129
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,860
Okay.

130
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,180
I have something to tell you, too.

131
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,040
You go first.

132
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,380
Actually, since I was little, I set my goal

133
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,840
to become a strong woman before 35.

134
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,880
So all I've done is move toward that goal,

135
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,460
whether finance studies or the job in Shanghai.

136
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,500
For your age, you've already done very well.

137
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,300
But it's still far from enough.

138
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,740
I want to work harder.

139
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,840
I want to aim higher.

140
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,680
I want to do anything I can do.

141
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,740
Congratulate me, Professor Qin.

142
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm going to New York.

143
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Congratulations.

144
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,700
 I just knew he wouldn't ask me to stay. 

145
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,180
 Ask him to wait for you. 

146
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,980
If you do, he will surely wait.

147
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,180
But he clearly didn't ask me to stay.

148
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,500
Why should I ask him to wait for me?

149
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,880
Look.

150
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,720
If you don't care, why are you so sad?

151
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm not sad.

152
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,300
Okay, I am sad!

153
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,420
I...

154
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,420
I really do like him a lot.

155
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,380
I know he's the first guy you've liked.

156
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,700
When are you planning to leave?

157
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,760
Tomorrow.

158
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,740
Are you in such a hurry?

159
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,620
A sharp pain is easier than dragging it out.

160
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,620
It's better to leave early.

161
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,200
I have a business trip tomorrow; I can't see you off.

162
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,700
You don't have to see me off.

163
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,220
I hate tearful goodbyes.

164
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,560
I will go without worries and be joyful.

165
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,780
Okay.

166
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,540
No concerns.

167
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,980
And you...

168
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,520
You and Gan Yang have to be happy.

169
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,335
- Okay. 
 - And you must visit me often.

170
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,895
I will.

171
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm all set.

172
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,280
Well,

173
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,300
I hope you attain all your wishes.

174
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:36,795
â™«  The time and time  â™«

175
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,380
 Professor Qin. 

176
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,800
 When I see him, I get annoyed. 

177
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,540
 I really don't want to attend his class anymore. 

178
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,480
 I hate him. 

179
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,220
 I want more cauliflower, please, Auntie. 

180
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,820
 - Hello, Professor Qin. 
 - Hello. 

181
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,820
â™«  I lost it though...  â™«

182
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,840
 Professor Qin, what a coincidence. 

183
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:01,500
â™«  Love in love  â™«

184
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,660
 Professor Qin? 

185
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,540
 Do you mind giving me a ride? Thanks. 

186
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,125
â™«  I see you  â™«

187
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:16,945
â™«  The moment  â™«

188
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,995
 Ming Mei. 

189
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:22,260
â™«  I live through your love  â™«

190
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,360
 I hope you will become who you want to be. 

191
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,495
â™«  The time and time  â™«

192
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,195
â™«  For life and life  â™«

193
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:39,975
â™«  I had it once. I lost it though  â™«

194
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,040
Good luck.

195
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,725
â™«  Love in love  â™«

196
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,175
â™«  So tell me you love me  â™«

197
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:57,025
â™«  I see you  â™«

198
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,895
Have a safe trip.

199
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:03,745
â™«  The moment  â™«

200
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:11,200
â™«  I live through your love  â™«

201
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,300
   

202
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,600
Chen Xi, what brings you here?

203
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,760
I heard your CEO's assistant resigned

204
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,920
so I'm here to apply for the job.

205
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,360
Seriously?

206
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,820
I might surprise you.

207
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,360
I studied finance, and I interned at Hetai Securities for a while.

208
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,620
Being a CEO's assistant is no problem for me.

209
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,460
If there's anything I can do,

210
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,840
just let me know, Director Gan.

211
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,920
Well, since you've offered,

212
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,240
we've just received some documents from the factories.

213
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,860
Please check the information.

214
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,120
See if there's any issue with their reported funding gaps.

215
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,680
No problem. Leave it with me.

216
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,140
Thank you.

217
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,920
Sister Mei.

218
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,560
Xi Xi?

219
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,540
Manager Long.

220
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,880
What are you doing here?

221
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,400
Sister Mei, let me introduce her.

222
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,400
This is our new CEO's assistant, Xu Chen Xi.

223
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,960
Manager Long, we will be colleagues from now on.

224
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,220
Take good care of me.

225
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,280
Good.

226
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,260
Welcome to our company.

227
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,339
You guys go ahead. I'll go get busy.

228
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:38,240
Oh, by the way, your office is on the left by the front desk.

229
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,820
Understood.

230
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,840
What do you need, Sister Mei?

231
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,220
The payday is near,

232
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,160
but we have little money in the account.

233
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,000
- Should we delay it a few days? 
 - No, we can't.

234
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,240
Recently, it's been unstable in the company.

235
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,900
If we delay our pay date, many people might quit.

236
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,460
I remember the company has several payments yet to be received, right?

237
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,540
Have we received them?

238
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,600
Only the one from Suzhou hasn't come.

239
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,700
I've asked many times but have received no response yet.

240
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,360
How about this?

241
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,400
Tomorrow, I'll go see what's happened.

242
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,040
It's better if I go.

243
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,500
Okay.

244
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
It's 10697...

245
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,800
48 plus 15 plus...

246
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,740
Why is it wrong again?

247
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,320
What the heck?

248
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,340
Ding Zhi Tong. She is so capable.

249
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,700
She can definitely help Gan Yang.

250
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
I forgot to tell you.

251
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,196
Don't tell Ding Zhi tong about my family problem.

252
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't want her to know.

253
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,680
But why?

254
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,740
Although I don't want to admit it, Ding Zhi Tong is a nice person.

255
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,980
She's so capable and hardworking.

256
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,600
If she knew, at least she could help.

257
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
I thought you've always disliked her.

258
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,960
Why are you defending her now?

259
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,280
I used to think she wanted something from you.

260
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,400
But last time when I saw her being hounded by creditors,

261
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,860
I was going to tell you,

262
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,640
but she seemed unafraid.

263
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,040
She even acted like she couldn't wait to let me tell me.

264
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,600
One day, I realized,

265
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,840
if she really wanted you to pay her debts, she would have told you long ago.

266
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
There's no way she'd wait until the creditors came for her.

267
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,120
Obviously, she was trying to provoke me.

268
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,380
If she knew you speak well of her,

269
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,680
I really wonder how she'd react.

270
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,720
So do you want to tell her your family issues?

271
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,200
She would certainly help if she knew.

272
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,180
Unlike me, I can't do anything for you.

273
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,800
Who told you that?

274
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,680
Right now, I have something important for you,

275
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,900
and only you can do it.

276
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,720
What is it?

277
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,640
This box contains all our company seals.

278
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,520
I'm going to Suzhou tomorrow.

279
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,920
Sister Mei is busy here at the company.

280
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,120
She can't carry those seals with her.

281
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,500
In this company, other than her,

282
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
you're the only person I trust.

283
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,460
So I'm giving this to you now.

284
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,520
Please, keep them safe.

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,480
Chen Xi, please remember,

286
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,160
from now on, except Sister Mei and I,

287
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,400
you can't trust anyone,

288
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,360
especially Gan Kun Liang.

289
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,480
Okay. Don't worry.

290
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,280
I'll do my best to protect these seals.

291
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,820
Thank you.

292
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,820
   

293
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,980
   

294
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,480
   

295
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,120
 What are you doing? 

296
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,080
- I'm here to meet Director Cai. 
 - Sorry, Director Cai isn't in now.

297
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,880
No appointment, no entry.

298
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,780
Sorry, Sir, please cooperate with us.

299
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,040
- Director Qin, we'll see ourselves out. 
 - Fine.

300
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,840
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

301
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,040
- Goodbye, Director Qin. 
 - Goodbye.

302
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,760
   

303
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,100
   

304
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,480
Texting your boyfriend again?

305
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm so jealous of you.

306
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,980
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

307
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,580
 Can we pull this off, Director Liu? 

308
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,700
 Of course, Director Zhao. 

309
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,840
 - Trust me. 
 - Okay. 

310
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,440
Director Cai.

311
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,180
Director Gan, wh-why are you here?

312
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,800
Director Cai, you might have forgotten something you promised.

313
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,640
How could I forget?

314
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,100
An old friend. Director Zhao, go on without me.

315
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,500
I'll have a talk with Director Gan.

316
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,220
He's an old friend.

317
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,320
Director Gan, let's step out to talk.

318
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,560
Director Gan, you came here yourself. Why didn't you tell me?

319
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,060
I could have someone pick you up.

320
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,240
I don't need picking up.

321
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,480
Director Cai, when can you pay our company's bill?

322
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,020
- Hasn't it been paid yet? 
 - No.

323
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,180
This is absurd.

324
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,460
Those people in charge just can't get things right.

325
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,420
But you see, I'm too busy right now.

326
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
How about this? Once I finish up today,

327
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,980
I'll send someone to pick you up.

328
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,380
Then we can talk about the payment.

329
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,660
Recently, I secured a big order for you.

330
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,780
Okay.

331
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,320
Let's talk once your work is done.

332
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,460
Okay.

333
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,120
Anyway, this time, I've just come to Suzhou for this payment.

334
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,380
I'm not leaving until we settle this.

335
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,540
No problem.

336
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,660
Let's do this.

337
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,020
I'll have my assistant take you to accounts to settle this.

338
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,280
I can't get away right now.

339
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,480
- Fine. 
 - Okay.

340
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,760
Just wait for me.

341
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,080
So I won't see you off.

342
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,920
Hello. You're Director Gan, right?

343
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,260
Director Cai asked me to take you to get your money.

344
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,480
Please.

345
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,960
Please send my regards to Director Dai.

346
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,520
Okay.

347
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,780
It's raining now?

348
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,140
It's okay. I'll call a driver to the underground parking.

349
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,840
- Please wait a moment. 
 - Thank you.

350
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,380
I thought we were going to accounts.

351
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,800
Why are we in the parking lot?

352
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,220
It's in another office.

353
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,340
I'll drive you there.

354
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,060
Just wait a minute.

355
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,160
Get up.

356
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,180
You've got guts, don't you?

357
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,700
Threatening Director Cai?

358
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,000
You must have a death wish.

359
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,380
Where is the car she called?

360
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,420
Let me check the plate number.

361
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,000
Sister Qin Yu, should we call the police?

362
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,980
Of course.

363
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,620
Hello, is this the police?

364
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,820
There's a fight here.

365
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,020
In the underground parking of Baoyan Building.

366
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,520
Please hurry up.

367
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,580
Okay, let's go. It's too dangerous here.

368
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,660
What if someone gets killed?

369
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,960
What should we do?

370
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
The police are coming! The police are coming!

371
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,140
Don't go over there.

372
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,100
You've called the police. Let them handle it.

373
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,240
It's none of our business. Let's go.

374
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,400
Mom, I'm in Shanghai now.

375
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,620
The debts have been paid off.

376
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,360
 What? 

377
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,420
 What do you mean? 

378
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,940
I got a bonus from my company.

379
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,020
I repaid all the money I owed my aunt.

380
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,260
And I still have some left.

381
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,180
A-Are you serious?

382
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,440
I'm serious. Why would I lie?

383
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,580
Good.

384
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,120
That's great!

385
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,180
Mom, soon I'll bring you to Shanghai.

386
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:52,540
When you're here, I have someone to introduce to you.

387
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,560
- Who? 
 - My boyfriend.

388
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,580
"Boyfriend"?

389
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,560
You've got a boyfriend?

390
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,600
 Who is he? What's his name? 

391
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,180
How old is he? What does he do?

392
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,920
How did you two meet?

393
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,100
His name is Gan Yang.

394
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,620
He's a year younger than me.

395
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,860
You'll get to know him when we meet.

396
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,940
 He went to his hometown now. 

397
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,293
 I'll bring you over once he gets back. 

398
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,620
Good, good. That's good.

399
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,160
 Bye bye. 

400
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,200
 Gan Yang, how I wish you were here with me now. 

401
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,770
â™«  I wish I could spend every  â™«

402
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:49,480
â™«  Dusk and dawn with you  â™«

403
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,520
â™«  Like a world with just us  â™«

404
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,340
â™«  And a clock without hands  â™«

405
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,260
Gan Yang, I need to tell you something.

406
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,540
I got my bonus.

407
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,520
I paid off all the money I owed,

408
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,800
and I even have some savings.

409
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,180
 Congratulations, my rich lady. 

410
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,780
I finally know how it feels to be debt-free.

411
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,460
All I could think of was paying debts.

412
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,660
Now without that pressure, it feels amazing.

413
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,220
Excuse me, can I have a pancake?

414
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,860
- With eggs? 
 - Yes, two.

415
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,440
Okay.

416
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,220
I'll pay with my phone.

417
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,900
I've paid.

418
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,780
Thank you.

419
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,280
Watch out!

420
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,820
â™«  Please  â™«

421
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,120
How did you know I almost got hit?

422
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,720
â™«  Donâ€™t wake me  â™«

423
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,483
I...

424
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,200
A child next to me almost fell.

425
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,360
â™«  Even for just one more second  â™«

426
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,170
Okay.

427
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:56,200
â™«  Please let me chase the lonely star  â™«

428
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,350
â™«  Through this unaligned universe  â™«

429
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,360
Gan Yang,

430
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,294
I'm home.

431
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:08,080
How's your mom's health been lately?

432
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,919
Tong Tong.

433
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,120
I might...

434
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,740
- Might not... 
 -  It's okay. 

435
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,640
She will recover.

436
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,340
Don't worry.

437
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,740
I believe we will be together soon.

438
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,020
 I'll talk to you later. 

439
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,540
I'm hanging up now. Bye bye.

440
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,280
 Fangshi Capital just sent us a repurchase notice. 

441
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,240
 They're demanding full repayment in one lump sum. 

442
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,440
 A total... 

443
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,220
 of Â¥150 million. 

444
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,080
 Doctor, how's my mom? 

445
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,440
 It's hard to say. 

446
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,040
 She could wake soon. 

447
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,300
 Could be... never. 

448
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,740
 So... prepare yourselves. 

449
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,860
 Don't you have a girlfriend working at some securities firm? 

450
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,760
 - Don't you dare involve her! 
 - Yang Yang. 

451
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,040
 Gan Yang, after paying off the debts, I want to eat with you, 
 - Boy. 

452
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,600
 run with you, watch movies with you, 

453
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,260
 and enjoy life with you. 

454
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,120
 I can already feel happiness in the air. 

455
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,920
 Tong Tong. 

456
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,240
 I'm afraid I can't give you 

457
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,260
 the happiness you want, not anymore. 

458
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,120
 What? Are you going to Gan Yang's hometown? 

459
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,660
 Are you serious? 

460
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,640
Yes.

461
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,400
Last time I didn't show up when I was supposed to meet his mom.

462
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,220
I heard she's sick now.

463
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,800
Since it's the weekend, I thought I'd go see her

464
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,460
and apologize to her in person.

465
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,300
But do you know where he lives?

466
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,200
Yes. He told me.

467
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,860
I didn't expect this.

468
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,160
The Ding Zhi Tong who was all about money

469
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,140
is now chasing love.

470
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,660
When Gan Yang knows, he will be so moved and cry.

471
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay, I've got to go. I'm hanging up.

472
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,300
Hello?

473
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,020
 Is this Gan Yang? 

474
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,440
 This is Guangming Police Station. 

475
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,580
 We received a complaint. 

476
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,480
 You are suspected of intentional injury. 

477
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,820
 Please come at once for the investigation. 

478
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,852
Could you tell me who is the victim?

479
00:31:57,852 --> 00:32:01,052
 Gan Kun Liang. Do you know him? 

480
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,380
I do.

481
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,940
But I'm out of town right now.

482
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,160
 That's fine. 

483
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,000
 Please come as soon as possible. 

484
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,500
Okay.

485
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:40,640
   

486
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,300
Gan Yang, what's up?

487
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,080
What's happened?

488
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,540
 Gan Yang, why aren't you saying anything? 

489
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,580
Let's break up.

490
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,350
   

491
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,620
Gan Yang!

492
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,820
Gan Yang, I just went to the police station to find you!

493
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,180
I can't believe you're already back.

494
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,780
Why have you been drinking so much?

495
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,720
What are you here for?

496
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,340
Exactly what's going on?

497
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,760
Nothing.

498
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,280
I just owe over Â¥200 million, and I broke up with my girlfriend.

499
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,520
You broke up?

500
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,180
If you tell her about your family troubles,

501
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,660
I don't believe she would leave you.

502
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
She will stay and help you.

503
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,840
That's why I can't tell her the truth.

504
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,460
I've seen her...

505
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,560
work so hard to pay off her debts.

506
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,040
I can't let her suffer this again.

507
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,300
And Gan Kun Liang

508
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,740
knows she works at a securities firm.

509
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,100
He said he will look for her.

510
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,340
I fear he would hurt her.

511
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,280
It wasn't easy for her to finally have peace.

512
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,820
I don't want to bring any trouble to her.

513
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,740
- No, you... 
 - Gan Yang, stop drinking! Stop!

514
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,220
- Give it to me! 
 - Give it back!

515
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,560
Give it to me!

516
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,080
I have to go to the restroom.

517
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,440
Tong Tong.

518
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,420
Gan Yang.

519
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,100
What has happened?

520
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,500
Why haven't you gone back to Shanghai?

521
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,340
Does your family oppose us?

522
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,160
Or did you run into some trouble?

523
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,040
Please tell me, okay?

524
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,720
We can face this together.

525
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,420
Exactly what's going on?

526
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,380
We've been through so much together.

527
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,020
I don't want to break up with you.

528
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,140
Who's here at this late hour?

529
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,600
If you tell me yourself

530
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,980
there's nothing between you two,

531
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,620
just tell me and I'll believe you.

532
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,080
Say it!

533
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,540
Tong Tong, I...

534
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,420
 No, I can't. 

535
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,880
 She deserves her own life. 

536
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,960
 I cannot drag her down. 

537
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,640
We've already broken up.

538
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,760
This has nothing to do with you.

539
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,640
So she's the real reason you broke up with me.

540
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,000
Am I right, Gan Yang?

541
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,640
Ding Zhi Tong, listen, I can explain.

542
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,260
I shouldn't have trusted you.

543
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,620
"Explain"?

544
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,060
I'm repaying the rent to you.

545
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,425
   

546
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,140
Give me the IOU!

547
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,920
Give it back!

548
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:47,125
â™«  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  â™«

549
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:53,450
â™«  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  â™«

550
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,095
   

551
00:39:55,095 --> 00:40:01,315
â™«  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  â™«

552
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:06,320
â™«  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  â™«

553
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,445
We're even now.

554
00:40:08,445 --> 00:40:15,195
â™«  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  â™«

555
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:22,325
â™«  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  â™«

556
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:29,100
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

557
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,100
Gan Yang, hurry and go explain to her! She surely misunderstood!  Hurry, go!

558
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,225
Why are you standing here?

559
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:42,460
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

560
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,761
This is for her best.

561
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,620
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

562
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,080
Let her give up.

563
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:55,375
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™«

564
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:57,040
You go home.

565
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,425
â™«  There is always the someone I never once forgot  â™«

566
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:00,665
I want to be alone.

567
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:05,240
Okay.

568
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,785
â™«  I wish time would rush toward its end  â™«

569
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:18,725
â™«  The one who said goodbye stayed behind  â™«

570
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:25,075
â™«  Whatever you chase, I wish you luck  â™«

571
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:31,850
â™«  I want you to be happy; don't look back  â™«

572
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:38,600
â™«  No matter how cruel I am, just move ahead  â™«

573
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,880
 I'll charge half the rent 

574
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,100
 because I'll be living there, too. 

575
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,740
 And I'm adding a clause. 

576
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:48,600
 What clause? 

577
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,925
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

578
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:54,100
   

579
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,200
 I want to marry you. 

580
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,060
 I'm afraid you'll suffer... 

581
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,760
 get hurt... or leave me. 

582
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,250
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

583
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:13,475
â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

584
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:17,500
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™«

585
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,471
 I miss you so much. 

586
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,380
 I miss you as well. 

587
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,400
 I want to hug you now. 

588
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,525
 I want to hug you, too. 

589
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:31,760
â™«  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  â™«

590
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,620
 Gan Yang! 

591
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:41,425
â™«  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  â™«

592
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:47,975
â™«  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  â™«

593

â™«  So I could fulfill all your future  â™«

594
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,000
 I think this wall can be painted green. 

595
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,240
 Itâ€™ll be easy on the eyes. 

596
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,625
â™«  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  â™«

597

598
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:06,960
â™«  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  â™«

599
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,400
 I just don't want you to come to Shanghai 

600
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,580
 with only memories of our arguing. 

601

â™«  Someone held my hand against all odds  â™«

602
