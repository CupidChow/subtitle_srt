 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,330
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,740
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,300
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,790
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,240
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,150
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,480
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,340
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,600
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,450
   

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:49,950


26
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,320
We're here.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,380
Be careful.

28
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,040
Okay.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,300
Bye bye.

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,520
Hurry inside.

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,180
Don't forget your promise for tomorrow.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Let's wait and see if you still remember it tomorrow.

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,820
Okay.

34
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,980
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye bye.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,220
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

36
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,420
Bye bye.

37
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,980
Bye bye.

38
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,340
Bye bye!

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
Bye bye!

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,000
Was your confession successful?

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,780
She promised to run with me tomorrow.

42
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,820
Confess your love properly next time.

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,700
Don't just invite her to run. Who'd understand that?

44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,800
She will understand.

45
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,380
Tong Tong!

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,780
I got the results of my mock due diligence project.

47
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,140
I'm in first place!

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,340
Are you really?

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,600
As expected of my best friend.

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,540
- You are amazing. 
 - Of course.

51
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,480
After all, I said I'd be financially independent before I turned 35.

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,780
Can a little mock due diligence project be hard for me?

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,080
Awesome.

54
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,460
Enough, stop drinking.

55
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
You might as well take this opportunity and try something.

56
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,780
Listen.

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,740
Being in a relationship is like doing business.

58
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,120
Good fortune waits only for bold ones.

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
Being like this, you're not the Xu Chen Xi I know anymore.

60
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,700
Do you think I've never confessed?

61
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,620
I confessed right after I graduated from high school.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,060
 Block, block. 

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,320
 Defense. 

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,580
 Gan Yang! Gan Yang! 

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,940
 - Be careful. 
 - Keep it up. 

66
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,340
 Nice shot! 

67
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,300
 Good shot! 

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,700
 Get into position. Stay on defense. 

69
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,440
 Gan Yang. 

70
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,940
 I like you. 

71
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,880
 Let's be together. 

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,380
 Since that day, he deliberately avoided me. 

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,320
 So I made a decision. 

74
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,260
 Why did she come? She's here again. 

75
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,440
 Why are you here? 

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,320
 That's none of your business. 

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,980
 Wait! 

78
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,440
 Gan Yang, since Xu Chen Xi is so proactive, why don't you just accept her? 

79
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
 Zeng Jun Jie. 

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,960
 I like you. 

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,800
 Me? 

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,300
 Let's be together. 

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,740
 She... 

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,880
 Mission accomplished. Bye bye. 

85
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
  Hey, wait a minute. 

86
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,080
 - What's going on? 
 - What do you mean? 

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,500
 Isn't it obvious? 

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,480
 It's not obvious. 

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,400
 Simply put, I'm playing Truth or Dare. 

90
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,300
 If I lose, I have to confess to whom they choose. 

91
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,020
 Then did you lose last time? 

92
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,520
 So did you really think I liked you? 

93
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,620
 You scared me. 

94
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,060
 I really thought you liked me. 

95
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,040
 In your dreams. 

96
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,560
 After I made an excuse that day, 

97
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,200
he stopped hiding from me.

98
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,360
Our friendship was back to normal.

99
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,500
I never dared to say I liked him again.

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,320
To avoid his suspicions,

101
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,180
I purposely chose a Shanghai university.

102
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,140
I'm so far from him.

103
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,700
It's really far.

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,740
Okay, okay.

105
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,700
- Stop crying. 
 - Why?

106
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,140
- Why doesn't he like me? 
 - There, there.

107
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,860
Hello?

108
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,400
 Ding Zhi Tong. 

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,440
 Why are you still sleeping? 

110
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,440
Don't forget what you promised me last night.

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,540
I'll pick you up in half an hour.

112
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,920
Have you sobered up?

113
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,760
I don't usually drink much.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,060
And I didn't drink that much last night.

115
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,780
I kind of hoped you drank too much

116
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,240
and forgot what happened last night.

117
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,980
Ding Zhi Tong.

118
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,140
 Are you listening? 

119
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,440
I am.

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm telling you.

121
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,620
Don't try to play dumb and refuse to admit it.

122
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,920
I was just drunk last night, not stupid.

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,920
We agreed I'd run with you after I get an offer, didn't we?

124
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,240
I haven't received the offer yet.

125
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,040
Why would you think that way?

126
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,080
If you run with me, you may receive it.

127
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,046
- Okay, then I'll see you in half an hour. 
 - Okay.

128
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:32,780
Tong Tong.

129
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,760
Are you running despite the heavy rain?

130
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Hey.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,820
It's raining outside.

132
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,920
Can we still run?

133
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,180
True.

134
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,260
Okay then.

135
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,840
You can go back to sleep.

136
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,460
How about this?

137
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,680
We can run when the rain stops.

138
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,920
That's good.

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,180
Then after the rain stops.

140
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,360
See you later.

141
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
Okay. Bye bye.

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,950
   

143
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,421
Is this jacket better than the last one?

144
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:45,580
Do you need to do this?

145
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,300
You're going for a run, not to a beauty pageant.

146
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,560
What do you know?

147
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,800
She finally agreed to run with me.

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,040
Of course, I have to prepare well.

149
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
I don't know anything.

150
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,100
That's why I won't waste my time on you.

151
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,000
- I have experiments to do. 
 - No way.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,320
Until I figure out what to wear, don't go anywhere.

153
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,400
Tell me.

154
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,780
Is this one better?

155
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,060
Wait. How can I recall what you wore before?

156
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,220
Aren't they all similar?

157
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,960
Then I'll try them again.

158
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,860
Your Majesty.

159
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,100
I've remembered it.

160
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,680
This one is very good.

161
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,880
It brightens your skin tone and shows your temperament.

162
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,120
It also makes your legs look longer.

163
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,300
Really?

164
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,480
Then I surely won't choose this one

165
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,460
because you have poor taste.

166
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,300
Then why are you pestering me for advice?

167
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,620
Reverse selection, don't you know?

168
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,500
What's the use of wearing cool clothes?

169
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,880
You run after the rain stops.

170
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,720
Please.

171
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,800
Please stop raining.

172
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
The sun is already out. Why is it still raining?

173
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm leaving, Yun Ting.

174
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,420
- Bye. 
 - Bye bye.

175
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,840
- Hello? 
 - The rain has stopped.

176
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,340
 Yes, it has. 

177
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,980
- Then let's meet at the park gate soon. 
 - See you there.

178
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,180
Okay. See you later.

179
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,720
Ding Zhi Tong.

180
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,640
I thought you'd left.

181
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,860
How could that be?

182
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,180
We made an appointment.

183
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,400
How could I leave before you arrived?

184
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,460
Then... let's go.

185
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
Okay.

186
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,200
Let's run.

187
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,660
Wait a minute. Ding Zhi Tong.

188
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,480
You're not breathing correctly while you run.

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm just breathing normally.

190
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
When you run,

191
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,620
the rhythm and method of breathing are important,

192
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,520
or it's easy to get out of breath.

193
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,600
Listen.

194
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,360
Follow me.

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,220
Put your hands on your waist.

196
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,140
Feel your breathing.

197
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,760
Follow me.

198
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,420
Breathe out.

199
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,840
Breathe out. Breathe in.

200
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,780
Inhale with your nose; exhale with your mouth.

201
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,220
Breathe out.

202
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,860
Give me your hand.

203
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,820
Put it on your abdomen and feel it again.

204
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,280
Breathe in.

205
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,480
Exhale.

206
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,200
In.

207
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,200
Out.

208
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,440
Out.

209
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,180
Why is your heart beating so fast?

210
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,280
Have you a problem with your heart?

211
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,960
I-I'm fine.

212
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,600
Let's go.

213
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,940
Okay.

214
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,480
Breathe.

215
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,220
♫  A different kind of air  ♫

216
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,140
♫  Hovers between us  ♫

217
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,650
♫  Lemony freshness after the rain  ♫

218
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,950
♫  Your breathing  ♫

219
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,170
♫  Has the same rhythm as me  ♫

220
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,740
♫  A different feeling  ♫

221
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,390
♫  Your eyes  ♫

222
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,650
♫  Hold the stars that fell into dreams  ♫

223
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,210
♫  Running against the wind  ♫

224
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,100
♫  At the rhythm of the heartbeat  ♫

225
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,820
Breathe.

226
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,140
♫  Is a loving, loving day  ♫

227
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,290
No. I can't run anymore.

228
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,510
You can't run anymore?

229
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,040
♫  Every shining, shining day  ♫

230
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,760
♫  I will go and open my heart  ♫

231
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,640
It's time to test your perseverance.

232
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,380
Think about Hetai Securities' offer.

233
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,380
That's what you're pushing for, right?

234
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,400
Let's run!

235
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,880
♫  Welcome to  ♫

236
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,520
For my offer!

237
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,360
Let's push forward!

238
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,122
Keep going!

239
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,780
♫  You are so unique  ♫

240
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,750
♫  You appeared in the cool season  ♫

241
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,040
♫  Like a cup of warm milk  ♫

242
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,420
♫  I want to greet a sunrise in your embrace  ♫

243
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,590
♫  Over the same blue ocean  ♫

244
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,980
♫  You and I  ♫

245
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,900
Here, have some water.

246
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,580
Thank you.

247
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,480
You ran quite well, didn't you?

248
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,720
And you made it to the end.

249
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
Isn't that due to your encouragement?

250
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,160
Ding Zhi Tong.

251
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,100
Do you remember

252
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,780
I had an important thing to say to you

253
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,640
after the marathon?

254
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Ding Zhi Tong.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,480
I...

256
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,240
It's raining.

257
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,520
It really is.

258
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,740
How about going to my place for now? It's nearby.

259
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,960
I'll take you back to school after the rain eases.

260
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

261
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,320
Have you heard what happened this morning?

262
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,760
Song Ming Mei roughed up Xu Shi Qi in the cafeteria.

263
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,160
Sure. Why didn't I hear about it?

264
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,400
It seems to be about the project results.

265
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,800
 I personally saw that! 

266
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,380
 Song Ming Mei and Prof Qin went back to the dorm together, 

267
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,740
 She even touched Old Qin's head. 

268
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,820
 Why would I lie to you? 

269
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,340
 How could that happen in an ordinary teacher-student relationship? 

270
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,200
 - Really? 
 - I saw... 

271
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,840
 Song Ming Mei, are you crazy? 

272
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,480
 Let's take a photo of her and report it to the school. 

273
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520
 She's hitting someone in public? 

274
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,060
 Your mock due-diligence results should be nullified! 

275
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,470
   

276
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,200
I've read all your reports.

277
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,360
Besides scoring, I also made detailed comments.

278
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Do you have any questions about your results?

279
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,780
Okay then.

280
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,800
Next up, we will focus

281
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,980
on Song Ming Mei's report.

282
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,140
In comparison, her report is the most comprehensive and complete one.

283
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,120
She also made a detailed industry analysis.

284
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,960
Plus a regular information review,

285
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,780
she also contacted senior experts

286
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,760
for industry interviews.

287
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,520
The rest of you ignored that.

288
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,975
Based on the above reasons, I gave her the highest score in the class.

289
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:25,900
If she gets the highest score...

290
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,180
Her report is indeed excellent.

291
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,180
I don't understand why Xu Shi Qi...

292
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,340
Before class started, I forwarded all the reports to you.

293
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,280
He is just jealous.

294
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,180
I believe you all have seen them.

295
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,340
If you have any objections to this,

296
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,300
we can discuss it now.

297
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Xu Shi Qi.

298
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,540
How about you?

299
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,260
Any objections?

300
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,260
Since there is no objection,

301
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,260
can you apologize to Song Ming Mei and me?

302
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,060
Xu Shi Qi.

303
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,360
Sorry, Professor Qin.

304
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm sorry, Song Ming Mei.

305
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,020
All right. Sit down.

306
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,940
If someone spreads rumors behind my back again,

307
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,260
they cannot take my class.

308
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,260
 Now he looks quite handsome. 

309
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,700
Let's discuss solutions for the Profit and Loss Ratio Formula.

310
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,300
Please come in.

311
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,420
This is my home.

312
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,340
I share this house with Wang Yi.

313
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,940
I...

314
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,620
Ding Zhi Tong, you got rained on!

315
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,740
Hurry and take a shower.

316
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,100
Do you have clothes so I can change?

317
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,660
Yes.

318
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,620
Here you are.

319
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,320
Thank you.

320
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,400
Gan Yang.

321
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,620
Are you finished?

322
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,740
I'll take you somewhere.

323
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,300
Okay.

324
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,720
These are my collections.

325
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,620
So this is your exercise science lab?

326
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,640
Yes.

327
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,300
But this lab is relatively small.

328
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,540
We do simple experiments here.

329
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,040
For complex ones, we use the college lab.

330
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,200
If we need special equipment, we go to my family's factory.

331
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,620
Are all the shoes part of your collection?

332
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,140
Look at this pair.

333
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,680
This is the first pair of running shoes with shock absorption.

334
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,400
You can feel it here.

335
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,905
Isn't it soft?

336
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:22,920
- What about this one? 
 - It's a defective product I've collected.

337
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,540
Why do you collect defective products?

338
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,940
I'm doing this

339
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,800
to understand running shoes' shortcomings.

340
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,660
Sometimes, I disassemble them

341
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,980
to see if I can improve anything.

342
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,300
That's how I learn.

343
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,600
You're really different from others.

344
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,940
Others usually collect good-looking ones

345
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,440
and those with potential.

346
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,460
You're collecting a bunch of failed sneakers.

347
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,600
Does it make you feel

348
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,660
that I'm a failure?

349
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,100
No. You are surely collecting these

350
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,080
to make better running shoes.

351
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,200
You understand me,

352
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,320
Tong Tong.

353
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,780
What would you like to drink?

354
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,720
Anything is fine.

355
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,140
Okay.

356
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,060
These are the shoes I prepared for you.

357
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,060
For me?

358
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,680
Yes. Before, you agreed to help me test running shoes.

359
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,500
- Do you remember? 
 - I thought you were just talking casually.

360
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,400
How could that be?

361
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,600
This is the latest batch of shoes produced by our factory.

362
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,400
I asked them to leave a pair in your size.

363
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,820
And it's pure white.

364
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,860
I was thinking to help you spray-paint them yourself.

365
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,340
Paint them myself?

366
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,040
Yes. Do you want to try?

367
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,020
I'm afraid I'll mess it up.

368
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,860
No need to be afraid. I'll show you how.

369
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,180
Okay.

370
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,580
The paint hasn't dried yet.

371
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,980
It will take a while before you can wear them.

372
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,080
This is the first time I've sprayed my own shoes.

373
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,560
It feels fantastic.

374
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,320
Do you like them?

375
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,180
When I make shoes of my own brand,

376
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,580
I will give you the first pair.

377
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,620
Then we will spray them together again.

378
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,920
That's a deal.

379
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,540
Thank you, Director Gan.

380
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,140
You're welcome, Director Ding.

381
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,940
I got an offer from Hetai.

382
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,920
   

383
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,720
Congratulations!

384
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,960
 Finally, it's a good result. 

385
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,720
Ding Zhi Tong.

386
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,200
Let's run together.

387
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
Okay.

388
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,880
I like you, too.

389
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,620
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

390
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,070
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

391
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,320
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

392
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,320
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

393
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,120
♫  Stay with me  ♫

394
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,820
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

395
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,420
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

396
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,370
♫  Burning bright  ♫

397
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,850
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

398
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:53,600
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

399
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,920
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

400
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,540
No. That one.

401
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Tong Tong. Which one do you think looks better?

402
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,260
- It's that one. 
 - Ding Zhi Tong.

403
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:23,240
Ding Zhi Tong! Focus!

404
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,100
You've been weird since yesterday.

405
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,049
You've been smiling since you returned.

406
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,840
Speak up. Are you hiding something from me?

407
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,720
Gan Yang and I are together.

408
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,740
- Is it for real? 
 - What?

409
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,200
Tong Tong, you've finally come around!

410
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,460
That Gan Yang is quite somebody.

411
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,880
Tell me. What's going on?

412
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,620
Well, I like him, and he likes me

413
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,494
so we are together.

414
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:58,740
- Boring. 
 - You were so hesitant a few days ago.

415
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,540
Tell us. Why did you decide so suddenly?

416
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
I just feel that you were right.

417
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,580
No one can tell the future.

418
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,060
But at least we are truly in love now.

419
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,000
Then I'll just deal with things as they come.

420
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Precisely.

421
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,860
That's the right way to think.

422
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,200
Youth is all about enjoying today.

423
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,400
- True. 
 - That's right.

424
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,940
What are you doing?

425
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,360
These are for my Tong Tong.

426
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
Can't you make some more?

427
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,000
These are the only dumplings left in the refrigerator.

428
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,740
If you want to eat, buy ingredients yourself tonight.

429
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,820
- I'll make them for you when I get back. 
 - Such a flake!

430
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,660
If you're jealous I have a girlfriend, just say so.

431
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,180
How smug!

432
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,020
Now I'm sending her the video of you getting drunk last year.

433
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,200
You still have the nerve to say that?

434
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,280
Whom was I drinking for?

435
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,260
Wang Yi.

436
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,000
Do you still want me to cook for you?

437
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,420
I'm just joking.

438
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,020
It's just my humor.

439
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,880
Is that humor?

440
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,580
Clean the pot.

441
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,800
Leave it to me.

442
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,260
- I'm leaving. 
 - Come back early.

443
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,640
I'll wait for you to eat dinner.

444
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,720
   

445
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,580
Good morning.

446
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,420
Why are you here?

447
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,280
I'm here to pick up my girlfriend for work.

448
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,600
Well, you are quite a good boyfriend.

449
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,300
You definitely fit the bill.

450
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,880
Are you going to class? I can give you a ride.

451
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,660
No need. I'll go by myself.

452
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,920
I won't be a third wheel with you two.

453
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm leaving.

454
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,771
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

455
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:49,880
- Bye bye. 
 - Bye bye.

456
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,640
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

457
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,540
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

458
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Here you are.

459
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,760
I made these fried dumplings.

460
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,160
So many?

461
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,200
I can just grab some food at the convenience store.

462
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
You can't eat junk food every day.

463
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,620
Now on, I'll cook for you whenever I have time.

464
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,940
Okay.

465
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,260
Let's go.

466
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,680
Let's go.

467
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,880
Give me the lunch box.

468
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,920
Shall we have dinner together tonight?

469
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,580
Okay. I get off work at 6 PM.

470
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,040
Okay. I'll pick you up then.

471
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,140
Then I'll see you tonight.

472
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,760
See you tonight.

473
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,740
Bye bye.

474
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,340
Bye bye.

475
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,320
Are you okay?

476
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,160
Yun Ting, what's wrong?

477
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,240
My boyfriend broke up with me.

478
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,300
He said he...

479
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,520
He said he was tired of our long-distance relationship.

480
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,460
Then I called him,

481
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,440
and I heard some other woman's voice.

482
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,060
I really want to ask him face to face exactly what's going on.

483
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,120
But the air ticket is too expensive.

484
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,180
I can't afford it at all.

485
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,692
Stop crying. How about this?

486
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:57,540
Take some rest and calm down.

487
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,560
Then call him and discuss it with him.

488
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,740
There might be a misunderstanding.

489
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,860
Who knows? Maybe you can resolve and talk it through.

490
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,040
Really?

491
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,720
Yes. It's better than overthinking.

492
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,800
Just go to the dorm and rest today.

493
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,400
But I just started working today.

494
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,180
It's okay. I'll do your part today.

495
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,060
Go to the dorm.

496
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,220
Thank you.

497
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,820
You're the best.

498
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,580
It's no big deal.

499
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,660
- Hurry now. 
 - Thank you.

500
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,860
- Go get changed. 
 - Okay.

501
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,500
Go. Go on.

502
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,660
 Gan Yang, I'm back. 

503
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,280
Gan Yang?

504
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,260
My dear chef.

505
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,860
 What's up? 

506
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,040
- Have you bought groceries? 
 - Of course. Come and look.

507
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,500
Check these out. They are very fresh.

508
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,340
Let's cook a big meal tonight.

509
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,600
I won't be eating with you.

510
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,285
I'm going on a date.

511
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:57,300
Then what should I do?

512
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,640
You can make it by yourself.

513
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,680
Do it yourself.

514
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,920
Are you joking?

515
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,500
As a human being, how can you say such cold words?

516
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
You just got a girlfriend. Now you want to abandon your old dining partner?

517
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,360
Just get yourself a girlfriend.

518
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,700
Do you think I don't want to?

519
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,140
Buddy, just look.

520
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,980
All these papers and those experiments.

521
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,800
Where can I find time for dating?

522
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,300
I can't help you with that.

523
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,840
I'm leaving.

524
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,440
Hello, Tong Tong.

525
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,500
Please wait for me for a bit.  I'm about to leave.

526
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,480
I'll be there soon.

527
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,720
 Hi, Gan Yang. 

528
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,860
 Maybe I can't meet for dinner today. 

529
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,120
I'm taking over my colleague's shift today.

530
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,440
It's okay. It's fine.

532
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,600
Okay, I understand.

533
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,840
It's an emergency.

534
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,560
You don't want this, either.

535
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,460
Okay, do your work.

536
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,780
Bye bye.

537
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,000
She won't eat with you tonight.

538
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,340
You have a keen ear.

539
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,400
Time waits for no man.

540
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,240
Let's do it!

541
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,720
Who wants to eat with you?

542
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,060
Tong Tong is still working overtime.

543
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,840
She will eat ramen alone in the convenience store.

544
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,320
I'll go find her.

545
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,240
Bye bye.

546
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,820
Then what about the groceries?

547
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,140
 You figure it out on your own. 

548
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:19,720
   

549
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,720
Is anyone here?

550
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,640
Welcome.

551
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,080
Why are you here?

552
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,060
I'm here to eat with you.

553
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,640
"To eat"?

554
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,260
I have only instant noodles for dinner.

555
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,280
Then I'll eat them with you.

556
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,380
Will you eat instant noodles, too?

557
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Then how about this?

558
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,240
I'll make you special instant noodles.

559
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,720
Okay. .

560
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,160
You can start eating when the cheese melts.

561
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,620
I also added some chips to it.

562
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,260
You can eat them this way too?

563
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,420
I specially developed this method.

564
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,000
Try it.

565
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,920
Then I will try it.

566
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,880
Is it okay?

567
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,380
It's good.

568
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,840
"Good"?

569
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,900
- That's fine. 
 - It smells great.

570
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,700
Wasn't Yun Ting on duty today?

571
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,060
But she had an issue to deal with.

572
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,120
So I took her shift for today.

573
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,520
By the way, isn't her boyfriend in Guangzhou?

574
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,240
How do you know that?

575
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,860
Wang Yi used to like her.

576
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,340
Then he found out she had a boyfriend.

577
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,000
Guangzhou is too far away.

578
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,540
The plane and train tickets are expensive.

579
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,260
They usually can't even meet monthly.

580
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,080
They're really suffering.

581
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,780
That's a real love story with many complications.

582
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,840
I'm going to Shanghai soon.

583
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,720
I know.

584
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,140
My Tong Tong is growing up and heading into the world.

585
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,340
But don't worry, I will work hard.

586
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,660
No matter which city you are in, I'll fly over to see you.

587
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,940
All right?

588
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,380
All right.

589
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,220
Do you want some?

590
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,560
No. I just ate a whole bowl of it.

591
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,220
Okay then.

592
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,840
 Hello? 

593
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,600
 Okay. 

594
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,840
 Okay. I'll arrive on time. 

595
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,500
Thank you.

596
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,960
What's wrong?

597
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,480
Nothing.

598
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,820
It's really nothing.

599
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,540
Eat up.

600
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,700
Okay.

601
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,200
I will change shifts with Yun Ting tomorrow.

602
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,740
I'll be free tomorrow evening.

603
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,800
Really?

604
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,200
- Then let's have dinner together. 
 - Okay.

605
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,240
 - Just add us. 
 - I'd rather not. 

606
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
 - Right, just add us. 
 - Add us as friends. 

607
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,900
 Look, why not? 

608
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,820
 - Just to get to know you. 
 - I really can't. 

609
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,840
 Add us as friends. 

610
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,020
- We're all classmates. 
 - Sorry, I won't.

611
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,660
- I can't do it. 
 - Just to get to know each other.

612
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
- Will that do? 
 - Tong Tong.

613
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,420
So many girls are talking to you.

614
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,620
Then what do I do if I go to Shanghai?

615
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,760
You saw that. Why didn't you save me?

616
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,080
I can save you once or twice, but I can't always be there to save you.

617
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,600
Don't worry.

618
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,980
I'll steer clear of girls.

619
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,140
Where shall we go to eat?

620
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,080
You'll see when we get there.

621
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,800
Hello?

622
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,420
Yes, I am.

623
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,020
Thank you.

624
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,080
I'll report to work on time.

625
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,200
I'd like to ask this.

626
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,540
Do all new employees need to report in advance?

627
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,560
Okay.

628
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,760
Thank you.

629
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,220
Bye bye.

630
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,760
This is my vegetable garden.

631
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,120
See. The chili peppers grow there.

632
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,540
Here are the tomatoes. They aren't ripe yet.

633
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,080
These are eggplants.

634
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,820
So many vegetables.

635
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,440
You have so many niche hobbies.

636
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,040
Tell me, have you more hobbies?

637
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,780
This isn't really a hobby. We grow them for cooking.

638
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,400
They are fresh for eating.

639
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,580
Only after enough food, we have the strength to live well.

640
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,480
Plants just don't thrive in my care.

641
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,720
Is there no hope for me then?

642
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,520
That's not true.

643
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,360
That's because you're usually too busy.

644
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,220
You have no time to care for such matters.

645
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,040
If you have time, you can do it well, too.

646
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,920
Then you can teach me in the future.

647
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,400
Okay.

648
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,340
Here it comes.

649
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,980
Bamboo Shoot with Pork Soup?

650
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,380
I knew you'd like this.

651
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,940
I rarely had it after I came to college.

652
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,520
I do miss it often.

653
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,340
But where did you buy bamboo shoots?

654
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,880
They don't sell bamboo shoots in the wet market near college.

655
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,660
I found them in a market farther away.

656
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,340
Hurry and try it.

657
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,680
I'll try it.

658
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,920
It tastes like the real deal.

659
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,120
That's good.

660
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,860
Chef Gan.

661
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,480
Is it really your first time cooking this?

662
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,380
It's the second time.

663
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,460
Then whom did you make it for the first time?

664
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,160
The first time I made it...

665
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,080
- It was for... 
 - I see.

666
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,200
Your ex-girlfriend.

667
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,320
Everyone has a first love.

668
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,120
I can understand.

669
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,880
It was for Wang Yi.

670
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,480
I feared I couldn't make it well,

671
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,320
and I tried it on him a few days ago.

672
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,120
Or whom do you think I made it for?

673
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,760
I don't care who it was.

674
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,480
Tong Tong.

675
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,560
You are my first love,

676
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,990
and the first person who touched my heart.

677
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:05,060


678
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,550
 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

679
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:15,280
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

680
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,730
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

681
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:29,870
♫  The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

682
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:37,030
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

683
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:43,860
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

684
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:50,760
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

685
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,830
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

686
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:04,830
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

687
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:11,370
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

688
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:18,660
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

689
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,790
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

690
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:32,690
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

691
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:39,580
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

692
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:46,130
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

693
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:53,410
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

694
00:40:53,410 --> 00:41:06,010
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
