 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,840
♫  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  ♫

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
♫  And you just happened to pass by there  ♫

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
♫  So effortlessly  ♫

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
♫  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  ♫

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,220
♫  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  ♫

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,200
♫  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  ♫

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  How lucky  ♫

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  That person turned out to be you  ♫

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
♫  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  ♫

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
♫  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  ♫

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,380
♫  And just for now I want to hold you tight  ♫

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,790
♫  Come let me see you in the morning light  ♫

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
♫  If our eyes can't hold back love  ♫

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,150
♫  Then let it pour in like a flood  ♫

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  Stay with me  ♫

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,680
♫  Eye to eye  ♫

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,240
♫  Come feel my heart  ♫

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,010
♫  Burning bright  ♫

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,550
♫  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  ♫

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,800
♫  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  ♫

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,360
   

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,460
♫  So don't let me go  ♫

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,450
   

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,580
   

26
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,260
Ding Zhi Tong.

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,100
Will you join me in running?

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,860
"Ding Zhi Tong."

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,220
"Will you join me in running?"

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,320
Are you crazy?

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,280
I never heard anyone ask in a love confession,

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,860
"Will you join me in running?"

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,440
Just shut up.

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,940
So what did she say?

35
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,860
Did she agree?

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,920
She said she has no time with her part-time job.

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
What's that supposed to mean?

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,540
Can you just focus for a second?

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,920
I'm asking what she meant by that.

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,100
Why would I know?

41
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,400
I know you've never been rejected before.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,940
This is the first time for you.

43
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,060
Honestly, it serves you right.

44
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,940
With your thinking, you'll stay single forever.

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,540
Just eat.

46
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:01,100
   

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,600
 Ding Zhi Tong. 

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
 Will you join me in running? 

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,540
   

50
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,360
   

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,500
   

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,940
   

53
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,580
Cool, see you at the bus stop at 8 a.m.

54
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,200
Tong Tong, the heater is out of order. There's no hot water.

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
Maybe skip it tonight.

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,780
No worries, cold water is fine.

57
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,140
I can't skip it after strenuous sweat.

58
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,660
All right then.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,480
"Resource allocation."

60
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,380
Good luck with your interview.

61
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,580
Fix your hair yourself.

62
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,460
- What's wrong? 
 - I suddenly have cramps.

63
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,060
Don't tell me your period started.

64
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,460
It seems it came early.

65
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,740
Tong Tong?

66
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,580
Are you okay? How about I grab painkillers for you?

67
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,580
 No time left. I'll get some after the interview. 

68
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
Tong Tong. 
    

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,780
Didn't we say to meet at the bus stop?

70
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,860
- Why are you here? 
 - I woke up early.

71
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,320
I brought you breakfast.

72
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,660
Thanks, but I don't feel like eating.

73
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,740
Are you feeling unwell, or are you just nervous?

74
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,520
I'm fine, a bit nervous. Let's just go.

75
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,980
Ding Zhi Tong,

76
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll attend Hetai's interview, too.

77
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
Why don't we go together?

78
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,040
It's okay. I'll just take the bus.

79
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,140
- I don't want to trouble you. 
 - It's no trouble at all.

80
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,920
It's the same way anyway.

81
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,820
Is he going for an interview, too? Let's all go together.

82
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,980
Schoolmate, Tong Tong said no.

83
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,060
Don't you understand?

84
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,580
I mean, the bus goes straight there.

85
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,620
It's very convenient.

86
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,260
Just go ahead. Don't worry about us.

87
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,960
We will leave first.

88
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,420
   

89
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,760
Next one, Tang Yan.

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,740
 I'm a senior student from Qingbei University's Finance Dept. 

91
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:50,980
   

92
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,780
Ding Zhi Tong, are you okay?

93
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,100
You were holding your tummy the whole time.

94
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,700
Are you unwell?

95
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,600
I just have cramps.

96
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,260
I'll be all right in a bit.

97
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,620
You're in so much pain, yet you said you were fine.

98
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,340
What if it's acute appendicitis?

99
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,820
Let me take you to the hospital.

100
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,920
No, it's not that.

101
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,400
It happens every month.

102
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
What should we do now?

103
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,300
Do you need some painkillers?

104
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,520
No time for that.

105
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,760
My turn is coming up soon.

106
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,320
Just wait for me.

107
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,760
   

108
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,020
- Excuse me. 
 - Can I help you?

109
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,040
Have you anything for period pain?

110
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,230
Are her hands cold?

111
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,740
I didn't touch them, but her forehead is sweating.

112
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,380
Next time, check your girlfriend's hands.

113
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,860
If they're cold, it's likely weak circulation and a cold womb.

114
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,980
Foot soak packs help with that.

115
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,600
"Foot soak packs"?

116
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
It's quite urgent.

117
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,760
- Do you have anything that works fast? 
 - Sure, a moment.

118
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,200
Okay. Be quicker, please.

119
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,720
 - Careful, it's hot. 
 - Thanks, Senior. 

120
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,240
 Senior, were you the interviewer 

121
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
 at Hetai's campus recruitment yesterday? 

122
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,600
I want to ask about someone.

123
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,620
Do you remember Gan Yang from our school?

124
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,472
Of course. Among all our university candidates,

125
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:28,160
only he and Ding Zhi Tong made this round.

126
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
What do you want to ask?

127
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,320
He pulled strings to get in, didn't he?

128
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
Actually, no.

129
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,060
He made it fairly.

130
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,920
He passed the written test like everyone.

131
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,220
His logic and case analysis

132
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,760
got full marks, like yours.

133
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,060
He got full marks, too?

134
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,750
   

135
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,900
 Ding Zhi Tong, I'm back. 

136
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,080
You bought so much.

137
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,500
I didn't know which one to get.

138
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,280
I just bought everything suggested.

139
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,620
Drink water with the medicine.

140
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,820
I got this, and this,

141
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,240
plus heat patches.

142
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,060
Which do you want?

143
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't need so much.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,720
A painkiller is enough.

145
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,260
This one.

146
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,560
Thanks.

147
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,360
Feeling any better?

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,800
It won't kick in right away.

149
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
It takes a while.

150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,340
Okay.

151
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,660
 Maybe try a heat patch? 

152
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,060
Here, hold it.

153
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,480
Next, Ding Zhi Tong.

154
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,500
Hi,

155
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm Gan Yang.

156
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,240
I'm here for the interview, too.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,120
- Can I go first? 
 - You will be next.

158
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,000
- Just wait a little. 
 - I really don't have time.

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Please, do me a favor.

160
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
You need consent of the interviewee ahead of you.

161
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,240
   

162
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,160
I know her.

163
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,000
Ding Zhi Tong, do me a favor.

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let me go first.

165
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,000
Good morning, Interviewers.

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm Gan Yang.

167
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,240
Let's get started.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
How are you feeling now? Better? 
    

169
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
Much better.

170
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,340
Good luck.

171
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,100
Please introduce yourself.

172
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,200
Good morning, Interviewers. I'm Ding Zhi Tong,

173
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,480
a senior student from Qingbei University's Finance Dept.

174
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,640
I received a First-class Scholarship

175
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,240
for three years in a row,

176
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
along with the National Scholarship.

177
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,440
Last year, I passed the bar exam.

178
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,640
I also won the grand prize of Financial Innovation Competition.

179
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,580
I was the only undergrad among the winners.

180
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,500
I gave a talk at the National Forum for Outstanding Finance Students.

181
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,780
Your experience is impressive.

182
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,500
Why did you decide to major in finance?

183
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
I got into it in my senior year of high school.

184
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
At that time, I realized we could use math models

185
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,440
and functions to solve problems,

186
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
analyze, and even predict the future.

187
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
Honestly, it blew my mind.

188
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,240
And why do you want to be an investment banker?

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Because the deeper I went, the more I saw

190
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,400
how variable and unpredictable the market is.

191
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,280
I think trying to manage or even judge such uncertainty

192
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,920
makes the work challenging and exciting.

193
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
So what made you choose Hetai?

194
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,440
Because only Hetai gives me a chance

195
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
to make 200,000 in my first year.

196
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
- Well, that's impressive. 
 - She's bold.

197
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,880
Smart, desire,

198
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,920
that's exactly what a securities firm needs.

199
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,360
Compared to others, I am one more thing: poor.

200
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,420
So my desire runs stronger than theirs.

201
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
Gan Yang.

202
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,700
Ding Zhi Tong,

203
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,380
are you all right?

204
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Ding Zhi Tong.

205
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,380
Ding Zhi Tong. Ding Zhi Tong!

206
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,200
♫  The time and time  ♫

207
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,800
♫  Life and life  ♫

208
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:42,700
♫  I had it once. I lost it though  ♫

209
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,000
Are you okay? I'm taking you to the hospital.

210
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,360
No, I don't need to.

211
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,440
Why?

212
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,920
You passed out from the pain.

213
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,440
My body is fine.

214
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,960
Probably, I was too nervous from the interview

215
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
plus the period pain.

216
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,640
I just need to rest.

217
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,920
I insist you get checked out.

218
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,840
There's really no need.

219
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,760
I'll go back to the dorm and sleep it off.

220
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,040
Where are you going?

221
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,960
Back to school.

222
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,680
I'll go back, too.

223
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,480
You're in no shape to take the bus.

224
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,760
Let me drive you; it's on the way.

225
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,000
Thanks.

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,740
Come on.

227
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,720
Take a nap.

228
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,900
I'll wake you when we arrive.

229
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,960
Ding Zhi Tong, let me walk you upstairs.

230
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,400
"Female Dormitory. No Entry for Males."

231
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,880
Yes, but this is an exception.

232
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
You're not feeling well.

233
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,920
The dorm supervisor will understand.

234
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,440
It's okay, just a few steps.

235
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,680
But seriously, thank you so much

236
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,400
for stalling the interview so long.

237
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,880
Your interview was fine, right?

238
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,520
Sure, they think highly of me.

239
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,200
They told me to watch for their call

240
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,040
and said we'd meet again soon.

241
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,480
That's great.

242
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,640
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

243
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,880
Okay, when you feel better.

244
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:35,752
I'll get going.

245
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:38,600
Okay, rest well.

246
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
Thanks.

247
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:44,643
Bye bye.

248
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:45,960
   

249
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,720
Bye bye.

250
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,740
Tong Tong.

251
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,540
What happened, Tong Tong?

252
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,560
I've never had such period pain before.

253
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,240
I passed out before leaving the company.

254
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,640
-  Oh no.  
 - So did the interview go well?

255
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,080
A total disaster.

256
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
I assume I blew it.

257
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,840
Gan Yang gave me a ride back

258
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
and even got me all the medicine.

259
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,480
Why is pain so bad this time?

260
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,840
Take some medicine and sleep a bit.

261
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
I already took some and had a nap.

262
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
Are you going out?

263
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,400
Senior Liu is returning to Shanghai today.

264
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,280
I'm having dinner with her.

265
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
- Remember to take your medicine. 
 - Okay, don't worry.

266
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,860
I'm leaving. Keep an eye on her.

267
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,340
- Call me if anything happens. 
 - Okay.

268
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,660
- Don't worry. 
 - Don't worry.

269
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,220
Song Ming Mei, how is Tong Tong?

270
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,760
She's fine. She just took her medicine

271
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,840
and needs some rest.

272
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,360
I got her some medicine.

273
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,920
Well... Gan Yang has already bought her a bunch.

274
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,080
She can hardly finish it.

275
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,880
Gan Yang already bought her medicine?

276
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,200
He brought her back.

277
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,800
Gan Yang drove her?

278
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,880
All right, I won't talk more.

279
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,520
My ride is here. Tong Tong is fine.

280
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,200
Just don't worry. I'm off, bye bye.

281
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,400
As long as she's okay...

282
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,120
Stop tapping; it's annoying.

283
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,480
Look, your phone indicates her text.

284
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
If you're really that worried, just call her, okay?

285
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
What if she's sleeping?

286
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,240
Then wait until she wakes up.

287
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,600
What if she's not sleeping?

288
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,720
What if she fainted again?

289
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,240
Her roommates will take her to the hospital.

290
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,640
What if they're all out?

291
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,040
Dude, just ask any girl from our department

292
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,240
to go and check on her dorm, all right?

293
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,000
You're usually a genius, but about Ding Zhi Tong,

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,160
you are a full idiot.

295
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,900
- Who is the real idiot? 
 - You.

296
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,380
I don't argue with idiots.

297
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,000
   

298
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,180
   

299
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,460
   

300
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,240
   

301
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,560
   

302
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,540
   

303
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,480
   

304
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,560
   

305
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,820
   

306
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,940
 How about... tomorrow? 

307
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,320
 Sure. Lunch on me at noon tomorrow. 

308
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,760
 All right, see you tomorrow at noon. 

309
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,460
   

310
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,960
Yes! 
    

311
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,000
"See you tomorrow at noon."

312
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,120
"See you tomorrow at noon."

313
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,660
"See you tomorrow at noon."

314
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,580
Are you insane?

315
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,320
You're awake.

316
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
Who are you texting?

317
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
You're grinning heartily.

318
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,440
Come here. I brought you some food.

319
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,480
- Thanks. 
 - Eat while it's warm.

320
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,720
Start eating.

321
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,100
Do you feel better?

322
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,920
Much better.

323
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,720
Hey, were you texting Gan Yang just now?

324
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,240
After you passed out, how exactly did he carry you?

325
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,120
Did he carry you on his back or hold you in his arms?

326
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,320
I was unconscious. How would I know?

327
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,080
Oh, what a pity!

328
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,600
T-Try to recall the details.

329
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
You seriously forgot?

330
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
Yes, indeed a pity.

331
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,200
I spent so long preparing for the interview.

332
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
It went down the drain due to my period.

333
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,700
It's not that bad.

334
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,320
The interviewers might not have even known that.

335
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,220
Besides, someone as brilliant as you,

336
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,480
how would you not get a job?

337
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,840
But a soulmate won't return if you miss them.

338
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,320
Think. Did he hold you in front?

339
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
I've never even been carried like that.

340
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,820
Try to recall it.

341
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,800
I can't talk. I'll take this call.

342
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,440
How is it? Did you get tickets for the Future Tech Summit?

343
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,600
 I should have eaten less the last few days. 

344
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,240
How about this one?

345
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,080
- Do I look cool? 
 - Yes.

346
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,580
Does it make me look too mature?

347
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
Forget it, I'll change again.

348
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
Why bother? You'll just have lunch with her.

349
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,120
What if she takes you to the cafeteria?

350
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,641
Are you crazy? No one treats others in the cafeteria, okay?

351
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:49,401
How about this one?

352
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,920
Is it too childish?

353
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,180
Everything looks childish on you.

354
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,480
Your face is childish.

355
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,500
Get lost.

356
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,800
- You don't get it. 
 - Want my advice?

357
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,660
"Cafeteria"?

358
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,120
No way.

359
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,360
Professor Hu.

360
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,240
Tell me,

361
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,560
what happened with Hetai Securities'

362
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,140
internship interview?

363
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,520
There was a small accident.

364
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,560
 I'm being serious. 

365
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,060
 They just called me. 

366
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,180
 They said you've got sharp thinking and a good grasp of investment banking. 

367
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,920
They thought you were promising.

368
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,620
Tell me, what happened to you later?

369
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,180
You started rambling for ten minutes straight.

370
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,640
They gave you up on the spot.

371
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,540
 Anything else? 

372
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,540
 I'm so sorry. 

373
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,420
 I forgot to ask some questions. 

374
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,780
 Maybe next time. 

375
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,540
 We've still got more candidates to interview. 

376
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,260
 Just give me a few minutes. 

377
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,140
I had a few questions that I forgot to ask,

378
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,220
then I couldn't stop.

379
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,580
If they don't like me, I can't do anything.

380
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,780
With your high scores,

381
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,540
getting into Hetai would have been easy.

382
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,260
You had such a great shot, and you wasted it.

383
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,920
Look, if you put only half as much energy into it

384
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,620
as you do into shoes, any firm would want you!

385
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,740
Calm down, Professor Hu.

386
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,420
Since Hetai won't choose me, I'll keep looking.

387
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,260
- Please don't be angry. 
 - H-How can I not be?

388
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,300
Seriously, it's not worth your health—

389
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,660
How can I not be angry?

390
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,600
- I'll visit you tomorrow. 
 - No need!

391
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,640
Please don't be upset.

392
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,440
Get lost.

393
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,400
Gan Yang.

394
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,360
Thank you.

395
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,780
It's fine.

396
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,020
I just grabbed the medicine and dropped you off.

397
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,200
No need to thank me so many times.

398
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,900
I heard what Professor Hu said to you.

399
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,660
Don't worry.

400
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,420
It really wasn't for you.

401
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,660
Let's drop the downer stuff.

402
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,520
Where are we eating?

403
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,260
How about the cafeteria?

404
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,380
Sounds good.

405
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,140
You pick first.

406
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,080
All right.

407
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Madam, the braised pork, please.

408
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,440
Okay.

409
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,400
Some tenderloin.

410
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,140
- Also, some cucumber salad. 
 - All right.

411
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,240
- Thanks. 
 - That's ¥32 ($4).

412
00:26:50,997 --> 00:26:53,060
- Thanks. 
 - Here, take this.

413
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,960
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

414
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,920
Madam, I'll take just shredded potato and cucumber.

415
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,840
Okay, five yuan.

416
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,860
You eat so little?

417
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,160
I'm not hungry; I'll eat less.

418
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,800
Thanks, Madam.

419
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,320
Come on, let's grab a seat.

420
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,740
Okay.

421
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,460
- Here, your soup. 
 - Thanks.

422
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,520
What are you looking at?

423
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,440
Nothing.

424
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,160
I was supposed to treat you to something nicer,

425
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,420
but I've been saving up for formal clothes this month,

426
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,720
and my budget is tight.

427
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,840
I can treat you only in the cafeteria.

428
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,040
I refused the hospital yesterday because it costs money.

429
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,120
I thought you just hated injections and blood tests.

430
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Do you think I'm stingy?

431
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,520
Not at all.

432
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,940
I've been stingy since I was a child.

433
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,220
I once went to Hong Kong with my mom.

434
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,260
Do you know the first place we went?

435
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,920
Wait,

436
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,440
don't say the bronze bull statue outside HKEX (Hong Kong Stock Exchange).

437
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,700
- Bingo. 
 - I was just guessing.

438
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,540
I pondered if I ever go to Hong Kong,

439
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,220
that's exactly where I'd go first.

440
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,680
I'll rub the bull for good luck.

441
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,060
I'm going to Hong Kong tomorrow for a marathon.

442
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,300
Why don't we rub the bronze bull together?

443
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,840
I'll wait until I can afford the plane ticket.

444
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
I'll cover the flight tickets.

445
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,060
No need.

446
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,040
Oh, I've already sent you money for medicine and the ride.

447
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,480
You really didn't have to.

448
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,820
I already said I was driving back to school.

449
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,200
I don't like owing anyone.

450
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,920
Just take it.

451
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,700
All right then.

452
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,320
I'll take it as a share of the cost.

453
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,980
- Li Shan. 
 - Here.

454
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,600
- Fang Yuan. 
 - Here.

455
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,000
- Xu Shi Qi. 
 - Yes.

456
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,360
Stop there.

457
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,200
Professor Qin, I arrived before the bell rang.

458
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,660
It doesn't count as late, right?

459
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,540
Sit down.

460
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,920
- Song Ming Mei. 
 - Here.

461
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,280
- Zhang Chang. 
 - Here.

462
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,480
Sorry.

463
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,780
All right. Let's get started.

464
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,040
   
   

465
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,560
   

466
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,840
   

467
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,380
 Check if there's anyone you know 

468
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,200
 that can get you a ticket. 

469
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,080
If you don't understand, 
    

470
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,780
feel free to ask questions.

471
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,520
While you're working on your assignment,

472
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,840
you can email me and discuss it.

473
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,140
-  I want more. 
 - Hurry! 

474
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,320
 Give me the juice. 

475
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,000
Let me serve you guys.

476
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,180
You treat us to hotpot and drinks.

477
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,260
Why?

478
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,920
Do you need help or what?

479
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,160
I want Qin Chang to take me to the Future Tech Summit.

480
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,140
I need some strategies.

481
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,432
Tong Tong.

482
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:25,180
Are you guys eating hotpot behind the dorm head's back?

483
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,500
- Come on. 
 - Keep quiet.

484
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,220
You'll get us exposed.

485
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,920
Stop eating now.

486
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,720
Answer my question.

487
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Are you dating Gan Yang now?

488
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,840
Yes, tell us.

489
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,920
Don't believe or spread rumors.

490
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,280
Don't talk nonsense.

491
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,880
Girl, it's all over the campus forum already.

492
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,160
Gan Yang waited for you downstairs

493
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,920
with his flashy car for so long.

494
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,960
Then you two had lunch in the cafeteria.

495
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,040
Tell us, isn't it a date?

496
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,680
Yup. Everyone's talking about it.

497
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,960
I treated him to lunch just to thank him

498
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,520
for helping me during the interview.

499
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,160
- That's all. 
 - No.

500
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,200
- Really? 
 - Rumors said you two kissed.

501
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,860
Look.

502
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,540
How did a simple lunch turn into this?

503
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,700
   

504
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,440
   

505
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,760
   

506
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,320
   

507
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,960
   

508
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,440
 Doesn't she work at a convenience store? 

509
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
Well, it is Gan Yang after all,

510
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,600
one of the campus stars.

511
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,960
- Yes. 
 - Exactly.

512
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,400
I heard girls line up for him.

513
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
Tell us.

514
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,980
What's really going on?

515
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,500
Truly, nothing goes on.

516
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,860
I'll go wash up.

517
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,100
Sit down. Don't dodge it.

518
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,020
- What? 
 - You won't go anywhere until you tell us everything.

519
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,000
- Come on. 
 - Tell the truth.

520
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,560
There's seriously nothing. I told you everything.

521
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,200
We ran into each other with the interview,

522
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,600
and he helped me.

523
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,640
You know what kind of guy he is.

524
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,800
Whether he gets into Hetai or not

525
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,520
doesn't really matter.

526
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,920
But for me? This company is the best shot I've got.

527
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
My life is studying and making money daily.

528
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,520
Just study and work.

529
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,000
We're worlds apart.

530
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,760
All right. We were just joking.

531
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,560
Honestly, he was born lucky.

532
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,080
But as for us, we rely on ourselves.

533
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,540
- We're way out of his league. 
 - You are great!

534
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,880
Well, enjoy your hotpot.

535
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,860
I'll go wash up.

536
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,360
 Ding Zhi Tong, wake up. 

537
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,900
 Did you forget what's actually most important? 

538
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,640
   

539
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,000
 Classmate, I noticed you posted photos 

540
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,240
 on the campus forum of me and my friend at the cafeteria. 

541
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,760
 The captions are false. 

542
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,320
   

543
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,060
   
   

544
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,600
 I'm on the way to the airport, 

545
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,680
 heading to Hong Kong now. 

546
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,040
 I sent a DM to who posted photos 

547
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,840
 on the campus forum to delete it. 

548
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,360
 Sorry to drag you into all that. 

549
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,040
 Don't let those comments get to you. 

550
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,540
 Thanks. 

551
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,880
   

552
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,060
   
   

553
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,900
   

554
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,420
   

555
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,280
- Hello? 
 -  Did you see the photo of the bronze bull? 

556
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,040
 Didn't you say you've always wanted to touch it for luck? 

557
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,440
 I made a wish for you just now. 

558
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,800
 Hope you pass Hetai's interview. 

559
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,700
 Give it a touch. 

560
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:21,640
Gan Yang, thank you.

561
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,080
Then I'll touch it through the screen.

562
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,740
 All right. 

563
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,600
I have to hang up.

564
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm still working. Talk later.

565
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
 Okay, bye bye. 

566
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,700
Bye bye.

567
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,000
 Ding Zhi Tong, we rely on ourselves. 

568
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,340
 We're way out of his league. 

569
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,712
Ding Zhi Tong.

570
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:58,560
Make money.

571
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,000
♫  Only after the burning, the fireworks come  ♫

572
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,841
-  Excuse me.  
 - Coming.

573
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:11,400
♫  Beauty always comes with its cost  ♫

574

♫  Every fall brings scars but also gives me  ♫

575
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,780
♫  A strong armor  ♫

576

♫  Even with twists, I'll keep running on  ♫

♫  I am not scared  ♫

578
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,100
♫  I think I can hold on  ♫

579
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,900
♫  Time will simplify everything  ♫

580

♫  Joy and sorrow will eventually become  ♫

581
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,300
♫  A moment of memory  ♫

582
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,940
♫  But I want too much  ♫

583
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,460
♫  How can I stop?  ♫

584

♫  I accept the gap of losing after every gain  ♫

♫  I accept the gap of losing after every gain  ♫

♫  I matter most  ♫

♫  I'm glad flowers once bloomed on my path  ♫

♫  After taking some wrong turns  ♫

595
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,080
♫  Then I know where to go  ♫

596
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,620
♫  I'll arrive by myself  ♫

597
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,320
 We've arrived at the final stop. 

598
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,000
 The doors are opening. 

599
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,720
 Please watch your steps. 

600
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,480
 Please board at the front and exit at the back. 

601
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,420
 Thank you. 

602
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,020
Girl, are you riding again to clear your head?

603
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,920
All right, sit tight.

604
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,560
   

605
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:40,080

 "Someone" by Tia Ray 

607
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,540
♫  The long-lost memories suddenly resurfaced  ♫

608
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:57,820
♫  That was when we were searching for a crack in love  ♫

609
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:04,040
 The one who ran back then just wanted to stop  ♫

610
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:11,200
♫  Even brushing past, we couldn't help but look back  ♫

611
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,020
♫  But we failed to hold on to that tenderness in time  ♫

612
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:25,020
♫  Hidden in plain sight, yet too hard to say aloud  ♫

613
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:32,020
♫  Someone stayed by your side without reservation  ♫

614
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:39,100
♫  Someone lost all the warmth those moments once held  ♫

615
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:45,760
♫  It took every ounce of courage to let go of all the pain  ♫

616
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,920
♫  So I could fulfill all your future  ♫

617
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,960
♫  Someone once said, "Please forget me"  ♫ 
 ♫  And every time I think of it  ♫

618
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,940
♫  Someone stood behind me with no reservation  ♫

619
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:13,760
♫  Someone held my hand against all odds  ♫

620
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,520
♫  Now I’m left alone, piecing together the memories we once had  ♫

621
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:27,580
♫  Along the road we used to run through  ♫

622
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:40,080
♫  There is always the someone I never once forgot  ♫
