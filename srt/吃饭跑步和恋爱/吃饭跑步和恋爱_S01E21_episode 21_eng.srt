 "Don't Let Me Go" by Arthur Chen, Sabrina Zhuang 

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,840
â™«  My affection for you lies quietly in my heart  â™«

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,430
â™«  And you just happened to pass by there  â™«

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,640
â™«  So effortlessly  â™«

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,870
â™«  Awaken the feelings with just one smile  â™«

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,120
â™«  Oh, I once tucked my true heart away  â™«

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,200
â™«  But your quiet intuition found its hidden path  â™«

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,900
â™«  How lucky  â™«

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,560
â™«  That person turned out to be you  â™«

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,730
â™«  Our tightly-held hearts folded the distance between us  â™«

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,830
â™«  Every heartbeat writes the words of our daily life  â™«

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,380
â™«  And just for now I want to hold you tight  â™«

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,790
â™«  Come let me see you in the morning light  â™«

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
â™«  If our eyes can't hold back love  â™«

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,050
â™«  Then let it pour in like a flood  â™«

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,850
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,580
â™«  Eye to eye  â™«

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,240
â™«  Come feel my heart  â™«

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,010
â™«  Burning bright  â™«

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,550
â™«  Our hearts beat in perfect sync  â™«

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,800
â™«  It's obvious because I'm thinking of you  â™«

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400
   
   

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,500
â™«  So don't let me go  â™«

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,465
   

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,740
- This... 
 - That's right.

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,980
- Well... 
 - It could be an opportunity, though.

27
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,140
Everyone.

28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,810
I invited all of you here today

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,420
to talk about equity investment in Training Box.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,320
I know

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,940
more than half of you

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,800
have signed the Letter of Intent for Financing.

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,060
CEO Gan.

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,080
There would be no Training Box today without you.

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,170
No matter what decision you make,

36
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,780
we all follow your lead.

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,380
- Right. 
 - Yes.

38
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,980
I understand you.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,660
Our shared goal is to make

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,100
Training Box a success.

41
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,420
I agree to raise capital.

42
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,740
- This... 
 - CEO Gan.

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,780
This is quite good.

44
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,020
- That's good. 
 - He actually agreed.

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:57,880
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ðŸ’– Heart's Journey ðŸ’– Team @Viki.com 

46
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,920
Are you sure you want to receive investment?

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,560
It's for the company's benefit.

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,960
More than half of the shareholders have agreed.

49
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,080
Even Yuan Chao was wavering toward capital investment.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,460
Aren't you afraid that Wang's

51
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,800
might affect your rights to decisions?

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,360
Wang's investment in Training Box

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,860
can help seize the market at this stage.

54
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,800
In the future, when our proportional capital increases,

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,360
it won't affect our decision-making rights.

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
It's up to you.

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
I believe your judgment.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
As for Ding Zhi Tong,

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,860
did you explain to her the misunderstanding back then?

60
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,280
During my business trip with her in Beijing,

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,320
I kept trying to explain to her

62
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,300
about why I broke up with her back then.

63
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,980
Don't rush.

64
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,220
Now you've accepted the investment,

65
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,600
she will come to Training Box for due diligence.

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,020
You'll have many chances to explain then.

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,420
I plan to get her out of the due diligence of Training Box

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,600
and not let her know what happened back then.

69
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,100
Why won't you explain?

70
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,800
Because she needs a peaceful life.

71
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,800
If I tell her the truth now,

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,300
it will only disturb her...

73
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,740
and trouble her.

74
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,220
As long as she lives well, it's enough.

75
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,820
But you love her so much.

76
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,780
By doing this, youâ€™ll only hurt yourself.

77
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,240
But I can't be so selfish.

78
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,800
Over the years, she has done well without me.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I heard that Ding Zhi Tong

80
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,320
can get a raise and promotion after this project.

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,420
She made great efforts in this project.

82
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,700
If you kick her out at this very moment, she will hate you.

83
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,080
I've arranged a greater project for her.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
She can still become Managing Director.

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,140
Only when I'm not around,

86
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,607
she can return to her happy, peaceful life.

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,640
As long as you've thought it through.

88
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,975
â™«  For you  â™«

89
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:31,575
â™«  For you  â™«

90
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:35,220
   

91
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,521
This time, we nailed Training Box's investment project.

92
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,320
Thank you for your hard work.

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,761
Director Zhang, then this time,

94
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:42,620
can Sister Tong be promoted to MD?

95
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,060
Sister Tong truly deserves a promotion.

96
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,020
Listen up. You have to learn from your Sister Tong.

97
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,320
Sister Tong is my role model.

98
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,460
I'm just wondering about this.

99
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,200
Hasn't CEO Gan always refused the capital?

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,340
Why did he suddenly agree?

101
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,160
Don't think too much. The next step is to do the due diligence.

102
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,520
 Â­  

103
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,180
CEO Gan, this time, we are here

104
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,800
to discuss the investment details.

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,440
Zhi Tong.

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,320
Fine, I agree to accept investment.

107
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,700
But I have a condition.

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,680
Go ahead.

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,060
Director Ding will not handle this project.

110
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,380
Chairman Wang.

111
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,700
CEO Gan finally agreed to accept investment.

112
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,780
Great.

113
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,380
Ding Zhi Tong did not disappoint me.

114
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,700
But he wants a different project manager.

115
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,660
"Different"?

116
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,780
So Gutong Securities asked for our opinion

117
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,700
on the substitution.

118
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,120
This is the candidate they proposed.

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,040
I agree. Why not?

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,860
But it's beyond my expectations

121
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,960
that Gan Yang will replace Ding Zhi Tong.

122
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,500
Fine, I'll get back to them.

123
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,580
Fang Ying, wait.

124
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,340
Ask Gutong Securities to give the wine to Ding Zhi Tong.

125
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,040
Tell them we appreciate her efforts on Training Box.

126
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,820
- Good job. 
 - Chairman Wang.

127
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,100
Will this be too expensive?

128
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,180
For this bottle of red wine, I waited the whole night at the auction.

129
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,420
The project wasn't completed yet.

130
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,780
Maybe we still need her in the future.

131
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,260
All right.

132
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:18,740
   

133
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,080
The Wang's agreed to replace you.

134
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,000
Itâ€™s what I expected.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,260
After all, the most they care about

136
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,500
is to get the project,

137
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,380
not the person who helps them get it.

138
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,820
That's not quite true.

139
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,380
If it weren't for you,

140
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
CEO Gan wouldn't have accepted the investment.

141
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm sure about it. Wang also sees it.

142
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,940
Here.

143
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,020
This is from the Wang's.

144
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,580
The chairman asked me to pass along a message to you.

145
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,540
What's the message?

146
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,200
"Good job."

147
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,100
Judging by their reaction, they clearly recognize

148
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,240
your effort,

149
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,500
and they appreciate you very much.

150
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,660
Don't be discouraged. Keep up the good job.

151
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,060
I'll deal with this project later.

152
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,680
Thank you, Director Zhang.

153
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,740
A Lishi Group financing project is in Hong Kong.

154
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,520
They specially want you in charge.

155
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,270
But this project is not in a hurry.

156
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,020
I'll give you a week off.

157
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,860
Start the deal after a good rest.

158
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,580
Okay.

159
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,740
I have a request.

160
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,440
Can Li Jia Xin follow up on this project?

161
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,550
Why?

162
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,220
She has been following this project since inception.

163
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,780
She knows the situation quite well.

164
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,500
CEO Gan kicked only me from the project,

165
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,300
not my subordinates, right?

166
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,540
I reckon you have one more reason.

167
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,240
Li Jia Xin will be promoted to system analyst soon,

168
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,180
and Training Box will greatly impact her promotion.

169
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,420
I can't hide anything from you.

170
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,740
Fine. I agree.

171
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,220
Thank you, Director Zhang.

172
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,200
Sister Tong.

173
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,980
- Is all the info ready? 
 - It's all here.

174
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,520
Sister Tong, we worked on it so long.

175
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,420
Should we just quit like this?

176
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,780
I used to admire CEO Gan's courage and strategy.

177
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,300
I don't anymore since he turned and kicked us out.

178
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,740
I really judged wrongly.

179
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,060
A reminder,

180
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,940
I'm the only one who got kicked out.

181
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,620
You'll continue with this project.

182
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,260
Director Zhang has agreed.

183
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,960
Really? Sister Tong.

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,420
All right.

185
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,980
Prepare the information well.

186
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,300
Do your best.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,280
Don't embarrass me, or I won't spare you.

188
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,380
Thank you, Sister Tong. I will work hard and never let you down.

189
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,960
Go on.

190
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,520
 I couldn't believe you made a precise prediction. 

191
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,420
 I just made it up to comfort you. 

192
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,180
Did you really believe it?

193
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,940
The project is accepted.

194
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,920
Why are you still sighing?

195
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,980
The negotiation is finished,

196
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,060
but they removed me.

197
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,940
I just worked all in vain.

198
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,600
Hello, your food is ready.

199
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,320
Thanks.

200
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,420
Thank you.

201
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,320
Enjoy your meal.

202
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,100
Hold on.

203
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,440
I almost forgot this.

204
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Could you help me decant this?

205
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,100
Wait a moment.

206
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,540
This wine is very expensive.

207
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,060
How expensive is it?

208
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,100
You can find it only at auctions.

209
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,500
There aren't many of them.

210
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,640
Are you sure you'll treat me to it?

211
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,860
Then please decant it now. I fear I'll regret it later.

212
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,780
Okay, Miss.

213
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,720
I didn't expect you to be so generous.

214
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,640
I've been telling you about myself.

215
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,900
I still don't know your name.

216
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,840
Is the name that important?

217
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,080
Just call me Wilson.

218
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,860
Nice to meet you.

219
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,600
Me, too.

220
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,900
Enjoy the wine.

221
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,060
Cheers.

222
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,720
Cheers.

223
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,820
How is it?

224
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,760
I can't tell. Let's eat.

225
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,580
 It's late now. Why hasn't she returned yet? 

226
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,020
Ding Zhi Tong.

227
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,900
Sorry.

228
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,420
I removed you from the Training Box's project.

229
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,300
Don't you think it's too late to apologize?

230
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,540
Or do you think a simple "Iâ€™m sorry"

231
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,380
will erase all that happened before?

232
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,600
I don't ask for your forgiveness.

233
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,860
I removed you from Training Box

234
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,020
in the hope

235
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,240
that you can live happily

236
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,460
and peacefully.

237
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,120
Happiness?

238
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,880
How dare you say this?

239
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,900
Iâ€™ll remove myself from your life

240
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,920
and never bother you again.

241
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,020
That'd be the best.

242
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,080
 Tong Tong. 

243
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,540
 Iâ€™ll remove myself from your life 

244
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,840
 and never bother you again. 

245
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,580
I forgot to cancel the alarm.

246
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:02,350
   

247
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,825
   

248
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,240
 Bamboo Shoot with Pork Soup? 

249
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,680
 I knew you'd like this. 

250
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,400
 It tastes like the real deal. 

251
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,060
 That's good. 

252
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,900
   

253
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,975
   

254
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm back!

255
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,460
What took you so long?

256
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,700
You invited me for dinner at your place.

257
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,480
But you made me wait for so long.

258
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,540
I just had a stroll and picked up takeouts.

259
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,025
I saw Gan Yang's delivery downstairs, Bamboo Shoot with Pork Soup.

260
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,720
   

261
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,380
You also ordered his favorite Braised Beef Brisket.

262
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,200
It's so many years, but you both still share the same habits.

263
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,700
Why do I bump into him everywhere?

264
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,220
It's been six years.

265
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,060
I thought I had gotten over it.

266
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,300
It was not until I met him again

267
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,920
that I realized I just lied to myself.

268
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,200
I just can't move on.

269
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,240
I told you to move to my place,

270
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,820
but you refused.

271
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,240
Now youâ€™re the one causing all this disturbance.

272
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm not moving.

273
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,820
I've decided...

274
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,340
to sell this home and leave Shanghai.

275
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,960
Wait, why would you sell it?

276
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,160
I've made up my mind.

277
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,860
Let's eat.

278
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,080
Have this.

279
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480
Your home has a good location.

280
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,500
It has full facilities and easy transportation.

281
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,320
It'll sell quickly.

282
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,260
A few days ago, I added your listing to our Top Choices.

283
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,652
However, the price...

284
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:42,960
The price is not a problem. I'm in a hurry to sell it.

285
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,512
Okay, Miss. Now that I have your word, you can rest assured.

286
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:47,680
I will help you sell it.

287
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,880
- Thank you. 
 - Fine. Feel free to contact me.

288
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,820
Then I'll leave.

289
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,780
Ding Zhi Tong.

290
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,080
I saw the agency's ad at the entrance.

291
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,560
Do you want to sell your place?

292
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm in a hurry.

293
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,280
Why not buy my place as well?

294
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,240
You don't have to sell your home.

295
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll move.

296
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
No need.

297
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,020
I'm in a hurry to sell it.

298
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,960
I'll go to Hong Kong soon.

299
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,120
Hello?

300
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,400
 Hi, Tong Tong. Please help me check. 

301
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Who is in charge of Matching's project at Hetai Securities?

302
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,560
I'll ask for you. I'll get back to you later.

303
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,040
Bye bye.

304
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,200
Hello?

305
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,640
You busy bee.

306
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,220
 Why do you call me today? 

307
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,400
I need your help, of course.

308
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,420
I knew it.

309
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,560
Go ahead. What's up?

310
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,880
Hetai will conduct an equity transfer for Matching.

311
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,120
 Did you know? 

312
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,540
Of course, I know. I'm in charge of this project.

313
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,060
You're in charge? What a coincidence!

314
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,500
What's the matter? You know this company?

315
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,460
Yes. It's great that you are in charge of it.

316
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,100
By the way,

317
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,220
what has Director Qin been busy with these days?

318
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,260
Hey, Sister.

319
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,440
You surely overestimated me.

320
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,443
 He is now the second-in-command of Hetai Securities. 

321
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:49,260
I can hardly see him in the office.

322
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,540
How would I know?

323
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,760
Fine, got it, Sister Qin Yu.

324
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,180
I'll buy your dinner some other day.

325
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,280
Okay. Bye bye.

326
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:07,960
 I've asked around. 

327
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,421
 The project manager is my former colleague, Qin Yu. 

328
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,041
 Don't worry. 

329
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,160
Understood. Thank you.

330
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,440
   

331
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,880
 Since when did you become so disgusting? 

332
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,020
You threaten me with Deng Yu Lin's custody in order to sell your stock equity.

333
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,480
Business is business.

334
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,020
Don't you think you're pathetic?

335
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,480
Don't yell at me.

336
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,220
Director Song, Director Deng.

337
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,120
A Hetai Securities guest is here.

338
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,880
Director Qin, nice to meet you.

339
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,660
Director Deng.

340
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,960
- Your reputation precedes you. 
 - You flatter me.

341
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,360
For our small company, the equity transfer

342
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,480
can complete simply following the process.

343
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,640
Why would a big shot like Director Qin handle it?

344
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,300
We are a small company

345
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,200
so I have to do it myself.

346
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,820
Director Qin, you're too humble.

347
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,440
Hetai Securities is one of the top companies.

348
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,520
Director Qin, I anticipate working with you in the future.

349
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,440
Likewise.

350
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,740
I must be crazy... crazy!

351
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,260
I was so embarrassed. Can you believe it?

352
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,980
While I quarreled with Deng Bo Ting, Qin Chang suddenly entered.

353
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,000
I even made eye contact with him.

354
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,480
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

355
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I was going to collapse.

356
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,680
Thanks to your false information,

357
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,560
I ended up mortified in front of him.

358
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,540
I told him I had a harmonious family, but then?

359
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,320
I was proven wrong shortly.

360
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,060
Can you even blame me for this?

361
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,920
Who else is to blame then?

362
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,480
Wait. Who knows that Qin Chang

363
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,960
would personally handle a tiny project?

364
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Is it possible he came

365
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,200
to cheer you up after hearing that Deng Bo Ting bullied you?

366
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,660
He came to cheer me up?

367
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,880
It would be nice if he didnâ€™t come to gloat.

368
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,040
If Iâ€™d known you werenâ€™t on Training Box,

369
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,560
Iâ€™d have asked you to help.

370
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,160
So I wouldnâ€™t be ashamed in front of him.

371
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,720
I won't do it. Deng Bo Ting won't trust me.

372
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,480
- Why not? 
 - How can he trust me as your best friend?

373
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
What's wrong with that?

374
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,680
As long as it is not Qin Chang, anyone will do.

375
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,240
For real?

376
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,220
Of course.

377
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,440
Ever since you sat down here, your mind was filled with Qin Chang.

378
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,140
No, I just think he and I...

379
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,680
It's fine.

380
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,040
See it like this, it might be shameful for him to see you two fight,

381
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,440
but at least Deng Bo Ting can't bribe him, right?

382
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,600
You might be right.

383
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,380
- It makes sense, right? 
 - It makes sense.

384
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,800
I'll stay with you for the handicraft class,

385
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,200
then let's go shopping, all right?

386
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,340
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

387
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,900
Feng Sheng?

388
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,180
Tong Tong. Ming Mei.

389
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,940
- You are also here. 
 - What a coincidence!

390
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,312
So this is...

391
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:51,640
Let me introduce you.

392
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,200
This is my fiancÃ©e, Yu Shang Na.

393
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,300
They are my college classmates.

394
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,920
This is Ding Zhi Tong. You met her before.

395
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,640
- This is Song Ming Mei. 
 - Hello.

396
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
- Hello. 
 - Now that we met,

397
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,560
why not sit and eat together?

398
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,260
It's rare for me to have a day off.

399
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,500
I want to keep her company.

400
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,999
Maybe next time.

401
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,580
- Fine. 
 - Let's meet up next time.

402
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,060
- Okay... next time. 
 - Next time.

403
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,160
- Okay. 
 - Enjoy yourselves. Bye.

404
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,800
Bye bye.

405
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,000
I know a good cafe nearby as well.

406
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,660
Can you believe after six years,

407
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,460
Feng Sheng became the happiest of us three?

408
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,920
You're not bad yourself.

409
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,880
You achieved financial freedom and have such a cute daughter.

410
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,040
You are quite right.

411
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,760
Let's eat.

412
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,420
I'll tell you something.

413
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,860
I'll return to Hong Kong.

414
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,100
So soon?

415
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,780
I've almost finished my work. It's time to go back.

416
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,020
What about your apartment?

417
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,020
I'll leave it for now and handle it in the future.

418
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,420
   

419
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,120
 I finally realized I should stand up bravely and tell the truth. 

420
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,840
 Then I wouldn't let down netizens who care about me. 

421
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,700
 I actually got injured wearing LT running shoes during the game. 

422
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,340
 I hope LT executives can be responsible to consumers. 

423
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,340
This video went viral on Internet.

424
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,300
What's wrong with Wu Xun?

425
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,440
He has gone hiding again.

426
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Shuchi must be behind the lies.

427
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,120
Shuchi must have bribed Wu Xun.

428
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,420
But do we have evidence?

429
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,740
But that's the fact.

430
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,420
Facts are not enough. We need proof!

431
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,300
Guys, calm down.

432
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,580
This isnâ€™t the time for internal strife.

433
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,720
Chen Xi, go to the PR Department,

434
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,760
and find how things have developed and their solution.

435
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,060
- Okay. 
 - Wang Yi.

436
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,200
I know.

437
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,660
I'll inform everyone of a meeting now.

438
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:07,580
 Latest news. 

439
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,740
 Scandals related to LT Group have started again. 

440
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,320
 The famous marathon runner, Wu Xun, 

441
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,160
 who previously issued an apology, 

442
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,960
 released a new statement  

443
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,780
 claiming LT executives pressured him 

444
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,480
 to make a fake clarification. 

445
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,800
 This incident embroiled LT Group in public controversy. 

446
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,760
 Next, let's watch this video. 

447
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,060
 Hello, everyone. 

448
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,600
 I'm Wu Xun, the runner who previously sprained my ankle during the marathon. 

449
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,080
 The clarification I issued earlier was neither my own intention 

450
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,720
 nor based on objective facts. 

451
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,180
   

452
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,750
   

453
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,510
   

454
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,460
Hi, Jia Xin.

455
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,940
 Sister Tong, I heard you're leaving for Hong Kong today. 

456
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

457
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,180
I would take you to the airport.

458
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,520
You focus on the due diligence.

459
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,180
Is everything going well?

460
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,680
LT's incident won't interrupt it, will it?

461
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,240
The due diligence of Training Box was suspended.

462
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,640
- Is it that serious? 
 - Yes.

463
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,260
Large amounts of LT merchandise were returned.

464
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,320
Many influencers and streamers

465
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,140
ruin LT's shoes in their live streams to attract attention.

466
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,320
Public uproar isn't dying down.

467
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,800
I saw CEO Gan in the elevator this morning.

468
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,420
He seemed so anxious.

469
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,760
It seems this matter is really tricky.

470
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,680
 I wonder if this project can go on. 

471
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,980
What is Director Zhang's opinion?

472
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,100
Director Zhang asked us to wait and see.

473
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,460
If LT fails to handle this incident,

474
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,500
the project may really end.

475
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,780
 Sister Tong, think of it. 

476
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,940
 We've worked hard on this project for so long. 

477
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,760
Yet it ended up like this.

478
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,120
Stay strong.

479
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,400
Gan Yang will figure out a solution.

480
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,920
 I hope so. 

481
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,160
I must go. Talk to you later.

482
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,840
Sir, I won't go to the airport.

483
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,240
 - Great! 
 - Great! 

484
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,620
 It sounds amazing! 

485
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,140
 Good. 

486
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,760
- Hello. 
 - Hello, what can I do for you?

487
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,900
I'd like to ask you a question.

488
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,820
Days ago, I lost an earring here.

489
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,180
Have you found it?

490
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,000
Isn't that Ding Zhi Tong? Do you want to say hello?

491
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,660
Do you recall when it was lost?

492
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,600
About last week.

493
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,180
Iâ€™m afraid not. Weâ€™ve done a thorough clean up and found no earrings.

494
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm sure I lost it around here.

495
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,300
Could you check the surveillance footage?

496
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,020
Sorry, Miss. We can't do it without permission.

497
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,180
It's very expensive.

498
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,660
Please help me.

499
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,700
How about this, Miss? You can go to the second floor to see our manager.

500
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,320
He will help you.

501
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,980
Thank you.

502
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,980
It's here.

503
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,500
Wait, please wind it back.

504
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,900
Just a little more.

505
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,100
Stop. Zoom in...

506
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,160
Miss, you are not in the footage at all.

507
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,020
Are you here to catch the cheaters?

508
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,940
You should leave now. You can't check surveillance for no reason.

509
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,420
My stuff was lost here.

510
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,740
- Please zoom in. 
 - We have regulations. We can't do it.

511
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,780
- Nonsense. 
 - Please leave.

512
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,100
What are you doing?

513
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,260
Do you know this lady is Chairman Wang's friend?

514
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,300
Chairman Wang is our major shareholder.

515
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,020
Do whatever you are asked to do!

516
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,260
Sorry, Miss.

517
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,920
You can check it any way you want.

518
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,180
We will do our best to assist you.

519
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,000
Thank you.

520
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,260
Just this frame.

521
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,580
Zoom in a bit, thanks.

522
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,180
Yes...

523
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:17,360
   

524
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,440
What's going on?

525
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,720
What's wrong?

526
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,300
I received a surveillance video of a bar in my mailbox.

527
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,200
Who sent it?

528
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,180
An unknown account.

529
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:33,264
Who could it be?

530
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,660
Look.

531
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,400
 What's wrong, Wu Xun? 

532
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,500
- Are you all right? 
 - Are you okay?

533
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,460
Great, LT will survive.

534
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,780
Who is helping us?

535
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,180
Not only did they go to the bar Wu Xun frequents,

536
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,780
they also obtained the surveillance footage.

537
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,540
Now Wu Xun canâ€™t deny it anymore.

538
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,860
 Hurry and call an ambulance. 

539
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,940
Send me the video quickly.

540
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,300
I'll post it online and let everyone see the truth.

541
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,140
No need to rush.

542
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,740
Shuchi won't be exposed that way.

543
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,820
What's your idea then?

544
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,960
What are you doing?

545
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Waiting for Wu Xun to take the bait.

546
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,830
   

547
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,600
Hello?

548
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,420
Wu Xun.

549
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:58,272
Director Zhan.

550
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,600
What's the matter?

551
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,060
I told you. Donâ€™t contact me unless itâ€™s necessary.

552
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,860
It's an emergency. Gan Yang found out I was injured in a bar.

553
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,300
He has a video now.

554
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,820
What are you afraid of?

555
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,700
Just deny it

556
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,820
and say LT maliciously edited the video.

557
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,980
Just blame it all on LT.

558
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,580
Now LT has lost all credibility.

559
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,920
Nobody would trust them.

560
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,460
Gan Yang is smart.

561
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,260
He will surely send the video for authentication.

562
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,700
That's your business.

563
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,060
What does it have to do with me?

564
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,980
Fine, but don't forget

565
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,880
you told me to use your cash to frame Gan Yang.

566
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,940
Can you get away if something happens to me?

567
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,340
Is there any evidence?

568
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,060
Is there any transfer record?

569
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,800
Or do you have a surveillance video like Gan Yang?

570
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,940
You have none, I guess.

571
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,440
Then just shut up.

572
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,400
Or I'll sue you for slander!

573
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,660
Director Zhan, it's indeed clever of you.

574
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,160
Why are you here?

575
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,520
You two are on the same side, aren't you?

576
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,500
Did he ask you to lure me here?

577
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,940
It turns out you and Shuchi

578
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,180
have schemed behind the scenes.

579
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,740
I don't know what you mean.

580
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,300
You just won't admit it, right?

581
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,600
Fine.

582
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,260
Anyway, I have just recorded your conversation.

583
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,980
You can check this out.

584
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,220
 Fine, but don't forget 

585
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,100
 you told me to use your cash to frame Gan Yang. 

586
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,980
 Can you get away if something happens to me? 

587
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,420
Sir, how much longer to the airport?

588
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,260
Half an hour.

589
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,620
You guessed it right.

590
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,620
The surveillance video was indeed sent by Ding Zhi Tong.

591
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,520
 The IP address traces back to your neighborhood. 

592
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,700
So it's really her.

593
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,600
 It seems she still cares about you. 

594
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,980
I just met Li Jia Xin.

595
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,460
She said Ding Zhi Tong flies to Hong Kong later today.

596
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,100
 I'll send you her flight information. 

597
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,800
 At least you should thank her in person.

This is my girlfriend.

627
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,280
Ding Zhi Tong and I never got married.

628
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,680
We have never been together.

629
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,020
I'm sorry.

630
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,500
When you came to Hong Kong, I lied to you.

Are you all right?
