If you don’t believe me,

115
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
you can check the video camera of the club

116
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,720
or the chat records on her phone

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,920

find a more suitable manager for you.

00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,160

You recorded our talk.

132
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
Think. If our boss knows,

133
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,440
he’ll…

134
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,480
What will he do?

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
You betrayed me.

You devious woman!

138
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,280
Give me the phone!

139
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
I can give it to you.

140
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,120
I still have a lot of copies.

141
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,560
Zhou Yao, you say I’m devious.

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,110
What about you?

143
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
In order to achieve your goal,

144
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
you did many devious things.

145
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
You wanted to be the endorser for HA

146
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,400
and you know Rich

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,560
likes affectionate people

148
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,370
so you pretended to be affectionate.

149
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
Your fans scolded Cheng Feng online.

150
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,160
Later you

151
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
pretended to be nice.

152
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,400
Knowing that without Cheng Feng’s choreography,

153
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,920
you’re nothing.

154
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,040
So you managed to trap her.

155
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,450
The sale of the house

156
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,280
and what happened to Lian Ruoshen,

157
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,480
they’re related to you.

158
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
Now you want to say you’re innocent.

159
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,720
Don’t you think it’s too late?

160
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
I was so stupid before

161
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,680
that I thought even if you’re selfish,

162
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
you still have a conscience.

163
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,360
I thought as long as I treat you well,

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,080
you’ll be grateful to me one day.

165
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,600
Now I think

166
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
I overestimated you.

167
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,160
You know what it is, right?

168
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,720
What you said just now

169
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,160
has already been spread.

170
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,480
The whole world knows about you!

171
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,690
Don’t you dare touch me again.

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600

173
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,400
If it has been publicized,

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,360
it’ll be interesting.

175
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,680
It’s shocking.

176
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
Now Zhou Yao can’t deny the claim.

177
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,210
He’d better not deny it

178
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,440
because no one will believe him.

179
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,560

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,440

181
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,360
You’re shameless!

182
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,330
You slept with me and took a video.

183
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,200
Send the video to me!

184
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,050
He’s a monster.

185
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,680
He took advantage of his prestige

186

Why are you here?

263
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,770
I’m here to see you.

264
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,650
So what did you find?

265
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,930
Did I change?

266
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,450
No.

267
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,240
You’re still like before.

268
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,760
You’re still quiet and cute.

269
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,810
But you changed.

270
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,530
The black hair is suitable for you.

271
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,400
It makes you look more reliable.

272
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,210
However, I prefer what you looked like before.

273
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,530
You were more energetic.

274
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,849
Yun, you were my faith before.

275
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,640
What about now?

276
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,530
You’re still my faith,

277
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,170
but I have to keep it secret.

278
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,810
Before, I often made you angry

279
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,280
and teased you.

280
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,040
The way you look

281
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,690
when you got angry was funny

282
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,730
and cute.

283
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,850
Later,

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,810
I didn’t want to

285
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,170
be a loser anymore,

286
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,050
so I hoped that I could

287
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,450
become a famous singer

288
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,480
and prove myself to you.

289
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,730
However, I didn’t realize

290
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,170
that I already fell in love

291
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,250
with you at that time.

292
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,090
Now I realized that,

293
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,290
but it seems to be too late.

294
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,930
We can’t go back, can we?

295
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,810

297
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,770
I lost. I lost everything

298
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,250
and I even missed you.

299
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,890
Yun, have you hung all the clothes?

300
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,170

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,890
Do you think of me as your husband?

374
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,540
No, you don’t.

375
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,530
You’re proud and stubborn.

376
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,730
You’re a control freak.

377
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,700
You’re a nut and psychopath!

378
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,500
Why don’t you get a divorce?

379
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,130
I won’t divorce him!

380
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:05,740
I can’t let him

381
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,010
spend the money I made

382
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,820
on that bitch!

383
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,020
Chen Huiyun,

384
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,970
mind your tongue.

385
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,810
Don’t forget that

386
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,180
I’m the CEO of our company.

387
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,300
Don’t piss me off,

388
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,170
or I’ll give you nothing!

389
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,700
You bastard!

390
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,050
Wanna slap me?

391
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,810
Don’t you dare touch her.

392
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,330
If you touch her,

393
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,730
I’ll ruin the life of you

394
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,650
and your mistress!

395
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,210
You!

396
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,370
Psychopath.

397
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,730
Both of you are psychopaths!

398
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,850
Did you ask me to come back

399
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,250
for this?

400
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,850
If I agreed to get a divorce just now,

401
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,810
everything you have

402
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,130
will be taken away by her son.

403
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,330
I tried my best to protect you,

404
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,490
but you never cared.

405
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,930
You’re completely obsessed with that girl.

406
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,100
She’s nothing.

407
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,270
She’s just a slut.

408
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,370
Is it worth it?

409
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,330
The life of those men whose family name is Jiang

410
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,170
will all be ruined

411
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,140
by dancers, right?

412
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,660
Don’t compare her with Cheng Feng!

413
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,500
Your failed marriage

414
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,090
has nothing to do with others.

415
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,820
On one hand,

416
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,340
you want to be a smart and graceful lady.

417
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,220
On the other hand,

418
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,890
you always taunt me.

419
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,210
Don’t you feel tired?

420
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,020
I do feel tired. If it’s not for you,

421
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,330
my life will not change.

422
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,250
Because of you,

423
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,850
everything I have

424
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,900
was taken away by Jiang Yi.

425
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,410
Because of you,

426
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,860
I can’t just get a divorce.

427
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,650
How dare you criticize me!

428
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,290
How dare you!

429
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,220
Listen,

if I could predict my future,

431
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,180
I wouldn’t give birth to you.

432
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,740
If I could predict my future,

433
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,020

You don’t want me to touch you.

I protected you

483
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,660
but you think it’s needless.

484
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,540
Yes, it’s my own wishful thinking.

485
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,180
My own wishful thinking.

486
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
I shouldn’t be there.

487
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,220

00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,140

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,460
you won’t leave me.

494
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,020
So I don’t want to take my medications anymore.

495
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,930
If I’m sick,

496
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,580
you won’t leave me.

But… But now I… I…

498
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,580
I don’t take my medications,

499
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,020
but you still want to leave me.

500
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,340
All of you want to leave me.

501
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,690
You didn’t take your medications?

502
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,980
Where are they?

503
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,580
I threw them away.

504
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,930
When did you do it?

505
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,140
Do you still care about me?

506
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,380
You hate me.

507
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,500
You’re going to break up with me.

508
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,900
What I did has nothing to do with you.

509
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,180
You’re going to give up on me.

510
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,140
When did I say I want to give up on you?

511
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,740
Dian, it’s you. You’re giving up on yourself.

512
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,340
Do you know that I’ve been trying

513
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,180
to help you and become better with you?

514
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,100
What about you?

515
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,380
You threw your medications away secretly.

516
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,730
Do you know what you did?

517
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,060
Did you ever think about me?

518
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,810
Jiang Dian,

519
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,500
why didn’t I tell you?

520
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,630
You’re horrible when out of control.

521
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,820
Don’t you know that?

522
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,420
Jiang Dian, I’m not a god. I’m a human being.

523
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,740
I can go to the hospital with you,

524
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,940
but I’m not your cure.

525
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,990
The reason why I didn’t tell you

526
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
is that I love you.

527
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,020
Now I still want to love you.

528
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,420
But Jiang Dian,

529
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,150
do you think we can still be together?

530
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,180
Yes, we can.

531
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,110
We definitely can.

532
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,860
Cheng, please stay here. Please don’t leave me.

533
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,940
I won’t be mad anymore.

534
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,460
Please don’t leave me, Cheng.

535
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,100
You… You’re giving up on me.

536
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,510
Now you’re afraid of me.

537
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:05,990
Dian. Bie. I’m going to leave here.

538
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,260
Where will you go?

539
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,910
I haven’t made up my mind. Maybe Africa.

540
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,550
What? Are you going to dig gold?

541
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,900
Can you take me?

542
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,220
You won’t feel lonely on the way.

543
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,790
You always want to get involved.

544
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,940
I can’t take you this time.

545
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,140
I want to leave on my own.

546
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,950
Can you stay here?

547
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,670
Even you will leave me.

548
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,220
No kidding, Dian.

549
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,700
You still have Cheng.

550
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,260
You won’t leave.

551
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,900
Unlike me. I’m single.

552
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,350
Wherever I go, I won’t miss anyone

553
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,300
and no one will miss me.

554
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,140
How dare you say that.

555
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,460
We’re gonna miss you

556
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,220
but you won’t miss us.

557
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,469
What about Baoling?

558
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,820
How to deal with her?

559
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,020
What can I do?

560
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,540
I can’t give her what she wants.

561
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
If I stay with her,

562
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,500
I’ll be a burden on her.

563
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,580
That’s not what I mean.

564
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,020
I mean,

565
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,139
will you say goodbye to her?

566
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,980
I feel ashamed,

567
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,060
so I won’t meet her.

568
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,500
I don’t want us to be sad.

569
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,150
Dian, live a happy life with Cheng.

570
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,060
Help us enjoy the life

571
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,790
we missed. Then I’ll feel like

572
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,820
my terrible youth

573
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,900
is kind of worth to be remembered.

574
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,550
Let’s toast our passing youth.

575
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,630
Cheers.

576
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,830
Let’s go get hammered tonight.

577
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,950
♫ When I have wings ♫

578
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,230
♫ I can fly to a bigger world ♫

579
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,670
♫ I change ♫

580
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,230
♫ in the last second ♫

581
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,190
Your music is lousy!

582
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,300
Let’s toast our youth.

583
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,820
Cheers!

584
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,020
♫ I change ♫

585
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,150
♫ in the last second ♫

586
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,870
♫ Breaking the cocoon into a butterfly ♫

587
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,500
Why are you crying?

588
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,940
♫ I may feel lonely in youth ♫

589
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,860
♫ I can be brave when I’m with you ♫

590
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,140
♫ Time has taught us ♫

591
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:17,650
♫ to be grateful for having each other ♫

592
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,410
♫ I laugh and cry because of you ♫

593
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,940
♫ I spent all the best time with you ♫

594
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,280
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫

595
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:43,850
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫

596
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,030
None of your business.

597
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,030
Get out, all of you!

598
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,420
Get out!

599
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,500
What are you doing?

600
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,190
What are you doing?

601
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,750
Get out!

602
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,750
What are you doing?

603
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,310
Let’s go upstairs.

604
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,510
Cheng!

605
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,230
Cheng!

606
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,230
Cheng!

607
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,350
Cheng!

608
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,390
Break it!

609
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,550
Jiang Dian, come here as soon as possible.

610
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,780
Someone’s destroying our cafe.

611
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,350
Cheng, should I call the police?

612
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,180
She’s Jiang Dian’s mother.

613
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,310
I’ll close the store today.

614
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,100
You can go back now.

615
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,740
We’ll stay with you.
