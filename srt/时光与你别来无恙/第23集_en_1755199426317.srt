Episode 23

00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,560
Get up, come on.

6
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,930
Get up!

7
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,870
Last time for the question,

8
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,150
Will you leave my son?

9
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,430
Stop destroying.

10
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,550
Stop destroying.

11
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,870
Stop it!

12
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,790
Stop it!

13
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,350
Stop destroying.

14
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,190
Stop it.

15
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,950
Are you okay?

16
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,110
You are here.

17
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,950
Have you reported to the police?

18
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,150
How could I call the police?

19
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,670
Should I send your mom

20
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,670
to the police office in person?

21
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,590
I will explain to you later.

22
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,670
President Chen, you don't look good.

23
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,510
How about sending you to the hospital?

24
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,190
Is anything new from Director Zhao?

25
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,670
Not yet, but I'll follow up as soon as possible

26
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,470
You've worked with me for years,

27
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,260
and witness my whole process.

28
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,630
Do you think it is very ironic?

29
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,710
I've tried so hard to get success,

30
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,870
but finally, I gain nothing.

31
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,900
What did I do wrong?

32
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,310
Why did you do that?

33
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,070
You could come to me if you had anything unsatisfactory,

34
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,190
but why did you bother Cheng Feng?

35
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,150
Why?

36
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,310
Just for you, Jiang Dian.

37
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,430
You turned blind eye to me when I talked with you with the manner.

38
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,150
Didn't I give you a chance?

39
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,510
All of these

40
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,790
were forced by you.

41
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,540
Forced by me?

42
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,230
It should be you, mom!

43
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,630
Why do you

44
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,670
interfere with my life

45
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,700
again and again?

46
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,590
I just want to

47
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,190
have a simple life, couldnâ€™t I?

48
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,030
Since my childhood,

49
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,030
you have

50
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,070
denied everything I like.

51
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,950
Why! I am your son!

52
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,230
I am your son!

53
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,550
Have you ever considered me?

54
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,710
I am really tired, mom!

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,110
So I don't want to argue with you anymore.

56
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,420
All I want is to stay with

57
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,550
Cheng Feng easily and happily.

58
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,380
Please,

59
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,220
Please let me off.

60
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,030
Let you off? So who would let me off?

61
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,950
Jiang Group was founded by myself,

62
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,830
I've paid a lot for the group.

63
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,510
But now the unfaithful bastard

64
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,470
is trying to take it.

65
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,710
So, the successor

66
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,430
may be the son of that woman!

67
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,270
Who has ever cared about me?

68
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,030
I also want to have a simple life

69
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,950
and a happy family.

70
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,860
There is nothing in the world

71
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,310
that you can get as you wish.

72
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,310
I don't want to push you, son.

73
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,230
Come back and have a study in Business School

74
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,710
to take my Jiang Group back.

75
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,190
This is my painstaking effort.

76
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,310
-This is also your future. -Enough. It's enough.

77
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,870
Why are you always

78
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,070
talking about your painstaking effort?

79
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,230
I am not the tool for your revenge.

80
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,830
I don't want to be involved in your fighting.

81
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,350
All I want is my own life,

82
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,430
can't I?

83
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,190
No, you can't as

84
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,350
long as you are my son!

85
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,590
What if not?

86
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,190
Stand up, Jiang Dian,

87
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,550
Mom.

88
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,430
Stand up!

89
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,590
So sorry.

90
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,630
Thank you for bringing me up.

91
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,310
You stand up now!

92
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,909
Stand up! Am I not clear? Am I?

93
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,710
From now on,

94
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,230
I'm no longer your son.

95
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,710
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

96
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,870
Did you eat yet?

97
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,220
No. I want to eat with you.

98
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,270
Stop drinking, what do you want to have?

99
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,870
I cook for you.

100
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,340
Jiang Dian.

101
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,510
Why can't you get through?

102
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,710
President Chen had a car accident.

103
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,710
You hurry to have a look.

104
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,790
I go with you.

105
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,950
[Emergency Room]

106
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,270
To be honest, Dian,

107
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,590
I should not

108
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,830
bother your household

109
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,910
matters as an outsider.

110
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,580
However, it's been so many years,

111
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,190
I have been looking at you and your mom,

112
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,150
so I think I should

113
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,230
tell you something.

114
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,190
You and your father always blame her

115
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,350
for being too dominant and assertive.

116
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,950
You thought she was neither

117
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,990
a good wife nor a good mother.

118
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,420
But you two have never

119
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,420
thought why did she

120
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,230
become what she is today.

121
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,790
A girl who had grown up with numerous

122
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,460
caring and love was so proud and tough.

123
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,100
And she fell in love with an ordinary office boy

124
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,550
at the age of her best youth.

125
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,430
She even turned against

126
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,310
her family for him

127
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,580
to start from scratch with him.

128
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,470
Finally, the company came to the normal development,

129
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,590
however, at that moment,

130
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,070
she found she was pregnant.

131
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,670
An able woman could give

132
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,430
up her business to deliver a baby.

133
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,460
What would it be if

134
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,900
she did not do it for love?

135
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,550
She had been a soft and tender woman,

136
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,870
and she once thought that

137
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,070
your dad persuaded her to deliver

138
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,750
a baby for loving her and the family.

139
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,110
However, it was unexpected that

140
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,070
she found there was no place

141
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,350
for her when she came back

142
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,310
to the company again after

143
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,470
delivering a baby.

144
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,990
And your dad did not

145
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,260
come home all day.

146
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,310
He was getting colder and colder to her,

147
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,780
so she turned to be more

148
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,830
sensitive when she suffered

149
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,350
from postpartum depression.

150
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,710
Her temper and character

151
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,790
were changed a lot.

152
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,590
The current anxiety disorder is

153
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,020
the consequence left at that time.

154
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,190
Do you know why did she not

155
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,270
stay at home frequently since then?

156
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,230
It was not because she did not love you.

157
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,990
Oppositely, she did not want

158
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,710
to vent the negative emotion

159
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,270
on you when seeing you.

160
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,270
But, she would not abandon you

161
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,870
when something happened to you.

162
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,150
In my memory, you got a fever

163
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,260
and made a call for her.

164
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,260
We were talking about an

165
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,430
important contract and we had

166
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,670
made an appointment to

167
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,100
see the counterpart,

168
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,230
but she still gave up

169
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,110
the business for you

170
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,470
and hurried home.

171
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,140
Dian.

172
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,670
Dian.

173
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,550
She sat beside you

174
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,790
for the whole night.

175
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,190
The next day,

176
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,310
she fired the babysitter directly.

177
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,470
She asked me to spend a lot of money

178
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,390
to find a more reliable person to look after you.

179
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,990
President Chen, you haven't had a meal yet.

180
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,830
How about?

181
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,630
No. thanks. You should go back.

182
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,110
And at her birthday,

183
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,660
she had begged your dad humbly,

184
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,030
but he still hid away from her.

185
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,870
She has worked hard for this family,

186
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,950
but she was defeated

187
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,150
by more and more cruel realities.

188
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,870
So she wanted to fly back to

189
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,150
celebrate her birthday with you.

190
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,620
However, you also did

191
