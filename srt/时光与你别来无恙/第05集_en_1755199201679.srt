Whether getting a cold

186
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,790
or a fever, he takes them by himself.

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,950

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,070
you had a thing for him?

195
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,150
Nonsense.

196
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,270
He’s just my student.

197
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,350
I’m talking about

198
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,630
Jiang Dian.

199
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,790
Don’t turn this back on me.

200
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,460
So why are you shy?

201
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,790
I’m so curious

202
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,550
about this Lian Ruoshen

203
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,150
whom Yunyun mentions

204
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,190
all the time.

205
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,750
Whatever.

206
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,030
It’s alcohol that makes my skin turn red.

207
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,310
I’m not shy.

208
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,950
Chengcheng, look at her, she fools me again.

209
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,110
Miss, here you are.

210
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,270
Wait.

211
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,470
Why is it with lemon not olive?

212
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,910
Martini with lemon

213
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,870
tastes better.

214
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,230
In fact, martini with lemon

215
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,990
and sea salt tastes better.

216
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,670
Really?

217
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,550
Miss, so…

218
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,670
Do as I say.

219
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,830
I want an olive instead of the lemon.

220
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:38,830
OK.

221
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,070
It seems the martini

222
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,020
has stories.

223
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,510
What story?

224
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,670
Chengcheng, sympathy is not love.

225
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,070
As we are adults,

226
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,790
you should think about

227
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,830
something.

228
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,390
Who told me

229
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,150
we should enjoy our youth while we can?

230
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,750
But do you enjoy that?

231
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,260
If it is,

232
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,630
you won’t be distracted.

233
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,630
That’s all I’m gonna say.

234
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,590
You think about it.

235
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,180
Why did you do these for me?

236
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,619
[Linxi University]

237
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,190
Here. Come on. Come on.

238
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,910
Why isn’t Yun answering the phone?

239
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,670
They’re all plain.

240
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,900
This one looks like cave people.

241
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,030
He’s suitable to be a comedian.

242
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,190
It’s so difficult

243
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,030
to find a handsome guy.

244
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,310
Play or not?

245
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,870
Anyway I don’t play as well as you.

246
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,550
Boss, I’m gonna buy a Coke.

247
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,750
Thanks.

248
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,910
Good.

249
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,390
What?

250
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,430
Miss,

251
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,590
why do you keep staring at me?

252
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,470
Are you polite?

253
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,310
Besides,

254
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,750
don’t be so narcissistic, buddy.

255
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,870
Play your basketball.

256
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,990
I’m too busy.

257
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,110
What are you talking about?

258
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,790
Forget to tell you,

259
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,150
I know Kungfu.

260
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,710
So, stay out of my way.

261
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,870
Or I’ll clean your damn clock.

262
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,030
Next time

263
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,350
I must beat…

264
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,630
you…

265
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,030
I’m busy now. I’ll call you later.

266
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,070
Hey,

267
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,670
where’s your

268
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,750
practice room?

269
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,550
There. You have to take a detour.

270
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,550
I’ll take you there.

271
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,060
Thank you.

272
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,070
Do you know

273
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,030
it’s time to practice?

274
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,830
I know.

275
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,350
There’s about 10 minutes.

276
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,590
What are you doing?

277
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,550
You can’t be

278
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,340
feeling embarrassed

279
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,510
to see my sister

280
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,710
due to the quarrel last night.

281
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,430
Am I embarrassed?

282
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,910
She’s the one who should be.

283
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,590
I was just mad

284
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,470
for Dian.

285
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,390
What for?

286
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,950
He’s willing

287
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,950
to do something for her.

288
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,110
So she has to accept that,

289
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,990
no refusing?

290
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,950
Love is two-sided.

291
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,140
One-sided action

292
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,710
is just a kind of burden and moral kidnapping.

293
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,470
What…what did you say?

294
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,910
You mean

295
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,350
it’s all Dian’s fault?

296
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,870
Right?

297
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,310
Right.

298
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,950
Aren’t you mad out of guilt?

299
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,870
What…what are you doing?

300
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,190
I tell you,

301
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,030
even if you beat me, I…

302
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,670
Bie, you’re so clever.

303
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,430
Come on, tell me.

304
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,470
We should find a way

305
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,980
to help Dian.

306
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,950
If he keeps his one-sided love,

307
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,230
I will barely stand it.

308
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:21,900
Come on.

309
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,910
There are indeed

310
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,630
some ways

311
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,790
which are effective.

312
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,180
My sister

313
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,310
seems to be indifferent.

314
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,670
But she may spark with him

315
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,550
actually.

316
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,310
We just have to take actions to gain her trust.

317
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,340
I believe

318
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,470
it will make difference.

319
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,590
Genius!

320
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,140
Why didn’t you say that?

321
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,670
Dian suffered a lot.

322
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,230
As the saying goes, you kill a snake by cutting off the head.

323
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,470
Our actions should be taken

324
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,030
at the optimal time.

325
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,790
What time?

326
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,390
At first we should ensure that

327
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,470
she’s attracted by Dian.

328
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,630
Fool,

329
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,470
what you said

330
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,190
is nonsense.

331
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,150
She just didn’t

332
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,190
have any interest in Dian.

333
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,790
Are you sure?

334
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,430
After my vivid descriptions

335
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,270
yesterday,

336
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,430
I believe

337
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,420
she must have been

338
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,110
moved

339
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,750
and tempted.

340
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,110
What did you say?

341
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,030
Why didn’t you mention us?

342
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,150
Mention what?

343
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,150
Mention we were funny

344
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,870
and interrupted Jiang Dian’s work?

345
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,190
There are so many fish, Lian Ruoshen.

346
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,350
Come on. There are fish everywhere.

347
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,790
Where?

348
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,750
There. Over there.

349
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,590
Really?

350
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,470
Don’t.

351
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,150
There are fish. There are fish.

352
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,630
There are fish.

353
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,750
Dian. Dian.

354
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,830
Dian. Dian.

355
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,150
What are you doing!

356
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,510
Screw you. I was drenched!

357
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,990
Work harder!

358
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,430
Here you are, Dian.

359
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,990
Bie.

360
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,350
It seems that we did nothing.

361
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,300
Forget it.

362
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,070
As you said,

363
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,990
Dian

364
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,830
is gonna get her?

365
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,230
Happy now?

366
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,310
Can we start our practice?

367
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,550
I was planning to.

368
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,350
Chengcheng.

369
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,750
Have a cup of milk tea.

370
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,950
Thank you.

371
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,110
It’s you.

372
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,710
What are you doing?

373
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,150
Stay away from me.

374
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,670
Bro,

375
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,510
I’m sorry about earlier.

376
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,990
But

377
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,700
no hard feelings.

378
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,830
Drink a cup of milk tea.

379
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,660
Let’s just call it even.

380
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,620
I’m Dai Baoling.

381
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,790
You can call me Baoling.

382
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,590
Just a cup of milk tea?

383
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,790
That’s too good for you.

384
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,070
So what do you want?

385
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,790
How about a rematch

386
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,390
sometime?

387
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,870
I don’t beat women.

388
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,950
You win.

389
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,990
Chengcheng.

390
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,910
Is he Lian Ruoshen

391
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,710
whom Yun mentions all the time?

392
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,590
He’s like a monkey.

393
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,830
No wonder she has headaches every day.

394
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,150
Miss Goddess.

395
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,710
I’m sorry

396
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,740
about yesterday.

397
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,790
You’re a much bigger person.

398
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,790
Forgive me.

399
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,630
Don’t be angry with Dian.

400
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,710
I’m responsible for what I did.

401
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,980
You’re so great.

402
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,990
How is he?

403
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,640
It’s Phase two.

404
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,750
Time to change our strategy.

405
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,660
He’s miserable.

406
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,190
He’s totally

407
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,390
dying already.

408
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,950
He struggles with his last breath.

409
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,790
Ah, Dian,

410
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,870
no one worries about him,

411
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,870
and no one looks after him.

412
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,630
Well, then,

413
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,190
as his good friend,

414
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,870
don’t you look after him?

415
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,830
Miss, what’s wrong with you?

416
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,430
As he’s still sick,

417
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,110
have you no soul?

418
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,110
Dian, why did you come?

419
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,630
Doctor said

420
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,550
you had to take rest.

421
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,030
Chengcheng, I gotta go.

422
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,190
I just said you were weak.

423
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,870

That’s it for today. Thank you.

431
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,230
Who bullied you?

432
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,070
Tell me.

433
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,340
I’ll get revenge for you.

In what?

437
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,060
Listen to her.

438
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,230
I…

439
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,900
Calm down.

440
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,270
It’s about our show.

441
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,990
It will be cancelled.

442
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,950
Why? Why will it be cancelled?

443
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,310
The board of directors thought midterms were coming up.

444
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,150
But there were too many people who failed exams in our class.

445
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,150
So they decided to cancel our show,

446
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,510

447
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,270
What the hell…

448
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,910
Some students in other classes also failed exams.

449
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,550
I’ll talk to the Dean.

450
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,190
Don’t be

451
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,150
the belligerent one. OK?

452
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,830
I tried my best.

453
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,750
If we pass our midterms,

454
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,230
will we celebrate the anniversary?

455
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,910
Yes, at least in theory.

456
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,260
But there are only a few days left.

457
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,190
It couldn’t be.

458
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,350
Why are you talking to me?

459
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,270
Moreover,

460
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,270
it’s not difficult to study.

461
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,950
Whatever problem is, we can get through it.

462
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,430
It’s just study.

463
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,990

What if we succeed?

469
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,990
Uh, you know,

470
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,030
just by yourselves,

471
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,670
it’s a little bit hard

472
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,740
to get your grades back

473
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,110
in a few days.

474
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,830
About that,

475
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,870
I can help.

476
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,270
Yeah, we have Dian.

477
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,310
Difficulties all for naught.

Jiang Dian,

479
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,950
you’ve helped a lot.

480
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,870
As for the anniversary,

481
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,070
you didn’t mean to attend

482
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,070
but because we lack a cello accompaniment…

483
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,710
Forget it.

484
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,100
If Professor Chen knows

485
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,030
you spend all your time on the anniversary,

486
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,590
he will be disappointed.

487
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,630
That’s true. Dian, forget it.

488
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,670
You’d better give priority to your physics competition.

489
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,070
But we…

490
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,430
We have to hang in there.

491
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,470
As for my physics competition,

492
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,790
I had my own ideas.

493
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,630
Don’t worry.

494
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,110
One more thing.

495
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,030

What? Why?

498
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,110
Hell no. I have to talk to the Dean.

499
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,510
Who are you?

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,150

502
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,910
So what now?

503
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,110
We can’t give up.

504
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,590
I have no idea either.

505
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,030
I have a place for you to practice.

Look at you.

577
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,230
I easily got ninety points.

00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,110

not everyone possesses that.

580
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,150
Hell no. I got seventy-eight points.

581
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,830
I eighty-five.

582
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,270

these paid Internet trolls were reliable

How can I?

631
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,270
As you said,

I’ll be happy if I get it.

But it’s okay if I don’t get it.

but just let him know.

The reason why he chose Zhou Yao

652
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,510
is that Zhou’s your ex-boyfriend.

653
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,910
It’s all because of you.

654
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,150
He can give me this advantage

655
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,070
rather than Zhou.

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,990

I don’t like troubles.

As you don’t like troubles,

660
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,150

00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,540
no good.

769
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,270
Do you take?

770
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,710
Do you have to do it this way?

771
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,230
We should have a clean break

772
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,310
sooner or later.

773
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,430
As for what you said last time, does that count?
