you are a great help to me this time.

Thank you!

193
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,980
You just give me a bunch of flowers?

194
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,180
No.

195
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,980
When you start your dance studio,

196
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
we want to be shareholders.

197
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,140
We will be partners in the future.

198
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,420
Both Lian Ruoshen and I

199
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,630
value friendship.

200
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,180
We will never

Oh, speaking of which,

203
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,540
I have to praise him.

204
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,060
He hasn't got the money yet.

205
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,340
But he used his own money

206
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,470
to buy me a massage chair.

207
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,460
I've been in show business

208
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,100

209
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,620
I've cooperated with a lot of people.

Among these people,

211
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
he values friendship most.

212
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,540
I didn’t expect

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,740

Shall I put it in your room or other places?

217

A massage chair?

218
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,460
Send it back. There is no room for it.

219
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,060
Does he care about other people?

220
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,140
I think

221
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,870

[The 50th Anniversary of Linxi University]

224

Mr. Wang, I'll call you later.

225
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,420
At the anniversary of the university,

226
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,190
I looked back and saw him.

227
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,260
I was deeply attracted by his song.

228
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,030
Later on,

229
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,420
I found that he was full of sap.

230
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,340
He is very bold and he never bows to fate.

231
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,540
If he likes something,

232
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,700
he will hold on straight to the end.

233
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,820
I'm deeply moved.

234
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,740
If he likes something,
he will hold on straight to the end?

235
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,190
Don't you know whom he likes?

236
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,220
I don't care.

237
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,100
He can choose whom he likes.

238
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,420
But who I like is my thing.

239
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,290
Don't worry.

240
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,380
I won't bring trouble to anyone.

241
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,140
You can pretend

242
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,380
you don't know it.

243
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,420
Why do you look at me that way?

244
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,300
If you are concerned about me,

245
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,500
will you choreograph Lian Ruoshen's dances

246
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,620
for free in the future?

247
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,180
No.

248
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,220
I also need to provide for my boyfriend.

249

I mean it.

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,060
Previously I felt you were too young.

257
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,660
I thought you might be a drag on us.

258
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,740
After getting along with you for a period of time,

259
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,180
I found that you were very capable.

260
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,860
You convinced me.

Your requirement is so high.

DK's budget is tight.

265
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,260
She is still the most suitable.

266
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,290
She was just lucky.

267
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,810
If there was no video to make things clear

268
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,300

269
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,980
Lian Ruoshen was also involved.

270
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,460
I only value the result.

Now that she can help increase Lian Ruoshen's fame,

272
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,730
she can also be helpful to us.

377
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,210
Goodbye!

378
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,730
I have nothing

379
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,420
to say to you.

380
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,100
You can just go back.

381
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,130
Don't be an eyesore here.

382
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,180
Chengcheng,

383
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,460
I'm the only one

384
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,050
who can help you now.

385
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,930
Is it so difficult for you

386
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,660
to accept my help?

387
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,060
Don't go too far!

388
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,970
Can you help her?

389
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,330
Why are you so confident?

390
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,900
I only want to help you.

391
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,340
Stay away from me if you want to help me!

392
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,100
I don't want my boyfriend to be jealous.

393
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:14,930
All right.

394
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,740
If you need me,

395
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,650
you can call me.

396
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,770
You know that

397
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,220
I have never changed my number.

398
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,460
Is there anything else?

399
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,620
I thought you were smart.

400
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,450
You didn't find

401
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,450
a suitable boyfriend.

402
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,610
You chose him.

403
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,130
Dian,

404
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,690
maybe we need to

405
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,650
find a new home this time.

406
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
I will try to solve this.

407
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,250
Not you. We will do it together.

408
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,860
[Lian Ruoshen]

409
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,370
Dian,

410
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,570
please watch Entertainment Hot Events.

411
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,890
Give me some support.

412
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,210
Lian Ruoshen,

413
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,050
your new song has been available online for only 5 hours.

414
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,340
It has topped

415
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,690
the major billboards.

416
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,370
It is the hottest super topic.

417
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,490
Over 3 million people

418
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,740
followed you on Weibo overnight.

419
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,170
No one has become famous

420
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,530
so fast.

421
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,020
How do you look at the fact

422
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,900
that you suddenly became famous?

423
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,050
How do I look?

424
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,250
Well,

425
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,980
pretty good-looking...

426
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,530
They all say that

427
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,820
I'm another Eddie Peng.

428
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,700
But in fact,

429
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,460
I don't care very much

430
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,660
about appearance.

431
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,450
I care more about cultivation.

432
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,010
A man should be

433
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,530
regarded highly,

434
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,020
as a well-cultivated person.

435
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,730
Shenshen was answering the question in advance.

436
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,930
He has answered

437
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,770
our next question.

438
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,810
He is too nervous.

439
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,890
I'm good at answering questions in advance.

440
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,530
What was your last question?

441
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,980
Why do you think

442
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,210
you could become famous overnight?

443
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,330
Is there anything special about you?

444
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,570
Anything special?

445
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,530
I don't know whether this counts.

446
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,810
When I was a child,

447
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,610
Uncle Zhang in our village told my fortune.

448
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,970
He said I would depend on my voice in my life.

449
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,210
God has given me a nice voice.

450
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,090
Uncle Zhang will become famous.

451
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,660
He can't.

452
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,220
He was cremated several days ago.

453
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,730
Just now

454
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,650
I was joking. I wanted to make you laugh.

455
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,210
In fact, what I really want to say is that

456
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,050
no one can easily succeed.

457
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,530
There are several reasons for my achievement,

458
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,970
the support

459
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,130
of my fans, "sea cucumbers",

460
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,730
the help of my friends

461
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,010
and my own efforts.

462
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,410
In the future,

463
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,610
I will bring you

464
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,330
better music.

465
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,770
Is there anyone

466
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,010
to whom you are very grateful?

467
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,450
Yes.

468
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,860
My agent,

469
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,370
Baoling.

470
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,130
Without her,

471
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,450
I might

472
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,210
still be buried now.

473
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,810
I don't mean it.

474
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,490
I mean

475
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,850
she saw my shining points.

476
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,650
She is a talent scout.

477
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,460
I need to thank her for approving my talents.

478
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,530
I need to thank her

479
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:23,850
for cultivating me.

480
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,740
It's very lucky

481
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,290
to meet a talent scout

482
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,730
who can appreciate you.

483
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,930
I heard that she had not only

484
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,090
supervised the production of your MV herself,

485
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,970
but also invited

486
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,220
Cheng Feng, a leading dancer of modern dance
who is out of the entertainment circle,

487
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,450
to choregraph for you.

488
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,610
You are cooperating with another talented person.

489
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,740
Now let's

490
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,770
watch the MV

491
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,970
for Shenshen's new song.

492
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,730
There is something else I want to say.

493
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,290
I need to thank another person,

494
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,770
my good friend, Lu Bie.

495
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,250
He helped me a lot

496
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,330
when I was writing this song.

497
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,650
I want to thank him, too.

498
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,610
OK.

499
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,930
Now let's

500
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,330
watch the MV of your new song.

501
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,020
[Royal Entertainment]

502
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,850
Lian Ruoshen's dance

503
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,370
is matching his song.

504
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,730
It is filled with the vigor of youth.

505
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,050
It's a good display of his confidence.

506
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,410
This is what your performance lacks.

507
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,770
I've seen the dance for your new song.

508
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,140
The choreography is pretty ordinary.

509
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,930
It's emphasizing the format, but not the content.

510
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:17,650
It doesn't have a soul.

511
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,850
If you can't solve this problem,

512
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,530
we will postpone the time of releasing the song.

513
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,570
Sir,

514
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,450
Zhou Yao has prepared a year

515
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,730
for the new song.

516
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,610
The fans are also expecting it.

517
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,640
We have also announced the time to boost popularity.

518
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,050
If we postpone the time of releasing the song,

519
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,450
it will be very harmful to Zhou Yao.

520
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,650
If a singer

521
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,810
stops temporarily to release new songs

522
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,690
and keeps his fame by spreading news

523
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,730
and other methods,

524
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,490
it will

525
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,530
gradually lower the enthusiasm of the fans.

526
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,650
Now Lian Ruoshen is the man of the moment.

527
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,090
You don't need to compete with him.

528
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,970
It will be an internal competition in the company.

529
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,330
It's not an issue about internal competition.

530
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,770
-It's about...
-I think what our boss has said is right.

531
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,890
I'm also not satisfied

532
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,880
with the choreography.

533
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,850
After I saw the video

534
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,050
of Lian Ruoshen's dance,

535
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,130
I believe a good method

536
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,450
is to cooperate with Cheng Feng.

537
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,330
After all, Cheng Feng was famous

538
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,530
in the entertainment circle.

539
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,530
And she is indeed talented.

540
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,410
Lian Ruoshen's MV

541
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,130
has made her famous again.

542
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,330
Therefore,

543
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,650
if our company can have

544
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,210
an in-depth cooperation with Cheng Feng,

545
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,290
I think it will be a very good thing

546
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,410
for both the company and I.

547
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,520
I don't want to cooperate with her.

548
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,930
She is not the only one

549
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,770
who can choregraph.

550
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,970
Now that she refused me,

551
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,050
I don't believe I can't find

552
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,050
a choreographer who is more suitable.

553
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,570
Sir,

554
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,850
I don't think it was the right time

555
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,850
to talk to her last time.

556
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,210
I heard that

557
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,570
she did not have enough money

558
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,210
on hand recently.

559
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,370
If we ask her to cooperate with us now,

560
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,850
we will be providing timely help.

561
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,570
Why it must be her?

562
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,930
If you can find a better one,

563
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,210
I can accept it.

564
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,850
But you are clear

565
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,050
about the current situation.

566
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,490
To cooperate with Cheng Feng

567
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,530
is a win-win situation for us.

568
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,130
After all,

569
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,530
you don't want to postpone

570
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,930
the time of releasing my new song.

571
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,650
Hello,

572
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,770
Honey!

573
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,240
Are you going to give us

574
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,490
Zhou Yao's endorsement contract?

575
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,250
I'm sorry.

576
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,840
Lian Ruoshen will be the brand ambassador instead.

577
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,720
I can do nothing about it.

578
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,570
The boss's mother

579
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,530
likes Lian Ruoshen.

580
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,930
It doesn't matter.

581
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,730
I can understand.

582
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,810
I look forward to our future cooperation.

583
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,290
The man has a narrow vision!

584
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,770
I want to see whether
he can be famous in his entire life!

585
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,360
What's the matter?

586
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,530
Lian Ruoshen has replaced you

587
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,970
to be the brand ambassador.

588
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,130
Will I

589
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,360
become a has-been?

590
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:15,970
Don't worry.

591
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,640
I won't let that happen to you.

592
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,170
Don't push! Don't push!

593
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,640
In good order! In good order! Order!

594
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,250
You can take a photo with him and get an autograph.

595
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,400
Be patient! Be patient!

596
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,250
Be patient!

597
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,450
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

598
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,530
How much do you still need?

599
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,330
I have 800 thousand yuan.

600
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,000
Dian gave me a million.

601
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,490
I still need 1.2 million.

602
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,170
I have 300 thousand.

603
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,880
You seldom ask me to help you.

604
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,810
I must help you this time.

605
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,450
If I sell those stuff,

606
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,850
we might get

607
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,290
enough money.

608
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,730
I will sell

609
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,330
my car.

610
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,010
On the wall of my house,

611
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,290
there is a collection of bags.

612
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,370
I'll sell all of them.

613
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,720
Then we might have enough money.

614
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,090
From your expression,

615
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,610
I can see that

616
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,490
you really don't want to sell them.

617
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:37,960
It doesn't matter.

618
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,330
I will find a way myself.

619
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,920
Even if you sell another collection of bags,

620
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,850
you won't be able to get enough money.

621
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:47,610
Chengcheng,

622
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,600
there is another solution.

623
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,410
DK wanted to sign a contract with you.

624
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,560
If you sign a cooperation contract

625
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
with Royal Entertainment,

626
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,330
I think you will

627
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,840
solve the issue.

628
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:02,920
No.

629
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,530
I don't want to be related

630
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,410
to Zhou Yao in any way.

631
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
Because of Jiang Dian?

632
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,210
You used to be

633
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,920
out of touch.

634
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,320
When you choose between love and bread,

635
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,560
love is your choice.

636
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,610
But I'm really happy

637
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,690
for you.

638
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,410
Because you have a younger heart.

639
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,880
I will also

640
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,490
try to

641
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,080
find more resources for you.

642
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,210
Baoling, thank you!

643
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,650
You are welcome!

644
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,130
Don't make a long face.

645
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,320
Go to Linxi University with me.

646
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,930
Lian Ruoshen will perform there this afternoon.

647
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:45,920
Come with me

648
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,210
and enjoy yourself.

649
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,400
Mrs. Chen, you've come.

650
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,640
Please come to my office.

651
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,450
It's not necessary.

652
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,010
I only have a few words to say.

653
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,130
First,

654
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,440
Jiang Dian will stop doing research.

655
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,090
Second,

656
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,320
I have made the arrangements and he will go abroad.

657
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,640
I hope you can leave him in peace.

658
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,890
Goodbye!

659
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,360
Mrs. Chen,

660
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,890
I have a few more words to say to you.

661
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,320
Jiang Dian

662
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,080
is talented and ambitious.

663
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,490
He is a good student.

664
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,690
He knows clearly what he wants.

665
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,450
He is also trying very hard to achieve it.

666
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,730
As his parent,

667
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,050
you should support him.

668
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,000
You should not always deny him.

669
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,640
He is the only son of the Jiangs.

670
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,090
He only needs to grow up

671
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,770
in a way that is defined.

672
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,920
After he was born,

673
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,210
we made arrangements

674
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,440
for his future.

675
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,200
The so-called talent and ambition

676
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,250
are nothing to us.

677
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,280
He has to undertake his responsibility.

678
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,720
I have said so much to you.

679
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,840
I hope

680
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,730
you will not contact my son again.

681
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,290
If you hadn't encouraged him

682
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,760
to go to another department,

683
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,520
how could he be so rebellious?

684
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,250
Goodbye!

685
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,280
Mrs. Chen...

686
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,530
There is no need to go on talking.

687
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,690
I... I...

688
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,650
[Lian Ruoshen, Shenshen, love you]

689
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,920
Thank you!

690
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,560
Thank you!

691
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,690
Shenshen!

692
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,800
Shenshen, love you!

693
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,170
We will support you forever!

694
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,400
Shenshen, I love you! Shenshen, I love you!

695
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,600
Shenshen! Shenshen, I love you!

696
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,290
I want to be with you!

697
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,120
Shenshen! Shenshen, my husband! Kiss you!

698
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,290
Bro, I'm a man!

699
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,600
Shenshen! Shenshen! Shenshen! Shenshen!

700
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,920
Shenshen, I love you! Shenshen, I love you!

701
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,200
I told you not to get off the car.

702
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,490
Someone

703
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,520
wanted to have close contact

704
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,370
with his fans.

705
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,920
Now he understands what it is.

706
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,840
Baoling, next time

707
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,920
you should tell me in advance.

708
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,170
It's so scary.

709
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:04,850
Let's first get inside.

710
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,760
Thank you! Thank you!

711
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,010
You won't answer it?

712
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,160
What if there is something urgent?

713
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,000
A matter of routine. I don't need to answer it.

714
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,190

715
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,770

Jiang Dian! Chengcheng!

727
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,720
Stop making out.

728
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,520
Follow us!

729
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,159
Send me all the information

730
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,159
about what Jiang Dian has done recently.

731
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,199
Hello! What's the matter?

732
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,760
OK. I see.

733
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,210
What's the matter?

734
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,760
My mother has discovered that
I have gone to another department.

735
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,120
I have to go home.

736
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,639
Do you need me to go with you?

737
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,159
No.

738
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,639
Wait for me.

739
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,770
I can solve it.

740
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,800
This woman ordered a cup of coffee.

741
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,480
It's been two hours.

742
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,360
She hasn't drunk a drop.

743
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,040
Who is she?

744
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,600
I've never seen her.

745
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,490
Cheng! Cheng!

746
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,400
What's the matter?

747
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,240
That woman wants to see you.

748
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,560
She's been sitting there for a long time.

749
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,650
She was motionless and she looked scary.

750
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,240
Do you want to see me?

751
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Please sit down and let's have a talk.

752
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,490
You were a dancer overseas when you were a kid
but quit dancing without reason.

753
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,720
Recently there are scandals about you.

754
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,280
You have just terminated the agreement with HA.

755
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,040
So that's you, Miss Cheng Feng?

756
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,400
Are you Dian's mother?

757
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Nice to meet you!

758
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm sorry I wasn't able to

759
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
visit you first.

760
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,080
If you are curious

761
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,360
about me,

762
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,840
you can ask me directly.

763
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,000
You don't have to investigate me.

764
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,330
Your coffee is cold.

765
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,480
I'll give you a hot cup of tea.

766
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,440
You don't need to.

767
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,640
Since we are not so intimate,

768
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,760
we won't drink tea together.

769
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,480
I think you know why I am here.

770
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,530
Leave Dian.

771
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,400
Does Dian

772
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,130
know that you've come here?

773
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,760
He doesn't need to know it.

774
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,520
I decide everything for him.

775
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,680
I just hope

776
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,850
you can leave Dian.

777
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
I have prepared the files for him
so that he can go abroad.

778
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,130
Why are you sneering?

779
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,520
Nothing.

780
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,240
I just feel that

781
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,320
it was not easy for Dian

782
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,760
to become an excellent man

783
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,960
in such an environment.

784
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,680
Don't say such nonsense.

785
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,840
I've seen a lot of women

786
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,920
like you.

787
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,120
Dian is too young

788
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
and you want to coax him

789
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,360
in order to have a sudden rise in life.

790
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,600
You want to become another Cinderella.

791
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,080
I will never let you succeed.

792
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,040
You can have

793
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,120
your own ideas.

794
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,480
Since you are

795
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,240
Dian's mother,

796
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,040
I don't want to say anything bad.

797
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,640
But you

798
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,330
don't need to persuade me

799
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,480
to leave Dian.

800
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,080
Only if

801
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,840
Dian tells me to himself.

802
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,400
It's an opportunity to leave him decently.

803
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,080
But you don't want it.

804
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,320
Don't regret it in the future.

805
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,400
Cheng,

806
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,800
are you OK?

807
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm fine.

808
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,440
When she asked you to break up with him,

809
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
her way was quite different

810
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,240
from what I've seen

811
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,560
in the novels and TV series.

812
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,520
She should give you a stack of money

813
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,360
or a check

814
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,120
and ask you

815
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,360
"How much money do you need

816
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,440
to leave my son?"

817
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,400
She didn't

818
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,320
give you a penny.

819
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,880
She is so stingy.

820
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,520
She even got the cup of coffee for free.

821
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,480
You should

822
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,880
never let Dian know it.

823
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,760
Don't worry. I'm the most tight-lipped.

824
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,280
I might go back late tonight.

825
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,680
You go to bed early.

826
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,480
Don't wait for me.

827
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,080
It's me who wants to go to another department.

828
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
You can ask me directly if you have any questions.

829
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,160
You don't need to talk to my teacher.

830
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,880
If I hadn't talked to him,

831
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,390
when would you tell me?

832
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
How many things haven't you told me?

833
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,480
I have a girlfriend.

834
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,200
How long have you been with her?

835
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,600
Over a month.

836
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
You are learning physics

837
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,440
but you didn't tell me.

838
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,040
You found a part-time job secretly.

839
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,440
You went to another department without telling me.

840
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
I thought these were the limits of your rebellious actions.

841
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
I never expected you

842
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,080
to be in a relationship

843
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,640
with such an indecent woman behind my back.

844
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,310
I'm really disappointed at you!

845
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,800
Who is indecent?

846
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,240
Do you know her?

847
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,640
Disappointed?

848
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,720
Are you qualified to say you are disappointed?

849
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,350
Are you qualified because you were showing no care?

850
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,880
Are you qualified because you want to control me?

851
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,990
I'm qualified because I'm your mother!

852
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,960
Mother?

853
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,360
Do you really know me?

854
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,710
What do I like to eat?

855
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,590
What do I dislike to eat?

856
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,880
What am I allergic to? Do you know?

857
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,600
How many times did we see each other
in the past nineteen years?

858
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,550
Do you remember?

859
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,240
Why did we see each other

860
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,310
each time?

861
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,040
Do you still remember?

862
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,760
When I want to say something to you,

863
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,080
most of the time you would say

864
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,200
"no, don’t, you can’t".

865
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
What does the word "mother" to do with you?

866
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
The girl has taught you

867
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,000
how to use your sharp tongue.

868
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,560
A mother can send someone

869
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,880
to follow her son.

870
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,670
Do you think I should feel disappointed

871
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,720
or desperate?

872
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,120
If you were obedient,

873
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,360
how could I send someone to watch you?

874
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,070
Now I know that

875
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
this man is following your orders.

876
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,150
You taught him

877
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,560
how to report to me.

878
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,800
You are really awesome!

879
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
If we can have a good talk,

880
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
I don't need to do that.

881
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,590
Every time I want to talk to you,

882
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,440
you always ask me to stop talking.

883
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,880
Or you would say you are busy.

884
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,640
Yes. You are busy, but I'm not free, either.

885
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
I just want to ask you

886
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,260
whether you will break up with her.

887
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,060
No.

888
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,390
Only when I die.

889
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,120
You love is whimsical.

890
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,560
You could easily

891
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,960
say the word "die".

892
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,750
Life is very long.

893
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,000
When you are no longer so passionate,

894
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,200
if you can still say this,

895
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,640
you two will be true love.

896
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,880
Other people will think

897
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
you are childish to say so

898
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,160
when you are at a young age.

899
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,760
I remember you said you liked physics.

900
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,680
Physics is your dream, your obsession.

901
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,640
Fine.

902
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,320
Now I give you two choices

903
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,760
and you can choose only one.

904
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,190
If you break up with her,

905
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,160
I will allow you to learn physics.

906
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,440
You are always so confident,

907
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,790
so self-righteous.

908
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,110
You will see

909
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,070
whether she and I are true love or not.

910
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,950
You asked me to choose between the two.

911
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,560
I'm tired of this game.

912
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,440
I was expecting

913
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,670
to win your love.

914
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,840
I just wanted you

915
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,840
to pay a bit more attention to me.

916
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
Now I want to choose both.

917
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,470
I decide what to do in my life.

918
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,160
You are fully fledged.

919
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,990
You will regret your decision on this day.

920
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,590
What do you mean?

921
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,280
Is there something wrong with you?

922
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,640
After you get the visa,

923
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,120
I will send you abroad immediately.

924
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,630
Wait in your room before that.

925
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,440
Let me go!

926
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,360
Send him to his room.

927
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,520
I won't go abroad!

928
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,150
I won't go abroad!

929
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,590
Let go of me!
