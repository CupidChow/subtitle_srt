[Linxi First Hospital]

6
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,890
Dian

7
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,470
seems to be smart,

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,750
but, in fact,

9
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,670
he is quite a fool.

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,600
Say…

11
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,800
He did so many things

12
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,690
without telling anyone.

13
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,800
He was preparing

14
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
for the physics competition

15
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,970
while working day and night

16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,240
to do the virtual reality project for you.

17
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,500
So, he got himself exhausted.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,080
I didn't know

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,040
he had done so much for me.

20
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,210
I don't mean to blame you.

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,050
If someone were to blame,

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,500
blame him for being a

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,080
poor boy that no one loves.

24
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,400
His father

25
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,150
always

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,650
neglects him.

27
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,280
And his mother always

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,090
pushes him to study business.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,900
She doesn’t care about other things.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,620
Being a child raised this way,

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,430
he doesn’t know how to

32
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,620
repay people’s kindness.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,600
If you are kind to him,

34
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,060
he wants to give you

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,950
the nicest things he can have.

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,760
No matter what lies in the future for him,

37
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,960
Cheng,

38
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,460
you work so hard for Jiang Dian,

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,650
keeping yourself busy.

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,290
You're a good girl.

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,500
In fact,

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,610
I just want you to be nicer

43
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,630
to Jiang Dian.

44
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,079
This kid’s life

45
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,660
is so hard.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,910
He has suffered too much.

47
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,050
He doesn’t say anything

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,950
about his sufferings.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,730
Now it's good.

50
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,910
He has you now.

51
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,470
When he is with you,

52
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,740
he won't suffer anymore.

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,750
He just wants to take care of you.

54
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,990
One can only be

55
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,970
devoted to one person.

56
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,890
Don't worry, Professor Chen.

57
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,220
I will take good care of him.

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,960
Good, Cheng,

59
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,850
Jiang Dian is so lucky to have you.

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,190
Okay, let me check on him.

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,960
I…

62
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,640
Well…

63
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,230
You brat.

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,510
I have come to see you, bringing some fruits.

65
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,750
You should be happy.

66
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,200
Why are you disappointed?

67
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,830
Why are you here?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,350
I…

69
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,230
I was going to ask you that.

70
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,780
You brat!

71
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,460
I thought the jog of

72
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,740
you lying to your mother was up.

73
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,990
Do you think your mother did it on purpose?

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,550
She changed the time for the interview

75
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,870
and it would be the time

76
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,010
for the physics competition.

77
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,470
The interview can be rearranged,

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,280
but

79
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,160
the physics competition can't.

80
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,010
It's a done deal.

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,930
I don't care.

82
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,380
You must not stand me up

83
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,610
for the competition!

84
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,670
Or else,

85
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,430
I can't take it.

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,070
Well,

87
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,650
your mother

88
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,850
can't see the talent in you.

89
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,000
That's alright.

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,070
But your health

91
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,170
is so poor.

92
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,750
If I were your father,

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,150
I would have…

94
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,040
Alright.

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,870
Let's not talk about it.

96
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,210
Cheng is good.

97
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,710
Cheng is really kind to you.

98
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,230
Cheng, you're back.

99
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,090
Here, you take care of him.

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,210
Tomorrow, whether he can go to Hua City

101
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,440
or not depends on you.

102
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,110
Don't worry.

103
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,170
I won't let you down.

104
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,810
Great! Great!

105
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,910
Okay, you guys talk.

106
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,920
I'll go home.

107
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,120
Bye.

108
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,090
Are you feeling better?

109
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,990
Yes, I'm better.

110
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,550
The doctor said you are overworked.

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,780
You need to rest.

112
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:27,900
Dian.

113
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,790
Don't hurt

114
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,850
yourself again.

115
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,290
Okay?

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,310
Even if it’s for me.

117
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,440
Cheng, in fact, I…

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,360
Let me finish my words.

119
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,850
Dian, you are an individual.

120
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,650
You don’t belong to anyone.

121
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,950
Although in the past,

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,760
no one worried about you when you were sick,

123
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,040
now it's different.

124
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,020
If you're sick,

125
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,860
I'll be concerned about you.

126
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,460
So,

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,610
for my sake,

128
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,120
take care of yourself, okay?

129
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,440
You know what?

130
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,730
Ever since I was a kid,

131
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,580
no one has ever cared about me.

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,070
You're the first one.

133
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,110
Dian.

134
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,660
I don't have much.

135
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
So,

136
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,400
take care of yourself.

137
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
I want to accompany you for a longer period of time.

138
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:21,800
I promise.

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,060
Lu Bie.

140
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,450
Have you ever kissed anyone? Tell me.

141
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,680
What does it feel like?

142
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,140
Watch it.

143
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,800
But don’t pinch me.

144
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,280
Why are you staring at me?

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
The feeling?

146
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,490
How can I tell you?

147
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,560
Try it. It can’t be taught.

148
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,420
You old bachelor.

149
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,310
As if you had kissed someone.

150
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,850
You, you're the bachelor!

151
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,910
Your whole family are bachelors.

152
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,360
Don't you know that?

153
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,110
Why do you ask?

154
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,070
So sour!

155
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
Damn monkey, you ate my orange

156
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,540
and you tell me it's sour?

157
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,430
It’s not okay.

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,700
I must try it for Dian first.

159
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,200
It’s sweet.

160
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
Stop eating.

161
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,840
This is for Dian.

162
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,850
Don’t eat it all.

163
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,570
How dare you?

164
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,060
You've crushed my flowers.

165
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,990
They have all wilted.

166
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,100
Don’t talk about the flowers.

167
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,070
You came visiting the sick.

168
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,120
Why did bring yellow and white chrysanthemums?

169
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,190
Are you sure you are here to visit the sick?

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,860
People who don't know will think you're here…

171
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,760
What should we do?

172
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
Why don't we go down and buy some more?

173
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,920
And we can come back later.

174
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,560
You're here.

175
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,850
We have been here for a while.

176
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,570
Have you had enough time together?

177
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,970
Does your mouth still hurt?

178
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,980
I didn't see anything.

179
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,870
Dian.

180
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,680
How did you get yourself

181
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,730
into this mess?

182
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,860
You should not work too hard.

183
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,720
We are young and there is a long way to go.

184
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,789
If something happens to you…

185
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,900
Shut up.

186
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,230
When you get better

187
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,080
I'll do exercise with you.

188
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,400
You will be able to…

189
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,590
I can't bear you.

190
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:42,990
Are you possessed by Pei Xiaoyun?

191
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,310
You’re a man.

192
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,930
Stop nagging.

193
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,690

382
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,960
Where is she?

383
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,500
She drank too much.

384
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,340
Why?

385
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,420
Why are you avoiding me?

386
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,630
Why didn't you answer my calls?

387
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,960
Why?

388
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,730
You bad guy.

389
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,060
Why didn't you call me?

390
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,690
Why are you avoiding me?

391
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,230
Where were you the last two days?

392
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,810
You bad guy.

393
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,050
Why are you avoiding me?

394
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,750
Lian Ruoshen, you bad guy.

395
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,380
Let me take you home.

396
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,260
I don't want to go home.

397
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,550
I want to drink.

398
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,090
Give me the drink.

399
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,020

I don’t want to go home.

Don't you understand?

402
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,370
I want a drink.

403
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,110
Listen.

404
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,960
Let’s go home first.

405
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,020
Let's go.

406
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,730
I don’t want to go home.

407
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,630
You don't understand, do you?

408
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,470
Lian Ruoshen, I said I'm not going home.

409
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,080
No. I want to drink.

410
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,280
Put me down!

411
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,870
I won't go home.

412
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,650
You put me down!

Lian Ruoshen, put me down!

414
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,370
I want to drink more. I haven’t drunk enough.

I won’t go home. Put me down!

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,620
Sure.

What should I do?

420
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,890
As the clock is ticking, I love you
more and more.

421
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,030
The happiest thing in my life

422
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,570
is to love you.

423
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,910
Put me down. I don’t want you to carry me.

424
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,850
What on earth do you mean?

425
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,010
Now that you are trying to avoid me,

426
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,070
why do you appear?

427
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,370
Why do you carry me?

428
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,790
Put me down.

429
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,980
I can walk.

430
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,190
Put me down.

431
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,770
Speak to me.

432
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,910
Speak!

433
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,410
Now that you want to avoid me,

434
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,160
you should not appear.

435
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,040
Otherwise, I will feel annoyed

436
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,900
and sad.

437
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,710
I’m sorry.

438

in front of your eyes.

440
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,530
I want you to see that

441
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,350
I am better than you think.

442
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,080
Please don’t avoid me, OK?

443
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,600
If there is anything between us,

444
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,690
we can talk about it. OK?

445
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,610
OK!

[Cheng Feng]

447
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,050
Why do you come here?

448
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,810
You knew I cooked

449
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,690
the soup for you.

450
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,450
But you didn’t have any.

451
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,730
You were just waiting for me

452
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,870
to bring it to you.

453
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,540
In the future,

454
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,440
don’t play such a trick.

455
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,590
In case I can’t understand it,

456
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,400
you will be disappointed.

457
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,200
The room is so dark. Why don’t you
turn on the light?

458
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,620
Cheng.

459
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,330
What’s the matter with you?

460
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,610
Nothing. I miss you.

461
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,990
From the taste,

462
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,180
can you tell what I added to the soup

463
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,630
after you had left?

464
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,740
Why did you add Hangzhou white
chrysanthemum and loquat?

465
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,380
Because you need them.

466
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,100
They can clear toxic material and moisten the lung.

467
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,640
They can also reduce internal heat.

468
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,250
Drink it before it gets cold.

469
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,750
I’ll go back after you finish drinking.

My friend’s family

471
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,240
is so rich.

472
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,750
I can feel the pressure.

473
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,810
This is not home.

474
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,570
This is a place I can stay.

475
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,350
Dian,

476
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,430
do you have anything to say to me?

477
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,880
I’ll show you my room.

478
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,140
This is my room.

479
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,210
I’ve been living in this room since
I was a child.

480
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,230
In this place,

481
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,770
I can be myself.

482
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,250
My mother has never taken much care of me.

483
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,970
When I am ill,

484
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,200
she just goes through the motions.

485
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,690
[Feynman  Lecture Notes on Physics]

486
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,400
But a long time ago,

487
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,590
she planned my life.

488
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,700
She wants me to live as she wishes.

489
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,750
Previously, I thought

490
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,460
it was maternal love.

491
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,130
Therefore, I tried very hard

492
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,540
to win her attention.

493
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,680
Later on, I found that

494
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,500
she only wanted to manipulate my life.

495
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,080
She doesn’t care about me at all.

496
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,530
For example,

497
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,800
my classmates’ parents would pick them up.

498
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,910
She only sent a driver to pick me up.

499
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,210
She had never participated

500
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,270
in the gatherings.

501
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,410
Not to mention parents’ meetings.

502
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,610
Most of the time,

503
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,540
I live alone

504
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,900

505
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,050

506
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,290
I’m used to it.

507
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,840
No one will praise me when my score is high.

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,340
No one will blame me when my score is low.

509
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,620
Sometimes I would think

510
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,380
if I die someday,

511
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,610

don’t care at all,

There will be about thirty people.

560
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,280
They need us to provide

561
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,700
coffee, refreshments, sweets, wine,

562
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,090
etc.

563
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,760
It’s a big order.

564
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,910
I need to discuss it with you.

565
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,450
OK. I’ll go back immediately.

566
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,110
OK.

00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,700
Cheng? Cheng?

757
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,970
There is no signal?

758
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,160
Cheng, are you listening?

759
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,280
Since the one I love is so excellent,

760
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,310
I want to become a better man.

761
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,510
Yeah. Falling in love is so sweet.

762
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,960
I am witnessing PDA.

763
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,160
I hope your love affair

764
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,400
can help you

765
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,580
compose a great dance.

766
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,920
Cheng, I have sent

767
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,410
the demo to your mailbox.

768
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,160
Please take a look.

769
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,740
Tell me if there are any problems.

770
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,990
-OK.
-Bye-bye!

771
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,150
♫ A beautiful transformation. ♫

772
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,550
♫ Break the cocoon at the last second
and become a butterfly. ♫

773
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,490
♫ Being laughed at ♫

774
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,230
♫ was like a passing wind that can be ignored. ♫

775
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,400
♫ Create a world that belongs to your own. ♫

776
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,630
Can you be quiet for a moment?

777
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,150
You are made of iron.

778
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,570
But I’m not. Let me take a nap.

779
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,230
Why do you sleep?

780
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,390
You should work hard on this beautiful day.

781
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,150
Recently I practiced singing

782
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,980
all night.

783
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,830
I didn’t say I was tired. Why are you tired?

784
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
How can you say that?

785
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,420
Haven’t I spent the whole night with you?

786
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,970
Haven’t I helped you

787
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,030
write this song?

788
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,530
I was wrong. I was wrong.

789
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,210
I really didn’t mean it.

790
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,780
Hello, Baoling!

791
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:09,710
OK!

792
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,130
OK! Thank you, Baoling!

793
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,360
I need to thank Cheng!

794
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,150
What is it?

795
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,520
Cheng will compose a dance for me!

796
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,310
Really!

797
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,940
I’m so happy!

798
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,870
I’m going to fly!

799
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,320
Will I become famous?

800
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,590
Of course!

801
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,950
I thought you had stopped

802
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,410
thinking about becoming a star.

803
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,770
I’ve prepared so many materials

804
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,090
so that you can review the lessons.

805
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,600
I think I was carrying coals to Newcastle.

806
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,550
Yun!

807
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,390
Yun!

808
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,840
Gosh! I’ve bombed the exam.

809
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,110
I’m too ashamed to see Mr. Chen.

810
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,710
How can the questions be so difficult?

811
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,910
Anyway, it’s the final.

812
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,410
The questions can’t be simple.

813
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:04,880
Why are you still here?

814
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,250
I asked you to go home and wait for me.

815
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,050
Because I know

816
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,550
you would like to see me

817
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,210
when you come out.

818
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,380
Don’t be too nice to me.

819
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,590
I’m afraid I can’t leave you.

820
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,700
I’m even more afraid that it is a dream.

821
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,660
Dian,

822
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,420
let’s go for a date.
