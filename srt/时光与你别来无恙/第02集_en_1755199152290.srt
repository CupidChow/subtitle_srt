[The Second Welfare House of Linxi City]

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,870
Recently the children in the welfare house

7
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,970
had an origami lesson.

8
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,300
They made a lot of stars and paper cranes.

9
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,970
These are the gifts for you.

10
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,600
Thank you! You’ve been

11
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,570
taking care of them for so many years.

12
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,070
Tell the children that I want to thank them.

13
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,100
Please tell them I will

14
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,850
bring more nice things to them
when I come next time.

15
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,790
Chengcheng, you’ve really changed a lot.

16
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,870
Although you are still a cold person,

17
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,490
the feeling you give people
is much better than before.

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,310
I remember the first time

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
I saw you.

20
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,360
The way you behave

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,650
was like a Queen’s.

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,980
It seemed that the words “No stranger”

23
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,210
had been printed on your forehead.

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,150
Later on,

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,480
I became your dancing partner.

26
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,550
I found that it was not very difficult
to get along with you.

27
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,970
Chengcheng, you really

28
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,470
don’t want to perform on the stage again?

29
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,870
I don’t have such a plan now.

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,730
Dear children,

31
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,470
please come here!

32
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,770
They should be people from the Linxi University.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,180
Will you go to take a look?

34
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,360
OK. I’ll take a look.

35
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,690
Ladies and fellow villagers,

36
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,120
are you ready? Let’s get started.

37
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,720
♫ Ba Ba Ba! ♫

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,930
♫ Do you add spice? Do you add pepper? ♫

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,360
♫ Do you add spice? Do you add pepper? ♫

40
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,170
♫ I don’t add pepper. ♫

41

♫ Ba Ba Ba! ♫

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,240
Little boy, don’t cry!

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,690
I’ll buy you a new one, OK?

44
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,840
I don’t believe you!

45
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,740
What’s wrong with you, Lian Ruoshen?

46
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,970
You are bullying a kid!

47
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,600
Do you know why we can come to
the welfare house?

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,450
Because Jiang Dian has pleaded
with the old professor.

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,510
If you blow it,

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,690
I’ll punish you!

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,510
Put it on!

52
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,050
What’s wrong? Put it on!

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,480
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,710
♫ I want to fulfill all your wish. ♫

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,990

Be careful! Be careful!

67
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,500
Are you well-behaved?

68
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,040
Yes..

Let’s play over there!

♫ Love. Love. Love. The way of love. The way of love. ♫

75
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:50,900
OK!

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,830
Be careful!

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,990
♫ Love. ♫

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,840
Dian!

79
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,400
do you have a crush on that lady?

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,420
Do you need me to help you?

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,910
Dian, why did you hit me?

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,000
Miss Goddess,

83
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,810
Yun asked me to

84
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,130
go to the warehouse together with you.

85
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,400
We have to find some small light bulbs.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,460
OK.

87
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,280
Miss,

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,040
I suddenly have a stomachache.

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,490
I need to go to the bathroom.

90
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,460
Can you go there first?

91
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,640
OK.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,710
Do you think it’s true?

93
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,070
No.

94
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,210
What’s about you?

95
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,610
Yes.

96
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,000
Dian!

97
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,070
Dian,

98
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,360
I have loose bowels.

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
Can you go to the warehouse

100
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,480
and take out the small light bulbs
instead of me? Over there.

101
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,940
Look after the kids.

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,820
Thank you, Dian!

It’s you?

106
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,820
Who do you think I am?

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,770
Is anybody there?

108
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,320
Let me do it.

109
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,550
Is anybody there?

110
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,270
Is anybody there?

111
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,970
We are locked inside.

112
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,420
Please help us open the door!

113
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,830
Open the door!

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Can anyone open the door for us?

115
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,000
Is anybody there? Open the door!

116
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,750
Cheng Feng! Cheng Feng! Cheng Feng!
What’s the matter with you?

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,450
Did you...

118
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,680
Did you hear

119
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,440
a beeping sound?

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,100
Look at me, Cheng Feng!

121
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,120
Listen to me. There is no sound at all.

122
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,360
I’ll find someone.

123
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,280
Don’t go!

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,550
Don’t go! Don’t leave me!

125
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,190
Don’t worry!

126
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,730
I’m always here.

127
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,150
Are you feeling better?

128
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,420
Dian, awesome!

129
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,310
You two are hugging!

130
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,970
I was trying...

131
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,030
Jiang Dian,

132
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,540
Chengcheng suffers from claustrophobia.

133
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,420
How can you do this to her?

134
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,900
And you!

135
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,000
I’ll talk to you later!

136
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,960
Dian,

137
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,750
I...

138
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,980
I...

139
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,370
Will you leave yourself

140
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,730
or shall I call the police?

141
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,549
I’m sorry. What happened in the warehouse just now

142
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,740
was not what you thought it to be.

143
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,970
I can explain it to you.

144
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,250
I thought

145
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,010
you were just a spoiled child.

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,340
Now I know that I’ve underestimated you.

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
Please believe me.

148
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,860
I can explain it!

149
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,460
I don’t care about what reason you have.

150
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,730
Please stay away from me!

151
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,400
I’m afraid of troubles.

152
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,780
And I don’t want to get into trouble!

153
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,840
But I want.

154
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,450
I like you.

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,730
Like? How do you like me?

156
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,430
Do you like

157
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,900
my face?

158
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,440
Do you like my stature?

159
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,980
Or do you want to sleep with me?

160
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,670
We’ve just seen each other several times.

161
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,900
Do you know about me?

162
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,870
But you said you liked me.

163
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,330
You had a sudden feeling,
but you thought we were true love.

164
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,050
Don’t you think you are being ridiculous?

165
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,270
I don’t have the time and I’m not
interested in flirting with you.

166
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,030
I have no feeling

167
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,520
for a younger man.

168
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,860
Since you are Yun’s student,

169
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,140
I’ll draw a line here.

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,410
You can leave now.

171
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,310
I’ve never been in love.

172
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,910
I don’t know how it feels

173
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,880
to love someone.

174
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,300
But I know the feeling of disappointment.

175
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,230
It’s not my sudden feeling.

176
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,680
I’ll prove it to you.

177
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,190
Why do you come back so late?

178
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,080
I needed to stay in college
for a longer period of time.

179
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,340
Why do you stay so long

180
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,310
in the business school?

181
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,930
What’s the matter with you?
Are you ill?

182
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,950
Why didn’t you take care of yourself?

183
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,960
Isn’t it a normal thing that I’m ill?

184
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,370
My son, I’ll be on a business trip today.

185
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,120
I see.

186
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,140
Like?

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,850
my casual words clearly this time.

374
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,550
Cheng, although you see me

375
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,520
as your cousin,

376
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,790
I see you

377
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,720
as my real sister.

378
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,990
Cheng, I’ll take it.

379
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,850
Lu Biebie, you are so shameless!

380
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,430
Stop!

381
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,160
Take it!

382
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,390
I don’t want to owe anyone a favor.

383
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,570
I’m sorry. I don’t want cash.

384
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,110
It seems it’s not the collection code.

385
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,830
It’s the code for adding a new friend.

386
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,020
I want a red envelop from you.

387
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,220
You can only accept

388
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,580
what I give you.

389
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,350
I have the right to refuse you.

390
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,430
You look awful.

391
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,030
Is it caused by claustrophobia?

392
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,720
It’s none of your business.

393
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,490
Mr. Wang,

394
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,940
I have to deal with something at home this evening.

395
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,040
I can’t go on the night shift.

396
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,760
I’m sorry about it.

397
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,150
Hello!

398
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,340
Is that Cheng Feng speaking?

399
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,230
We are from the Happiness Street Police Station.

400
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,470
I’m sorry for calling you at this hour.

401
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,450
We’ve found

402
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,510
a girl.

403
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,560
She told us that

404
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,660
her boyfriend was cheating on her.

405
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,510
She has found your photos and videos

406
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,230
in her boyfriend’s phone.

407
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,640
She thought you were his secret lover.

408
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,880
She did it in order to show her anger.

409
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
We have

410
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,780
criticized and educated her.

411
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,420
OK. Thank you very much!

413
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,080
I don’t know you. What do you want to do?

414
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,450
Let go of me!

415
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,820
If you go on, I’ll call the police!

416
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,720
Help! Help!

417
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,750

help me! I don’t know him!

420
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,870
If you don’t let go of me, I’ll call the police!

421
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,450
Why are you here?

422
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,170
I want to protect you.

423
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,850
It’s you want to do it, but it doesn’t
mean that I need it.

424
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,360
A man is protecting her.

425
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,080
Yeah.

426
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,700
He can’t protect her

428
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,180
She hurt my boy.

429
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,860
My bestie was detained because of her.

430
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,230
Don’t persuade me.

431
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,350

Were you a thief last night?

437
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,560
You slept through the entire morning.

to send it to my father.

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,970
Are you sure

446
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,020
when your father sees your score,

447
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,700
he will maintain a good relationship with you?

as long as my score was higher than
the previous time,

he would double the pocket money
he would give me.

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,460

This is the score I got this time.

457
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,820
It’s twice the score I got last time.

458
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,940
If I go on trying,

459
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,900

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,420
about men’s appearance, either.

00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,320
look so much alike.

00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,820
to pick them out.

480
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,290
Although they look similar,

00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,340
people all have

482
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,190
two eyes and one mouth.

483
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,730
You can’t pick out a special one.

In this age,

485
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,120
appearance means everything.

486
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,170
It’s easier for a good-looking man

487
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,580
to get resources.

488
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,470
You want me to find some ugly men.

489
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,750
Do you want them to be comedians?

490
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,270

who look the same.

Let go of me.

506
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,550
Don’t wipe his forehead.

507
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,540
Does it have anything to do with you?

508
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,660
Stop watching!

509
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,210
You may leave now.

510
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,050
OK, Baoling!

511
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,500
What happened just now?

512
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,030
I have to say

513
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,100
that you two are matching each other.

514
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,350
Why are you staring at me?

515
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,850
Did I say something wrong?

516
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,400
You are both good-looking
and your characters are similar.

517
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,720
Neither of you can be trifled with.

518
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,280
A wild wolf and a wild cat are
a perfect match.

519
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,230
Your life might be turbulent

520
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,200
in the future.

521
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,720
You are talking too much today.

522
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,540
I’m joking with you. Don’t take it seriously.

523
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,340
A younger man is a younger man.

524
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,880
They are not suitable for us because of our age.

525
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,300
It’s very tiring to be with a younger man.

531
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,980
Why didn’t you tell me?

532
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,840
You are in the mood to have a hotpot!

533
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,740

534
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,910
Nothing. The issue has been solved.

535
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,710
Who did this to you?

536
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,470
You don’t go out very often.

537
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,570
Who can you offend?

538
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,640
A young girl.

539
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,750
She misunderstood that I was
in a relationship with her boyfriend.

540
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,610
What a big joke!

541
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,780
Which girl? Do you have an impression on her?

542
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,410
No.

543
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,550
I think I need to

544
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,480
tell you something,

545
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,290
though you don’t want to know

546
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,560
any news about him at all.

547
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,820
Someone interviewed Zhou Yao yesterday.

548
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,890
He talked about your love affair

549
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,070
and behaved as if he was deeply in love.

550
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,050
When his fans saw the interview online,

551
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,860
they responded actively.

552
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,620
Can it be related to the incident?

553
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,570
Previously nothing happened to you.

554
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,020
Once he talked about you,

555
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,720
something happened to you.

556
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,310
Which interview was it?

557
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,330
There is no right or wrong about love.

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,520
in your life.

560
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,020
He or she will lower other people’s importance.

561
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,310
You are willing to give everything to her.

562
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,390
But in the end, you two can’t keep

563
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,230
the relationship.

564
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,680
No one has made any mistake.

565
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,490
We are just immature.

566
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,840
Sometimes I was thinking

567
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,040
if I had tried harder

568
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,490
to keep our relationship,

569
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,950
would our story end differently?

570
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,350
But it’s a pity that there is no “if”.

571
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
Mr. Zhou

572
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,380
is a man who can love so deeply.

573
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,450
The woman whom you can’t forget

574
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,370
is such a happy woman.

575
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,820
If she can see

576
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,720
you still love her so deeply,

577
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,140
will she regret it?

578
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,810
What are you watching?

579
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,260
Zhou Yao.

580
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,510
His expression obviously shows that

581
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,870
he is still thinking about my sister.

582
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,460
As to my sister,

583
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,949
she is cold to other people.

584
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,230
She has not been in a relationship
for several years.

585
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,429
It’s obvious that she can’t forget him.

586
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,010
I don’t understand

587
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,820
why the two

588
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,960
have broken up.

589
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,530
My sister’s ex-boyfriend, Zhou Yao.

590
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,630
A super star.

591
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,960
Haven’t I told you about him?

592
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,840
Maybe there is too much I need to tell you.

593
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,520
I need to give you some time

594
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,570
to be psychologically prepared.

595
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,520
Now it’s the right time.

596
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,409
Dian,

597
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,520
although I admire you very much,

598
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,050
your...

599
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,159
Go on!

600
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,380
your psychological burden

601
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,480
should not be too high.

602
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,290
You can see

603
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,080
his age and his background.

604
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,179
Compared with him, you are...

605
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,840
Bro, give me your beer, please.

606
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,510
I’m a bit thirsty.

607
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,850
I believe you and I

608
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,950
are all very curious

609
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,000
about the woman

610
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,800
whom Mr. Zhou can’t forget.

611
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,260
I don’t know whether it’s convenient for you

612
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,050
to reveal her identity.

613
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,800
Does she

614
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,180
work in entertainment sector or not?

615
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,970
She is a person who loves to be quiet.

616
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,740
I don’t want to

617
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,550
bring her any trouble.

618
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,500
I hope the media

619
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,680
can leave her alone.

620
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,050
Therefore,

621
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,190
let’s go on

622
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,030
talking about my new song.

623
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,460
We have to say that

624
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,790
Mr. Zhou’s new song is still a hit.

625
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,020
The choreography

626
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,250
has always been wonderful.

627
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,850
We still have a deep impression

628
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,570
on the choreography of your debut.

629
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,230
He was mouthing high-sounding words.

630
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,690
Does he want to restore
his relationship with Chengcheng?

631
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,650
Even if he wants to, it is impossible.

632
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,410
Although I don’t know

633
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,290
what happened on earth

634
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,530
between them,

635
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,590
I know how Chengcheng conducts herself.

636
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,740
Their breaking-up must be his mistake.

637
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,160
Now he wants her back.

638
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,610
He can only get her back in a dream!

639
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,730
Zhou Yao has chosen this time

640
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,540
to express his deep love.

641
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,730
He must have a purpose.

642
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,590
Maybe his words have encouraged

643
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,470
a fangirl to cause a disturbance

644
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,830
in the cafe.

645
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,090
Oh my Gosh! This is horrible!

646
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,120
In this way, Jiang Dian is better.

647
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,130
At least, he is very simple.

648
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,410
Come on! Drink some beer!

649
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,910
You don’t have a glass of beer?

650
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,100
Here you are. Drink mine.

651
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,080
Come on!

652
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,250
Brother-in-law, you are my brother-in-law.

653
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,790
I will tell you

654
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,150
everything

655
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,170
I know.

656
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,870
Go on.

657
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,030
Tell me all

658
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,730
you know,

659
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,090
please!

660
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,610
I have to say that

661
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,890
at that time

662
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,740
Zhou Yao was shining among the people.

663
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,330
He was handsome and he studied very well.

664
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,800
He was a very nice guy and had
the virtue of patience.

665
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,160
In simple words,

666
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,090
you can say

667
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,230
he was a hero in a Korean TV drama.

668
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,530
All the girls were crazy about him.

669
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,590
My sister

670
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,570
was also mad about him.

671
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,470
She wrote some love letters to him.

672
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,720
Dian has also received a lot of love letters.

673
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,040
Go on.

674
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,840
My memory is so poor!

675
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,850
No. My sister

676
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,090
didn’t wrote love letters to him.

677
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,990
Zhou Yao wrote some love letters to my sister.

678
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,410
Later on, my sister joined the dance regiment

679
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,460
and she went abroad.

680
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,270
Zhou Yao got enrolled in

681
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,540
the music school she was in.

682
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,270
He was courting my sister fervently.

683
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,120
At that time, it caught a lot of people’s attention.

684
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,580
My sister didn’t give much response to him.

685
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,160
Later on, they became lovers.

686
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,930
My sister was quite famous at that time.

687
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,180
She did performances in various places abroad.

688
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,140
She gradually had a lot of resources.

689
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,520
Zhou Yao began to work on his music.

690
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,150
I’ll omit ten thousand words here.

691
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,040
Later on,

692
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,960
for some inexplicable reason

693
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,980
the two broke up.

694
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,090
I don’t know the exact reason.

695
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,380
My sister quit the dancing circle.

696
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,830
She never danced again on the stage afterwards.

697
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,900
Dian,

698
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,350
these are all I know.

699
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,760
Are you satisfied?

700
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,700
After she broke up with him,
she quit the dancing circle.

701
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,540
Such a heavy blow?

702
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:29,890
Dian,

703
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,580
it will be difficult for you

704
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,170
to warm up her heart.

705
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,480
As I understand the love between
a man and a woman,

706
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,810
it’s absolutely impossible for them
to restore their relationship.

707
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,070
Dian, you have a chance.

708
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,220
Come on! I think highly of you.

709
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,700
My stomach is hurting so much!

710
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,360
Lian Ruoshen, go to the bathroom
together with me.

711
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,600
You are so womanish.

712
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,570
You need a company to go to the bathroom.

713
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,580
Go there yourself!

714
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,860
I want to be with Dian!

715
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,800
After a man suffers a blow,

716
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,900
he doesn’t want

717
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,440
other people to see his weak side.

718
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,710
We have to give him some time

719
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,810
to adjust himself.

720
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,800
What is love supposed to be?

721
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,390
Everything has its vanquisher.

722
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,070
Dian!

723
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,160
Step aside!

724
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,400
I will leave after asking you a question.

725
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,730
Last time, you said

726
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,860
you had no feeling for a younger man.
Is it true?

727
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,500
I think I made it

728
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,550
very clear last time.

729
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,280
I have no feeling for a younger man.

730
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,040
Have you heard it clearly?

731
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,790
You are lying.

732
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,460
Now that you have no feeling for younger men,

733
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,960
why were you talking happily
with those three men?

734
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,160
Is there any problem with it?

735
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,190
I have no feeling for you who is younger.

736
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,440
But it doesn’t mean that I have
no feeling for other younger men.

737
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,480
What’s the matter? Is it a blow?

738
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,260
Do you feel very uncomfortable here?

739
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,110
This is the way I am.

740
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,500
Therefore, stop bothering me!

741
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,060
Is it because

742
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,110
you still can’t forget Zhou Yao?
