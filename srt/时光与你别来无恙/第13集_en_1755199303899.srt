00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:47,950
Lisa,

6
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,120
can you please help me find the backstage recordings

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,370
of the 2015 Dance Competition?

8
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,130
Especially the full recordings

9
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,600
of my dancing partner An Yin and me.

10
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,190
Please send me a copy if you’re available.

11
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,790
You should have asked earlier.

12
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,860
I just finished the video data management recently.

13
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,920
And maybe it’s been deleted.

14
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,919
Do you think there will be any backup?

15
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,250
I’m not sure, but I can ask for you.

16
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,440
Thank you.

17
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,200
I really need these files.

18
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,660
Don’t worry. I will reply soon.

19
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,620
Go. I want to talk to your manager.

20
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,860
Otherwise, I won’t leave today.

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,600
Our manager is busy right now.

22
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,270
If you think there’s something wrong with our dessert,

23
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,280
I can bring you a new one.

24
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,820
But please do not break more stuffs.

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,390
Xuedong, what happened?

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,810
They said there’s a fly in our dessert.

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,480
We’ve been here so many times, but we didn’t find any flies.

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,240
Why did you find it?

29
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,920
What do you mean?

30
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,850
You mean we’re lying,

31
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,110
right?

32
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,960
Yep.

33
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,400
You...

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,950
Mind your words.

35
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,850
There’s something wrong with your dessert,

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,610
but you blamed us for not coming in time.

37
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,540
You let someone who’s afraid of insects

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,250
eat them.

39
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,210
Do you know

40
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,620
how scared my girlfriend felt?

41
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,340
Now you even blamed us!

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,750
No way! We won’t forgive you!

43
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,520
Don’t cry, babe.

44
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,970
Let me help you.

45
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,700
That’s enough.

46
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,060
Today, in this restaurant,

47
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,910
if you can’t find a single fly,

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,950
I’ll beat you up!

49
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,970
What do you want to do?

50
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,990
Look! He’s going to beat us!

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,460
It’s your fault.

52
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,690
You even threatened us.

53
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,850
Listen,

54
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,510
Don’t you dare touch us!

55
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,430
If you touch us,

56
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,840
I’ll post a video online.

57
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,940
- Do it!
- Dare you!

58
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,170
Wow, amazing!

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,579
Cheng,

60
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,510
They claimed there’s a fly in our dessert.

61
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,570
They’re making trouble for us.

62
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,690
Don’t be afraid, Cheng.

63
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,060
I’m here.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,290
They can’t hurt you.

65
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,360
Cheng, go upstairs.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,630
We can handle it.

67
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,120
What do you want?

68
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,220
It’s simple.

69
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,640
Apologize to us and waive the charge.

70
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,310
Then it’ll be done.

71
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,250
How dare you say that?

72
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,590
OK. We can apologize,

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,090
but please compensate first.

74
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,690
We don’t care about the compensation.

75
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,570
What we care

76
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,930
is your apology.

77
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,370
Yep.

78
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,529
Looks like you don’t understand what I mean.

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,890
I mean you compensate us,

80
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,470
not we compensate you.

81
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,230
This set of plates,

82
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,460
I bought it from Italy.

83
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,540
You broke one of them.

84
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,080
Others will also be useless.

85
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,110
I spent 5,000 yuan on this set.

86
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,360
I’d like to give you a discount. What about 4,000 yuan?

87
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,140
Xuedong, pack other plates up.

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
OK.

89
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,830
You’re insane!

90
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,659
It’s just a plate.

91
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,890
You charge us 4,000 yuan!

92
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,730
You’re blackmailing us!

93
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,270
Search the plate online!

94
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,500
Lady,

95
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,140
about if there’s something wrong with our dessert,

96
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,640
you’re clearer on it than me.

97
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,720
I don’t make trouble for anyone,

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,870
yet I’m not afraid of troubles.

99
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,990
Don’t ever think that you’re young

100
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,490
so you can do whatever you want.

101
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,160
I’m not your mother

102
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,650
or boyfriend.

103
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,580
I won’t spoil you.

104
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:13,950
By the way,

105
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,490
delete the video you just recorded.

106
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:16,990
Otherwise,

107
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,760
I can sue you for invasion of privacy.

108
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,810
You...

109
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,010
You should go!

110
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,060
Let’s go!

111
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,210
Good job, Cheng.

112
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,370
Of course, she’s Cheng!

113
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,300
Chengcheng, there are many journalists in the Welfare House.

114
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,740
Do you have time now?

115
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,540
Don’t worry. I’ll come over.

116
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,360
I’m going to the Welfare House.

117
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,250
Guys, stay in the restaurant with Xuedong.

118
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,580
Shall we follow her?

119
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,070
Dian told us to protect her,

120
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,610
but she left.

121
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,940
Well, she asked us to stay here.

122
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,410
What if we call Dian

123
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,770
and ask him to follow Cheng?

124
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,090
Dian,

125
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,160
Cheng went to the Welfare House.

126
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,480
OK. I got it.

127
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,600
[The Second Welfare House of Linxi]

128
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,260
About the 2015 European International Dance Competition,

129
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,110
may I ask why did Cheng Feng miss it?

130
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,380
Did she miss it on purpose?

131
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,380
I have no idea about it,

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,140
but I know

133
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,370
Chengcheng is not that kind of person.

134
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,390
She must have had something really important,

135
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,840
so she left without telling anyone.

136
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,720
She didn’t tell anyone?

137
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,820
She’s so irresponsible like that?

138
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,940
No, what I mean is that

139
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,210
she must have had something significant

140
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,180
and she didn’t have time to tell me.

141
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,850
Cheng Feng’s absence affected

142
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,520
your performance so you got hurt, right?

143
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,420
The reason why I got hurt is that

144
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,000
I was not used to dancing alone.

145
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,190
That’s the real reason.

146
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,510
It has nothing to do with Chengcheng.

147
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,180
The absence of Cheng Feng

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,410
made you change the dance.

149
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,640
Even if it’s not the direct cause,

150
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,390
it still affected you indirectly.

151
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,770
No.

152
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,400
It’s my fault.

153
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,290
I was so stupid.

154
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,440
I fell down when I danced.

155
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,910
It has nothing to do with Chengcheng.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,050
It’s all my fault.

157
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,460
You’re still trying to protect her.

158
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,870
You’re so kind.

159
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,450
May I ask what kind of impact

160
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,080
on your life and financial status did you feel

161
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,780
after you got hurt

162
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,620
and left the stage?

163
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,880
What I look like now,

164
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,860
you can see it.

165
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,010
I heard that your boyfriend broke up with you

166
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,020
for your disability. Is that true?

167
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,780
No more questions, please.

168
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,540
- Ms. An.
- Stop asking me, please.

169
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,020
Step aside.

170
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,640
Ms. Cheng,

171
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,130
why did you miss the competition that year?

172
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,280
May I ask did you cause

173
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,890
the leg injury of Ms. An?

174
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,820
Throughout the years,

175
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,740
what you have done for the Welfare House

176
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,880
is not for charity.

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
It’s for redemption

178
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,600
which can make you feel better,

179
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,000
right?

180
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,640
Before, in the Book Cafe,

181
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,560
I think I’ve made it clear.

182
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,750
I don’t wanna explain again.

183
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
So let’s stop here today.

184
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,440
Ms. An.

185
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,910
You made Ms. An break her leg,

186
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,050
but you act like nothing happened.

187
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,670
You’re disgusting.

188
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,640
Your attitude is savage.

189
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,690
Rumor has it that you bullied your schoolmates.

190
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,570
It must be true.

191
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,450
Yes, it must.

192
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:15,890
Yes.

193
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,770
If you have further questions, you can ask me.

194
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,740
Let’s talk there.

195
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,070
Are you okay?

196
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:33,980
Slow it down.

197
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,059
You okay?

198
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,250
Don’t worry. I’m fine.

199
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,090
Dian,

200
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,410
wait for me outside.

201
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,600
I want to talk to An Yin.

202
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,150
OK.

203
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,440
Did you get hurt?

204
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,760
Do you need to see a doctor?

205
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,710
I’m fine. Luckily, you came here.

206
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,510
Otherwise, I don’t know

207
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
how to deal with them.

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,730
It happened because of me.

209
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,980
Don’t worry. I’ll fix it as soon as possible.

210
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,070
Hi.

211
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,080
Chengcheng,

212
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,730
the endorsement shoot

213
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,570
has to be suspended,

214
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,370
because your personal affair

215
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,690
affected our brand a lot.

216
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,140
Our company is trying to solve it.

217
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,640
Anyway, don’t worry.

218
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,350
I’ll try my best to help you.

219
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,650
I can totally understand that.

220
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,110
OK, that’s it.

221
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,510
If I hear anything new,

222
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,570
I’ll let you know in time.

223
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,790
What happened, Chengcheng?

224
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,180
My endorsement

225
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,550
shoot for HA has been suspended.

226
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,360
What should you do?

227
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,790
It’s suspended

228
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,610
instead of terminated. It’s OK.

229
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,750
You changed a lot, Chengcheng.

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,250
Who you used to be

231
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,230
was pessimistic.

232
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,260
Now even if

233
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,710
you’re in big trouble,

234
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,730
you still remain calm.

235
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,320
I’m happy for you.

236
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,830
Before,

237
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,890
I didn’t care about myself.

238
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,700
But now,

239
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,330
for myself

240
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,530
and also for him,

241
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,830
I wanna be a better person.

242
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,840
Why are you here?

243
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,350
I went to the Book Cafe.

244
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,090
Lian Ruosheng told me that

245
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,410
you came here in a hurry.

246
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,470
I’m worried about you,

247
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,530
so I came here.

248
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,730
Luckily, I arrived here in time.

249
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,570
If someone snapped,

250
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,330
it would be troublesome.

251
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,560
My endorsement for HA may be terminated.

252
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,140
Just because of it?

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,450
Capitalists are ruthless.

254
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,170
But it’s OK.

255
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,840
As long as we can solve it,

256
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,850
we'll be good.

257
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,910
Well,

258
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,140
did you ask them?

259
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,150
Any updates?

260
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,840
They said due to the data management,

261
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,940
all recordings were deleted.

262
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,050
They asked me to look for the copy.

263
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,870
Actually, there is another way.

264
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,510
You can ask An Yin

265
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,910
to clarify what happened

266
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,890
since she’s involved.

267
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,790
What she says is reliable.

268
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,120
Do you really think it’s gonna work?

269
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,190
No matter what she says,

270
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,860
people will just think that

271
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,570
I’m using my friend for my own benefit.

272
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,290
In the end,

273
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,180
there will be more crimes for me.

274
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,080
Alright,

275
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,800
if it’s not gonna work,

276
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,720
we can try another way.

277
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,450
As long as we can find a way,

278
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,900
there is still a glimmer of hope.

279
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,160
I’ll definitely find out

280
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,100
who spread the rumor secretly.

281
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,330
Why do you look at me like that?

282
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,310
After you fell in love,

283
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,460
you became sensitive.

284
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,480
Give the cold Cheng back to me.

285
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,010
Surprise!

286
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,540
How’s that?

287
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,370
Cheng,

288
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,380
what do you think of our dance?

289
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,210
It’s better than your debut dance.

290
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,680
I… I think

291
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,000
being a comedian

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,790
is more suitable for you.

293
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,200
What are you doing?

294
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:02,810
What did you say?

295
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,560
It’s going to explode!

296
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,230
Stop. It’s going to explode!

297
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,140
Smells good.

298
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,810
Where is she?

299
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,090
I’m starving.

300
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,540
Lian Ruoshen,

301
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,820
come here to join us.

302
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,740
Wait a moment.

303
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,800
She’s coming.

304
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,290
Yun, you’re finally here.

305
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,650
We’ve been waiting for you.

306
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,270
Come in, please.

307
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,160
I’ll sit here.

308
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,530
Yun,

309
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,250
you didn’t answer our calls

310
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,350
or text us back, did you?

311
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,690
Chengcheng, they insulted you online.

312
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,360
I was angry.

313
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,380
I wanted to scold them,

314
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,960
but there were too many people.

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,500
I couldn’t scold all of them.

316
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,200
I’m fine,

317
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,050
as long as you’re not angry anymore.

318
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,840
Well, since all of us are here,

319
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,890
let’s toast together

320
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,530
to sweep away the bad luck and turn the tide.

321
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,200
- OK.
- OK. Let’s do it.

322
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,610
Cheers.

323
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:26,810
Here you are.

324
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,960
Yun, just tell me

325
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,810
if we’re still friends.

326
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,570
If you think we can’t be friends anymore

327
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,370
because of Lian Ruoshen,

328
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,440
I’ll never show up

329
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,890
in front of you

330
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,810
from tomorrow.

331
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,530
I don’t want us to feel awkward.

332
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,300
If you think we can still be friends,

333
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,390
please drink this toast.

334
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,220
Let’s forget about the past.

335
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,080
In the future, I’ll treat you like before.

336
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,750
You’re still my friend, Yun.

337
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,360
I didn’t mean that.

338
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,210
Although I was angry,

339
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,630
I never wanted to

340
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,510
end our friendship.

341
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,300
I…

342
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,160
I just couldn’t accept that

343
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,020
my friend

344
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,000
made my student become a star

345
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,540
without telling me,

346
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,400
knowing that I’d be mad.

347
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:58,850
But…

348
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,580
Maybe you’re right.

349
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,440
I’m just his teacher.

350
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,390
I can’t make decisions for him.

351
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,120
Recently,

352
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,670
I’ve been thinking.

353
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,890
Maybe I…

354
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,530
I made peace with Baoling.

355
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,020
It has nothing to do with you.

356
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,000
About you,

357
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,070
I haven’t made my mind up yet.

358
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,120
OK.

359
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,800
I just hope that all of us are happy.

360
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,430
That’s enough.

361
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,620
Enjoy the hot pot.

362
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,330
The food is delicious.

363
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,530
Let’s eat.

364
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,230
Be careful.

365
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,770
Baoling,

366
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,609
take him home.

367
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,980
I have something to tell Yun.

368
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,130
I don’t wanna talk to you.

369
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,790
What are you doing?

370
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,670
Are you jealous?

371
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,359
I also feel jealous of them.

372
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,730
Sometimes, I just don’t understand

373
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,320
why people like us

374
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,250
are still single.

375
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,500
Did the world change?

376
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,870
I’m different with you.

377
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,720
I don’t want to be in love.

378
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,350

756
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,790
all the things.

757
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,650
Chengcheng.

758
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,280
I’m OK.

759
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,720
Since she hates you so much,

760
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,100
will she hurt you again in the future?

761
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,220
I’ve already given her a chance.

762
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,820
If she keeps annoying me,

763
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,980
I’ll publish the voice recording which can

764
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,470
prove that she incited her fan to slander me.

765
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,080
Dian is going abroad tomorrow.

766
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,800
This Master Salon

767
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,380
is essential to his career.

768
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,010
I don’t want to affect him

769
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:18,710
at this critical moment.

770
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,580
You’re so sweet.

771
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,680
Well,

772
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,020
Lian Ruoshen will have a trial tomorrow.

773
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,730
Come here to support me.

774
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,320
I will even if you forget to tell me.

775
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,290
Buddy,

776
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,500
your patent has been valued.

777
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,520
Do you want to sell it for 300,000 yuan?

778
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,410
Yes

779
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,490
OK. I’ll inform him tomorrow.

780
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,330
I’ll ask him to

781
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,960
pay you this week.

782
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,920
Inform him now.

783
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,740
I want you to inform him now.

784
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,060
Why are you impatient?

785
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,860
Look, it’s getting dark.

786
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,090
Soon he’ll be off duty.

787
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,290
Tomorrow I’ll inform him.

788
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,920
Focus on your experiment.
