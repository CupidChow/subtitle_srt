Episode 21

5
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,070
Chengcheng,

6
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,590
I’ve been waiting for you at hospital for a long time.

7
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,190
Why didn’t you…

8
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,430
Why didn’t you go there?

9
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,910
What is it?

10
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,820
Dian, I can explain.

11
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,509
Explain what?

12
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,630
Explain why you want to break the promise

13
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,910
that you won’t sign the contract?

14
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,150
It’s not like what you think.

15
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,180
Please let me explain.

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,940
Explain what?

17
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,820
Explain why you came to him

18
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,750
when I was waiting for you.

19
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,870
Dian, relax.

20
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,110
Sit down and have a talk with me.

21
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,030
Could you please let go of my hand?

22
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,750
Let go of your hand? Then you’ll come to him, right?

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,180
Why?

24
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,030
Why

25
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,910
you didn’t listen to me all the time?

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,550
Why do you want to sign the contract?

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,430
I’ve told you

28
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,390
not to contact him.

29
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,270
Not to contact him.

30
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,990
It’s not like what you think.

31
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,630
So what’s it like?

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,470
Tell me what it is like!

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,270
Today because…

34
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,750
Let go of my hand!

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,430
Sister ,

36
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,350
are you mad at me?

37
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,990
You hate me.

38
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,070
No.

39
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,420
I’m just tired.

40
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,180
Sorry, it won’t happen again.

41
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,060
I promise.

42
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,829
Dian,

43
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,150
do you think

44
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,790
I was wrong?

45
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,390
If I listened to Yun and chose not to sing,

46
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,910
Baoling wouldn’t have to suffer with me.

47
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,710
Recently,

48
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,550
because of me,

49
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,990
people ignored and taunted Baoling.

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,550
She used to be a famous

51
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,580
celebrity manager.

52
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,220
How proud she was!

53
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,740
Now people bully her,

54
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,740
but she can’t strike back.

55
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,110
I feel sorry for her.

56
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,550
Dian,

57
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,950
do you think I’m a burden on her?

58
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,190
Before I became a star,

59
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,540
I already knew the entertainment industry is complicated.

60
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,710
However,

61
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,380
I didn’t expect that it’s so disgusting.

62
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,750
Why can’t people

63
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,590
stop hurting others

64
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,030
and make peace?

65
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,110
I just want to be a singer.

66
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,150
If Yun knows

67
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,070
what I look like now,

68
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,110
will she be worried about me?

69
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,580
Maybe.

70
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,790
Thank you for comforting me, Dian.

71
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,740
After I dropped out of school,

72
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,230
I texted her many times,

73
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,700
but she never replied to me.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,300
Maybe I really hurt her this time.

75
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,150
It’s too late to say anything.

76
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,940
Baoling suffered a lot for me.

77
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,100
Now I can’t give up.

78
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,740
I don’t want to be a jerk.

79
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,550
No matter how hard it is,

80
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,430
I’ll keep going down this way

81
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,260
with Baoling.

82
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,580
No matter how hard it is,

83
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,030
We have to stick to it.

84
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,380
Dian,

85
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,070
how is it going?

86
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,140
Do you have some trouble?

87
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,710
I’m sick.

88
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,510
Sick?

89
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,030
What’s the disease?

90
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,060
It’s

91
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,900
paranoid personality disorder.

92
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,710
Why are you sick?

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,780
The doctor said

94
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,620
it’s related to my original family.

95
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,110
When I was young, I didn’t get enough love.

96
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,020
So when I grow up,

97
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,020
I cherish love.

98
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,020
After I fall in love,

99
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,390
I tend to be afraid of losing.

100
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,780
I often think a lot.

101
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,540
Dian.

102
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,310
Do you think

103
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,790
whether she’ll leave me?

104
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,140
No, she won’t.

105
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,660
You’ve been through a lot together.

106
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,540
Your love grew with the years.

107
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,100
She won’t leave you.

108
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,670
Really?

109
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,460
Dian,

110
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,700
stop thinking.

111
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,420
When you were healthy, Cheng treated you well.

112
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,390
Now you’re sick.

113
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,620
She must be worried about you.

114
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,500
Why will she leave you?

115
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,550
So

116
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,820
my sickness

117
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,150
can make her stay with me.

118
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,909
Dian,

119
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,140
stop talking like that. I’m scared.

120
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,580
I’m just kidding.

121
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,060
You scared me.

122
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,260
Yes,

123
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,430
since I’m sick,

124
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,780
she won’t leave me.

125
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,500
Baoling,

126
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,990
Ruoshen is drunk.

127
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,750
We’re on the roof of the school.

128
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,140
Go pick him up.

129
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,300
Baoling,

130
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,780
why are you here?

131
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,980
Am I in a dream?

132
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,430
No, you’re not.

133
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,460
Baoling,

134
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,420
sorry.

135
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,350
I’m a burden on you.

136
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,020
Do you think we will…

137
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,580
We will…

138
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,700
But I don’t wanna give up.

139
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,340
My dream is to be a singer.

140
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,340
I hope I can sing all the time.

141
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,660
OK.

142
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,580
As long as you don’t want to give up,

143
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,260
I’ll work hard with you.

144
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,620
As long as you want to sing,

145
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,860
you should focus on the music.

146
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,020
About other things,

147
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,140
I’ll deal with them.

148
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,110
I gotta go.

149
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,310
Take care of him.

150
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,340
When will you

151
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,420
forgive Lian Ruoshen and me?

152
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,460
Are you begging me?

153
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,070
Tell me what you want.

154
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,590
We can talk,

155
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,110
but you need to talk with me in bed.

156
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,140
Otherwise,

157
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,860
let’s stop here.

158
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,910
Who’s there?

159
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,070
Why it’s you again?

160
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,910
Why am I in the same room?

161
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,260
I don’t know.

162
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,780
I could stay at home,

163
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,260
but I chose to take care of you here.

164
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,830
When you were sleeping, you moved.

165
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,420
You kicked me to the ground.

166
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,100
Why am I here?

167
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,860
I thought I was drinking

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,140
with Dian on the roof.

169
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,200
[Got a New Message]

170
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,670
Dai Baoling slept with DK for you.

171
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,700
What happened?

172
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,580
If you don’t believe me,

173
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,690
come to Room 408 of 24K.

174
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,900
Where are you going?

175
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
Dian, go to 24K as soon as possible!

176
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Lian Ruoshen is going to beat DK up.

177
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,940
I can’t stop him.

178
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,380
I called Baoling and Cheng.

179
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,100
They didn’t answer. You should persuade Ruoshen.

180
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,300
OK. I’m coming.

181
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,780
The jerk wanted to sleep with me.

182
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,940
He’s insane. How dare him!

183
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,060
He’s disgusting.

184
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,500
Chengcheng,

185
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,260
you should punish your boyfriend.

186
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,150
Why did he bite you?

187
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:26,900
Chengcheng,

188
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,220
tell me the truth.

189
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,420
If he hurts you,

190
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,500
I won’t forgive him.

191
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,420
He has paranoid personality disorder

192
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,420

00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,690
Why are you here?

383
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,770
Get out!

384
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,090
Don’t be mad at me.

385
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,050
I’m here to visit you.

386
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,570
You look tired.

387
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,090
Baoling,

388
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,450
you’ve been working

389
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,410
in the industry many years.

390
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,290
Because of that stupid boy,

391
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,410
your career will be ended.

392
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,250
Is he worth it?

393
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,210
None of your business!

394
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,570
Why is it none of my business?

395
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,450
In Royal Entertainment, I

396
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,530
helped you a lot,

397
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,090
but you didn’t pay me back.

398
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,330
Instead, you have a crush on him.

399
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,050
You disappointed me.

400
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,620
I always think that you’re smart.

401
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,610
I didn’t expect that you could be so stupid.

402
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,410
For that boy,

403
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,660
you sold your car and your house.

404
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,730
You drank with others and begged them.

405
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,770
When someone harassed you,

406
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,570
you were afraid to fight back.

407
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,820
Now you even have gastric perforation.

408
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,580
What are you looking for?

409
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,660
After leaving Royal Entertainment,

410
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,810
your life became miserable.

411
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,180
I’ve told you before.

412
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,890
As long as you want to go back,

413
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,610
I welcome you at any time.

414
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,530
Whoever I like,

415
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,050
it’s none of your business.

416
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,290
What you said is disgusting.

417
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,890
Check your phone.

418
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,170
I sent a video to you.

419
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,820
I didn’t plan to

420
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,970
be completely ruthless,

421
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,340
but you made me change my mind.

422
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,210
Should I sue him

423
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,290
or publish the video online?

424
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,330
About what happened,

425
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,180
you’re clear on it.

426
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,290
But

427
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,490
why is there a camera in the box?

428
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,330
You think you’re smart,

429
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,450
but someone took advantage of you.

430
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,170
I came to you.

431
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,650
How did Lian Ruoshen know about that?

432
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,130
Who told him?

433
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,170
I think you’re clearer on it than me.

434
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,930
Zhou Yao, wait me in the company.

435
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,650
Baoling,

436
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,610
why are you here?

437
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,880
I’m going to visit you.

438
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,450
Yun, I can’t find Lian Ruoshem.

439
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,970
I can’t find Lian Ruoshen.

440
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,130
Calm down.

441
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,370
He’s an adult.

442
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,610
He knows what he is doing.

443
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,000
Take care of yourself first. OK?

444
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,010
Come here and sit down, please.

445
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,690
Come here.

446
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,450
Sit down.

447
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,650
It took me three hours to make the soup.

448
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,970
Have a taste now.

449
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,210
Yun,

450
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,490
don't you blame me?

451
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,210
I did blame you,

452
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,930
but now I don’t blame you anymore.

453
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,330
I realized that

454
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,290
he and me

455
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,610
are completely different.

456
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,050
We have different values.

457
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,290
The things we pursue are different too.

458
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,770
So no one is wrong.

459
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,490
Yes,

460
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,370
you’re right.

461
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,250
As long as he is gifted,

462
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,210
I could make him famous.

463
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,690
However, it’s ironic that

464
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,850
I just gave him hope

465
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,490
but I failed to make his dream come true.

466
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,650
He has to make his dream come true by himself.

467
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,570
You can’t help him.

468
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,130
Besides, you already

469
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,330
did many things for him.

470
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,130
He’ll get it.

471
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,970
You don’t have to blame yourself.

472
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:52,690
OK.

473
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,880
Baoling, recently

474
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,930
I thought a lot.

475
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,010
I found that people

476
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,570
need some time to reflect.

477
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,090
Maybe after thinking, you’ll find

478
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,250
the reality is not that bad.

479
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,210
We can’t get everything we want.

480
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,730
Yun,

481
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,290
you changed a lot.

482
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,490
You became better.

is for you.

486
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,450
Listen to it carefully.

487
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,570

488

Ms. Gao!

493
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,160
Fine. I should give up singing.

494
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,090
I hate my life.

495
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,530
Chengcheng told me about his new song.

496
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,880
I also know that for him,

497
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,810
you mortgaged your car and your house.

498
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,490
Here is 200,000 yuan.

499

Hope it can be helpful.

500
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,840
If you want to give it to him,

501
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,890
please give it in person.

507
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,130
Will you return here?

508
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I don’t think so.

509
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,440
If you miss me,

510
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,930
you can come to my home.

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,970

don’t want to see him before leaving?

Zhou Yao?

582
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,680
I heard what happened last night.

583
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,760
Are you okay?

584
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,240
Dian,

585
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,120
I’ll let him pay for what he did.

586
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,920
[Royal Entertainment]

587
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,320
You told Lian Ruoshen

588
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,080
what happened to Baoling, right?

589
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,920
I’ve told you before that

590
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,760
you’ll come back to me again.

591
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,370
You know what,

592
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,130
DK has a video which can prove

593
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,160
that Lian Ruoshen beat him.

594
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,040
If this video is published online,

595
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,920
Lian Ruoshen will go to jail.

596
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
His career will go to an end.

597
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,690
Jiang Dian is an accomplice.

598
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,160
Do you think he can get away with it?

599
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,280
However, if you agree to my conditions,

600
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,800
I’ll help you persuade DK.

601
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,320
I’m the cash cow of the company.

602
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,320
I’m more valuable than anything.

603
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,650
I’ll give you one day.

604
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,240
Hope that you can make a wise choice.

605
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,570
I can agree

606
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,080
as long as you fire Pang Ting.

607
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,320
Her presence always irritates me.

608
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,000
It reminds me that you betrayed me

609
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,280
and started the show business with her.

610
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,320
OK. I promise you.

611
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,480
It’s easy.

612
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,280
I’ve always wanted to fire her

613
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,760
because she’s no longer suitable

614
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,480
to be my celebrity manager.

615
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,400
It’s useless to keep her.

616
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,040
It’s a deal!

617
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,480
You agreed so soon.

618
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,360
I didn’t expect that.

619
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
She did so many things for you,

620
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,080
but you abandoned her easily.

621
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,120
No wonder

622
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,040
you betrayed me easily.

623
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,760
You’re different from her.

624
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,320
She’s just my partner,

625
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,170
but you’re always

626
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,240
the most important person to me.

627
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
Tomorrow there is an event

628
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,440
called Dancing Stars.

629
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,800
You need to come with me as my partner.

630
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,280
I’ll send you the details later.

631
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,490
Cheng Feng!

632
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,720
Why can’t you

633
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,120
just disappear in front of me?

634
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,360
Do you think he’ll

635
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,040
be different when I’m gone?

636
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,120
Are you stupid or are you pretending to be stupid?

637
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,320
Even if you die for him,

638
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,790
he’ll never

639
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,000
be grateful to you

640
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,040
because he’s heartless.

641
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,640
Throughout his life,

642
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,320
he only loves himself.

643
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,240
I think you heard what he said.

644
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
You’re just a chess piece to him.

645
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,880
He can abandon you at any time.

646
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,440
When you’re useless, he’ll abandon you.

647
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,280
That’s enough.

648
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,120
Don’t try to alienate me from him.

649
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,530
Tell me.

650
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,880
What’s your intention

651
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,050
to let me witness the scene?

652
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,600
He took advantage of Lian Ruoshen

653
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,760
and forced me to cooperate with him.

654
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,560
Sorry,

655
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,560
I don’t want to cooperate with him.

656
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,520
Since you also don’t want me to contact him,

657
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,840
I think we can cooperate.

658
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,920
What do you mean?

659
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,040
No, it’s too risky.

660
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,720
I can’t bet my

661
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,400
career.

662
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Are you sure?

663
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,040
If you don’t cooperate with me,

664
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,670
how long do you think you can stay here?

665
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,120
Stop talking.

666
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,800
I won’t agree.

667
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,280
Chengcheng, can you come to visit me?

668
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,120
Dude,

669
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,160
did you buy the breakfast

670
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,200
in space?

671
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,800
You didn’t answer my phone.

672
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,040
I know everything now.

673
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,040
I know what you did for me

674
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,830
and how you feel.

675
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,670
You don’t have to feel sorry.

676
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
Everything I did for you,

677
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,960
I did it of my own free will.

678
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,000
It has nothing to do with you.

679
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,760
If it has bothered you,

680
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,600
I’ll say sorry to you.

681
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,240
Baoling, I don’t deserve your love.

682
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,880
I haven’t told you how I feel yet.

683
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
You already refused.

684
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,920
Although

685
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,240
you refused,

686
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,760
I still want to

687
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,030
tell you about my feelings.

688
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,920
Ruoshen, to be honest,

689
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,990
I didn’t like you at first.

690
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,760
You’re not eloquent.

691
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,680
You’re not efficient.

692
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,720
You’re not handsome.

693
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,920
I said I didn’t like you.

694
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,760
Actually, I even hated you.

695
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,200
However, it’s funny that

696
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,120
I have a crush on someone who I

697
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,680
hated before.

698
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,910
I still remember on the anniversary,

699
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,800
I went to your school and planned to pick someone.

700
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,310
When the show was ending soon,

701
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,560
I still didn’t pick anyone.

702
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,830
I was about to leave,

703
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,640
but your voice made me stay.

704
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,190
Actually, you’re charming

705
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,720
when you sing a song.

706
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,910
Later I sacrificed

707
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,110
my friendship with Yun

708
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,110
and made you become a star.

709
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,160
Then

710
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
I was completely obsessed by

711
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,000
your hardworking spirit

712
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,320
and your frankness.

713
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,120
You promised me you’ll stay if I stay.

714
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
At that time, I decided to

715
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,960
help you fulfil your dream

716
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,040
at any price,

717
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,280
even if I have to give up my dream.

718
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,550
We can hardly explain the love.

719
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,840
We can’t force others to love us back.

720
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,640
The reason why I talked to you

721
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,440
is not that I want you to feel guilty.

722
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,550
I just don’t want myself live to regret.

723
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,280
You don’t have to

724
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,560
feel guilty because of me

725
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,270
and force yourself to be together with me.

726
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,400
Ruoshen,

727
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,990
if you still want to

728
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,160
work with me,

729
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,360
I’ll always be there for you.

730
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,110
If you don’t,

731
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,880
I’ll respect your decision.

732
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,160
Yun gave you 200,000 yuan.

733
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,480
Her flight is going to take off at 17:00.

734
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,190
You still have time to go to the airport.
