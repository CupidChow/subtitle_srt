like you weren’t afraid of death?

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,500

Don’t come here again.

Although you’re not disabled,

556
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,560
your legs are still injured.

557
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,750
You don’t have to do this.

558
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,300
So, are you caring about me?

559
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,680
You’re so glib.

560
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,950
Seems like you are fine.

561
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,150
You will know if you follow me.

562
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,000
No more stairs.

563
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,870
We’re arriving soon.

564
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,280
Open your eyes.

565
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,570
This was my world.

566
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,910
It was colored when you came.

567
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,860
It was you

568
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,490
that made me want to

569
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,110
hug someone.

570
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,110
Of course, I was too impulsive.

571
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,160
So, maybe you think

572
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,850
my feelings are just temporary.

573
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,530
But I’m not that kind of man.

574
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,450
I don’t do this to everyone.

575
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,870
I know

576
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,460
you won’t have feelings for me today.

577
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,060
But I just want you to be happy.

578
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,430
That’s enough.

579
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,960
Cheng Feng.

580
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,909
Will you let me

581
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,179
spend this winter with you?

582
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,260
Just a winter?

583
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,530
Even if I say yes,

584
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,570
how long do you think we can be together?

585
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,739
Actually,

586
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,639
we are kind of alike, don’t you think?

587
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,260
We are lonely

588
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,800
though we don’t seem so.

589
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,560
We seem to be passive.

590
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,659
It’s all because that

591
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,170
we haven’t met the one.

592
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,800
We seem indifferent.

593
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,350
But we are more enthusiastic than anyone else.

594
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,550
And we also aspire for love.

595
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,760
Yes, I still don’t know you well enough.

596
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,860
But I believe that

597
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,830
this could work out

598
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,900
if you give me time since we are so similar.

599
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,220
I will get to know you.

600
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,200
I can. Trust me.

601
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,030
Know me?

602
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,880
To know me is to ignore my will

603
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,460
and enter my life without permission.

604
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,060
To know me is to give me troubles

605
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,900
after I refuse you.

606
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,460
To know me is

607
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,760
to disturb me,

608
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
yet you will study abroad soon.

609
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,580
You think that’s how

610
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,770
you love me.

611
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,950
But it’s irresponsibility.

612
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,760
We don’t

613
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,940
have common interests.

614
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,260
No common topics.

615
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,300
How can we continue

616
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,150
when the passion subsides?

617
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,200
We can make it happen.

618
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,130
No.

619
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,460
Even if we don’t have common topics,

620
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,310
I can find one.

621
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,390
You… You said

622
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,460
you like dancing, and you like cats.

623
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,260
You like drinking. I like

624
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,060
everything you like.

625
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,580
How would you think these are what I like?

626
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,850
I drink because

627
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,170
I haven’t found anything

628
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,620
more nerve numbing than alcohol.

629
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,780
I have a cat

630
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,720
just because I think he’s poor

631
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,900
and feed him some food.

632
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,420
As for dancing,

633
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,020
it’s you who think I like it. Not me.

634
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,830
I don’t even know

635
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,930
what I like myself.

636
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,030
How can you like what I like?

637
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,570
So, don’t waste your energy anymore.

638
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,500
Please abide by the agreement.

639
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,190
So, you

640
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,090
faked all

641
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:11,750
your feelings today?

642
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,180
You are still clear-minded.

643
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,260
So, seems like you haven’t touched yourself.

644
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,200
Tell me

645
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,570
if it’s disappointing

646
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,990
to work in vain?

647
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,350
This is me.

648
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,950
I’m selfish and cruel.

649
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,500
You said we are alike.

650
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,300
Let me tell you this.

651
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,630
I don’t even like myself.

652
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,320
How can I like you?

653
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,070
I don’t believe you haven’t been touched

654
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,260
for a moment today.

655
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,090
Playing basketball. Riding a bicycle.

656
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,630
Your eyes won’t lie.

657
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,050
Although I don’t know

658
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,840
what happened to you before,

659
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,520
♫ I want to know why you feel lonely ♫

660
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,380
I know you

661
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,280
♫ I want to stay with you ♫

662
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,610
deserve to be liked.

663
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,120
You have every right to be liked.

664
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,630
♫ I wanna tell you not to be afraid of the dark since I’m here ♫

665
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,410
Cheng Feng, I won’t give up.

666
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,700
♫ I want to keep you warm ♫

667
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,420
I won’t.

668
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,390
♫ Pray that you will keep it ♫

669
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:26,030
♫ It’s okay. I will rest assured if you are happy ♫

670
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,260
♫ How satisfactory can love be

671
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,140
♫ It’s the dearest company

672
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,520
♫ I’ve been used to it ♫

673
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,730
Some people like you.

674
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,290
♫ Even my tears are brave ♫

675
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,910
But they stop liking you after they know you.

676
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,270
♫ The moments of our memory ♫

677
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:49,830
After I saw your laziness and sensibility,

678
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,500
♫ The answer you are looking for in every minute ♫

679
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,180
I found that you are lonely and weak.

680
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,440
♫ I really want to shoulder everything for you ♫

681
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,740
I felt your cruelty and indifference.

682
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,310
♫ I may feel lonely in youth ♫

683
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,820
But I got more obsessed.

684
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,120
You said I haven’t touched myself.

685
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,250
♫ I can be brave when I’m with you ♫

686
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,760
But I

687
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,690
♫ Time has taught us ♫

688
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,540
never treated this

689
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,420
♫ to be grateful for having each other ♫

690
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,440
as a game.

691
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,430
♫ I laugh and cry because of you ♫

692
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,410
♫ I spent all the best time with you ♫

693
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:31,560
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫
