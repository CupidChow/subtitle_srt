OK. I’ll wait for you.

I’m here!

190
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,920
Two days ago,

191
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,410
something happened to my research lab,

192
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,820
and my phone powered off at that time.

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,410
So, I didn’t reply to you in time.

194
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,690
The physical experiment can’t be an excuse.

195
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,500
Your phone can’t be an excuse, either.

196
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,210
I remember

197
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,900
your phone often powers off.

198
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,220

199
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,070
I’m sorry.

It won’t happen again.

201
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,890
Again? I don’t wanna meet you again.

202
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,470
By the way,

203
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,230
you flirted with other women

204
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,120
in front of me.

205
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,870
Are you jealous?

206
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,210
Yes. It’s obvious.

207
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,020
Excuse me. I’m sorry to bother you.

208
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,850
Professor Jiang,

209
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,880
your second speech is going to start.

210
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,370
- I’ll be right there. - OK.

211
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,570
I owe you. I’ll make up for it next time.

212
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,590
I don’t care.

215

Chengcheng, what’s wrong?

216
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,410
A person can be

217
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,130
completely different within three years.

218
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,630
What happened?

219
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,210
Why did you say that?

220

He’s not cute anymore.

It’s no big deal.

as long as your love remains the same.

225
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,450
By the way, you also changed.

226
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,130
You became more jealous

227
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,400
and cuter.

228
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,380
You’re totally different with

229

So what?

238
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,590
He doesn’t have time to see me

239
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,050
and he even flirted with other women.

240
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,050
Let’s stop talking about me.

241
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,540

you haven’t found the best man.

I really like him so much.

♫ Love. Love. Love. Love’s way Love’s way ♫

560
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,560
Great. No matter how time flies,

561
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,230
we don’t change.

562
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,220
♫ Love ♫

563
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,040
♫ Every time I want to say something ♫

564
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,830
♫ I’d practice it several times in heart ♫

565
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:17,920
♫ Limited memory becomes infinite ♫

566
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,020
♫ Because you are by my side ♫

567
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,720
♫ Love. Love. Time is a little sweet ♫

568
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,150
Before I thought

569
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,520
the best thing of our life

570
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,360
♫ Love. Love. I’m waiting for you to show up ♫

571
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,400
is to meet someone.

572
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,350
Now I realized that

573
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,920
♫ Love. Love. Love ♫

574
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,290
it’s harder to

575
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,650
meet someone again.

576
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,200
♫ Love. Love. Love ♫

577
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,130
♫ Love. Love. Love. Love’s way. Love’s way ♫

578
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,070
Hope that

579
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,870
time can slow down,

580
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,500
and people can always be together.

581
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,100
♫ Love. Love. Exclusive cover for youth ♫

582
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,260
Hope everything is good

583
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,460
when we meet again.

584
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,760
♫ Love. Love. It’s the world you give me ♫

585
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,910
♫ Love. Love. Love. Love’s way. Love’s way ♫
