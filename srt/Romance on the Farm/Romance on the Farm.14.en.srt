00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,650
he wouldn't have

192
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,260
lost the book.

193
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
Since Young Master Song is trying so hard

194
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640
to make up for it,

195
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,150
let's give him a chance.

196
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,700
Master Liu.

197
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,950
Master Wu said the wine is pretty good.

198
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,850
Order 100 jars and get them delivered to the capital city.

199
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,460
This time,

200
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,500
be careful.

201
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,580
If anything goes wrong again...

202
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,730
Let Master Wu rest assured.

203
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,410
I got it.

204
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,190
I'm on it.

205
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,850
[Song]

206
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,000
Mother.

207
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,930
Please have some tea.

208
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,910
Lady Hua'er.

209
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,700
Do you admit your mistake?

210
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,730
I don't know what I did wrong.

211
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,330
Please enlighten me, Mother.

212
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,330
You lost the jade pendant we gave you

213
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,820
even before you married into our Song family.

214
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,280
You bought a fake jade pendant to replace it.

215
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,550
Not only did you marry into our family with debts,

216
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,510
but you also

217
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,430
try to be clever

218
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,050
and lie to Her Ladyship now.

219
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,040
You don't know what you did wrong?

220
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,460
I know what I did wrong.

221
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,220
About the jade pendant,

222
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,240
I shouldn't have lied to you, Mother.

223
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,220
But when I lost the jade pendant,

224
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,110
I was so anxious.

225
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,220
My husband has always been nice to me.

226
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,450
I really don't want to

227
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,540
cause him trouble.

228
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,560
That's why I got confused

229
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,450
and bought a fake jade pendant.

230
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,840
Sit down and talk.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,720
I'm glad that

232
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,630
your husband treats you well.

233
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,790
As a husband,

234
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,870
it's his duty to treat you well.

235
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,920
But

236
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,930
you've been plotting

237
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
against your husband, haven't you?

238
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,500
Mother.

239
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,700
Why do you say so?

240
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,170
I have never

241
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,020
been disloyal to my husband, Mother.

242
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,830
Even if I have all the guts in the world,

243
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,320
I wouldn't dare to plot against him.

244
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,330
Then, do you know

245
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,810
your husband is not my biological son?

246
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,960
No, I don't.

247
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,420
Didn't you marry into the Song family

248
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,160
in the hope of raising your social status?

249
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,350
Mother, I'm not...

250
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,670
Didn't your mother tell you

251
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,200
not to interrupt when the elders are talking?

252
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,650
But you plotted

253
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,140
too early.

254
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,320
Although Hailong is nominally my son,

255
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,690
in terms of wisdom and knowledge,

256
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,300
he inherited these from

257
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,710
his inferior mother.

258
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,810
He's mediocre and feckless.

259
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,350
And he never fights to be the best

260
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,480
among his brothers.

261
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,410
So,

262
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,590
even when he wanted

263
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,650
to marry a girl from the countryside,

264
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,910
I didn't say no.

265
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,220
From now on,

266
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,100
as long as you live in peace and don't cause trouble,

267
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,090
I will make sure you live comfortably.

268
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,790
I got it, Mother.

269
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,670
Her Ladyship is kind and nice,

270
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,070
but I'm not.

271
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,880
Lady Hua'er.

272
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,290
Think about it.

273
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,190
What else are you hiding from Her Ladyship?

274
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,920
I don't know.

275
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,820
Please enlighten me, Mother.

276
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,720
Since you don't know,

277
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,600
from now on,

278
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,250
deduct half of Lady Hua'er's household's monthly salary,

279
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,680
and cut the charcoal by half.

280
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,810
Only leave 3 or 4 servants

281
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,470
for her.

282
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,630
I really don't know, Mother.

283
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,840
Please enlighten me, Mother.

284
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,990
Return the money

285
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,650
your maiden sister made

286
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,420
at the wedding banquet as is.

287
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,450
Dong Xiang.

288
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,640
Take your lady back to her room.

289
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,580
Yes.

290
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,320
Honey.

291
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,310
Remember to remind

292
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,170
Man'er that

293
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,420
the wine Eldest Brother ordered

294
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,930
needs to be delivered to the capital city

295
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,050
at Boss Wu's order.

296
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,830
So be careful

297
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,790
and make sure nothing goes wrong,

298
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,590
or Eldest Brother will blame me.

299
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,820
What's wrong, Hua'er?

300
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,490
Did Mother give you a hard time?

301
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,660
Honey.

302
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,150
Didn't you tell me

303
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,820
you are the most esteemed son

304
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,500
in the Song family?

305
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,319
Mother told you everything?

306
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,270
So why did you lie to me?

307
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,740
Today is my first day

308
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,470
marrying into the Song family,

309
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,040
and you put me through such humiliation.

310
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,810
Yes.

311
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,910
I did tell you that.

312
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,109
But I only said that

313
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,710
to make you like me.

314
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,140
Although no one in our family admits,

315
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,510
and they say good things about me

316
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,220
in public,

317
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,470
I... I know that

318
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm not

319
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,740
valued in the family.

320
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,820
Mother isn't willing to get closer to me

321
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,020
due to my background.

322
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,490
Eldest brother doesn't allow me

323
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,550
to meddle in family business either.

324
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,750
He could tell I'm bored,

325
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,290
so he gave me some chores to do

326
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,210
to kill time.

327
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,630
Do you know

328
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,830
how much effort I made

329
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,150
to marry you?

330
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,130
Of course I know.

331
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,480
So you must trust me, Honey.

332
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,570
I didn't mean

333
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,620
to lie to you.

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,730
It's just...

335
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,450
It's just that it was really hard to tell you this.

336
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,690
Honey, are you really mad?

337
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,460
Honey.

338
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,020
Don't worry.

339
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,270
As long as we don't cause trouble

340
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:22,920
and live our own

341
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,120
peaceful life,

342
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,870
we can still live happily

343
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,190
in this mansion.

344
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm not mad.

345
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,360
What I want has always been you,

346
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,950
not your identity.

347
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,550
By the way, Honey.

348
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,800
You just said

349
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,170
the wine Eldest Brother ordered from Man'er

350
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,120
was entrusted by Boss Wu?

351
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,260
Who is Boss Wu?

352
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,380
Man'er.

353
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,060
Youheng.

354
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,790
My father just withdrew this money

355
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,990
from the bank.

356
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,530
He said he'd lend it to you without interest.

357
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,790
Thanks a lot, Youheng.

358
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,620
But as the saying goes, "Even with your own brothers, keep clear accounts."

359
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,150
I can't break Mr. Laojin's rules.

360
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,010
I'll pay the interest as I should.

361
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,050
Typical you.

362
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,470
Always taking things so seriously.

363
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,610
Why are the garlic peanuts

364
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,830
tied to the wine jars?

365
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,470
Didn't you sell the recipe?

366
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,170
Although the recipe was sold,

367
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,750
the garlic peanuts

368
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,240
are much more famous

369
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,790
than the wine I just started to make.

370
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,310
It doesn't cost much

371
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,030
to gift peanuts to those who buy my wine.

372
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,920
And I can sell more wine

373
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,870
with the help of the reputation of garlic peanuts.

374
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,130
Youheng, you're here.

375
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,110
Uncle Lian.

376
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,940
How much did you borrow this time?

377
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,740
200 taels.

378
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,030
How about we start small?

379
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,030
Didn't you already borrow 60 taels

380
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,190
from another private bank?

381
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,900
Putting it together, that's quite a lot of money.

382
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,500
Besides,

383
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,310
Master Liu

384
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,280
and Master Qin

385
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,670
are famous for being difficult to deal with.

386
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,760
What if you can't pay them back?

387
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
What should we do?

388
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,740
Man'er.

389
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,130
You also borrowed money

390
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,060
from Master Liu?

391
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,440
I have to buy the ingredients.

392
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,390
There are not enough wild grapes on the hill.

393
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,500
Besides, I need more manpower.

394
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,420
But I feel uneasy

395
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,960
borrowing money to do business.

396
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,610
Father.

397
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,630
Song Haikun

398
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,160
ordered 100 jars from me

399
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,540
and asked me to deliver them to the capital city.

400
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,240
It must be for

401
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,540
the dignitaries.

402
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,100
If the dignitaries like it after drinking,

403
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,510
and order 1000 jars or even 2000 jars

404
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,310
from me later,

405
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,950
I'll be able to make

406
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,290
1,000 taels of gold.

407
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,160
Besides, as long as

408
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,700
I deliver the wine to the recipient

409
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,890
and get the contract signed,

410
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,490
Song Haikun will pay me right away.

411
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,220
Don't worry.

412
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,560
What Uncle Lian said

413
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,980
makes sense.

414
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,650
It's better to be careful.

415
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,450
I'll go deliver the wine with you.

416
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,100
No need.

417
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,240
Someone will come and get it

418
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,390
after I cross Pingfeng Mountain.

419
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,920
It'll take less than a day to make a round trip.

420
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,150
Man'er.

421
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,700
Father.

422
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,710
Don't you worry.

423
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,580
It'll be okay.

424
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,900
This place you picked

425
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,990
is really remote.

426
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,400
I wonder

427
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,920
what you want to buy, a house

428
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,220
or rare animals?

429
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,520
I'm not buying anything.

430
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,130
I want you to send a message for me.

431
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,470
I heard

432
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,160
you have contact with those mountain bandits.

433
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,890
Can you make a trip there for me?

434
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,730
Three days later,

435
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,870
a batch of goods will pass through Pingfeng Mountain.

436
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,530
[New location unlocked: Black Tiger Fortress]

437
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,780
Master.

438
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,670
How did it go?

439
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,950
Did you figure it out?

440
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,640
Yes.

441
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,910
The goods belong to the Song family.

442
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,570
But the fixer wouldn't tell me

443
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,230
where he got the news from.

444
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,720
Was there anyone following you?

445
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,510
Absolutely not.

446
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:54,980
They don't know

447
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,030
the location of our Black Tiger Fortress.

448
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,180
I only met with him in the posthouse

449
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,240
down the mountain.

450
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,820
It's the Song family again.

451
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,850
We're destined to cross paths with them.

452
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,900
Many of our men

453
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,880
were forced to become bandits by the Song family.

454
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,580
Now we get to rob them again.

455
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,590
Of course we can't miss it.

456
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,260
What do you think, Shen?

457
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,650
Do you want to go on another round with us?

458
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,110
Master.

459
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,500
Why are you...

460
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,710
My brother and I have lived here

461
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,910
for quite a long time, right?

462
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,500
And we've helped you a lot.

463
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,980
But you haven't given that thing back to us

464
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,390
as you promised.

465
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,840
Now you want us

466
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,350
to rob the Song family again?

467
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,770
Isn't this

468
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,170
a little inappropriate?

469
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,840
How about this?

470
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,900
After this last robbery,

471
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,430
Master,

472
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,020
give that thing back to us.

473
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,190
What do you think?

474
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,890
Of course I will.

475
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,410
What do you think, Shen?

476
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,870
Do you have

477
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,700
any opinion this time?

478
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,140
We used the trick of diversion last time.

479
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,740
This time,

480
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,660
how about we use

481
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,190
the trick of replacing the real thing with a fake?

482
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,630
[Song's Residence]

483
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,410
Breaking news.

484
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,970
Hurry up!

485
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,150
Eldest Young Master lost his temper in the front hall.

486
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,680
Hurry up and send people there in attendance.

487
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,390
Honey.

488
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,080
Is something wrong?

489
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,950
Why do I feel

490
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,890
everyone in the mansion is panicking?

491
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,920
It's about the wine Eldest Brother ordered

492
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,840
from Man'er.

493
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,560
What a coincidence.

494
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,830
The wine went missing on the way.

495
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,590
What do you mean the wine went missing?

496
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,310
According to the messenger,

497
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,720
the government set up a checkpoint and took the wine.

498
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,590
But Eldest Brother inquired about it just now.

499
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,230
No checkpoint was set up at all.

500
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,960
We don't know

501
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,090
who robbed the wine.

502
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,850
Will this matter

503
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,600
get Man'er involved?

504
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,250
Of course.

505
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,550
Now that the wine's gone,

506
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,230
Eldest Brother will definitely

507
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,300
not pay for the wine

508
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,090
and let Man'er bear the consequences herself.

509
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,460
I'll tell you more about it when I'm back.

510
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,930
Honey, take care.

511
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,870
Yes.

512
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,860
Laojin.

513
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,500
We didn't want to come out either.

514
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,220
Yes.

515
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,990
Boss has been urging us.

516
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,990
He can't pay the bill.

517
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,150
Laojin.

518
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,030
Man'er, you're back.

519
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,390
Mr. Laojin.

520
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,360
Why are you here?

521
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,720
I happened to

522
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,460
run into these two masters.

523
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,960
They were looking for you.

524
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,820
So I

525
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,960
chatted with them for a while.

526
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,110
Miss Man'er.

527
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,630
We're here to collect money today.

528
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,660
You should pay our money back today as agreed.

529
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,150
Yes.

530
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,440
Masters. I...

531
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,110
I may need you to wait longer.

532
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,330
Wait longer?

533
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,210
If I can't get the money,

534
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,310
how should I explain to Boss

535
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,300
when I go back?

536
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,430
Exactly.

537
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,860
Don't worry.

538
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,670
I will get the money and pay you back

539
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,800
as soon as possible.

540
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,750
Just...

541
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,980
Just give me a few more days, okay?

542
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,690
How many days has it been?

543
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,040
Look at you.

544
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,070
Don't make it hard

545
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,090
for a little girl.

546
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,870
She must have a reason for not being able to pay it back.

547
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,270
She's not trying to bilk.

548
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,800
Besides, it's just a few dozens of taels of silver.

549
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,090
Do you have to collect it now?

550
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,230
We have bills to pay too.

551
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,230
Listen.

552
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,220
I watched Miss Man'er grow up.

553
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,990
I know what kind of person she is.

554
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,700
Don't worry.

555
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,980
She will definitely pay you back in full.

556
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,990
But, Laojin,

557
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,300
Boss has been rushing me.

558
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,220
Well...

559
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,800
How about this?

560
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,000
After half a month,

561
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,120
if Man'er can't save up enough money,

562
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,820
I'll pay you back for her, okay?

563
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,100
Laojin, you said that.

564
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,620
Don't go back on your word.

565
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,220
When did I ever do that?

566
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,400
Mr. Laojin.

567
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,900
I already owe you hundreds of taels.

568
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,570
No hurry.

569
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,500
It's normal to need turnaround time

570
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,870
for business.

571
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,980
Alright.

572
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,190
It's getting late.

573
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,550
You can leave now.

574
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:49,950
But...

575
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,220
Come to my place for a drink some other time.

576
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,620
Come on. Alright.

577
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,460
I have

578
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,580
Miss Man'er's Champion Red Brandy

579
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,750
stored at my place.

580
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,220
Come and have a drink some day.

581
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,790
Okay, let's go.

582
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,860
What should we say when we go back?

583
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,910
It's a deal.

584
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,790
You...

585
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,440
Didn't you go deliver the wine today?

586
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,700
The Song family didn't pay you?

587
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,180
Some government officials took the wine.

588
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,900
Some government officials took it?

589
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,760
What happened?

590
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,450
Tell me about it.

591
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,180
Come to think of it, it's quite strange.

592
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,670
I was on my way delivering the wine.

593
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,870
As soon as I left town,

594
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,950
I got stopped by some officers who set up a checkpoint

595
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,750
along the way.

596
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,840
What did they say?

597
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,710
They said the government was inspecting smuggling.

598
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,380
But I got the approval document

599
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,150
for my wine from the government long ago.

600
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,680
I didn't get to explain yet,

601
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,550
and those people took my wine

602
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,140
brutally

603
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,020
without a word.

604
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,460
Smuggling?

605
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,510
When I was drinking with

606
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,940
some government officials the other day,

607
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,400
they didn't mention this.

608
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,150
I'll take you to the government office tomorrow to inquire.

609
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,410
Maybe we can get the wine back

610
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,510
with a few taels.

611
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,650
I already went to the government office.

612
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,510
I didn't get anything out of them.

613
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,990
The government officials only

614
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,390
told me they didn't know.

615
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,370
Those scums.

616
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,090
Don't you think

617
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,280
it was odd?

618
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,310
Did they show you

619
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,130
any document for their seizure?

620
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,140
No.

621
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,630
But Mr. Laojin,

622
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,110
who could they be

623
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,790
if not government officials?

624
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,670
Let me ask around.

625
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,120
Don't worry.

626
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,990
I won't be able

627
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,560
to get this batch of goods back any time soon.

628
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,360
Now I can only make another batch

629
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,510
to pay off my debts.

630
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,790
Okay.

631
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,230
Ask Youheng for help

632
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,660
if you need anything.

633
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,500
Go back and rest early.

634
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,470
Your parents must be waiting.

635
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,730
Thank you, Mr. Laojin.

636
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,270
All right, I'm leaving.

637
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,840
Take care.

638
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,240
Okay.

639
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,560
I'm leaving.

640
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,940
Being an official feels so good.

641
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,070
Check it out. I feel much more authoritative

642
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,050
in this outfit.

643
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,120
Nonsense.

644
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,410
Of course it feels good, Three.

645
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,710
Don't you know the government officials

646
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,390
only do conscienceless things?

647
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,250
How can you be proud wearing this?

648
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,880
Four, you...

649
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,100
You're right.

650
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,030
Just let me have some fun.

651
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,890
I'll take it off later.

652
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,560
All right.

653
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,950
Stop messing around.

654
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,810
Open the boxes.

655
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,150
Be careful.

656
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,230
Why isn't it gold and silver jewelry?

657
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,230
Why is it all wine?

658
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,100
We're not short of wine here at Black Tiger Fortress.

659
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,020
Where did you get that

660
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,940
useless news from?

661
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,870
How would I know?

662
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,700
This...

663
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,810
Well.

664
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,830
It's still good.

665
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,140
Three. Four.

666
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,950
Although

667
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,710
this batch of goods isn't worth much,

668
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,380
we still managed

669
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,790
to make the Song family angry.

670
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,140
So our trip is still worth it.

671
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Thirteen, you...

672
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,860
You're right.

673
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,770
See? He's right.

674
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,860
That's more like it.

675
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,860
That makes sense.

676
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,130
Young Master.

677
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,660
Four. You were a bit tough today.

678
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,060
She's just a little girl.

679
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,500
So what?

680
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,740
She had to work for the Song family.

681
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,710
Come to think of it, though,

682
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,600
why would the distinguished Song family

683
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,500
ask a weak little girl

684
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,990
to deliver the goods

685
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,710
for them?

686
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,180
How would we know?

687
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,370
What does that girl look like?

688
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,860
She's very pretty.

689
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,260
Really?

690
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,610
What are you talking about? Pretty?

691
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,950
You and Shen didn't go,

692
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,800
so you missed the dramatic part.

693
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,530
When we were robbing the goods,

694
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,380
she started to curse, and it was so irritating.

695
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,330
If it weren't for my tenderness towards women,

696
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,260
I would have brought her back here.

697
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,540
♫Wind blows through the rice field♫

698
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,800
♫The smoke is blown away♫

699
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,320
♫A bird stands on a branch alone♫

You're here, Shen.

711
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,760
What do you want to see me for?

712
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,850
I have a request.

713
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,510
Just kidding.

714
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,100
I know this is what you want.

715
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,780
Not only that.

716
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,719
I want

717
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,800
the wine we robbed yesterday.

718
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,500
Shen.

719
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,880
Although that wine is not worth much,

720
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,030
it's still the result

721
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,460
of our men's hard work.

722
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,020
If I let you take everything you want away

723
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,750
from the Black Tiger Fortress,

724
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,630
how should I explain to my men?

725
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,650
How can I establish my prestige in the fortress?

726
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,469
Master.

727
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,929
Actually, this batch of wine doesn't belong to the Song family.

728
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,590
It belongs to a friend of mine.

729
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,520
I didn't know about it before we did the robbery.

730
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,330
But this batch of wine

731
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,260
means a lot to me.

732
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,920
You have to give it to me

733
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,260
no matter what.

734
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,830
I have to take it away.

735
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,250
Shen Nuo.

736
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,650
Even if you take the registration book away,

737
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,160
with so many of my men outside,

738
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,090
do you think

739
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,720
you can take it

740
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,090
out of the fortress?

741
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,700
Today, you can only choose one of them,

742
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,180
the registration book or the wine.

743
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,180
Which one do you choose?

744
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,410
It seems you choose the wine.

745
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,950
Master.

746
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,830
Please keep your promise.

747
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,880
Shen Nuo.

748
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,190
Do you have a grudge against the Song family

749
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,460
or Jinyang Guild?

750
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,040
Jinyang Guild?

751
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,280
I've read the registration book.

752
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,100
It records

753
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,280
all the bosses of the merchant guilds

754
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,680
in Jinyang Guild.

755
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:03,820
They're all famous people

756
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,670
in the county.

757
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,680
I'm flattered, Master.

758
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,560
I'm just a commoner.

759
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,530
How could I possibly have grudges

760
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,790
against the big names?

761
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,630
I just want to extort some money.

762
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,890
Right.

763
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,290
You went through so much trouble

764
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,080
to get here,

765
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,220
and you even fought with me.

766
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,550
I didn't expect

767
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,490
what you take away would be a few jars of wine.

768
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,210
Is it worth it?

769
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,810
Yes.

770
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,210
She is very important to me.

771
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,410
The delivery girl?

772
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,970
Till we meet again.

773
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,820
You've finally come down the mountain.

774
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,370
Young Master.

775
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,830
Yu Xiangjin gave you

776
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,530
both the registration book and the wine, right?

777
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,670
I exchanged the registration book for the wine.

778
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,700
I'll come and get the rest of the wine

779
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,660
in a few days.

780
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,110
But...

781
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,350
What about returning to the capital city?

782
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,800
Thirteen.

783
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,560
I know you like Miss Lian.

784
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,750
But now,

785
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,000
you're totally ignoring the big picture.

786
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,110
You know how important

787
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,310
the registration book is.

788
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,630
It records the salt smuggling transportation routes,

789
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,100
name lists,

790
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,830
and rendezvous

791
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,230
of local rich merchants.

792
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,940
What did we spend

793
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,510
so much time

794
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,580
in Jinyang County for?

795
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,490
Isn't it for getting the evidence as soon as possible

796
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,950
and returning to the capital city to report to the government?

797
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,910
I'm sorry.

798
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,630
Our efforts have come to naught.

799
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,220
What should we do now?

800
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,630
Just now, Yu Xiangjin told me that

801
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,970
the people recorded in this registration book

802
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,310
all come from a local guild called

803
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,380
Jinyang Guild?

804
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,870
Jinyang Guild?

805
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,180
That's right.

806
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,470
Although we didn't get the registration book,

807
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,670
there is another way.

808
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,430
I need to make a trip back to Shisanli Camp.

809
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,430
Maybe there's someone

810
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,300
who can help me.

811
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,960
Master told us

812
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,720
Shen is an affectionate lover.

813
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,480
Master offered him the registration book,

814
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,760
but he exchanged it for the wine.

815
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,160
He took all the wine away.

816
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,750
What's the use of that stupid book he left behind?

817
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,550
The winter is around the corner.

818
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,460
So many people need to be fed.

819
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,510
What should we do?

820
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,120
Three.

821
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,480
It seems the registration book can actually be of use.

822
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,150
What use?

823
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,200
We can blackmail

824
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,660
Young Master Song with it.

825
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,070
Master said

826
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,520
what's recorded in the registration book

827
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,660
is the delivery list.

828
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,920
Shen wants it,

829
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,620
and the Song family kept a close eye on it.

830
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,750
What does that mean?

831
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,480
That means the registration book is very important.

832
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,460
We can totally

833
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,490
get a large sum of money out of it.

834
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,600
Forget it.

835
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,140
Given the temper of

836
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,870
Master and Second Master,

837
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,820
they wouldn't agree.

838
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,480
Yes, of course they wouldn't.

839
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,590
Given Master's temper,

840
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,300
she would never

841
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,140
bend the knee and ask for money.

842
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,420
But the registration book

843
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,350
is useless to us.

844
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,070
It's better to exchange it for money.

845
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,580
When we put the hard cash we earn

846
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,840
in front of their eyes,

847
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,540
will they blame us?

848
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,550
You're right. Let's do it.

849
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,730
I'll ask the fixer

850
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,930
to spread the news right away

851
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,130
and tell Song Haikun.

852
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,560
I'll go check

853
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,520
if there are

854
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,470
any of our old costumes left.

855
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,250
We need to put on disguises.

856
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,840
We can't reveal our identity.

857
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,190
Also, we need more people.

858
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,780
Those guards of the Song family

859
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,580
are very tough.

860
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,420
Let's go.

861
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,020
Miss Man'er.

862
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,040
Master Qian.

863
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,080
Why are you here?

864
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,140
I came

865
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,000
to collect the money you owe me.

866
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,950
Didn't we agree that

867
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,010
you could give me a few more days?

868
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,670
It hasn't been long.

869
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,710
Besides,

870
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,770
Mr. Laojin vouched for me.

871
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,760
Please pardon me, Miss.

872
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,170
I don't want to go back on my word either.

873
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,960
It's just

874
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,210
my boss blamed me.

875
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,950
He said that

876
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,270
I lent too much money.

877
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,780
If I still can't collect it,

878
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,150
my position as the master

879
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,470
will be on the line.

880
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,510
Besides,

881
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,720
Wang Laojin is also a loan shark.

882
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,960
It doesn't make sense

883
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,240
collecting debts from a peer loan shark.

884
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,240
Today,

885
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,950
I must bring the money back to report to my boss.

886
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,600
After I sell the wine here,

887
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,100
I'll be able to pay you back.

888
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,870
If you don't have money, offset the debt with these.

889
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,380
Come on.

890
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,240
These grapes are worthless.

891
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,690
I need them to make wine.

892
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,600
Don't take them.

893
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,340
These grapes are really worthless.

894
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,470
They are worthless.

895
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,600
These grapes are worthless.

896
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,160
Master.

897
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,190
These grapes are really worthless.

898
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:06,790
Master Qian.

899
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,730
Youheng.

900
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,310
It's only right and proper that she pays off her debts.

901
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,370
Your father is Wang Laojin.

902
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,070
I don't want to have any beef with you.

903
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,260
Stay out of this.

904
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,040
I'll

905
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,470
pay this money back for her.

906
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,640
You could have asked him to pay the money back for you sooner.

907
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,460
Let's go.

908
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:02,850
Man'er.

909
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,480
In your memory,

910
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
what's something

911
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,280
that makes you happy?

912
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,410
Eating.

913
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,850
Making money.

914
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,220
And watching fireworks.

915
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,270
Once,

916
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,160
I saw so many fireworks.

917
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,190
So I made

918
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,180
a small wish.

919
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,990
I didn't expect

920
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,060
it came true the next day.

921
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,030
I wish I could see it again.

922
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,550
Forget it.

923
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,130
There wouldn't be any fireworks here.

924
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,680
[Mission: 1,000 taels of gold]

925
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,680
[Income: Selling wine, and money borrowed from Mr. Laojin and other private banks: 620 taels.]

926
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,680
[Expenses: The cost of wine production in high volume: 728 taels.]
