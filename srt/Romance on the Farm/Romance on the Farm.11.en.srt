[Episode 11]

4
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,710
If you want peanuts,

5
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,220
give me the recipe in exchange.

6
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,660
Look at you.

7
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,550
Something this bad happened to their family.

8
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,130
Why are you still thinking about the recipe?

9
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,180
They caused the trouble themselves.

10
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,300
What can I, an old lady,

11
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,600
possibly do to help you?

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,550
Besides, he is my son.

13
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,390
I just want a recipe from him.

14
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,460
Is it too much to ask?

15
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,310
How ungrateful. When you were making money,

16
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,950
you forgot about us completely.

17
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,930
Have you ever asked how we were doing?

18
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,330
Now something happened,

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,450
and you need us,

20
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,720
so you came to court us.

21
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,240
I never

22
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,500
thought about it like that.

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,550
I won't give it to you.

24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,010
Don't even think about it.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,520
San'er.

26
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,310
Go back first.

27
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,700
I have something to say to your mother.

28
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,250
Loser.

29
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,810
After all,

30
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,050
that's your own son and granddaughter.

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,490
Can we really not help them

32
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,079
when they're faced with such a plight?

33
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,820
Can you really stand by and watch your own granddaughter

34
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,870
go to jail?

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,340
The peanuts

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,770
are precious.

37
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,510
If you give them to Shouxin,

38
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,710
when will he pay?

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,280
What if he doesn't?

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,860
Do you want our whole family

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,010
to live on air?

42
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,740
San'er and his family

43
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,329
are not that kind of people.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,770
Anyway, they've separated from us.

45
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,510
Don't you think about taking advantage of them again.

46
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,230
Why?

47
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,930
I gave birth

48
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,960
to him.

49
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,550
Why can't I control him?

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,190
Your mother

51
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,790
also controlled you like this back then.

52
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,320
She did the same thing to me.

53
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,750
Grandpa.

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,890
Don't be angry. Let me talk to Grandma.

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,820
But I'm not done yet.

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,470
Go away.

57
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,500
Grandma, don't be angry.

58
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,950
I know what you're thinking.

59
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,680
Do you think I'll listen to you?

60
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,920
Grandma.

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,100
If we want the recipe

62
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,760
for garlic peanuts,

63
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,120
there are many ways.

64
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,280
We don't have

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,579
to ask for it in person.

66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,630
Besides,

67
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,790
Lian Man'er

68
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,090
is such a cunning girl.

69
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,690
We can't confront her the tough way.

70
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,620
What do you think we should do then?

71
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,560
There is a way.

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,540
It's just...

73
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,990
Just say it.

74
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,950
Stop dawdling.

75
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,910
Grandma.

76
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,800
Come here.

77
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:56,880
Man'er.

78
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,250
-Man'er.
-Father.

79
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,410
Your grandma agreed.

80
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,780
She agreed?

81
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,990
She agreed to sell peanuts to us at market price,

82
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,050
10 coins per catty.

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,330
We can pay her back after we make money.

84
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,340
By the way, your grandma's worried that

85
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,330
we won't be able to manage,

86
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,060
so she sent Aunt He here to help.

87
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,940
Father, we're not short-handed.

88
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,440
What?

89
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,560
Nothing.

90
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,690
I was just saying we're not short-handed.

91
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,950
So you don't have to bother.

92
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,980
Look at her.

93
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,700
Being so courteous.

94
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,880
It's better to have more manpower, right?

95
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,650
I'm very capable.

96
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,570
Come on. Let's hurry.

97
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,659
Bring the baskets up.

98
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,500
Come on.

99
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,030
Is there any more basket?

100
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,770
No.

101
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,920
-Come on.
-Let's go, Aunt He.

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,870
Yes, let's go.

103
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,240
Shouxin, come in front.

104
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,650
You pull the cart.

105
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,030
Man'er, push it from behind.

106
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,830
That's right.

107
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,460
Let's go.

108
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,860
Can it handle my weight?

109
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:49,960
Forget it. I'll walk.

110
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,560
You've gone too far, Aunt He.

111
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,580
How about we pay for

112
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,870
Miss Man'er's ransom?

113
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,130
In case something really happens to her.

114
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,030
That's inappropriate.

115
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,910
If we make such a large payment,

116
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,240
people will suspect us.

117
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,770
We must focus on the big picture.

118
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,550
On the 15th of this month,

119
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,670
the troupe will perform at a banquet in the Song Mansion.

120
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,420
We can take this opportunity to enter the Song Mansion

121
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,840
and steal the registration book.

122
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,150
There will be many people there.

123
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,210
It'll be a good time

124
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,790
for us to take action.

125
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,180
How did you persuade Yu Xiangjin

126
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,790
to perform at the banquet in the Song Mansion?

127
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,120
When Song Changsui came here for an opera,

128
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:48,880
I introduced this person

129
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,210
to Yu Xiangjin.

130
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,909
I was going to make this happen

131
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,710
by recommending the troupe to him face to face.

132
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,960
I didn't expect that before I could say anything,

133
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,159
Troupe Master Yu brought it up herself,

134
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,800
convinced Song Changsui

135
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,270
with only a few words,

136
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,120
and set the date for the banquet.

137
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,820
But come to think of it,

138
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,440
that wasn't surprising.

139
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,160
She's a person who loves money.

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,820
Now that she's given a chance

141
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,140
to make money from rich people,

142
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,870
of course she wouldn't miss it.

143
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,070
I didn't expect she's thinking

144
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,200
the same thing as us.

145
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,150
One more thing.

146
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,570
That day,

147
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,940
when Song Changsui was meeting someone here,

148
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,140
I secretly heard that

149
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,690
they were discussing about

150
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,040
transporting a batch of salt

151
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,470
after the banquet.

152
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,750
The higher-ups must have urged them.

153
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,490
No matter what,

154
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,630
we must succeed this time.

155
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,159
Okay.

156
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,870
Almost.

157
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,970
-Father.
-What brings you here?

158
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,240
Grandpa.

159
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,980
Having us here is enough.

160
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,290
Go back to the room and rest.

161
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,690
We have to pay 100 taels of silver in 10 days.

162
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,330
100 taels.

163
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,360
I feel anxious

164
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,840
whenever I think about it.

165
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,860
Can we get enough money

166
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,409
by selling these peanuts?

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
There's no other way for now.

168
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,800
We can only make more and sell more.

169
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,270
How about I go ask your eldest brother

170
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,930
and see if he has any connections

171
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,610
to help you?

172
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,230
Don't bother Uncle Shouren.

173
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,500
We'll find more ways

174
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,430
to sell peanuts.

175
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,100
We will earn enough money.

176
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,420
He.

177
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,170
The peanuts you picked

178
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,680
aren't right.

179
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,870
Like this one. It's moldy.

180
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,970
-Okay.
-You can't put it in there.

181
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,830
Look. The shriveled ones.

182
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,590
Like these.

183
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,420
-You can't put them in there.
-Right.

184
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,500
They're for selling.

185
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,990
You need to pick them carefully.

186
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,510
Otherwise,

187
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,220
they won't sell at a good price.

188
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,740
Father.

189
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,500
I've always been clumsy

190
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,620
doing chores.

191
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,750
I'm not very good at

192
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,030
such delicate work.

193
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,549
How about this?

194
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,790
You do it.

195
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,020
You pick.

196
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,450
I'll go help Man'er.

197
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,270
Let me help you.

198
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,060
Look, it's quite heavy.

199
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,530
It's okay.

200
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,820
Aunt He.

201
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,580
You came to help us.

202
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,760
It won't affect your chores at home, will it?

203
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,060
I don't want Grandma to scold you in the end.

204
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,010
No.

205
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,050
Your grandma said

206
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,340
as long as I come and help,

207
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,140
she'll make chicken stew for me.

208
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,610
Man'er.

209
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,080
Your garlic peanuts are so delicious.

210
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,840
How do you make it?

211
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,870
There's an exclusive recipe.

212
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,330
What recipe?

213
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,450
I can't tell you.

214
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,790
Aunt He.

215
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,930
Bring me the sugar.

216
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,090
Okay.

217
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,940
Here.

218
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,580
How much should we put?

219
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,800
Look.

220
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,320
There are so many ingredients.

221
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,940
Can you remember all of them?

222
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,530
Sometimes I can't.

223
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,420
Right?

224
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,750
But I wrote it down.

225
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,530
So you have a recipe.

226
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,410
You must keep

227
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,150
your valuable recipe well.

228
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,480
Don't let anyone steal it.

229
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,250
Don't worry, Aunt He.

230
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,280
The recipe is

231
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,070
on the second layer of the third cabinet

232
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,760
on the left-hand side of my room.

233
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,990
No one can steal it.

234
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,270
Good.

235
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,790
As long as you keep it well.

236
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,620
This isn't it.

237
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,100
I found it again.

238
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,620
This isn't it either.

239
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,420
Why is the cabinet door open?

240
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,460
Luckily, the treasure I keep

241
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,320
on the second layer is still here.

242
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
The second layer.

243
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,770
Found it.

244
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,990
The recipe for garlic peanuts.

245
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,060
I'm so smart.

246
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,500
So your Aunt He

247
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,250
really stole the fake recipe?

248
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,150
You bet.

249
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,330
Fortunately, I saw through

250
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,330
her little trick.

251
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,100
I replaced the recipe with a fake one

252
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,630
and offered her a solution.

253
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,520
Otherwise,

254
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,780
Aunt He

255
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
couldn't steal anything

256
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,140
after taking on my grandma's mission.

257
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,540
Even I feel sorry for her.

258
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,930
As the saying goes, what's worse than being stolen by thieves

259
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,390
is being targeted by them.

260
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,440
A fake recipe.

261
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,900
Even if it gets sold,

262
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,740
it won't cause any big trouble.

263
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,070
You're quite quick-witted.

264
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,230
This is called wisdom.

265
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,110
You're a good person.

266
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,910
It's a pity that you have a mouth.

267
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,940
Lian Man'er.

268
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,990
If I leave one day,

269
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,930
will you think of me from time to time?

270
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,510
You're all alone.

271
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,670
Where are you going?

272
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,180
I mean hypothetically.

273
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,320
Why should I miss you?

274
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,180
For teasing me?

275
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,110
If you leave,

276
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,540
I'll be at peace.

277
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,140
Did I say something wrong?

278
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,720
Hurry up and bring the peanuts in.

279
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,610
Come on. Be careful.

280
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,820
The weather was fine just now.

281
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,560
Why did it suddenly start raining?

282
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,360
Hurry, Honey!

283
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,500
Hurry up.

284
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,550
Watch your legs.

285
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,350
Be careful, Father.

286
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,490
Watch your legs.

287
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,460
Here.

288
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,150
We need to send them to the restaurants tomorrow.

289
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,200
But now the peanuts are all wet.

290
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,100
There won't be enough time for us to cook them.

291
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,820
This is our first time cooperating with

292
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,950
these restaurants.

293
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,780
If we can't deliver the peanuts on time,

294
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,410
they probably won't

295
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,230
take them.

296
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,270
Then

297
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,060
wouldn't it be even harder for us to save up

298
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,570
100 taels of silver in 10 days?

299
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,370
That won't do.

300
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,550
If we can't get 100 taels,

301
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,850
Man'er will be put in jail.

302
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,670
This...

303
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,300
How about this? I'll go to the restaurants

304
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
and persuade them to give us a few more days.

305
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,950
Wait.

306
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,460
Father. Mother.

307
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,859
Go borrow some braziers.

308
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,560
Braziers?

309
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,050
What do you want to do?

310
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,270
I can't explain it in a few words.

311
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,180
Anyway, the more, the better.

312
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,619
Okay.

313
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,210
-Shen Nuo, go cut some bamboo.
-Let's go. Hurry.

314
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,240
Okay. Let's go.

315
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,780
Look.

316
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,690
This is the only one we have.

317
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,500
Isn't there another one here?

318
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,650
But it's broken.

319
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,850
It's okay.

320
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,420
It's okay.

321
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,020
It will do.

322
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,870
Come on.

323
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,060
Be careful.

324
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,660
Thank you.

325
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,570
We'll send it back right after use.

326
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,030
Be careful. It's raining.

327
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,710
Okay.

328
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,090
Man'er.

329
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,600
I borrowed two more braziers.

330
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,250
Let's go.

331
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,660
Seven, be careful.

332
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,620
Can we make it?

333
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:07,990
Mother.

334
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:08,930
Father.

335
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,670
Let's roast some taros

336
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,990
with the charcoal.

337
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,900
Okay.

338
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,200
It's so hot. What are you doing?

339
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,350
Here, Seven.

340
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,700
You eat first.

341
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,860
We can even roast

342
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,720
such big taros.

343
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,470
I believe these peanuts

344
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,580
can also be dried.

345
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,540
Don't worry.

346
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:06,840
Here.

347
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,800
Try one.

348
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,130
Thanks a lot.

349
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,170
Here.

350
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,530
Seven, eat.

351
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,760
Be careful. It's hot.

352
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,250
Here.

353
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,100
I wonder

354
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,780
if we can make it in time

355
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,080
this way.

356
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,120
No matter if we can make it,

357
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,750
we have tried our best.

358
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,230
Man'er. Father. Mother.

359
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,240
Shen Nuo.

360
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,410
Come and have a look.

361
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,910
What's wrong, Seven?

362
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
They're dried up.

363
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,630
They're all dried up.

364
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
They're dried up.

365
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,240
Mr. Zhang.

366
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,710
We've delivered the peanuts here on time

367
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,490
as promised.

368
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,710
Check out the quality of peanuts.

369
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,000
It tastes good.

370
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,840
Master.

371
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,850
We've checked.

372
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,380
A bit more than 200 catties.

373
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,870
Please wait a moment, you two.

374
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,190
I'll go get the money.

375
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,900
Thank you.

376
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,430
Master.

377
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,140
Please hurry up.

378
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,020
We need money urgently.

379
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,140
We want to go home

380
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,300
and make another batch of peanuts as soon as possible.

381
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,330
Why don't you

382
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,940
come in and take a rest?

383
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,150
It's about to rain.

384
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,050
It's going to rain again?

385
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,550
No way.

386
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,340
Believe me.

387
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,560
I have rheumatism in my legs. It can tell weather precisely.

388
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,530
If it's a shower,

389
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,060
it will only hurt for a while.

390
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,190
But my legs have been hurting for days.

391
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,120
It seems the rain

392
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,790
will last for a few more days.

393
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,140
Don't forget to come and wait inside.

394
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,270
Be careful, Master.

395
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,280
If that's the case,

396
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,600
we won't have enough time

397
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,930
to cook so many peanuts.

398
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,580
If we want to save up 100 taels of silver,

399
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,910
we have to think of another way.

400
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,120
There's only one way left.

401
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,120
You're not thinking about...

402
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,930
80 taels?

403
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,980
The price we agreed on

404
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,820
was 120 taels.

405
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,390
Things are different now.

406
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,160
Who can guarantee that garlic peanuts

407
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,490
will always be popular?

408
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,080
Is your recipe real?

409
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,190
Of course.

410
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,850
Why do you ask?

411
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,870
Nothing.

412
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,390
I truly am

413
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,060
interested in your recipe.

414
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,520
But I definitely won't

415
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,670
pay 100 taels for it.

416
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,810
We're not the only one

417
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,090
selling garlic peanuts now.

418
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,950
Everyone says they are the first.

419
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,830
But why did you choose

420
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,050
our peanuts?

421
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,150
It's because for now,

422
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,620
our peanuts

423
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,500
are the most delicious

424
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,010
and most popular among the guests.

425
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,870
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

426
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,110
Our peanuts

427
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,770
are extraordinarily popular.

428
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,300
We wouldn't sell the recipe

429
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,710
if we weren't in urgent need of money.

430
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,620
Besides,

431
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,370
if you buy

432
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,260
our recipe,

433
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,610
besides selling peanuts in your own restaurant,

434
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,460
you can also supply them to various food stores in town.

435
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,860
In less than six months,

436
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,910
you'll be able to earn back

437
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,990
the 100 taels of silver.

438
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,700
Mr. Zhang.

439
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,460
You can't miss this opportunity,

440
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,920
or it may never come again.

441
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,510
You're not wrong.

442
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,180
But as a restaurant owner,

443
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
I have to consider all kind of risks.

444
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,190
I can't offer you a higher price.

445
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,200
-If that's the case...
-Forget it.

446
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,990
We won't waste your time.

447
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,180
Master, are we really not buying?

448
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,710
What's the hurry?

449
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,040
They are more anxious than us.

What's next?

453
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,760
Nothing.

454
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,720
Hey.

455
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,700
You are not waiting for Mr. Zhang

456
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,030
to call us back, are you?

457
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,690
Yes.

458
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,710
Then we can

459
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,550
get the initiative back, right?

460
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,020
This is weird.

461
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,950
This trick always worked

462
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,540
when I was buying things

463
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,460
in the past.

464
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,230

up your sleeve?

no matter what we talk about,

478
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,700
No problem.

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,820
what banquet are you holding?

483

490
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,740
You have to give us more discount.

Master.

492
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,260
We won't stop at the baby shower banquet.

to see a couple that comes to reserve tables

505
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,370

No.

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,020
Didn't you say the price was too high?

539
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,620
Why did you change your mind?

540
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,300
Stop making fun of me.

00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,000

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,880
to save as much money as possible.

543
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,430
Please have some refreshments first, you two.

544
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,990
I'll go draw up the contract.

545
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,610
I'll give you the money,

546
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,640
and you'll give me the recipe.

Look. Their business is so good,

552
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,630
yet they refuse to pay me.

553
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,200
If they don't pay me today,

554
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,840
I won't let them off!

555
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,660
I showed this recipe to the chef.

556
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,100
There must be fennel

00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,320
in the garlic peanuts.

558
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,850
But it's not in your recipe.

559
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,300
Since it's not included, the recipe must be fake.

560
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,580
How can I pay for a fake recipe?

561
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,740
This is an ancestral recipe.

562
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,870
How could it be fake?

563
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,230
Didn't you read it?

564
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,100
You have to pay us if you read it.

565
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Let's go.

566
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,750
No wonder Mr. Zhang asked you

567
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,140
whether the recipe is real or not.

568
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,140
You have to pay as long as you read it.

569
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,860
Mother!

570
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,270
Mother.

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,430
I'm a 58-year-old

572
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,960
kind old woman.

573
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,580
How can you treat me like this?

574
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,120
Sister.

575
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,680
I'm even one year older than you.

576
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,540
You're just...

577
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,690
My mother!

578
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,480
I told you

579
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,620
to be careful of these profiteers' tricks.

580
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,420
You didn't believe me.

581
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,710
Mother.

582
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,320
Give us the money!

583
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,930
Mother!

584
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,790
Mother, don't leave us!

585
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,620
I also don't want to live anymore! Mother!

586
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,980
She died! My mother!

587
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,990
-I also don't want to live anymore!
-Grandma!

588
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,790
Aunt He. Uncle Shouyi.

589
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,880
Why are you here?

590
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,700
Man'er.

591
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,540
You came at the right time.

592
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,390
You know what?

593
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
This restaurant

594
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,850
stole our family's recipe!

595
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,450
And they got physical!

596
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,220
Grandma!

597
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,120
Master!

598
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,060
You hit my grandma!

599
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,030
I wouldn't accept that!

600
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,180
I... I didn't...

601
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,900
Grandma, get up!

602
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,670
Let's go report it to the court.

603
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,280
Come on!

604
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,660
-Get up.
-Slowly.

605
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,000
Be careful. Grandma.

606
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,620
Although our recipe is fake,

607
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,170
they hit you for real.

608
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,570
Yes!

609
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,130
So many people are watching.

610
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,040
We'll make him bear the consequences!

611
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,730
Bear the consequences!

612
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,330
Bear them!

613
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,360
Wait.

614
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,770
The recipe is fake?

615
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,010
No way.

616
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,080
But I took it from...

617
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,460
Aunt He secretly took it

618
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,370
from the third drawer of the second cabinet

619
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,170
on the left-hand side of my room.

620
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,230
You brat.

621
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,130
You screwed me.

622
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,380
Grandma Lian.

623
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,850
If you keep making a scene

624
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,910
like this in public

625
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,770
and get caught by government officers,

626
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,010
it won't end well.

627
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,020
It's all because of Hua'er.

628
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,110
She came up with such a bad idea.

629
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,020
I'll go back and teach her a lesson.

630
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,490
You, listen carefully.

631
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,420
Even though this recipe is fake,

632
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,150
I'll mess with you. I'll mess with you every day.

633
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,350
I'll create chaos...

634
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,170
Officer!

635
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,660
What officer? What...

636
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,190
Mother.

637
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,620
We still have work to do in the fields.

638
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,220
Yes, we still have work to do.

639
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,810
I'll come make a scene here.

640
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,740
I'll make a scene at your door every day.

641
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,150
Mother. Come on.

642
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,310
What's going on?

643
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,260
Nothing.

644
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,190
It's just...

645
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,070
A few guests

646
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,070
got into a fight.

647
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,550
Yes.

648
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,240
It's nothing serious. Go.

649
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,300
It's already over.

650
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,090
You can all leave now.

651
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:22,910
Yes.

652
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:23,730
Man'er.

653
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,280
Let's go.

654
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,980
Let's go.

655
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,780
Stop crowding here.

656
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,460
It's over.

657
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,440
Continue to eat and drink.

658
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,310
It's nothing.

659
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,640
Continue to eat and drink.

660
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,840
Sorry about just now.

661
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,420
Enjoy the food and drinks.

662
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,900
Sorry about just now.

663
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,700
Take care.

664
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,090
It's okay.

665
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,140
The problem for now

666
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,020
has finally been solved.

667
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,940
My life

668
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,630
is spared.

669
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,010
But the recipe has been sold.

670
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,040
We need to think of other ways

671
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,900
to make money.

672
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,560
Man'er.

673
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,330
Youheng.

674
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,540
I borrowed money from everyone I could the last couple of days.

675
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,270
I finally raised enough money.

676
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,950
There's no need.

677
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,190
Why?

678
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,010
Just now, Lian Man'er

679
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,230
sold the recipe

680
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,220
for garlic peanuts.

681
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,350
We've got the money.

682
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,530
You sold the recipe?

683
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,590
Then...

684
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,030
Can you redeem it?

685
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,270
If only

686
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,400
I could have been faster.

687
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,010
It's okay. Look.

688
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,870
I don't need to go to jail

689
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,530
or dig salt. How great is that?

690
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,760
Tomorrow is the 15th. After I pay the tax,

691
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,040
I'll be fine.

692
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,890
You know what?

693
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,180
Today, my grandma,

694
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,980
Aunt He and Uncle Shouyi

695
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,900
made a scene in the restaurant. It was so embarrassing...

696
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,660
Lian Man'er!

697
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,030
You're going to

698
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,730
pay the tax at the government office tomorrow.

699
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,790
Can you do it alone?

700
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,540
Sure.

701
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:58,950
Why?

702
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,680
Nothing.

703
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,300
It's just since we'll stop

704
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,640
supplying peanuts to the restaurants,

705
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,680
I should at least inform them.

706
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:18,659
Let's go.

707
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,880
And then, they wanted to sell the recipe

708
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,610
to the owner of the restaurant.

709
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,219
Which recipe?

710
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,159
The recipe for garlic peanuts.

711
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,000
But that recipe was actually fake.

712
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,560
Fake?

713
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,710
[Song's Residence]

714
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,580
♫Dear, please don't♫

715
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,770
♫Worry so much♫

716
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,990
♫Just take me as your maid♫

717
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,360
♫I don't want your money♫

00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,740
♫I only want to be with you♫

719
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,950
♫I only want to be with you♫

720
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,580
♫We can make do with bread and water♫

721
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,780
♫I don't care how poor we are♫

722
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,200
Miss.

723
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,750
Your rouge is so beautiful.

724
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,970
-Come on, Miss.
-Let's go.

725
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,910
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

726
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,030
The troupe performance over there

727
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,090
must be wonderful.

728
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,230
Let's go check it out.

729
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,020
What are you doing here?

730
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,950
The Song family is having a banquet.

731
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,210
Why didn't you tell me?

732
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,140
If I missed such a good business opportunity,

733
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
it would be a loss.

734
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,450
How did you get in without an invitation?

735
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,200
I bribed them

736
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,700
with peanuts.

737
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,320
Leave here.

738
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,210
Where to?

739
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,140
Back home.

740
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,090
Why are you trying to send me back in such a hurry?

741
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,290
What do you want to do?

742
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,370
Don't ask about things that don't concern you.

743
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,230
I won't leave if you don't tell me.

744
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,310
I came to the Song Mansion today

745
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,170
to get something very important.

746
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,270
I can't guarantee

747
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,600
what will happen later.

748
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,500
But if something happens to you since you refuse to leave,

749
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,160
I won't be able to protect you.

750
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,590
Go.

751
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,350
Go back home.

752
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,710
How's it going?

753
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,950
Where's the counting room?

754
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,980
In the west wing of the backyard.

755
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,320
I investigated here

756
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,580
when they were setting up the stage.

757
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,020
Okay.

758
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,640
We must succeed today.

759
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,380
As long as we get the registration book,

760
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,100
we can leave Jinyang County

761
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,230
as soon as possible.

762
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,820
What's wrong?

763
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,100
Nothing.

764
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,460
Now everyone in the mansion is watching the opera.

765
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,320
Let's be quick.

766
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,730
-Okay.
-Let's go.

767
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,300
Before the banquet started,

768
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,660
I saw Song Changsui come into the counting room

769
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,260
with the registration book.

770
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,980
And then he left empty-handed.

771
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,260
Why can't I find it now?

772
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,260
It's over so soon.

773
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,500
Don't worry.

774
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,420
There will be a new opera later.

775
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,350
We must watch it.

776
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,380
Why don't we patrol the backyard now?

777
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,460
We can come back on time.

778
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,510
Let's go.

779
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,300
Okay.

780
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,800
The backyard...

781
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,720
Will they be caught?

782
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,070
Oh my god.

783
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,910
Focus.

784
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,110
Don't open it!

785
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,670
There's a mechanism.

786
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,750
Hurry up. Stop dawdling.

787
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,370
I know. Coming.

788
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,300
Look.

789
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,150
I told you they're rich.

790
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,770
But you didn't believe me.

791
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,270
After this, I can build a big house.

792
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,130
Third Brother.

793
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,650
What's so good about building a house?

794
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,260
The stockade isn't big enough for you?

795
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,520
If you ask me, it's better to get married.

796
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,340
Is getting married better than building a big house?

797
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,140
Build a house!

798
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,990
It's better than building a house. Get married!

799
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,740
Build a house!

800
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,330
Get married!

801
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:14,940
Build a big house!

802
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,320
Get married!

803
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,920
-Build a big house!
-Shut up!

804
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,830
Do you want all the people out there

805
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,460
to hear us?

806
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,090
Take action.

807
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,440
Master.

808
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,990
He even brought a rice bag.

809
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:39,790
Eldest Young Master.

810
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,020
It'll be a while before the next performance starts.

811
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,420
Take your time, masters.

812
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,600
Have some tea.

813
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,290
Let's wait.

814
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,300
They're already coming up?

815
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,070
Why so fast?

816
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,340
So fast.

817
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,530
Dear folks.

818
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,920
Next,

819
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,470
we'll perform

820
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,940
a new opera called Heroes' Opera for you.

821
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,090
I hope

822
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,300
you can sing with us.

823
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,180
Okay?

824
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,270
Sing with us.

825
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,300
Come on.

826
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,830
♫Great rivers flow east♫

827
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,580
♫Stars in the sky follow the Big Dipper♫

828
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,950
♫Follow the Big Dipper♫

829
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,410
♫We will follow you to the grave over a bowl of wine♫

830
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,740
Come on. Sing with me.

831
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,780
♫Great rivers flow east♫

832
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,110
♫Stars in the sky follow the Big Dipper♫

833
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,250
It started.

834
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,820
Let's go watch it.

835
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:57,680
Let's go.

836
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:06,730
Master.

837
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,140
Why don't you

838
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,900
stay in Shengde Troupe with us?

839
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,430
That's right. I'm here to rob the Song family.

840
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,470
Who's there?
