00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,570
Miss Ye'er.

5
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,280
Miss Ye'er.

6
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,140
It's you.

7
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,640
You're still working at this hour?

8
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,630
Yes.

9
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,200
I need to finish grinding these beans quickly

10
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,920
or Grandma will scold me.

13
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,759
will move back here for a while.

14
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,690
How long will you be staying this time?

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,450
I'm not sure yet.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,930
Miss Ye'er.

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,660
Take a break

18
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,180
and have some snacks.

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,770
Let me do it.

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,090
Let me do it.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,210
It's good.

22
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,730
It's so delicious.

23
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,970
Don't move.

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,870
Are you here

25
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,100
specially to give me snacks?

26
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,210
Yes.

27
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,660
From now on, call me

28
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,370
if there's any work to do.

29
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,450
As long as I'm not busy, I'll do it.

30
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,340
I have plenty of strength.

31
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,940
Don't move.

32
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,000
Come on.

33
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,470
Come on.

34
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Eat something dry.

35
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
Hurry up. Good.

36
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
Thirteen.

37
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Come on.

38
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,250
Thirteen.

39
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,159
Ye'er.

40
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,920
What can I do for you?

41
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,850
I thought it was something big.

42
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,070
Don't be shy.

43
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:03,610
Give it to me.

44
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,300
If you want money in the future,

45
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,260
just tell me.

46
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,670
Here.

47
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,650
Take it.

48
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,140
No.

49
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,000
Ye'er.

50
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,080
I...

51
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,030
Thirteen?

52
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,850
Ye'er.

53
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,640
What are you two doing?

54
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,450
Miss Ye'er wanted me to...

55
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,910
No, no.

56
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,620
I'm watching Thirteen feed the pigs.

57
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,420
What is this?

58
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,200
Honey.

59
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,100
Look at how you eat.

60
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,450
The food's all over your face.

61
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,810
Here, wipe yourself.

62
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,210
Here.

63
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,260
Here.

64
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,120
I can do it myself.

65
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,810
So you're just very nice to everyone.

66
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,070
-What did you say?
-What did you say?

67
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,030
I said

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,260
that after eating the honey,

69
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,690
don't throw away the honeycomb.

70
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,450
You can use it to make lipstick.

71
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,260
Do you know how to make lipstick?

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,610
Melt the honeycomb,

73
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,900
put it in a cloth bag and squeeze it the pulp.

74
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,420
Melt it again and mix in honey

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,050
and your favorite colorant.

76
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,110
After it hardens, you can make it into

77
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,390
all colors and kinds of lipstick.

78
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,130
Great.

79
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,910
Miss Ye'er.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,730
Do you still remember

81
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,430
that I told you

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,460
that if you're willing,

83
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,100
we can make money together?

84
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,100
Well,

85
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,090
here's your chance.

86
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,300
What chance?

87
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,600
To make lipstick.

88
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,760
Thirteen will pick the honey from mountains for you.

89
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,650
You

90
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,300
will focus on making them at my place.

91
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,090
Then, I'll sell them for you.

92
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,690
No.

93
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,090
I still have a lot of work at home

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,890
waiting for me to do.

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,409
Father, Mother and Grandma

96
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,580
will definitely disagree to it.

97
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,860
Come here secretly then.

98
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,770
I-I was just saying.

99
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,390
I'm not that capable.

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,090
Miss Ye'er.

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,720
You definitely can do it.

102
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,560
Do you really think so?

103
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,460
Of course.

104
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,570
Miss Ye'er, think about it.

105
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,170
You are clever and handy.

106
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,530
If you don't put your skills to use,

107
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,330
it'd be such a waste.

108
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:53,940
Right?

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,240
Since Thirteen said so,

110
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,660
when I'm done with my work,

111
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,780
I'll try it when I'm free.

112
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,770
I'm going back to work.

113
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
One sentence from you

114
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,310
is more persuasive than ten sentences from me.

115
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,570
Stop looking.

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,460
Those from the Black Tiger Fortress

117
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,340
have already started to make wine.

118
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,410
We can't just stay idle.

119
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,020
Let's go.

120
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,400
Yes, the grapes this year...

121
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,230
Be gentle when washing the grapes.

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,460
Slowly.

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,810
Be careful.

124
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,470
Sister, give me more.

125
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,500
Here.

126
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,250
Okay.

127
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,640
Here, try one.

128
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,220
Everyone, hurry up.

129
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440

130
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,550

we have almost enough money.

In a few days,

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,170
let's go check out the stores.

Man'er.

Shen.

173
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:12,610
Have a seat.

174
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,370
You came at the right time.

We're splitting the money.

176
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,200
Splitting the money?

177
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,530
This is

178
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,360
for Black Tiger Fortress.

179
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,030
We split it fifty-fifty.

180
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,490
This is

181
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,280
for Seven's birthday.

182
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,890
This is

183
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,700
the money we're keeping to buy a store.

184
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,780
This is yours.

185
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,200
Thank you for lending me money before

186
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,400

189
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,970
You still need money in a lot of aspects.

190
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,120
Keep it for now.

191
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,570
Just take it.

192
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,770
Why?

193
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,450
Don't you trust my ability to make money?

194
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,290
Take it.

195
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,490
Take it.

196
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,330
Okay.

197
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,410
Man'er.

198
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,190
Has my father

199
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,860
asked about me recently?

200
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,290
Don't worry.

201
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,990
I've settled everything.

202
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,520
Mr. Laojin still thinks

203
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,550
that you're collecting debts outside of town.

204
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,540
Okay.

205
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,970
Shen.

206
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,690
Just now,

207
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,690
what were you discussing about?

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,950
Luckily,

209
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,170
Black Tiger Fortress helped us this time

210
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,080
to produce a huge batch

211
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,000
of brandy,

212
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,220
so that we could

213
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,130
make so much money

214
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,050
in such a short time.

215
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,150
When I had to do business with Yu Xiangjin and the lot,

216
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,160
I initially thought

217
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,610
that we're helping them out

218
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
such that they can make a living.

219
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,320
Unexpectedly,

220
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,440
they're the ones who helped us greatly in the end.

221
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,520
Yes.

222
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,040
How dare you sell fake wine and poisonous wine?

223
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,370
My brother became like this after drinking it.

224
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,300
I must kill you today.

225
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,820
I...

226
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,060
Great.

227
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,240
I've been looking for you for days.

228
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,330
Here you are.

229
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,760
My brother became like this after drinking your wine.

230
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,080
The fake wine you're selling...

231
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,130
Uncle Shouyi.

232
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,500
Uncle Shouyi, what happened?

233
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,020
I don't know.

234
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,770
He sold fake wine and poisonous wine.

235
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,410
My brother became like this after drinking it.

236
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,920
If you don't give me an explanation today,

237
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,650
I won't spare you.

238
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,700
Nonsense!

239
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,940
I just added some water

240
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,760
to the wine.

241
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,830
How could this have happened?

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,680
No wonder I had two jars of wine which were off.

243
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,530
Uncle Shouyi, you stole my wine

244
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,900
and even watered down the wine.

245
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:21,930
Man'er, now

246
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,330
is not the time to talk about that.

247
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,080
He has a chronic illness.

248
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,590
This was not caused by drinking.

249
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,580
See?

250
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,290
Who is this quack

251
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:33,840
spouting nonsense here?

252
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,040
What are you doing?

253
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,270
Can you be responsible for this?

254
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,160
Calm down.

255
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,870
Give him to the doctor first.

256
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,020
Youheng is a skilled doctor.

257
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,220
He has cured many people.

258
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,940
He'll be fine with Youheng.

259
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,980
Sirs.

260
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,140
Calm down first.

261
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,750
Saving him is the priority now.

262
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,130
Okay, fine.

263
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,660
Why hasn't Father and Three

264
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,440
come back?

265
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,360
Darn that Shouyi.

266
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,740
Xiu'er.

267
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,260
Later, when they

268
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,490
break in and make trouble,

269
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,410
just hide under the bed.

270
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,560
Mother.

271
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,450
I'm scared.

272
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,520
Son.

273
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,920
Son.

274
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,200
Brother.

275
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,040
This...

276
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,090
Son!

277
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,540
Son!

278
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:23,980
Brother!

279
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,490
Son!

280
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,050
Brother!

281
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,310
Son, wake up!

282
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,090
Brother, wake up!

283
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,760
Brother!

284
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,070
Brother!

285
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,540
Murderer!

286
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,300
Murderer!

287
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,260
Brother!

288
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,960
You quack.

289
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,350
You killed my brother.

290
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,330
You...

291
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,720
are selling fake wine.

292
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,100
No.

293
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,270
Your...

294
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,700
medical treatment killed someone.

295
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,190
I'll beat you to death!

296
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,620
It's still uncertain whether the patient is alive or death.

297
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,750
Are you trying to punish him illegally?

298
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,490
If anything happens,

299
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,040
let the government decide.

300
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,580
I'll take full responsibility.

301
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,280
Brother!

302
00:13:59,210 --> 00:13:59,840
Save him.

303
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,730
This...

304
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,200
Brother.

305
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:33,850
Brother.

306
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:41,940
Brother.

307
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,060
Brother.

308
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,090
Son!

309
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,880
Brother, say something.

310
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,560
Son! Brother!

311
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,080
Brother! Brother!

312
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,440
You...

313
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,920
Son, wake up!

314
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,760
Brother!

315
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,380
-Brother!
-Brother!

316
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,880
Murderer!

317
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,560
[Shisanli Camp]

318
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,970
I’ve made myself very clear.

319
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,780
My brother drank your wine

320
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,580
and died.

321
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,300
My mother also got a shock

322
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,200
because of this

323
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,490
and can't get up.

324
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,100
You'll have to compensate us 300 taels

325
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,500
to solve this problem.

326
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,810
You're obviously demanding an exorbitant amount.

327
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,980
This is extortion!

328
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,460
The officials are here.

329
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,530
How dare you accuse us of extorting money?

330
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,330
Sir.

331
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,560
My brother died unjustly.

332
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,090
You have to help me

333
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,140
and seek justice for me.

334
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,690
Sir.

335
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,600
We'll pay. We'll pay.

336
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,820
We'll pay. We'll pay.

337
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,330
Father.

338
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:06,980
Mother.

339
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,770
Think of a way.

340
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,210
S-Sir.

341
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,010
We are all

342
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,900
from the same area.

343
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,460
Yes.

344
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,300
Can you

345
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,420
give us a few more days?

346
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,400
Give us a few more days.

347
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,080
Sir.

348
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,300
Do you know

349
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,290
who my elder brother is?

350
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,450
He's Lian Shouren,

351
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,220
a scholar.

352
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,090
And my third brother is a businessman.

353
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,180
I don't care if he's a scholar

354
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,210
or a businessman.

355
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,100
I just want money.

356
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,730
Get me the money.

357
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,970
You're so...

358
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,560
Move aside.

359
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,560
Sir.

360
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,430
My incompetent husband

361
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,940
just stole my niece's wine

362
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,840
and watered it down

363
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,890
to sell it on the street.

364
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,090
Tell me.

365
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,960
Whether this man who died

366
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,580
really drank it

367
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,150
or if he really died from drinking the wine,

368
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,540
we can't be sure.

369
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,410
How can we reason things out in this situation?

370
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,570
You still want to deny it?

371
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,180
Sir, just take him back.

372
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,680
No, no, no

373
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,380
Father! Look for Laojin!

374
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,410
Laojin! Laojin!

375
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,410
There's no other way now.

376
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,020
Look for Laojin.

377
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,150
If we borrow money from a private bank,

378
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,570
how are we going to pay it back?

379
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,410
What about Eldest Brother?

380
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,280
Something big happened to our family

381
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,069
yet Eldest Brother is in town and indifferent.

382
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,980
For Lian Hua'er's marriage,

383
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,630
we

384
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,960
exhausted our family's resources.

385
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,280
Shouldn't Eldest Brother offer some money?

386
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,960
Father!

387
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,950
I know.

388
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,810
I know.

389
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,410
Sir.

390
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,000
Do you know who my niece

391
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,710
is married to?

392
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,460
The Song family in town.

393
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,550
Song Hailong.

394
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,140
He's rich.

395
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,980
You can ask him for money.

396
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,710
Yes.

397
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,290
Ask the Song family for money.

398
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,170
Shouyi.

399
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,960
You were the one who did something wrong.

400
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,650
Don't get your eldest brother involved.

401
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,180
I can't do this or that.

402
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,010
Then you have to give me a solution!

403
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,740
Well...

404
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,610
I'm trying to figure something out now.

405
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,770
Figuring out? Hurry up!

406
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,520
Are you paying or not?

407
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,110
Sir.

408
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,180
Sir, just take him back.

409
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,190
W-We have...

410
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,350
We have the money. We have the money.

411
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,730
-Shouyi! 
-We have the money.

412
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,300
Father!

413
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,580
Wait. Wait.

414
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,490
Wait.

415
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,870
Come here.

416
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,730
Come here.

417
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,630
Look at her.

418
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,810
How is this lady?

419
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,980
Father.

420
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
She's too skinny.

421
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,140
Twenty taels.

422
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,560
Father.

423
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,200
Twenty taels.

424
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,980
Twenty taels can be paid off with her, right?

425
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,690
Father.

426
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,560
My family is poor.

427
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,800
I didn't feed her well.

428
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,140
When you go back,

429
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,570
she'll gain some weight after feeding her delicacies for two days.

430
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,230
You'll have a better life there.

431
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,070
It'll be more comfortable than home.

432
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,140
Go.

433
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,380
Shouyi.

434
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,200
Go.

435
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,480
Shouyi!

436
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,720
Mother!

437
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,580
Go.

438
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,160
Ye'er!

439
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,770
What are you doing?

440
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:33,820
Don't move!

441
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,240
Don't move!

442
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,960
Don't move!

443
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,740
Don't move!

444
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,580
-Put it down!
-Are you buying me or not?

445
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,740
Are you buying me or not?

446
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,320
Put it down!

447
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can't buy me.

448
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,010
This...

449
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:45,960
This...

450
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,730
Ye'er.

451
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,560
Put it down!

452
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,740
Ye'er.

453
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,860
Your father was momentarily confused just now.

454
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,390
Don't take it to heart.

455
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,330
Let's put the ax down first.

456
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,340
Put it down!

457
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,580
I'm her father!

458
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,920
I have the final say!

459
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,890
Take her away!

460
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,830
Take her away!

461
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,200
Mother!

462
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,820
Screw you!

463
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,580
What are you doing?

464
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,950
What are you doing here?

465
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,670
Go away!

466
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,380
Who...

467
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,370
Who is this?

468
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,540
One who buys or sells civilians

469
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,810
will be flogged 100 times and exiled 3,000 miles away.

470
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,290
One who buys or sells wives, concubines, children, or grandchildren

471
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,890
will be flogged 100 times and sentenced to three years in prison.

472
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,240
How dare you do this

473
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,290
in front of the officials?

474
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,970
Is there still any law?

475
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,790
I'm not buying her!

476
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,950
Everyone's crazy in this family.

477
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,010
Just take away the one

478
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,680
who killed my brother.

479
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,080
Yes.

480
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:36,610
Sir.

481
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,530
Take him away.

482
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,540
I have an idea.

483
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,040
Wait.

484
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,820
Shouyi!

485
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,060
Father. Mother.

486
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,090
If I go to jail,

487
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,880
Eldest Brother will also be implicated.

488
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,810
Father, save me! Father!

489
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,960
Shouyi!

490
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,750
Leave me alone!

491
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,740
Shouyi!

492
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,130
Shouyi!

493
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,340
Mother!

494
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,290
Mother, do something.

495
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,330
Why is my life so miserable?

496
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,330
Why are you here?

497
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,640
So the surprise you mentioned

498
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,010
is planting vegetables in a hot spring cave?

499
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,870
I've never seen this before.

500
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,240
Did you manage all these yourself?

501
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,390
Youheng helped me out a lot.

502
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,150
I promised to help you before.

503
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,330
I broke my promise.

504
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,360
It's fine.

505
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,690
I shouldn't have dragged you along to do this and that.

506
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,990
At that time,

507
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,500
I didn't know your identity

508
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,570
nor did I know

509
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,810
that you have other important things to do.

510
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,250
After I left,

511
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,250
I realized...

512
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,210
that there's nothing

513
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,090
more important than you.

514
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,560
Just now, your uncle Shouyi

515
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,050
wanted to sell Ye'er to pay off the debt.

516
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,320
If Thirteen hadn't stopped it in time,

517
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,730
I'm afraid Ye'er

518
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,550
would already have been

519
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,370
sold to somewhere.

520
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,130
Now, your uncle Shouyi

521
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,330
has been taken away by the government officials.

522
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,080
Uncle Shouyi...

523
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,120
Uncle Shouyi actually tried to sell his daughter to pay off his debt?

524
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,430
Although

525
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,150
he did a bad thing

526
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,270
by selling watered-down wine,

527
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,100
this wine couldn't have killed someone.

528
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,890
It's clear that the other party is a rogue

529
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,340
and the government took bribes.

530
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,580
That's why he was arrested.

531
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,060
Right now, the government

532
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,190
doesn't have any conclusive evidence.

533
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,710
They wouldn't dare

534
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,610
do anything to your uncle.

535
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,520
Compared to Uncle Shouyi,

536
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,640
I'm more worried about Youheng.

537
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,100
Are you talking about how Youheng

538
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,020
killed someone with his medical treatment?

539
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,750
He looks weak,

540
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,600
but he's actually quite strong inside.

541
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,120
He should be fine.

542
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,560
You don't know him.

543
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,080
If it were about something else,

544
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,040
no one would have to say anything

545
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
and he'd know how to

546
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,060
resolve it internally.

547
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,310
But being a doctor

548
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,780
is too important to him.

549
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,360
If if something goes slightly wrong,

550
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,230
he will feel guilty and blame himself.

551
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,600
Besides, this time,

552
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,130
someone died in his hands.

553
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,800
It's not as simple as you said.

554
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,850
I don't know him as well as you do.

555
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,120
But I think it's impossible for everything to go smoothly

556
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,570
regardless of what you do.

557
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,970
Maybe experiencing

558
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,940
this ordeal

559
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,020
will make him become stronger.

560
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,340
I hope so.

561
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,890
I asked the coroner and verified

562
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,200
that that man

563
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,570
suffered from severe chest pain.

564
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,250
There was nothing wrong

565
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,380
with your medical treatment.

566
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,040
I stopped you from studying medicine

567
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,050
and asked you to follow in my footsteps and collect interest.

568
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,570
Then I'd be free from worry.

569
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,540
It's probably

570
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,600
good that something bad happened to you now.

571
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,180
Now you know

572
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,610
how hard it is to be a doctor.

573
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:00,830
Here.

574
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,410
Brat, listen up.

575
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,180
You are sad today,

576
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,690
so I'm talking nicely

577
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,570
with you.

578
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,020
In the future,

579
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,090
if you dare treat others again,

580
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,240
I'll beat you up.

581
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,840
If it were another doctor,

582
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,290
he might have been saved.

583
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

584
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,710
Even a god wouldn't have been able

585
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,760
to save that man.

586
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,130
Here.

587
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,080
Drink up.

588
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,340
Drink it and cover your head and sleep.

589
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,860
You can't think about anything when you're asleep.

590
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,810
Have some food.

591
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,470
Thank you, Father.

592
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,200
Father. Mother.

593
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,410
What should we do?

594
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,400
Father.

595
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,750
Eldest Brother.

596
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,980
Eldest Brother, you're finally back.

597
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,790
Please save Shouyi.

598
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,010
Please.

599
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,490
I'll do anything for you.

600
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,280
I'm begging you.

601
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,480
Shouren.

602
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,290
Hurry and think of a way

603
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,760
to get Shouyi out.

604
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,960
Also, about the amount of compensation,

605
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,560
see if you can

606
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,320
get someone

607
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,040
to ask them to reduce it.

608
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,210
We really don't have

609
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,410
that much money.

610
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,110
Yes.

611
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,420
Well...

612
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,050
Say something!

613
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,180
Eldest Brother.

614
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,550
Shouyi is in prison

615
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,500
where he's eating rancid steamed buns

616
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,310
with huge rats running around everywhere.

617
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,780
Even if a living person went in,

618
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,490
he'd be tortured to dead in a few days.

619
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,660
If Shouyi is gone,

620
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,320
I don't want to live either.

621
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
I don't want to live anymore.

622
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,770
-All right.
-Stop crying!

623
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,490
Father.

624
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,040
As you know,

625
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,580
I

626
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,470
do know some people indeed.

627
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,630
But to bribe people,

628
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,960
doesn't it...

629
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,610
Doesn't it require money?

630
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,310
That ignorant fool.

631
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,050
It's fine that he sold wine,

632
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,690
but why did he water it down?

633
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,100
Fine.

634
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,290
Since none of you would help me,

635
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,780
I'll figure it out myself.

636
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,630
He.

637
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,380
He...

638
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,130
They're all bullying me.

639
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,250
No one will help me.

640
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,340
Sister-in-law.

641
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,480
Are you busy?

642
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,780
With these matters,

643
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,100
don't take it to heart.

644
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,370
Don't blame our parents.

645
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,590
They have their difficulties.

646
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,670
Come on.

647
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,830
You're not in trouble,

648
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,700
so of course you're not worried.

649
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,400
Father and Mother

650
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,920
have always been on your side.

651
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,450
Who would have thought about our Second Master?

652
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,800
Shouyi is so pitiful.

653
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,120
Both his parents don't love him.

654
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,110
Even if he has a capable brother,

655
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,290
he won't help either.

656
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,540
Sister-in-law.

657
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,890
Look at what you're saying.

658
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,530
Aren't I here now?

659
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,530
As the saying goes,

660
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,420
all things fall into place

661
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,390
eventually.

662
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:15,860
I

663
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,340
thought of an idea for you.

664
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,130
What idea?

665
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:06,950
Why...

666
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,290
are you back?

667
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,980
I...

668
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,240
Didn't you go out just now?

669
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,320
Aunt He, did you take my money?

670
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:12,950
No.

671
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:13,650
No.

672
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,450
Let me see.

673
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,030
No.

674
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,540
Let me...

675
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,290
Aunt He.

676
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,240
Did you take my money?

677
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,810
No.

678
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,960
Did you take my money?

679
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,580
Mother, Aunt He stole my money!

680
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,320
He.

681
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:23,900
He.

682
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,010
What are you doing?

683
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,560
Stop there!

684
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,330
Aunt He.

685
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:30,890
Come down.

686
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,950
Listen to me.

687
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,630
I've let you down.

688
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,770
But I can't abandon your uncle.

689
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,970
Your uncle Shouren said

690
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,250
that as long as I have money,

691
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,100
he can save Shouyi.

692
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,400
When Shouyi comes out,

693
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,810
you can scold me and hit me

694
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,300
however you like!

695
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,720
He!

696
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,180
Aunt He...

697
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,330
Did she fall down?

698
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,060
Aunt He, stop there!

699
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,770
Stop there!

700
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,610
Forget it, Man'er.

701
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,430
Forget it, Man'er.

702
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:55,850
Stop chasing.

703
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:56,900
It's useless even if you catch up with her.

704
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,950
She won't give it to you.

705
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,340
Your aunt He

706
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,260
has no choice either.

707
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,760
She just wants to save your uncle Shouyi.

708
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:02,890
She is

709
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,420
not a bad person.

710
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,720
Mother.

711
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,990
That's my hard-earned money.

712
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,060
I still need to buy a store.

713
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,280
This matter is not over yet.

714
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,640
Besides,

715
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,920
it's uncertain whether

716
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,850
Uncle Shouren is reliable

717
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,580
and can save Uncle Shouyi.

718
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,320
Great.

719
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,730
Aunt He took all the money.

720
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,840
The money for daily expenses,

721
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,850
the money to buy raw materials,

722
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,110
and the money for Seven's birthday.

723
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,970
I've divided every penny

724
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,810
clearly.

725
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,430
The money to buy the store is gone too.

726
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,240
What should I tell Shen Nuo?

727
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,010
[Seven's birthday]

728
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,570
The money for Seven's birthday.

729
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,990
[Seven's birthday]

730
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,140
Hurry up.

731
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,630
Stand here.

732
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,730
He.

733
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,840
Any news of Shouyi?

734
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:06,810
Man'er.

735
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,990
I brought Ye'er here

736
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,960
to apologize to you.

737
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,000
As for the money,

738
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,660
I've already stolen it.

739
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,410
You can hit me or scold me however you like.

740
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,150
Will hitting you and scolding you

741
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,270
bring my money back?

742
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,960
No.

743
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,880
But for this,

744
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,780
your uncle Shouyi and I

745
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,620
will remember your kindness forever.

746
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,340
In the future, no matter what you need help with,

747
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,040
just let me know.

748
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,400
As long as I can save your uncle Shouyi,

749
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,590
even if I have to

750
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,560
go through hell,

751
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,060
I'll do it.

752
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,800
Aunt He.

753
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,520
I understand your difficulties.

754
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,700
But your promise

755
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,820
is too unrealistic.

756
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,500
Man'er.

757
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,430
What do you want then?

758
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,700
As long as you don't send me to jail,

759
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,150
I'll do anything you want me to do.

760
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,050
Really?

761
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,670
Yes.

762
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,080
If you want money, I don't have any.

763
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,360
If you want my life...

764
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,400
I-I can't give you that either.

765
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,680
-But...
-I don’t want your life

766
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,570
or your money.

767
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,520
I want someone from you.

768
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:09,290
You...

769
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,170
want someone?

770
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,489
Since you want to sell Ye'er,

771
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:14,889
why don't you sell her to me?

772
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,010
Man'er.

773
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,270
This...

774
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:24,699
Ye'er...

775
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,170
This...

776
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,659
You want me to use Ye'er

777
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,050
to pay off this debt?

778
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,620
Man'er.

779
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,280
I don't think

780
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,440
that's appropriate.

781
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,100
Do you really only want Ye'er?

782
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:42,560
Mother.

783
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,560
Ye'er will continue to live

784
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,360
in the east wing.

785
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,830
But when she works,

786
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,929
she can only work at my place

787
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,520
until she gets married.

788
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,290
Then this debt will be cleared.

789
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,890
I'll also have to trouble you

790
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,490
to tell Grandma about this.

791
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,660
He!

792
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,640
This...

793
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,210
Man'er.

794
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,210
Man'er.

795
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,890
I don't think it's a good idea.

796
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,530
Then the mother and daughter

797
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,770
will be separated from each other from now on.

798
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,460
Uncle Shouxin.

799
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,640
Aunt Zhang.

800
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,200
Don't blame Man'er.

801
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,200
Don't worry about me either.

802
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,300
My father was going to sell me

803
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,480
and my mother abandoned me.

804
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,410
I'm redundant to them.

805
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,910
I'm alone from now on.

806
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,140
Don't be sad.

807
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,890
Ye'er.

808
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,300
I'm here for you.

809
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,600
Don't be sad.

810
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,370
I'm here.

811
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,020
Here.

812
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,010
Miss Ye'er is here too.

813
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,170
It's just right. Here.

814
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,090
Thirteen's cooking is delicious.

815
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,200
You should eat more of it from now on.

816
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,720
I remember you don't eat chili.

817
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,690
I didn’t put chili. I put some ginger foam.

818
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,450
-Ye'er! 
-Mother.

819
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,540
Let her have some quiet time alone.

820
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,530
Wait.

821
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,730
What's wrong with her?

822
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,760
Her mother sold her to me.

823
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,200
Wait.

824
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,100
Then I'd better go check on her.

825
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,920
Enjoy your meal first.

826
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,250
What a mess.

827
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,020
It started when Uncle Shouyi tried to sell his daughter.

828
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,660
Ye'er

829
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,950
was already sad then.

830
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,700
So I thought

831
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,650
I could take this opportunity

832
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,430
to bring her here.

833
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,690
In this way,

834
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,570
she can still do

835
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,390
what she wants to do.

836
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,770
And she doesn't have to

837
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,090
to do chores for her family

838
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,310
and be bullied all day.

839
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,820
Chunzhu.

840
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,920
Go home for dinner.

841
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,140
I left some food for you.

842
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,220
It's your favorite

843
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,690
braised pork with eggplant.

844
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,890
You're so heavy.

845
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,490
You brat.

846
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,450
Chunzhu is such a good boy.

847
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,020
Give it to me.

848
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,510
Did you have fun today?

849
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,760
Why are you here?

850
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,670
Put this on.

851
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,640
Ye'er.

852
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,830
Do you know how Master

853
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,050
taught me martial arts in the past?

854
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,090
Even on the coldest days

855
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,120
or the hottest days,

856
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,660
from morning to night, he made me

857
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,200
stand barefoot

858
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,510
in the river to train my concentration.

859
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,530
From morning to night?

860
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,300
Your master was really cruel.

861
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,320
Yes.

862
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,480
Then, I was thinking

863
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,080
if my master had a grudge against me.

864
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,630
Why did he always torture me?

865
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,110
Then how did you get through it?

866
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,920
Then I started to think of ways

867
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,930
to distract myself.

868
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,090
I was counting the fishes in the river.

869
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,400
I thought

870
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,720
that after I finish training,

871
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,060
I'll catch them all

872
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,510
and make fried fish,

873
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,080
grilled fish,

874
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,580
and fish soup,

875
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,680
and have a good meal.

876
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,230
This way, I kept counting

877
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,150
until I reached 1,000.

878
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,650
That way, time flew by.

879
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:10,780
Ye'er.

880
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,960
One should try to look on the bright side.

881
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,380
Don't always think about the negative side of things.

882
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,640
Life is short.

883
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,970
Don't care about others.

884
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,680
You must live for yourself.

885
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,150
Understand?

886
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,550
Are you going back to eat?

887
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,310
It's getting late. I'm heading back.

888
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,190
Are you letting your uncle Shouyi's family off

889
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,100
just like this?

890
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,260
What else can I do?

891
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,380
This is not like you.

892
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,170
What am I like?

893
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,770
You care about nothing but money,

894
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,120
are extremely stingy,

895
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,570
seek revenge for even the smallest grievances,

896
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,880
and are merciless when you're in the right.

897
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,100
What else?

898
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,890
Are...

899
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,360
you angry?

900
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,450
If it were in the past,

901
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,220
you would have already scolded me.

902
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,750
I'm just a little sad.

903
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,680
Ye'er is a good person.

904
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,870
Unfortunately, she was born in Uncle Shouyi's family.

905
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,540
Her parents don't love her,

906
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,290
but she still has to take care of all of them.

907
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:08,920
I think

908
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,600
this is a good opportunity

909
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,440
for her to break free.

910
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,720
I have to try my best to help her.

911
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,770
Let me tell you a story.

912
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,790
There once was a little foal

913
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,680
who fell into a dry well.

914
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,100
It was very small

915
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,010
and weak.

916
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,440
So it tried its best,

917
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,540
but couldn't get out.

918
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,950
Someone passed by

919
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,020
and saw it lying inside.

920
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,360
They wanted to tease it

921
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,040
so they filled the well with soil.

922
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:41,780
Unexpectedly,

923
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,400
after this person left,

924
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,040
this little foal

925
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,690
actually pushed his head upwards.

926
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,280
Step by step,

927
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,130
he stepped onto the soil.

928
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,400
Little by little,

929
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,870
it climbed out on its own.

930
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,100
This little foal is

931
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,510
from Shen Village, right?

932
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,400
Although I was born in a minister's family,

933
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,090
because I'm an illegitimate child,

934
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,760
my so-called siblings

935
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,610
pushed me into the dry well.

936
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,940
My parents didn't care

937
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,450
and stayed indifferent.

938
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,390
But after this

939
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,450
little foal from Shen Village

940
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,560
climbed out,

941
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,580
with my own ability,

942
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:41,730
I was admitted into Academies of Classical Learning

943
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,600
and became the Prince's study partner.

944
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,360
From then on,

945
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,760
I studied,

946
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,840
learned horse riding,

947
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:49,860
learned archery,

948
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,290
and planned my future.

949
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,550
I've come this far step by step.

950
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,840
Man'er.

951
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,400
No one

952
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,530
can really help anyone.

953
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,010
Everyone

954
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,560
has to create their journey on their own.

955
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,020
Shen Nuo.

956
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,610
Is there anything else

957
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,560
that I don't know about you?

958
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,360
Let's go back.

959
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,090

to buy a store.
