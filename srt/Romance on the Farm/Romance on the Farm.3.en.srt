[Episode 3]

4
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,259
Since the Sun family dared to kidnap me,

5
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,720
they'll surely come back.

6
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,410
Instead of waiting,

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,410
we should find a way to solve it.

8
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,110
The Sun family doesn't lack people.

9
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,320
But there are only three of us.

10
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,250
What can we do?

11
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,380
How can you say that

12
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,640
without trying first?

13
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,550
Fine.

14
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
You'll be the bait

15
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,670
to lure the Sun family into the trap.

16
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,009
The Sun family is

17
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,539
well-known and respected by the locals.

18
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,590
Even if we go to town

19
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,180
and yell about it all day,

20
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,510
no one would believe us.

21
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,570
Even if they do,

22
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,580
no one dares to do anything

23
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,780
without solid proof.

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,500

and the officials see it with their own eyes.

27
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,450
But this move

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,430
needs Lian Man'er to be the bait

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
to lure the Sun family into the trap.

30
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,030
You...

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,020
You were caught by us on purpose.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,840
That's right.

33
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,150
I've left marks along the way.

34
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,240

37
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,840
You can't leave today!

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,820
They are fighting.

39
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,710
They're fighting!

40
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,780
What should we do?

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,580
No.

42
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,430
I have to save Man'er.

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,140
Otherwise,

44
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,780
people will criticize me behind my back.

45
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,480
They'll call us unkind and unfaithful.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,380
I can't live with that.

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,060
Sit down!

48
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,980

If you have the energy,

147
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,840
you should thank our reinforcements.

What are you waiting for? Chase them!

Have you found them?

170
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,350
I looked everywhere

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,390
in the village

172
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,510
and at the field.

173
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,640
It's already dark.

174
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,670
Where did they go?

175
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,390
Slow down.

176
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,190
Father.

177
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,510
Slow down.

178
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,470
Father, Mother.

179
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,700
Man'er.

180

Man'er.

182
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,500
What happened?

183
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,930
What's with your clothes?

184
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,720
I'm fine.

185
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,080
Are you okay?

186
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,740
Where did you go?

187
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,550

You didn't see

191
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,690
how big the fire was.

192
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,480
It was burning.

193
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,230
It almost burned Man'er.

194
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,110
They really wanted to kill her.

195
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,630
I'm scared just thinking about it.

196
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,270
What are you doing?

197
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,230
-Get up.
-Father.

198
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,690
Get up.

199
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,180
Man'er.

200
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,580
Man'er, stay out of it.

201
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,340
Father.

202
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,980
Mother.

203
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,350
Man'er is my only daughter.

204
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,160
If anything happens to her,

205
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,760
I will die too.

206
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,400
Please uphold justice for me.

207
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,470
Shouxin.

208
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,180
I will ask Shouren

209
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,750
to give you an explanation.

210
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,770
Slowly.

211
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,770
Get up.

212
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,700
Dear.

213
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,580
Come on.

214
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,220
Get up.

215
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,140
Father agreed.

216
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,260
Man'er.

217
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,170
Man'er.

218
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,830
I'm glad you're fine.

219
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,540
As long as she's fine.

220
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,180
As long as she's fine.

221
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,430
Okay.

222
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,300
Let's go home.

223
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,350
Let's go.

224
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:05,860
Shen.

225
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,390
Let's go in first.

226
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,680
It's been six hours.

227
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,730
I've never seen such a long

228
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,530
acupuncture treatment before.

229
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,860
Youheng,

230
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,460
are you practicing on me?

231
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,580
The acupuncture treatment is long in nature.

232
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,040
Bear with it for a bit more.

233
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,110
No fighting for the next few days.

234
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,970
Just let Youheng practice on you.

235
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,660
If it weren't for him,

236
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,890
we wouldn't even be alive right now.

237
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,740
After this,

238
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
Grandpa won't let

239
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,220
Uncle Shouren and Aunt Gu go easily.

240
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,110
According to my father,

241
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,990
Uncle Shouren and Aunt Gu

242
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,520
haven't been home for a day.

243
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,560
They must be hiding

244
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,030
now that the truth is out.

245
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,460
Since my grandparents witnessed

246
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,830
the widow burning attempt,

247
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,460
the Sun family

248
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,860
won't act rashly, right?

249
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,150
Bees have venomous stings.

250
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,240
Jackals bite back.

251
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,100
I hope it goes as you wish.

252
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,470
Speak plainly.

253
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,940
Shen thinks

254
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,300
the Sun family won't stop here.

255
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,790
In fact, they'll be even more aggressive.

256
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,350
When one strikes,

257
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,440
one must go for the kill.

258
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,010
Otherwise, there may be retaliations.

259
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,900
The Sun family

260
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,850
hasn't been arrested by the officials yet.

261
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,220
We can only wait and see.

262
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,700
Youheng.

263
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,700
You are usually so gentle and elegant.

264
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,500
I didn't expect you to be so bold.

265
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,370
I can't believe you got a bunch of beggars

266
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,570
to pretend to be government officials.

267
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,960
This is the first time

268
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,620
I've made such a deviant move.

269
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,290
But I had no choice.

270
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,630
Youheng,

271
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,710
how much did you spend

272
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,970
to hire those beggars?

273
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,220
Not much.

274
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,840
No need to be polite with me.

275
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,350
I

276
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,600
have plenty of money.

277
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,230
Where did you get the money?

278
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,450
What's wrong?

279
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,600
The Sun family wanted my life.

280
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,860
I only took 100 taels from them.

281
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,590
It's fair.

282
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,770
The situation today

283
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,920
was so tense.

284
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,980
You still had time to steal money?

285
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,590
Of course.

286
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,630
I couldn't have done all that for nothing.

287
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,380
Man'er.

288
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,370
Man'er.

289
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,460
Man'er!

290
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,230
Man'er.

291
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,350
Man'er!

292
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,890
Mother, what happened?

293
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:47,990
Man'er!

294
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,860
Just now,

295
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,370
I went to your room to look for you.

296
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,030
But I couldn't find you.

297
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,140
I thought you...

298
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,670
I'm fine.

299
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,180
See?

300
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,589
All limbs intact.

301
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,040
Go back.

302
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,990
It's good that you're fine.

303
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,590
Let's go back to your room.

304
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,420
Mother.

305
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,460
You can go back to your room.

306
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,660
Don't worry about me.

307
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,020
I'm smart.

308
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,400
I won't be in danger.

309
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,380
You've had a rough day.

310
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,810
Go to bed first.

311
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,640
I'll accompany you for a bit.

312
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,390
It's so hot.

313
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,030
I can't sleep.

314
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,070
When you were young,

315
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,780
you would fall asleep the moment you were in bed.

316
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,740
What was I like when I was young?

317
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,490
When you were young,

318
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,620
you had a round face

319
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,510
and rosy cheeks.

320
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,760
You were very obedient.

321
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,460
At that time,

322
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,450
not only did I have to raise you,

323
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,280
but I also had to raise Xiu'er as well.

324
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,270
Xiu'er was domineering.

325
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,860
You

326
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,640
didn't fight for anything

327
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,060
and tolerated her in everything.

328
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,020
When I washed and cooked,

329
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,480
you always obediently

330
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,860
sat by my side

331
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,850
and played with your

332
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,100
little rattle drum.

333
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,390
When I turned around,

334
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,980
you would smile at me.

335
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,910
Your smile melted my heart.

336
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,990
That rattle drum

337
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,900
was made by your father.

338
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,710
It was your favorite

339
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,840
when you were young.

340
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,300
I wonder

341
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,590
where your father put it.

342
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,830
Doesn't that mean

343
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,000
I have changed a lot?

344
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,950
Xiu'er

345
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,320
can't bully me anymore.

346
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
No matter how you change,

347
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,360
you're still my daughter.

348
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,360
From now on,

349
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,750
no matter what you do,

350
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,620
or what you want to do,

351
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,500
tell me.

352
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,860
I will always be on your side

353
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,480
and protect you.

354
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,900
In the past,

355
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,660
I was a pushover.

356
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,710
I tolerated everything.

357
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,700
That's why

358
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,550
such a disaster happened to you.

359
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,010
I've thought about it.

360
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,720
From now on,

361
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,990
I will never be like that again.

362
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,460
As long as you,

363
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,260
Seven,

364
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,910
and Eight are here,

365
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,000
I won't be afraid anymore.

366
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,630
I'll just focus on

367
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,180
protecting all of you.

368
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,700
Come on.

369
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,290
Time to sleep.

370
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,460
Good.

371

The chicken coop is broken.

385
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,600
Your grandma

386
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,440
wants me to make some more.

387
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,270
It's pricked.

388
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,630
Man'er.

389
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,230
I'm sorry

390
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,310
about what happened this time.

391
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,440
It's all my fault

392
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,220
for not protecting you.

393
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,530
It's not your fault.

394
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,230
If someone's at fault, it's Uncle Shouren.

395
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,070
Father!

396
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,020
Mother!

397
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,230
Mother!

398
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,950
Father!

399
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,550
-Brother.
-Shouxin.

400
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,480
Where's Father?

401
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,200
Father and Shouyi went to the field.

402
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,250
Mother isn't here either.

403
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,240
What happened?

404
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,960
Hua'er was caught

405
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,140
by the Sun family.

406
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,270
I'll go to the field

407
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,400
and get Father back.

408
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,140
Me too.

409
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,810
Me too.

410
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,460
Then I...

411
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:13,900
Man'er.

412
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,230
Man'er.

413
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,430
How did you

414
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,660
escape from the Sun family

415
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,460
last time?

416
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,180
Hurry.

417
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
Help me think of a way

418
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,570
to save Hua'er.

419
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,270
What can I do?

420
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,640
You can report to the government.

421
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,920
What's the use of that?

422
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,230
You know that

423
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,510
the Sun family is rich and powerful.

424
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,850
If we report it rashly,

425
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,780
what if he blames your Uncle Shouren

426
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,690
for slandering him instead?

427
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,230
Man'er,

428
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,250
you and Hua'er

429
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,040
are related by blood.

430
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,260
You grew up together.

431
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,190
You're sisters.

432
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,890
At this point,

433
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,230
how can you watch

434
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,390
and do nothing?

435
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,070
Aunt Gu.

436
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,180
I'm immune to moral blackmail.

437
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,710
Besides,

438
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,940
according to your plan,

439
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I'm already dead.

440
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,790
You can't ask a dead person for help.

441
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,060
You want to save Lian Hua'er?

442
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,230
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

443
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,630
What do you mean?

444
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,350
Although Uncle Shouren and his family wanted to harm me,

445
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,360
Lian Hua'er

446
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,440
is a living person.

447
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,680
If she were burned to death,

448
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,580
any human being

449
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,840
would feel uncomfortable.

450
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,500
I wouldn't.

451
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,540
Fine.

452
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,150
Call me a saint then.

453
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,010
Will you save her or not?

454
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,710
Let me remind you.

455
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,030
Once Lian Hua'er takes your place,

456
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,830
the Sun family

457
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,600
won't come to you again

458
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,140
or hurt other girls.

459
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,920
But if you help her now,

460
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,050
this matter

461
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,680
will never end.

462
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,420
But we can't just let her die.

463
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,710
Won't that make us an accomplice?

464
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,910
If it weren't for you,

465
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,890
I wouldn't have interfered.

466
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,890
How am I different from Lian Hua'er?

467
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,350
Where are you going?

468
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,570
I'm afraid your grandma will find me. I need to stay away from trouble.

469
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,570
Are you really not going to save her?

470
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,410
Can our villagers

471
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,900
be bullied by outsiders?

472
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,190
Exactly.

473
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,870
Who dares to bully our people?

474
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,610
As long as I'm here,

475
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,380
I'll see who dares to touch our villagers.

476
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,180
That's right.

477
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,260
I'm telling you,

478
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,420
no one dares to touch our villagers.

479
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,500
You should have seen what it was like.

480
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,470
What was it like?

481
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,180
That moment

482
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,690
could only be described with one word.

483
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,620
What word?

484
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,750
Dangerous.

485
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,860
How dangerous?

486
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,620
The Sun family was fierce and evil.

487
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,550
Each one of them had a weapon

488
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,420
with such a long blade.

489
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,970
How many people were there?

490
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,710
How many?

491
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,240
At least hundreds of people!

492
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,710
Hundreds of people?

493
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,780
They surrounded me and Shouyi

494
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,620
immediately.

495
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,030
Oh my god.

496
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,860
There really were hundreds of people?

497
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,460
Hundreds.

498
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,670
I went all out.

499
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,730
At that time,

500
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,800
I grabbed a stick

501
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,620
and charged into the crowd.

502
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,370
I went...

503
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,690
Who dares to touch my husband?

504
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,030
Bravo! Bravo!

505
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,170
At that crucial moment,

506
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,390
I grabbed Shouyi with one hand

507
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,190
and Man'er with the other

508
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,830
and I ran like my life depended on it.

509
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,090
Luckily, I was there.

510
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,610
Otherwise, Man'er

511
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,440
would have been burned to death.

512
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,420
Awesome.

513
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,230
Yes.

514
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,260
We need women at critical moments.

515
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,290
Of course.

516
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,960
Man'er is here.

517
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Listen to Man'er.

518
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,420
Man'er, tell them.

519
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,800
I was saved by Aunt He.

520
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,390
See?

521
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,880
But Lian Hua'er was captured.

522
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,820
But with you here,

523
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,180
I'm assured.

524
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,840
Of course. We're here.

525
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,100
There's no time to lose.

526
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Let's go save her.

527
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,880
The egg is steaming on the stove.

528
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,190
Oh no, it's burnt.

529
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,420
I think it's about to rain.

530
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,570
I'm going back to collect my clothes.

531
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,210
You have to report this to the officials.

532
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,080
I have soup in the pot.

533
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,000
It's going to rain.

534
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,820
This...

535
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,370
I'm going to dry the quilts.

536
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,110
Why are you drying the quilts when it's about to rain?

537
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,900
Why are you drying the quilts when it's about to rain?

538
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,780
Damn it.

539
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,600
So annoying.

540
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,060
Look how beautiful the ginkgo leaves are.

541
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,050
Look at the sky.

542
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,950
Look at the ground.

543
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,630
What are you doing?

544
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,070
Great.

545
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,310
The height is perfect.

546
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,750
Okay.

547
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,640
Put it here.

548
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,890
We must not make any mistakes during

549
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,980
the Mid-Autumn Festival ceremony.

550
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,440
Especially the ancestral memorial tablet.

551
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,440
Go after her!

552
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,310
Stop!

553
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,910
Stop!

554
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,130
Stop!

555
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,390
Stop! Stop!

556
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,250
Buddy.

557
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,180
What's going on?

558
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,750
Well,

559
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,750
that lady stole

560
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,550
our ancestral memorial tablet.

561
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,620
Stop!

562
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,590
Get her! Hurry!

563
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,270
Stop!

564
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,780
Stop! Stop!

565
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,710
Stop!

566
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,170
Father.

567
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,830
I didn't know

568
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,560
about the Sun family's doings.

569
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,130
Otherwise, Hua'er

570
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,680
wouldn't be in such danger.

571
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,220
We are preparing for the Mid-Autumn Festival ceremony.

572
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
Lizheng and the villagers are busy.

573
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,790
I wonder if they can come and help.

574
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,800
Father,

575
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,460
I don't think it's a big problem.

576
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,850
Stop! Stop!

577
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,410
Stop! Stop!

578
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,500
Stop! Stop!

579
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,390
Am I crazy?

580
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,220
Why am I risking my life

581
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,150
for Lian Hua'er?

582
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,160
I can't run anymore.

583
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,030
I can't run anymore.

584
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,850
They can do whatever they want.

585
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,260
Qingfeng County

586
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,770
is four kilometers away from here.

587
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,230
Are you planning

588
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,960
to lure everyone there on foot?

589
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,260
It was a spur of the moment.

590
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,720
I didn't think it through.

591
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,350
Didn't you say you won't help Hua'er?

592
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,280
I won't help her.

593
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,310
I'm just giving you a ride along the way.

594
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,500
Where did you get the horse?

595
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,220
Lizheng!

596
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,010
Lizheng!

597
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,460
Isn't that your horse?

598
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,310
Get me all our

599
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,940
horse and cow carriages.

600
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,440
Get them back!

601
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,870
Stop!

602
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,540
Stop!

603
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,480
Stop!

604
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,080
Let's go.

605
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,570
Bad news.

606
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,880
Someone from Shisanli Camp is coming.

607
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,460
Why are you panicking? So what?

608
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,470
Master.

609
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,340
What should we do?

610
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,650
Lord Sun,

611
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,680
so many eyes are watching.

612
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,860
I'm afraid even the magistrate won't protect you.

613
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,810
No one can stop me.

614
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,600
Go!

615
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,260
Hua'er!

616
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,780
Hua'er!

617
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,140
Hua'er!

618
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,550
Don't be afraid.

619
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,410
What's going on?

620
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,070
Is this a wedding or a funeral?

621
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,500
Hua'er.

622
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,400
Mother!

623
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,180
Mother.

624
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,430
I disturbed the ancestors today

625
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,230
for Hua'er.

626
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,700
I'm sure the ancestors

627
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
will not blame me.

628
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,370
Mr. Lizheng

629
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,950
just led his clan

630
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,600
with great momentum.

631
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,030
You glib-tongued child.

632
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,680
Kneel properly.

633
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,390
Considering that

634
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,410
there was more to the matter,

635
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,820
you may get on your feet.

636
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,620
This matter has been reported to the magistrate of Qingfeng County.

637
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,150
With the public as witness,

638
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,870
Lord Sun won't be able to escape again.

639
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,350
Saving Hua'er

640
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,340
has also saved the image of

641
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,850
our whole village.

642
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,150
Otherwise, if it got out that

643
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,270
Shisanli Camp sold daughters for widow burning,

644
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,790
it would surely implicate the

645
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,320
marriage of many future daughters.

646
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,120
Yes.

647
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,860
You're right.

648
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,440
Man'er.

649
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,950
Remember,

650
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,150
don't touch the ancestral memorial tablet again.

651
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,300
Also,

652
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,040
the guy who

653
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,520
stole my horse...

654
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,850
Lizheng, rest assured.

655
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,040
He won't do it again.

656
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,140
He won't.

657
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,080
He won't.

658
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,830
Do you want some tea?

659
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,930
What did you do to

660
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,380
to my grandma?

661
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,760
She bought so many good things for you.

662
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,430
She didn't buy them.

663
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,230
You bought them yourself?

664
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,760
Where did you get the money?

665
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,310
Could it be...

666
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,650
You took it out

667
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,540
and left it on the table that night.

668
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,500
I forgot my money.

669
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,190
And you spent it all?

670
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,560
Oh, you didn't leave it for me?

671
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,780
How much do you have left?

672
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,710
All gone?

673
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,610
Consider it a loan.

674
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,140
I will pay you triple in the future.

675
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,020
That's 100 taels.

676
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,920
All gone.

677
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,270
Do you know

678
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,560
how much 100 taels is worth?

679
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,020
You spent it all?

680
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,370
Are you crazy, Shen Nuo?

681
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,360
You're here to slow me down.

682
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,409
Give me the money!

683
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:24,060
Spit it out!

684
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,350
Spit it out!

685
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,520
Why are you so angry?

686
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,760
Calm down.

687
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,130
Spit out the money!

688
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,090
Tell me now!

689
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,429
A gentleman shouldn't fight.

690
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,590
Pay me back!

691
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,360
Matchmaker Wang.

692
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,260
Let's talk it out.

693
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,889
-Let’s talk inside.
-Let’s talk it out.

694
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,949
Let's talk inside.

695
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,070
What's there to talk about?

696
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,139
When it's done,

697
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,310
I should have

698
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,830
what I deserve.

699
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,030
But Lord Sun is now in prison.

700
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,580
Who can I ask for money from?

701
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,120
If you don’t give me

702
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,550
500 taels of silver today,

703
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,870
we’ll all die together

704
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,489
You see...

705
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,000
I will let the villagers

706
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,450
and the Song family

707
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,830
know about

708
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,340
the Lian family's shameful matter.

709
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,870
You still want to be an official?

710
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,670
No way.

711
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,820
Shouren, the money

712
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,500
isn't rightfully yours anyway.

713
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,300
Give it back to Matchmaker Wang.

714
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:10,990
Father.

715
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,990
I spent

716
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,460
all the

717
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,570
money.

718
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,740
Father.

719
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,300
I have my reasons.

720
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,940
Father, Mother.

721
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,420
Among the betrothal gifts

722
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,210
from the Song family,

723
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,910
there was a

724
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,260
valuable jade pendant.

725
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,820
It was extremely precious.

726
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,390
So they told us many times

727
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,660
for Hua'er to wear it

728
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,390
on the wedding day.

729
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,030
But...

730
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,910
But last month,

731
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,540
we accidentally broke it.

732
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,940
We thought of many ways

733
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,660
and finally found a similar one

734
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,300
in town.

735
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,870
But I never thought

736
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,070
such a small jade pendant

737
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,570
would cost 300...

738
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,250
I mean, 500 taels of silver.

739
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,740
If Shouren went out

740
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,400
to borrow money,

741
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,190
our in-laws would surely find out.

742
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,510
We're doing this to

743
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,280
safeguard Hua'er's marriage.

744
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,920
That's why

745
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,690
we had to do this.

746
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,670
You were willing to sacrifice

747
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,460
your own niece for the dowry.

748
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,680
How could you be so heartless?

749
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,460
Enough!

750
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,990
What's the point of

751
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,210
saying that now?

752
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,830
Your brother has his own way

753
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,810
to get the money.

754
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,640
We're really out of money.

755
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,900
Please help us,

756
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,000
Father, Mother.

757
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,400
You wretch!

758
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,710
I can't live anymore.

759
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,620
I don't want to live anymore.

760
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,900
I don't want to live anymore.

761
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,750
Mother.

762
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,710
Don't cry. It's my fault.

763
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,590
It's my fault

764
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,650
for doing such a foolish thing.

765
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,570
Mother.

766
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm doing this

767
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,720
for the Lian family.

768
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,080
For you!

769
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,780
Grandpa, Grandma.

770
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,260
I made a mistake

771
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,940
and caused a disaster.

772
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,590
The Song family promised us

773
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,430
that after I got married,

774
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,740
they would definitely

775
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,380
let Father be an official.

776
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,030
Father just wanted to

777
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,030
help the whole Lian family.

778
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,100
That's why I made this decision.

779
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,060
It's my fault.

780
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,980
It's my fault.

781
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,990
I apologize to you.

782
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,420
I'm unfilial.

783
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,760
Alright.

784
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,070
What can you solve

785
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,530
by kowtowing to me?

786
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,750
We're all from the Lian family.

787
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,140
Let's discuss

788
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,470
to see how we can gather

789
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,420
500 taels of silver

790
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,620
to help Shouren

791
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,300
get through this.

792
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,670
How much money do we have?

793
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,140
Some jewelry

794
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,280
and some

795
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,100
loose silver.

796
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,780
At most...

797
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,920
40 taels.

798
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,910
40 taels!

799
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,800
But Matchmaker Wang said

800
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,650
if we can't

801
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,470
pay her within the next few days,

802
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,470
she

803
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,780
will spread this matter.

804
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,560
Then we can only sell our field.

805
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,020
No.

806
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,590
Father.

807
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,970
Shouren should be

808
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,200
paying the money.

809
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,020
Exactly.

810
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,050
Whoever makes trouble will pay.

811
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,270
Shouyi, He.

812
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,640
We're from the same family.

813
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,020
Now that a family member is in trouble,

814
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,550
you're suddenly treating us like outsiders?

815
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,540
Didn't Young Master Song say

816
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,390
he would only marry Hua'er?

817
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,870
Yes.

818
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,480
Hua'er.

819
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,330
You can go

820
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,870
talk to Young Master Song.

821
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,130
500 taels

822
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,130
is a big deal to our family.

823
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,950
But to his family,

824
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,630
it's just some

825
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,860
spare change.

826
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,740
Is Hua'er

827
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,540
not worth 500 taels?

828
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,550
Exactly.

829
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,240
Is she not worth 500 taels?

830
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,990
But if I ask for money

831
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,780
before I marry to the family,

832
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,460
I will forever

833
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,980
be living in shame.

834
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,150
If Hua'er marries the Song family

835
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,950
and receives their approval,

836
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,200
then,

837
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,600
our whole family

838
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,880
will benefit from it.

839
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,870
Shouyi, He,

840
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,000
you'll surely benefit too.

841
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,760
Oh,

842
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,540
save it.

843
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,620
You live in the town.

844
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,330
Shouren earns grains from being a scholar

845
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,930
and money from being a tutor.

846
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,910
Not only did he not

847
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,230
contribute anything to the family,

848
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,440
but we had to pay him every year

849
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,950
for your enjoyment.

850
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,530
You always said that

851
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,940
after he got promoted,

852
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,180
the rest of us would benefit too.

853
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,100
In the end, not only did we not benefit,

854
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,780
we sold most of our land.

855
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,760
If we sell more,

856
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,350
all of us

857
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,630
will have to live on air.

858
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,030
We all have to live on air.

859
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,940
Shouyi.

860
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,720
Are you determined

861
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,510
not to help me?

862
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,820
You borrowed so much.

863
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,800
Instead of asking the rich family,

864
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,000
his heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys

865
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,260
have gone black with ill intent.

866
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,290
He wants to sell the land of our ancestors instead.

867
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,270
He might as well

868
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,350
tie the rest of us up

869
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,190
and sell us along with the land.

870
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,070
Anyway,

871
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,260
Hua'er is valuable.

872
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,070
But our child

873
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,770
is not his grandparents' biological grandson.

874
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,760
Shouyi, tell your wife to shut up.

875
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,130
You two, get up too.

876
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,630
You kneel all the time.

877
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,910
Have you no pride?

878
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,360
Grandpa.

879
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,270
Why don't we borrow from Mr. Jin?

880
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,560
Isn't he

881
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,480
the manager of the private bank?

882
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,110
Don't talk nonsense, kid.

883
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,950
We can't borrow from the private bank.

884
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,990
The interest rate is too high, it's not worth it.

885
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:46,810
Father,

886
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,180
you said

887
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
we can never borrow money from the private bank.

888
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,160
Whoever does it, you'll break their legs.

889
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,600
No.

890
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,580
I think it works.

891
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,030
I think it works.

892
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,500
Our father said that back then

893
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,410
because you were gambling.

894
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,260
You gambled your job

895
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,900
and our family savings away.

896
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,750
That's why he said those harsh words.

897
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,880
It's different now.

898
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,780
This is an emergency.

899
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,900
Mother.

900
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,380
It's settled.

901
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,030
Dear.

902
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,160
Shouren.

903
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,180
Ask Jin about this.

904
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,570
Okay.

905
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,280
What are you doing?

906
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,150
I'm watering the vegetables.

907
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Is the jade pendant problem solved?

908
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,230
You're well-informed.

909
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,440
Grandpa is going to borrow money

910
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,170
from Mr. Jin.

911
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,900
It has nothing to do

912
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,780
with me anyway.

913
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,630
Let him be.

914
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,660
Whose name is written

915
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,570
on the bank's account book?

916
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,100
Grandpa's name, of course.

917
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,150
What's with that look?

918
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,310
Just say it.

919
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,780
If I tell you,

920
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,780
how will you repay me?

921
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:16,510
I...

922
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,140
I just wanted you to

923
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,520
help me clean the woodshed

924
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,980
and dry my quilt in the sun.

925
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,470
What were you thinking?

926
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,020
Nothing.

927
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,010
The woodshed is dirty and damp.

928
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,140
The quilt is wet too.

929
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,510
Sleeping feels like torture every night.

930
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:34,980
Also,

931
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,510
the spider webs on the beam...

932
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,770
Okay, I know.

933
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,590
I know.

934
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,240
You just miss your comfortable life.

935
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,290
I'll do it.

936
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,300
So, what's the problem

937
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,600
with borrowing from the private bank?

938
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,210
It matters whose name you use

939
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,890
to borrow the money.

940
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,310
If the money

941
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,890
is borrowed under your grandpa's name,

942
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,950
your whole family will be implicated

943
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,000
if Hua'er refuses to

944
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,530
pay the money in the future.

945
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,420
You're right!

946
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,770
Why didn't I think of it?

947
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,590
It was my idea too.

948
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,040
That was close.

949
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,750
It's a good thing you're smart.
