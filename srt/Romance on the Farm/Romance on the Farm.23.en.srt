We've been traveling quite a while.

Why don't we take a break and go another day?

No.

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't know why

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
very anxious.

15
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,630
Besides, when Xiu'er came back home,

16
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,110
she didn't bring Son-in-law back.

17
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,110
Now she doesn't know

where we moved to.

We have to go there

20

That's easy.

22
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll ask someone to send a letter to Xiu'er

Besides, I want to look for Xiu'er

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,829
to see if there's a way

30

for them to offer us

and you're already asking the in-laws to get us a house.

38

it'll be humiliating.

51
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,640

even if she didn't go today,

Sir, we have to continue.

194
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:54,830
I've reached my limit.

195
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,870
I can't drink anymore.

196
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,870
You have to drink.

197
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,110
I'm happy.

198
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,710
Master Lian.

199
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,830
I'll drink with you.

200
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,590
What a good friend.

201
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,480
Right?

202
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,120
Drink.

203
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,710
Fill your bowl too.

204
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,630
Fill it up.

205
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,280
Come on. Cheers.

206
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,040
Master Lian.

207
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,590
Let me make a toast to you.

208
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,970
Cheers!

209
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,450
Cheers!

210
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,730
Great wine.

211
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,110
I'm fine.

212
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,990
I'm fine.

213
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
I'm fine.

214
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,980
You may leave.

215
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,520
No need to wait outside tonight.

216
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,650
Yes, Master.

217
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,070
Honey.

218
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,740
I've been waiting so long for this moment.

219
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,990
My Lord, don't say that.

220
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,270
I was the one who was suffering while waiting so long for you.

221
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,670
Well, after suffering comes happiness...

222
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,400
Like I'd be waiting for you!

223
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Okay, this is it.

224
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,320
What is this?

225
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,650
It calms the nerves.

226
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,830
It can help this old man

227
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,030
fall into deep sleep.

228
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,210
What took you so long?

229
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,090
I've already drunk 800 rounds.

230
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,220
It's all because of that old pervert.

231
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,830
My legs are numb from squatting beside the bed.

232
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,890
Let's hurry and go.

233
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,680
Who's that?

234
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,060
I can't take it anymore, sir.

235
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,750
I can't drink anymore. I have to go back.

236
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,310
Hurry.

237
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,030
Miss Man'er.

238
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,770
You're finally out.

239
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,770
We were about to barge in and attack.

240
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,180
We're safe and sound now.

241
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,200
That's good.

242
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:46,930
Thirteen.

243
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,860
Yes, this is it.

244
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,050
Three.

245
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,520
This is for you.

246
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,710
As for the rest,

247
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,990
I'll have to count on you guys.

248
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,590
Don't worry.

249
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,110
Okay.

250
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,500
Man'er, it's getting late.

251
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,520
Let's go home now.

252
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,760
Not yet.

253
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,080
When Liu Fugui wakes up

254
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,190
and you're not here,

255
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,840
he will look for you everywhere.

256
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,950
Follow Four

257
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,630
and hide out in Black Tiger Fortress first.

258
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,230
When things blow over after a couple of days,

259
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll go look for you.

260
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,430
Okay.

261
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,230
Everything is here.

262
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,710
Okay.

263
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,760
Three.

264
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,910
Get them to change their clothes quickly.

265
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,590
Let's get down to business.

266
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,840
Come on.

267
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,370
Let's go.

268
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,830
Let's go.

269
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,950
Three.

270
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,710
Will he come out?

271
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,040
I don't know.

272
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,020
Who are you?

273
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,910
Why did you call me out

274
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,700
at this hour?

275
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,110
Please pardon me, Boss Cao.

276
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,750
I'm a new servant of the Liu Mansion.

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,350
Master Liu asked me to deliver the goods to you.

278
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,080
The goods?

279
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,820
Why am I not getting it at the posthouse?

280
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,950
Where is Master Liu?

281
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,880
Recently, Master Liu

282
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,600
got a new concubine.

283
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,580
Right now,

284
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,940
he's unable to leave his home.

285
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,480
Otherwise, he wouldn't have made me

286
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,300
come and disturb your sleep.

287
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,020
Master Liu said this batch of goods

288
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,900
has to be delivered

289
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,510
to Linshui City tomorrow.

290
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,350
Linshui City?

291
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,870
Why did they change

292
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,050
the delivery place?

293
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,710
The higher-ups are rushing us.

294
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,990
Instead of wasting your time

295
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,200
talking to me here,

296
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,830
why don't you hurry up and get going?

297
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,120
If we can't deliver the goods on time,

298
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,650
we can't afford to take this responsibility.

299
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,870
As usual,

300
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,060
don't open the boxes until the goods are delivered.

301
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,680
But it has to be delivered by tomorrow.

302
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,310
Even if I leave now,

303
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm afraid I can't make it.

304
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,690
Previously,

305
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,860
for safety reasons,

306
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,750
the map route you received

307
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,960
takes a long detour.

308
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,990
But right now,

309
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,110
several villages have been emptied

310
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,990
of their villagers.

311
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,630
Just travel boldly.

312
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,950
With one night's journey,

313
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,750
you'll definitely make the delivery by tomorrow.

314
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,240
Master Liu also said

315
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,110
that when this batch of goods are delivered,

316
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,990
you'll be paid double.

317
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,960
Okay.

318
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,370
I'll pack up now

319
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,840
and leave immediately.

320
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,830
Thank you.

321
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,720
Three.

322
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,960
Well done.

323
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,030
Young Master.

324
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,050
How is it going?

325
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,600
Everything is going well.

326
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,190
We've successfully rescued Xiu'er out.

327
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,990
Four has brought her

328
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,470
to hide out in Black Tiger Fortress temporarily.

329
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,530
Three has also given the goods

330
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,370
to Boss Cao.

331
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,550
Boss Cao didn't suspect anything.

332
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,720
Everything at Linshui City has been arranged.

333
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
As you ordered,

334
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,830
a while ago, I've already

335
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,590
sent a message through pigeon post

336
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,430
to Wude Bureau

337
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,830
to ask the Palace Assistant Secretary

338
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,290
to cooperate with our act.

339
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,190
If nothing goes wrong,

340
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,380
the Palace Assistant Secretary

341
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,180
should be at Linshui City by now.

342
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,960
Okay.

343
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,080
Whether we'd be able to drink

344
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,540
Wu Zhonglian's tea sooner

345
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,870
will depend on tomorrow.

346
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,750
Let's wait and see.

347
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,470
Your Lordship,

348
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,990
you must be tired from this trip.

349
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,990
You should rest for a few more hours.

350
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,550
It's because I didn't arrange it well.

351
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,410
Please pardon me, Your Lordship.

352
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,230
It's fine.

353
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,060
I have work to do.

354
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,840
I'm not here to play and have fun anyway.

355
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,619
Last month, the Patrol Imperial Envoy

356
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,910
has already done the patrol according to schedule.

357
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,950
All the matters here

358
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,150
have been submitted.

359
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,599
Lord Lin, has there been any oversight

360
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,990
that led to you having to

361
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,250
make a trip here again?

362
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,119
This area

363
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,220
is a crucial stop in the border town of Qingzhou Prefecture.

364
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,170
There are many people coming and going here.

365
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,780
It's inevitable that there are bandits among them.

366
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,720
You should be careful.

367
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,710
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

368
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,900
I don't mean to brag,

369
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,460
but this place has been free of bandits

370
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,320
for many years.

371
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,710
No one dares to commit crime

372
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,990
on my watch.

373
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,870
Stop!

374
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,680
Officer.

375
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,620
What are you transporting?

376
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,470
Officer.

377
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,390
I'm transporting

378
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,870
top-grade tea leaves.

379
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,120
Tea leaves? Why are they sealed?

380
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,730
This tea is expensive.

381
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,340
I'm afraid someone might swap it out midway.

382
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,130
So it's better to be cautious.

383
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,390
Lord Lin.

384
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,190
After the patrol here,

385
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,150
I'll accompany you on the patrol inside the city.

386
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,870
Okay.

387
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,070
Be careful.

388
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,230
Get out of the way!

389
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,690
Didn't you say you're transporting tea leaves?

390
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,180
How dare you smuggle Hematite?

391
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,730
Arrest them!

392
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,570
Your Lordship.

393
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,600
Your Lordship.

394
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,790
-Your Lordship.
-Lord Lin, I...

395
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,250
I knew nothing about this.

396
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,280
I was tricked, Your Lordship.

397
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,990
Master.

398
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,200
Master.

399
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,170
Help!

400
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,910
Master!

401
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,760
Master, you're finally awake.

402
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,590
Where's Concubine Lian?

403
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,050
Hasn't Concubine Lian been accompanying you this whole time?

404
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,600
Where is she?

405
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,550
Where is she?

406
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,670
I don't know.

407
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,140
I came this morning to call you

408
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,870
but you didn't respond for a long time,

409
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,600
so I didn't dare to disturb you.

410
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,750
What time is it?

411
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,660
It's already late afternoon.

412
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,650
How dare she trick me?

413
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,780
Open the door!

414
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,530
Open the door!

415
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,060
Who is it?

416
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,450
What are you doing?

417
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,310
What do you want?

418
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,650
Master Liu.

419
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,670
W-What's going on?

420
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,390
Go over there.

421
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,720
Okay.

422
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,430
W-What's going on?

423
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,550
Bastard.

424
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,310
How dare you toy with me?

425
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,330
H-How would I dare to?

426
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,120
My Lord! Inside...

427
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,310
What's wrong?

428
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,720
I don't know either.

429
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,760
Your sister

430
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,710
dared to poison me.

431
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,110
If you don't hand her over today,

432
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,230
don't dream of leaving here alive.

433
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,210
Master Liu.

434
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,360
Since she married into Liu Mansion,

435
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,550
we've never seen her.

436
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,030
Yes.

437
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,140
Xiu'er is not here.

438
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,190
She's really not here.

439
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,780
Master.

440
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,550
Master Liu.

441
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,410
There's no one.

442
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,370
She's not here.

443
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,560
She's not here.

444
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,070
Attack!

445
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,520
My Lord!

446
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,310
My Lord!

447
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,310
Stop hitting him!

448
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,270
I'm the bookkeeping official.

449
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,230
Stop hitting him!

450
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,910
You'll go to jail if you hit me.

451
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,510
Stop hitting him

452
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,270
or he might die!

453
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,430
Even if I have to go to jail tomorrow,

454
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,230
I'll still have to beat you up today.

455
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,070
My Lord!

456
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,440
Let go of me.

457
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,570
My Lord!

458
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,830
Master Liu, I beg you.

459
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,790
Stop hitting him!

460
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,040
He'll die.

461
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,910
Master Liu.

462
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,950
My Lord!

463
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,190
My Lord!

464
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,950
Master Liu.

465
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,940
Master Wu wants to see you urgently

466
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,540
and asked you to go there now.

467
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,830
Let go of me!

468
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,520
My Lord!

469
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,750
My Lord, come out quickly.

470
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,080
My Lord.

471
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,430
My Lord, are you okay?

472
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,950
My Lord.

473
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,570
I really don't know anything.

474
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,030
My Lord, they've left.

475
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,580
My Lord! My Lord!

476
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,990
It's me.

477
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,480
They're gone. They're...

478
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,670
My Lord!

479
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,510
They're gone!

480
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,740
They're gone, My Lord!

481
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,380
Master Wu.

482
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,910
What did you do?

483
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,980
What did I do?

484
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,960
Without my order,

485
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,230
how could you've let Boss Cao make the delivery?

486
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,890
He even took

487
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,120
the route where there's a lot of people.

488
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,070
He has now been caught in action

489
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,150
in Linshui City.

490
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,710
Once the secret of Hematite smuggling is exposed,

491
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,000
we'll lose our lives!

492
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,930
Do you know that?

493
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,360
I didn't ask Boss Cao to deliver the goods.

494
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,990
Then where did the Hematite he's transporting

495
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,670
come from?

496
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,130
Without your permission,

497
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,790
would he have dared to do this?

498
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,850
I really didn't.

499
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,000
Calm down.

500
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,150
Whatever situation

501
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,150
Boss Cao is in now,

502
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,540
I'll go to Linshui City

503
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,870
and handle it right now.

504
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,280
He has already been arrested.

505
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,830
There are even court officials patrolling there.

506
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,770
His delivery carriage broke down

507
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,900
and the goods spilled all over the floor.

508
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,910
Everyone was watching.

509
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,840
Even immortals can’t save him now.

510
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:37,990
Master Wu.

511
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,530
You must believe me about this.

512
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,310
I have nothing

513
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,820
to do with this.

514
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,530
You've been the one

515
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,090
holding on to the delivery jade token.

516
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,710
How dare you say it has nothing to do with you?

517
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,310
Master Wu.

518
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,120
I promise I never gave the jade token

519
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,050
to Boss Cao.

520
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,280
Where's the jade token?

521
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,420
Where's the jade token?

522
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,430
I-It was always here.

523
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,270
Where's the jade token?

524
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,960
Master Wu, you made such a big mistake.

525
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,630
His Lordship is furious.

526
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,120
It was my negligence this time.

527
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,450
I didn't manage my men well.

528
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,950
Please

529
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,390
relay this message to His Lordship.

530
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,810
Please give me a chance

531
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,680
to atone for my mistake.

532
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,510
Rather than focusing on atoning for your mistake,

533
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,470
Master Wu,

534
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,960
you’d better check out

535
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,060
your people first.

536
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,920
Or else you wouldn't even know

537
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,240
who killed you when you're at your deathbed.

538
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,510
What do you mean?

539
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,510
[Marquis Ningyuan's Desperate Warrior: Wu Qiu]

540
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,180
People from Wude Bureau

541
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,600
have been in Jinyang County for a long time.

542
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,520
Shen.

543
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,430
Shen.

544
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,780
Master Wu?

545
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,450
Why are you here?

546
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,340
Master Wu, what happened?

547
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,590
You look so flustered.

548
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,210
Liu Fugui was killed.

549
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,140
Boss Liu died?

550
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,060
Who killed him?

551
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
It doesn't matter.

552
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,520
What matters is me.

553
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm being targeted.

554
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,660
There's an internal strife.

555
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,250
Master Wu, what do you mean by that?

556
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
The higher-ups.

557
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,070
The higher-ups?

558
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,030
It's hard to explain

559
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,770
in a few words.

560
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,570
Stop asking.

561
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,150
I came to you today

562
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,470
to ask you for a favor.

563
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,190
You helped me

564
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,440
with the land collection previously.

565
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,370
You're the only one

566
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,270
I can rely on now.

567
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,340
If you need me to do anything for you,

568
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,300
just let me know.

569
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,860
Great.

570
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,790
Follow this route

571
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,710
to collect a batch of goods.

572
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,710
The delivery place is also on there.

573
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,590
Master Wu.

574
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,040
The collection point on this map is...

575
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,270
A mining cave.

576
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,100
A mine?

577
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,200
I remember people from the merchant guild said

578
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,330
that the transportation...

579
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,190
The transportation of private salt is just a cover.

580
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,360
This

581
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,890
is the real profitable business.

582
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,630
Previously, Liu Fugui used to be in charge of

583
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,710
collecting the mined goods

584
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,990
and passing it on to the subordinates.

585
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,070
The subordinates are responsible for transporting the mined goods.

586
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,330
But now that he's dead,

587
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,330
I have no other choice.

588
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,310
I can only trouble you

589
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,090
to personally make a trip.

590
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,010
After this is accomplished,

591
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,790
naturally,

592
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,150
you'll be rewarded generously.

593
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,060
Shen.

594
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,730
Can I

595
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,690
trust you?

596
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,280
Master Wu, it's your order.

597
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,070
I would not refuse it

598
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,540
and would do my best.

599
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,380
[Long-term Residence of the Su Family]

600
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,740
Remember,

601
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,530
you must act covertly.

602
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,080
Don't be discovered by the government.

603
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,190
After this is accomplished,

604
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,590
I won’t break my promise.

605
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,350
Master Wu, don’t worry.

606
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,190
Take care.

607
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,330
Raise the sedan.

608
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,380
We did it!

609
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,230
I'll go to the place on the map

610
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:39,950
to find out

611
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,150
if it's the Hematite mine.

612
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,910
Relay the news by pigeon post

613
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,220
to Wude Bureau immediately.

614
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,540
Okay. When are you leaving?

615
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,830
Tomorrow.

616
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,870
Here, try this bun.

617
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,910
This bun is good.

618
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,550
Look at the rouge.

619
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,430
Sister, look at the rouge.

620
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,540
These rouges, right?

621
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,090
Yes.

622
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,290
This one...

623
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,540
How much is this?

624
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,550
Twenty coins.

625
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,270
So expensive?

626
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,260
Is there propolis in it?

627
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,220
Osmanthus?

628
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,260
Go away.

629
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,140
Don't delay my business if you're not buying anything.

630
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,500
It’s so small yet so expensive.

631
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,020
When I go back, I have to tell Ye'er

632
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,080
that we shouldn't sell our products at such a cheap price.

633
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,320
Sister, buy some dried fruits.

634
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,960
Is it good?

635
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,990
Yes. Have some.

636
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,420
They were talking about someone dying since the morning.

637
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,150
The Liu Mansion is in chaos now.

638
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,400
His concubines

639
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,520
took away

640
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,750
all valuable things.

641
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,680
He deserves it.

642
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,190
When I was working in Liu Mansion,

643
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,790
he always treated us workers

644
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,990
very badly.

645
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,980
I don't know how many

646
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,140
servants he worked to death.

647
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,740
Really?

648
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,610
Sir,

649
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,010
who did you say died?

650
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,580
The town's Master Liu, Liu Fugui.

651
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,470
Master Liu is dead?

652
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,630
Yes, do you know him?

653
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,590
Sort of.

654
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,910
Since Master Liu is dead,

655
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,360
do you think his son

656
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,450
will be in charge now?

657
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,050
Liu Fugui doesn’t have a son.

658
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,820
Liu Fugui has no sons?

659
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,180
He married one concubine after another.

660
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,840
Yet by his death,

661
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
he still doesn't have any children.

662
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,170
Then do you know

663
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
how to get to his mansion?

664
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,270
Second lane at the west market entrance.

665
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,790
Why? Are you going there?

666
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,960
I'm just going to join in the crowd.

667
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,600
Enjoy your meal.

668
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
Eat it while it's hot.

669
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,630
The buns are delicious.

670
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,990
Try it. The meatballs are also good.

671
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,610
This one.

672
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,510
Mother.

673
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,340
I've heated this dish three times.

674
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,350
Have a bite.

675
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,310
No.

676
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,700
This is good. Open your mouth.

677
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,200
I have no appetite.

678
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,390
Something bad happened!

679
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,510
Something bad happened!

680
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,760
Shouyi! Mother!

681
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,860
-Come back!
-Something bad happened!

682
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,660
What could have happened to her?

683
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,240
Liu Mansion... Mother.

684
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,570
Something happened in Liu Mansion.

685
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,570
Liu Mansion? Which Liu Mansion?

686
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,430
Which else?

687
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,230
The one Xiu'er married into.

688
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,440
Master Liu

689
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,880
is dead.

690
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,150
Master Liu is dead?

691
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,320
Good.

692
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,860
Let's go pay our respects

693
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,810
and visit Xiu'er and Son-in-law.

694
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,890
-Right?
-No.

695
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,970
No, Mother.

696
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,020
I heard the news just now,

697
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,990
so I went to Liu Mansion

698
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,190
and asked around.

699
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,270
I finally found out

700
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,340
what's going on.

701
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,870
Master Liu

702
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,150
is who Xiu'er married.

703
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,230
Xiu'er was tricked into becoming a concubine.

704
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,000
What did you say?

705
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,510
A concubine?

706
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,910
Then what happened to Xiu'er?

707
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,510
Xiu'er...

708
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,750
After Master Liu died,

709
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,040
the whole Liu Mansion is in chaos.

710
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,159
I don't know

711
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,520
where Xiu'er is either.

712
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,060
My Xiu'er.

713
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,850
Mother!

714
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,320
Go get Shouxin.

715
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,560
Shouxin!

716
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,630
Shouxin! Mother fainted.

717
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,670
Where's Shouxin?

718
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,449
Mother!

719
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,350
Wake up.

720
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,110
Mother!

721
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:37,889
My Lord.

722
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,570
It's me.

723
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,250
My Lord, it's me.

724
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,179
Take the medicine.

725
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,790
The doctor said this medicine is very good.

726
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,520
You'll be fine after taking it.

727
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,010
My Lord.

728
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,270
Liu Fugui

729
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,699
is dead.

730
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,870
He won't come cause trouble again.

731
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,700
I didn't kill him.

732
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
I didn't kill him.

733
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,560
I didn't kill him.

734
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,090
I didn't say you killed him.

735
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,310
Lian Shouren!

736
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,470
Again?

737
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,380
Lian Shouren!

738
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,640
Shouren! Gu!

739
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,780
My Lord, it's fine.

740
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,100
It's your brothers.

741
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,280
Coming.

742
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,900
Shouyi. Shouxin.

743
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
Why are you here?

744
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,910
Lian Shouren!

745
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,520
How dare you hide?

746
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,470
-Are you still human?
-Shouxin.

747
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,780
-I didn’t kill anyone.
-Shouxin.

748
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,450
I didn't kill anyone.

749
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,490
Are you still human?

750
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,470
Shouxin, let go of Shouren!

751
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,910
Let go of your eldest brother!

752
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,110
I didn't kill anyone.

753
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,090
Eldest brother?

754
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
Has he acted like an eldest brother?

755
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,520
Normally,

756
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,150
I just regarded you as a social climber.

757
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,490
But I didn't expect

758
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,300
you to be so shameless

759
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,450
even in this regard!

760
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,640
Shouxin, calm down.

761
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,360
Let me explain, okay?

762
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,910
What's there to explain?

763
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,630
What kind of older brother

764
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,750
would sell his own

765
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,580
sister?

766
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,160
Xiu'er

767
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,390
is missing now.

768
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,940
Stop pretending to be crazy.

769
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,110
Don't play dumb and come with me!

770
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,950
Shouxin.

771
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,350
Shouren is really crazy.

772
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,580
He's not pretending.

773
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,240
I know I was wrong, Master Liu.

774
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
What happened?

775
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,340
Liu Fugui beat him up.

776
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,940
Yes.

777
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,750
It was Shouren who tricked Xiu'er

778
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,280
and sold her to Liu Mansion.

779
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,320
But he had no choice.

780
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,780
You don't know

781
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,310
that Boss Liu from Jinyang Guild

782
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,270
threatened him.

783
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,020
If Shouren didn't obey him,

784
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,110
he'd have died.

785
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,270
Master Liu...

786
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,510
Why didn't you discuss

787
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,110
such a grave matter

788
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,040
with the family?

789
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,850
How could I have discussed it?

790
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,970
You know how much

791
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,110
Mother loves Xiu'er.

792
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,110
There's no way Mother would agree to

793
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,290
Xiu'er becoming a concubine.

794
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,460
By then,

795
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,110
am I supposed to watch

796
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,550
the whole family get implicated?

797
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,230
Enough!

798
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,620
When have you two

799
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,390
ever

800
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,810
really cared about the Lian family?

801
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,000
Every time,

802
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,180
you only thought about the family

803
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,800
when you got into trouble or need money.

804
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,770
Mother

805
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,860
fainted on the spot

806
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,610
because of Xiu'er's matter.

807
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,950
How dare you still argue

808
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,220
that this was all for the sake of the Lian family?

809
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,450
Come with me!

810
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,810
Come with me!

811
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,200
Even if you are crazy,

812
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,660
you have to go back with me!

813
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,320
Let's go!

814
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,070
Shouxin!

815
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,180
It's your eldest brother's fault.

816
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,990
But look

817
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,170
at him now.

818
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,530
Liu Fugui forced him

819
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
and tortured him.

820
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,160
As his brothers, are you also

821
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,520
going to torture him and force him?

822
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,870
We were wrong.

823
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,120
We've let the Lian family down.

824
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,750
I'm begging you, please.

825
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,470
Shouxin.

826
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,160
Let's go back first.

827
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,920
Come on. Let's go.

828
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,860
Let's go.

829
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,420
What's wrong?

830
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,490
Gu.

831
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,760
Shouxin gave this to me just now.

832
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,420
Find a good doctor for Shouren first.

833
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,430
Get up.

834
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,230
I didn't kill anyone.

835
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,580
I didn't kill anyone.

836
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,120
I didn't kill anyone.

837
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,670
I didn't kill anyone.

838
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:02,340
[Mission: 1,000 taels of gold]

839
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:02,340
[Income (restaurant revenue): 332 taels]

840
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:02,340
[Expenses (restaurant operation cost): 15 taels]
