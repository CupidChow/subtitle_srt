[Zuixian Restaurant]

5
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,570
Why are you just coming home now?

6
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,880
Honey.

7
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,509
You're still up at this hour?

8
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,120
Wang told me everything.

9
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,950
Honey.

10
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,430
Can you forgive me this time?

11
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,190
I just wanted to

12
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,340
take them down a peg.

13
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,920
Do you think that as long as I forgive you,

14
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,670
this matter will be over?

15
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,740
I have no choice.

16
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,360
I did this

17
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,750
all for you.

18
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,820
When did I ask you

19
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,820
to do such a thing?

20
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,920
Yes.

21
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
You didn't ask me to do it.

22
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,450
But think about

23
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,360
your predicament

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,210
in the Song family for these past few years.

25
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,740
Even I'm aggrieved for you.

26
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,450
We finally have

27
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,870
an independent business

28
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,850
where you can make a name for yourself.

29
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,030
But Lian Man'er appeared out of nowhere

30
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,590
and is stealing our business.

31
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,140
If I don't use some tricks

32
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,800
or try

33
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,360
to steal some business back,

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,220
when will you become successful?

35
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,960
When will you gain a foothold in the Song Mansion?

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,350
Until now, you still don't think

37
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,880
you're in the wrong, right?

38
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,490
You keep saying

39
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,600
it's for me

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,420
and to help me gain a foothold

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,480
in the Song family.

42
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,740
But have you ever thought

43
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,710
that with what you did,

44
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,470
how could...

45
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,120
the Song family still accept you?

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,800
Honey.

47
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,110
What do you mean?

48
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,959
Since you starting making this mistake,

49
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,860
you should have known

50
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
that you'd have to pay a price for it.

51
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,940
What he said really isn't true.

52
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,930
He was this tall.

53
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,440
Next.

54
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,750
Everything that was said before is not accurate.

55
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,850
I really saw him.

56
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,960
He was this tall.

57
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,960
Right?

58
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,390
And in his hand, he had...

59
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:07,870
had...

60
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,470
Next.

61
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,340
He was this tall.

62
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,990
You don't believe me?

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,140
They're all wrong.

64
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,810
Man'er.

65
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,590
You're finally here.

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
One by one.

67
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,590
Don't be anxious.

68
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,700
I saw it with my own eyes.

69
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
During this time,

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,790
many people have been providing clues?

71
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,310
Don't.

72
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,520
Speak one by one.

73
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,000
Although

74
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,840
we've identified the culprit,

75
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,870
there are too many people

76
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,130
coming here every day.

77
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,620
This act has to continue.

78
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,940
Man'er.

79
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,180
We've let you down.

80
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,690
It's not your fault.

81
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,180
You don't have to apologize.

82
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,380
Hua'er is the one who should apologize.

83
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,740
Hua'er is my wife.

84
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,210
She did all these wrong things

85
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,540
just to help me.

86
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,760
To help me gain a foothold

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,820
in the Song family.

88
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,240
I hope you

89
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,280
can forgive her

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,260
and let her off.

91
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,200
Let her off?

92
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,430
Now that you mention it,

93
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,820
it's actually my fault, right?

94
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,080
She not only framed me,

95
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:17,710
but...

96
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,390
But she also disregarded human lives.

97
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,450
Calm down, Man'er.

98
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,370
It's...

99
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,470
It's because no one was killed.

100
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,960
That's why I dare

101
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,730
to ask for your forgiveness.

102
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,040
No one was killed?

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,620
That's because Youheng intervened.

104
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,310
Did Hua'er really realize her mistake

105
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,300
or is she just hiding

106
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,760
after committing a crime?

107
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,630
You're the one

108
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,260
who's most clear about this.

109
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,590
You're helping her this time.

110
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,790
What about next time?

111
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,909
What about following time?

112
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,909
Are you going to indulge her every time?

113
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,590
I promise

114
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,750
that this is the first time

115
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,760
and the last time.

116
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,590
If you can forgive her,

117
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,020
I won't open

118
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,930
my restaurant.

119
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,980
I won't let her cause any more trouble.

120
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,230
I know

121
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,790
you and Shen Nuo

122
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,690
are kind-hearted people.

123
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,240
If we hand Wang

124
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,730
to the government,

125
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,690
this matter

126
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,540
will be recorded in court

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,920
and Hua'er

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,900
will most likely be imprisoned.

129
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,140
But you left Wang to me

130
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,210
because you trust my character.

131
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,990
I don't want Hua'er to lose everything.

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,390
Man'er.

133
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,920
After all,

134
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,960
you still care about

135
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,880
sisterhood.

136
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,400
You sure can see through me.

137
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,060
But what about those poisoned people?

138
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,490
What about my restaurant?

139
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,510
We can't just

140
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,150
move on from this matter like that.

141
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,710
I will

142
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,460
take full responsibility for all of that.

143
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,120
I'll try my best to compensate

144
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,370
the poisoned people.

145
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,170
I'll make sure your restaurant

146
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,010
reopens.

147
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,550
You're a member of the Song family.

148
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,790
The Song family has connections with the government.

149
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,910
But as far as I know,

150
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,970
you have no real power.

151
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,450
How will you ensure that my restaurant reopens?

152
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,720
Yes.

153
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,270
I'm not capable.

154
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,110
But there's someone who's capable.

155
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,070
Okay.

156
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,430
Young Master Song.

157
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,980
Goodbye.

158
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,010
Boss Jia, take care.

159
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,470
Boss Jia, this way please.

160
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,020
What are you doing here?

161
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,570
Brother,

162
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,100
I have a favor to ask.

163
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,310
Didn't I tell you not to bother me

164
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,750
if it's nothing important?

165
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,590
Were you not listening

166
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,350
or what?

167
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,160
I think you've been living a comfortable life

168
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,910
for too long

169
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,850
that you're asking for trouble.

170
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,580
Brother.

171
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
Just this once.

172
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,840
It's really important.

173
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,310
It concerns the Song family.

174
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,190
You were already allowed

175
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,520
to marry that poor girl.

176
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,060
I didn't expect such a thing to happen.

177
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,720
So, Brother,

178
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,120
you must help us.

179
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,110
Otherwise, the Song family...

180
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,570
This can be solved easily.

181
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,820
That's good.

182
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,080
Thank you, Brother.

183
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Just divorce her.

184
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,140
Bring Lian Hua'er

185
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,350
and the person who poisoned others

186
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,440
to the government.

187
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,770
One has to admit one's crime

188
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,030
and be punished for it.

189
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,350
Then it has nothing to do

190
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,550
with the Song family.

191
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,630
Brother.

192
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,300
What are you talking about?

193
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,680
You can ask me to do anything

194
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,970
except this.

195
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,660
Don't bargain with me.

196
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,010
It's settled then.

197
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,060
Go back.

198
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,130
Brother.

199
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,240
All these years,

200
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,480
I've never begged you

201
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,280
for anything.

202
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,250
If you ask me to go east,

203
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,250
I dare not go west.

204
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,370
But today,

205
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,530
let me make it clear.

206
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,530
You have to help me

207
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,470
whether you're willing or not!

208
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,360
How dare you.

209
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,200
Do you know

210
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,020
who you're currently relying on

211
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,700
for everything?

212
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,610
Enough.

213
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,830
If you

214
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,060
you bow to me and apologize

215
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,230
and go back,

216
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
I'll pretend you didn't come today.

217
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,940
In the future,

218
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,970
you'll still be the fourth Young Master of the Song family.

219
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,550
Fourth Young Master?

220
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,340
Although I'm in the Song family,

221
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
for so many years,

222
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,280
who has treated me like a fourth Young Master?

223
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,640
Yes.

224
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,430
Mother and you

225
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,690
gave me food, clothing and expenses,

226
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,290
and let me live comfortably.

227
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,760
But I'm so useless

228
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,400
that even I despise myself.

229
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,420
The only thing I'm doing

230
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,470
is staying alive.

231
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,080
As long as dad knows I'm alive, that's all.

232
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,180
Today,

233
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,090
if you don't help me solve this

234
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,780
and don't allow Man'er's restaurant

235
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,590
to reopen,

236
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,690
then all that you did...

237
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,090
Jinyang Guild,

238
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,990
Wu Zhonglian,

239
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
official salt, smuggled salt,

240
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,780
-and even…
-Song Hailong.

241
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,740
I'm weak and incompetent.

242
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,780
But I'm not stupid.

243
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,110
This matter of mine

244
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,780
is nothing to you.

245
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,650
As long as you

246
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,290
help me resolve this matter,

247
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,230
in the future,

248
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,130
I'll still be the obedient brother and kid

249
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,260
to you and mother.

250
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,230
I'll be loyal to you.

251
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,790
Otherwise...

252
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,120
Hailong.

253
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,580
I used to think

254
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,160
you seemed like

255
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,340
a useless person.

256
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,740
I didn't expect that there'd be a day

257
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,940
where you'd do this for such a poor girl.

258
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,790
I underestimated you.

259
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,610
Farewell.

260
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,260
When did I say I would kick you out?

261
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,600
Honey.

262
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,650
I've taken care of this matter.

263
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,060
It's enough

264
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
that you acknowledge your mistake.

265
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,680
We are a married couple.

266
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,050
Your mistakes

267
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,480
are my mistakes.

268
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,670
I won't just maintain personal integrity.

269
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,070
I won't leave you either.

270
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,770
[One Fresh Move]

271
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,780
Come on.

272
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,450
Open the door!

273
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,500
Light the fireworks!

274
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,350
May the business thrive!

275
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,460
May you make a fortune!

276
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,470
May the business prosper!

277
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,730
May you make a fortune!

278
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,160
People are coming.

279
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,460
-This way, guys.
-The best restaurant I’ve ever eaten at.

280
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,830
-Let’s go inside.
-The one in front.

281
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,840
I'll take you there.

282
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,370
Go ahead.

283
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,070
Turn left.

284
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,910
Okay.

285
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,200
He's obviously busy

286
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,170
and in a hurry.

287
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,930
Someone will be here soon.

288
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,430
Shall we go in first?

289
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,320
Go in first.

290
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,680
Okay.

291
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,360
Go in.

292
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,230
Let's go inside and check it out.

293
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,650
Come on.

294
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,180
Let's go.

295
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,800
You're back.

296
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,190
It's fine.

297
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
It's just the first day of business.

298
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,960
Many people still don't know

299
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,010
we've reopened.

300
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,240
Tomorrow,

301
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,450
I'll help you solicit customers.

302
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,190
Forget it.

303
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,150
Are you discouraged?

304
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,960
This is not like you.

305
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,810
Where's the Man'er

306
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,540
who is full of fighting spirit?

307
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,960
If you really solicit more customers,

308
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,920
I'd probably really collapse.

309
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,920
What do you mean?

310
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,670
Master.

311
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,050
Master.

312
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,670
The kitchen is empty.

313
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,230
We need to order more ingredients.

314
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,990
Stop arguing.

315
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,010
I can't do anything without the ingredients.

316
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,770
I was so busy that my energy is depleted.

317
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,620
Since we opened at noon,

318
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,540
the customers kept coming.

319
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,950
Even my throat is hoarse from exhaustion.

320
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,430
I wanted to save myself some pork knuckles

321
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,960
but it was sold out at noon.

322
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,600
Yes.

323
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,090
We've only finished the afternoon shift

324
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,470
and the stock of ingredients in the kitchen

325
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,670
is already depleted.

326
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,890
What should we do

327
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,530
tomorrow?

328
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,840
What should we do?

329
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,950
So it's not that you don't have customers

330
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,680
but that you're closing early.

331
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,310
Lian Man'er, you tricked me again.

332
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,110
How would I have known

333
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,300
that business would be this thriving

334
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,110
after we reopen with our new store?

335
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,070
Why didn't you come back earlier

336
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,770
to help us?

337
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,430
Let's go.

338
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,930
Where are we going?

339
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,710
There's no ingredients in the kitchen.

340
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,240
I have to go up the mountain and carry some back.

341
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Okay.

342
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,280
Let's go.

343
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,190
Let's go.

344
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,990
Shouyi.

345
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,230
Let's go together.

346
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,890
Hurry up.

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
Don't be lazy. Hurry.

348
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,320
I'll give you a pork knuckle later.

349
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,359
Who set this up?

350
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,329
The Madam of the Song family with four sons

351
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,060
reported it.

352
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,750
In the end,

353
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,180
the Song family still used their connections

354
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,410
to get the government to stop pursuing

355
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,140
the matter with One Fresh Move.

356
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,530
They even closed down their own Chunhuai Pavilion.

357
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,720
I didn’t expect Shen Nuo

358
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,290
to make a drastic move.

359
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,300
Not only did he solve the crisis,

360
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,070
but he also managed to get his rival

361
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,730
to close down their business.

362
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,320
Have you checked

363
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,240
Shen Nuo’s background?

364
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,670
Shen Nuo

365
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,430
is the nephew

366
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,320
of a family surnamed Lian from Shisanli Camp.

367
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,260
He came here only because

368
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,870
his hometown was affected by flooding

369
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,870
and is seeking refuge with his aunt.

370
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,880
Later, he and his cousin,

371
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,630
that

372
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,630
lady you saw,

Champion Red Brandy wine

375
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,240
and made a lot of money.

376
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,470
After that,

377
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,530
they opened this restaurant.

378
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,090

entry into the merchant guild.

381
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,910
That kid is in such a hurry to enter the merchant guild.

382
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,640
Should we...

383
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,390
Do it.

[Yuelai Restaurant]

385

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,490
The oriole

577
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,400
you gave me last time

578
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
is really nice.

579
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,360
That's rare

580
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,780
to get your recognition.

581
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,320
I heard that there's

582
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,850
a top grade macaw in your house.

583
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,290
When can I be fortunate enough

584
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,400
to go and take a look?

585
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,430
As long as you like it,

586
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,470
I'll personally send it to your place

587
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,620
in a few days.

588
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,240
That's great.

589
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,040
Thank you in advance, Boss Zhao.

590
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,120
You're welcome.

591
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,270
We should work together more

592
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,070
in the future.

593
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,920
Of course.

594
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,770
Gentlemen.

595
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,360
Boss Wu invites you to the banquet.

596
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,770
Please come in.

597
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,000
Sure.

598
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,950
Come on.

599
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,520
Let's go.

600
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,620
Come on.

601
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,830
In this winter,

602
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,760
where did you get

603
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,420
such fresh green vegetables?

604
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,010
Did Master Wu

605
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,440
specially transport them from the south?

606
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,160
I forgot to introduce.

607
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,390
This is Shen Nuo, Boss Shen.

608
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,740
These non-seasonal vegetables

609
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,570
were prepared by Boss Shen

610
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,610
for everyone.

611
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,300
From now on,

612
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,890
Boss Shen will be

613
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,430
a member of Jinyang Guild.

614
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,990
Thank you for your guidance, Master Wu.

615
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,570
It’s my honor

616
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
to meet everyone here today.

617
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,880
In the future, with regards to business,

618
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,080
I look forward to everyone's guidance.

619
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,190
If you don't mind,

620
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,470
you can count on me for your residence's vegetables

621
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,550
in the future.

622
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,460
You're too kind, Boss Shen.

623
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,240
To be able to plant

624
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,580
hot spring vegetables,

625
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,310
you must be no ordinary person.

626
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,360
I won't stand on ceremony then.

627
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,190
Thank you in advance, Boss Shen.

628
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:05,990
You're welcome.

629
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,440
Thank you, Boss Shen.

630
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,070
Thank you.

631
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,440
To Master Wu.

632
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,030
To Master Wu.

633
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,550
Master Wu.

634
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,510
Since we are all here,

635
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,630
why don't we play some games?

636
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,910
Yeah.

637
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,750
Drinking alone

638
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,440
is boring.

639
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,510
Well,

640
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,360
what should we play?

641
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,040
How about business riddles?

642
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,280
Sounds good.

643
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,680
Sure.

644
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,710
Let's play business riddles.

645
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,700
Business riddles are a good game.

646
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,740
Let's play business riddles.

647
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,490
Yes.

648
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,230
Then,

649
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,320
as usual,

650
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,710
you'll fight to answer the questions.

651
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,880
If you get the wrong answer,

652
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,150
you'll have a drink as punishment.

653
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,470
If someone gets a correct answer,

654
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,430
everyone here

655
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,200
will have a drink with them.

656
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,200
What do you think?

657
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,470
Great!

658
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,610
Great!

659
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,870
Master Wu, please give us a question.

660
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,430
What should I ask about?

661
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,060
Everyone has one be it square or round, big or small.

662
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,990
The words in its center are elegant.

663
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,070
Sometimes, it has red makeup all over its face.

664
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,030
It's always facing the wind under the moon.

665
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,200
Well...

666
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,280
I guessed it.

667
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,070
It's a book box.

668
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,020
Have a drink as punishment.

669
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,070
I didn’t guess it right.

670
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,880
Master Wu.

671
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,480
It's a painting brush.

672
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,470
You should have a drink as punishment too.

673
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,800
He wanted to show off,

674
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,470
but he's also wrong.

675
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,220
Boss Shen.

676
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,600
Have you guessed it?

677
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,880
It should be a seal.

678
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Everyone.

679
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,200
Raise your glasses.

680
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,180
Thank you.

681
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,230
Thank you.

682
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,390
-Boss Shen.
-He got it.

683
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,440
Not in the skies above

684
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
nor the fields below.

685
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,570
It's hiding in the center.

686
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,390
A mystery of mysteries.

687
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,950
A mystery of mysteries?

688
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,910
Boss Shen.

689
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,310
Did you guess it again?

690
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,650
From east to west

691
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,120
and from south to north,

692
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,480
everyone's convinced.

693
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,310
Master Wu.

694
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,870
Am I right?

695
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,580
I quit.

696
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,120
With Boss Shen here,

697
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,040
no one can win.

698
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,690
I guessed it by accident.

699
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,490
I'll take a drink as punishment.

700
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,080
So what's the answer?

701
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,070
It's a spider.

702
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,660
Master Wu.

703
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,960
We've drunk quite a bit.

704
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,940
How about

705
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,940
we have some tea

706
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,520
to relieve our hangovers?

707
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:17,910
That's right.

708
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,730
Good suggestion.

709
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,650
Yes.

710
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,070
Serve the tea.

711
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,480
Come on.

712
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,450
Come on.

713
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,950
Boss Zhao.

714
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,130
It’s Boss Cao?

715
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,570
Thank you for your tea, Master Wu.

716
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,950
Boss Cao is lucky.

717
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,280
I was wondering

718
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,410
why all my birds at home

719
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,740
were singing together.

720
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,300
It turns out

721
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,860
that I was going to get this cup of tea.

722
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,720
Gentlemen.

723
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,560
I'll drink it first then.

724
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
No wonder they are like this.

725
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,940
So they are waiting here for this.

726
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,110
Young Master.

727
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,850
You weren't full just now?

728
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,480
How could I get full from eating there?

729
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,940
I was only paying attention to what they say.

730
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,990
What did you figure out

731
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,590
from looking at that teacup?

732
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,710
Isn't it obvious?

733
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,630
It means

734
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,400
he obtained the dispatcher qualification.

735
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,900
Looks like it's good that you're not full.

736
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,610
But we can't

737
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,370
be so sure about this matter for now.

738
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,500
We need to get close to Boss Cao

739
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,900
before we can confirm it.

740
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,090
Then, Young Master,

741
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,250
do you have an idea?

742
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,700
Bird.

743
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,420
Bird?

744
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,150
Hundred birds singing together.

745
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,400
Give me one more.

746
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,650
Just put it down.

747
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,050
Okay.

748
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,620
Mother.

749
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,790
When I enter the city and get married

750
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,120
and become a noble wife,

751
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,130
I'll take you there.

752
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,020
We won't do

753
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,580
such manual labor anymore.

754
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,469
With these words from my daughter,

755
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,139
nothing is hard work.

756
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,750
The radish looks great this year.

757
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,750
They're so fresh.

758
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,280
Mother.

759
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,120
Eldest Brother.

760
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,040
Why did you come back suddenly?

761
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,380
Why did you bring so many things?

762
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,500
Mother.

763
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,090
Let's go back and talk.

764
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,440
Let's go.

765
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,090
Eldest Brother, give these to me.

766
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,719
Let's go.

767
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:53,840
Let's go.

768
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,490
Eldest Brother.

769
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,950
Father talks about you every day.

770
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,910
[Cao Mansion]

771
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,310
Be careful on the road today.

772
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,310
Don't let them

773
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,770
notice you.

774
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,070
Be careful.

775
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,320
Okay, go ahead now.

776
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,200
Isn’t this One Fresh Move's

777
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,140
Boss Shen?

778
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,760
Boss Cao?

779
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,560
What a coincidence.

780
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,040
I was so focused on teasing the birds

781
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,960
that I really didn't notice you.

782
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,560
I'm sorry.

783
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,430
Is this your residence?

784
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,500
Yes, yes.

785
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,190
Is this bird in your hand

786
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,710
a Gray Pearl parrot?

787
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,520
You sure know your birds.

788
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,320
As the saying goes,

789
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,450
teach parrots every day at the window

790
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,270
and it'll recite several poems by the King.

791
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,040
Only the nobility

792
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,790
get to play with a parrot like this.

793
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,800
It’s a reputable noble bird.

794
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,400
May I ask you

795
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,670
how you got it?

796
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,720
I happen to have a friend

797
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,950
involved in the trade of rare birds in Bianjing.

798
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,420
So,

799
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,200
when he knew I joined Jinyang Guild,

800
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,640
he sent me this divine bird

801
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,770
to congratulate me.

802
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,930
You should know

803
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,210
this breed

804
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,910
is priceless and rare.

805
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,970
Boss Shen’s friend

806
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,350
is really generous.

807
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,470
That's very rare.

808
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,060
Very rare.

809
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,370
Hearing what you said,

810
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,560
this little bird

811
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,790
must be a rare animal.

812
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,530
Show it to Boss Cao.

813
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,350
Call him Boss Cao.

814
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:44,880
Boss Cao.

815
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,160
Boss Cao.

816
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,670
Boss Cao.

817
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,370
This... It...

818
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,940
It is really clever indeed.

819
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,150
Boss Cao.

820
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,280
I can tell that you love birds.

821
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,350
It's also fate to run into each other today.

822
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,750
Why don't I give this bird

823
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,310
and give you this bird?

824
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:01,920
Yes.

825
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,470
No.

826
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,510
You can't.

827
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,550
This...

828
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,340
It's such a precious bird.

829
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,350
How can I...

830
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,070
not love it?

831
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm just

832
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,390
momentarily curious about birds.

833
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,680
If I lose interest

834
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,750
and neglect to take care of her,

835
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,180
it'll be a waste.

836
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,930
Why don't I find a good owner

837
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,060
as soon as possible.

838
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,450
I also believe Boss Cao

839
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,020
will treat it well.

840
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,700
Just take it.

841
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,870
Take it, Boss Cao.

842
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,370
In that case,

843
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,130
I'll

844
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,210
accept your offer.

845
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,840
Do you two

846
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,950
have any hobbies?

847
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,120
Hobbies?

848
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,390
I’m ashamed.

849
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,910
I don’t have any hobbies

850
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,870
outside of running my business.

851
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,250
Everyone loves money.

852
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,750
But we can't neglect the joys

853
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,810
in daily life.

854
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,670
In the future,

855
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,760
we'll have to trouble you

856
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,110
to take us two

857
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,040
to have fun.

858
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,340
No problem.

859
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,070
There will be a golf game in a few days.

860
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,270
They are all reputable businessmen

861
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,780
in the county.

862
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,610
When the time comes,

863
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,450
come have fun and talk about business together.

864
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:03,870
Okay?

865
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,800
Thank you in advance then, Boss Cao.

866
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,730
You're welcome.

867
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,520
If you two

868
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,810
have nothing urgent to tend to right now,

869
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,920
how about having some tea with me?

870
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,740
Sure.

871
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Thank you.

872
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,780
Please.

873
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,190
Okay.

874
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,540
Gray Pearl parrot!

875
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,080
Hubby.

876
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,970
How much wedding money do you think is appropriate

877
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:36,770
for us to give?

878
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,240
Although we've split from the family,

879
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,530
she's still my sister.

880
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,350
It should be a decent amount.

881
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,150
Give her more.

882
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,580
Sure.

883
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,240
Man'er, you're back.

884
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,670
How was it?

885
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,590
Was business good?

886
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,280
Yes.

887
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,020
Who...

888
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,430
Who are these things

889
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,520
for?

890
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,980
For Xiu'er.

891
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,950
She's getting married soon.

892
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,000
Your father went to town

893
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,680
to buy some decent things to add to it.

894
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,150
I

895
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,210
also took out two items

896
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,080
from my dowry.

897
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,430
Xiu'er

898
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,350
is getting married?

899
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,290
I've never heard of it.

900
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,410
It happened this morning.

901
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,050
Shouren

902
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,950
came here specially to talk about the marriage.

903
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,190
Your grandparents were so happy.

904
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,920
They agreed to it immediately.

905
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,690
It seems that

906
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,900
the date has been set too.

907
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,420
Yes.

908
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,170
He said he's the son of the Liu family in town.

909
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,300
The Liu family

910
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,720
is even a wealthy family.

911
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,940
In town?

912
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,390
A wealthy family surnamed Liu?

913
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,130
There aren't many of them.

914
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,170
Is it Liu Fugui?

915
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,780
Yes.

916
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,540
He's called Liu Fugui.

917
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,030
Why?

918
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,930
You know the son of the Liu family?

919
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,470
His son?

920
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,430
Thirteen.

921
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,590
Is Shen Nuo here?

922
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,070
Young Master has been

923
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,890
especially tired these days.

924
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,360
He fell asleep early today.

925
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,420
What's the matter?

926
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,990
I just want to ask you

927
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,420
if Liu Fugui

928
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,510
has a son.

929
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,960
Liu Fugui?

930
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,740
Why do you suddenly ask this?

931
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,550
Uncle Shouren talked about a marriage

932
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,360
for Xiu'er.

933
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,200
He said

934
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,070
it's with Liu Fugui’s son.

935
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,090
I heard Boss Cao mention this.

936
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,630
Although Liu Fugui has married

937
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,630
many concubines,

938
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,110
he doesn't have any sons.

939
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,080
No sons?

940
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,110
So

941
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,460
he fabricated a son?

942
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,270
There's something fishy about this.

943
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,070
This won't do.

944
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,670
I have to remind my grandparents

945
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,580
to figure out

946
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,270
who Xiu'er is marrying first.

947
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,470
What about you?

948
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,270
How is the investigation going?

949
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,240
We are watching Boss Cao right now.

950
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,590
He should be the new dispatcher

951
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,590
of Jinyang Guild.

952
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,070
Young Master and I

953
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,730
have become friends with him.

954
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,780
What's left

955
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,010
is to get closer to him

956
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,360
and try to find evidence

957
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,950
that they smuggled salt illegally.

958
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,880
How do you plan to get closer to him?

959
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,560
Stop there.

960
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,620
Sir.

961
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,570
Today,

962
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,620
we have an appointment

963
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,620
with your master.

964
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,480
Please

965
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,400
let him know.

966
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,360
Boss Cao.

967
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,990
You came at the right time.

968
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,320
We were looking for you.

969
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,380
What do you want?

970
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,450
Boss Cao.

971
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,110
You’re so forgetful.

972
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,750
Didn't we agree

973
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,520
to go to the golf game together?

974
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,730
Yes.

975
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,110
I'm really sorry.

976
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:35,840
Guys.

977
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,090
I have something urgent

978
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,290
to handle right away.

979
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,150
Let's meet another time.

980
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,870
Boss Cao.

981
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,390
Where are you going

982
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,330
in such a hurry?

983
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
We happen to be free.

984
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,330
Why don't we go with you?

985
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,130
No, no.

986
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,350
You can't follow us.

987
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,560
I'll look for you again later.

988
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,830
Where do you think Boss Cao

989
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,830
is going with an empty carriage?

990
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,600
If he really is the dispatcher,

991
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,960
maybe today

992
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,870
is the day he receives and delivers the goods?
