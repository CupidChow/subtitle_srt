[Episode 6]

4
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:38,979
Youheng.

5
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,220
He is indeed a member of the Lian family.

6
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,509
There are too many crops to tend to as a farmer.

7
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,350
Constable.

8
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,860
It's normal that you've never met him

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,720
in the village.

10
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,480
Although we shouldn't take things lightly,

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,150
if

12
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,550
you just randomly arrest someone

13
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,260
and send him back to the magistrate office,

14
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,150
not only will you be blamed by the magistrate,

15
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,750
but you'll also get caught up

16
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,430
such that there'll be no time to search for the real culprit.

17
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,270
Sirs.

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,060
Don't waste any more time

19
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,720
on a farmer.

20
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,970
Constable Liu.

21
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,590
Even Youheng said so.

22
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,579
What do you think?

23
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,100
Go on.

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,720
Wang Youheng.

25
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,800
Why are you helping me?

26
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm not helping you.

27
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,710
I just don't want

28
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,640
to add trouble to Man'er's family.

29
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,540
As I said,

30
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,870
once you're done with your affairs,

31
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,600
you should leave immediately.

32
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,700
Go.

33
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,660
Xiu'er.

34
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,329
We don't have to be angry with Man'er.

35
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,160
Am I mad at her?

36
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,880
I'm angry with Father.

37
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,130
So many people are watching.

38
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,540
Not only did he scold me,

39
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,730
but he also hit me.

40
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,620
That's because

41
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,100
Lian Man'er tried to sow discord between Father and you.

42
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,380
Who knows if she isn't

43
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,140
making up stories about you behind your back?

44
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,829
Otherwise,

45
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,220
why would Father get so mad

46
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,060
with just those few words from you?

47
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,590
Yes.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,270
But you're still family after all.

49
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,580
No matter how bad she is,

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,970
you shouldn't

51
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,020
take it to heart.

52
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,720
Hua'er.

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,430
What should I do?

54
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,610
It's between you and Man'er.

55
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,550
I shouldn't talk too much.

56
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,269
Hua'er.

57
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,440
Lian Man'er is such a bad girl.

58
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,500
Why do you still care so much for her?

59
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,030
Help me think of a solution.

60
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,560
F-Fine.

61
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,870
If I think of a good solution,

62
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,110
I'll tell you.

63
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,620
You treat me the best indeed.

64
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,380
Father.

65
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,700
Why did you call all of us here

66
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,580
so early in the morning?

67
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,980
Aren't we going to the fields in a while?

68
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,870
I called you here before heading to the fields

69
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,670
because I have something important

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,530
to discuss with the whole family.

71
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,580
I was planning

72
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,830
to talk about it in a few days.

73
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,030
But Shouren and his family

74
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,830
will be going back to town after the autumn harvest.

75
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,840
After thinking about it,

76
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,270
I thought it'd be better to talk about this

77
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,530
when everyone is here.

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,420
About this,

79
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,280
Shouren and I

80
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,090
have thought about it.

81
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,460
I know

82
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,220
that San'er

83
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,930
is a filial son.

84
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,450
I guess he wouldn't object either.

85
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,110
Well.

86
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,360
Hua'er

87
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,380
is getting married soon.

88
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,260
After getting married,

89
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,840
Shouren

90
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,060
will have no children to take care of him.

91
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,380
Zhang,

92
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,030
If this baby is a boy,

93
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,850
you should let Shouren adopt it.

94
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,120
Father.

95
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,550
San'er.

96
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,230
You're still young.

97
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,100
You can have more children in the future.

98
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,300
From now on,

99
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,790
this child will study and read with Shouren

100
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,970
and make achievements.

101
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,659
It's better than being a farmer at home.

102
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,070
Then, a hundred years later,

103
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,180
Shouren

104
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,370
will also have

105
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,630
someone to carry his coffin and bury him.

106
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,720
All right then.

107
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,590
It's a deal.

108
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,430
Grandpa.

109
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,020
Since the whole family is here to discuss,

110
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,350
I have a few words to say.

111
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,990
Go ahead.

112
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,650
Regardless of whether Eight is a boy or a girl,

113
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,380
Uncle Shouren cannot adopt it.

114
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,570
Because we want to split from the family.

115
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,250
Split from the family?

116
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,150
You heard it right.

117
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,710
We're going to split from the family.

118
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
I don't have a good son

119
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,960
or a good daughter-in-law.

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
How dare you split from your family?

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,830
Just take me to the mountain

122
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,330
and bury me.

123
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,370
Bury...

124
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,720
Mother.

125
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,280
Father... Father is angry.

126
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,680
Hurry.

127
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,780
San'er.

128
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,670
I know

129
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,630
that you don't talk about it,

130
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,990
but you're still

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,710
bothered by

132
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,860
what happened to Man'er the last time.

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,820
But making mistakes

134
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,210
is inevitable

135
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,080
for everyone.

136
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,890
Man'er.

137
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,340
You're still young.

138
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,530
There are many things you don't understand.

139
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,010
In this house,

140
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,160
other than the biological parents and children,

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
everyone's biological brothers.

142
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,950
He broke the bones,

143
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,950
the tendons weren't hurt.

144
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,679
No matter who did something wrong,

145
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,110
we have to be tolerant, right?

146
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,350
We're a family.

147
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,980
If you think it through,

148
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,710
we have to work together.

149
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,460
Once we split up,

150
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,140
then...

151
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,160
the familial bonds will be broken.

152
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,230
Grandpa, how did you

153
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,720
make such a cliched theory

154
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,570
sound so grand?

155
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,980
What did you say?

156
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,650
I said

157
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,290
that just because my parents are easy-going,

158
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,110
you naturally think that

159
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,580
they can be wronged.

160
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,990
Man'er.

161
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,830
Mother.

162
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,430
Stop it.

163
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,280
Mother.

164
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,870
Just now, Grandpa said so much

165
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,480
about the logic

166
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,950
of familial relationships.

167
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,340
But before, when Uncle Shouren

168
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,150
sold my life

169
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,020
for a piece of broken jade pendant,

170
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,620
did he consider our kinship?

171
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,470
Now,

172
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,010
they're eyeing the baby in your womb.

173
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,510
If we don't hurry and split from the family,

174
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,020
they'll bleed us dry.

175
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,990
This girl has a sharp tongue.

176
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,050
San'er.

177
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,000
Is this what you want to do too?

178
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,440
Do you really want to be separated from your parents?

179
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,950
Father...

180
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,520
I get it now.

181
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,190
Shouxin's family

182
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,920
wants to split from the family.

183
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,300
As brothers and sisters-in-law,

184
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,470
you should reflect on yourselves.

185
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,810
You're going to be an official.

186
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,740
After you become successful,

187
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,970
you mustn't forget Shouxin's family

188
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,470
and support them in everything.

189
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,580
Let them enjoy a comfortable life

190
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,320
along with you.

191
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,820
Remember that.

192
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,160
Father.

193
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,630
I realize my mistake.

194
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,880
Before, I was in a befuddled state.

195
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,400
From now on, I'll treat Shouxin

196
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,220
and Sister-in-law well.

197
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,820
Fine.

198
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,230
As I said,

199
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,450
brothers

200
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
do not bear grudges.

201
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,690
From now on, you need to

202
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,820
be respectful and compromising with each other

203
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,350
like you used to.

204
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,710
Got it?

205
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,340
Yes, Grandpa.

206
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,660
Yes.

207
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,580
San'er.

208
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,510
Your elder brother's family realized their mistake.

209
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,170
Father.

210
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,910
I'll listen to you.

211
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,620
No!

212
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,080
Did your parents say anything?

213
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,940
I said no!

214
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,670
You have no say in this. Shut up!

215
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,650
Mother!

216
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:52,750
My Lord.

217
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,570
Mother.

218
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,500
What's wrong?

219
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,190
Go get a doctor now.

220
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,580
Mother.

221
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,100
Go.

222
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,820
Go.

223
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,830
Hurry up.

224
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,700
Mother! Mother!

225
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,520
She has insufficient energy and blood

226
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,320
and the fetus's vital signs are a little unstable.

227
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,010
But there's no major problem.

228
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,180
She just needs to rest.

229
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,990
Here.

230
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,990
Seven.

231
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
I'm glad you're fine. You scared me.

232
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,070
Look.

233
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,820
The shoes Mother sewed for Eight

234
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,700
are finished.

235
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,550
Don't look at the shoes.

236
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,560
Take a good rest first.

237
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,960
I go to the temple every day

238
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,590
and pray to Buddha.

239
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,780
Every day, my heart and liver are already bitter

240
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,480
from taking medicine.

241
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,270
But you actually secretly

242
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,780
discussed with Father

243
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,390
about adopting

244
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,220
San'er's child.

245
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,370
It's been so many years

246
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,440
and we haven't had any success.

247
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,960
Father was just anxious.

248
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,460
I think you're the one that's anxious.

249
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,320
Let me tell you.

250
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,060
A wife has to be subservient to her husband.

251
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,190
If you continue to make a fuss like this...

252
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,120
What will you do?

253
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,340
What will you do?

254
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,350
I...

255
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,180
Lian Shouren.

256
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,620
My family was rich back then.

257
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,950
My father advised me to marry you

258
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,700
and into this family of farmers,

259
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,500
because he thought

260
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,890
you were diligent in your studies

261
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,330
and that you'll treat me well in the future.

262
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,070
But ever since I've been with you,

263
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,700
I just have an empty title

264
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,230
as a scholar's wife.

265
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,300
I haven't had

266
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,110
a single good day.

267
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,420
If my two sons

268
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,870
didn't die early,

269
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,320
I wouldn't have to endure

270
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,100
this humiliation today.

271
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,810
All right.

272
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,400
I feel bad

273
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,620
inside too.

274
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,620
Shouyi and Shouxin both have sons.

275
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,420
I'm the only one without a son.

276
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,830
How can the villagers

277
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,560
say about me?

278
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,920
How can my friends

279
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,350
talk about it?

280
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,530
If anything, it's your fault.

281
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,860
It's your womb's fault

282
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,320
for being uncooperative.

283
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,070
Man'er.

284
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,600
You were too impulsive today.

285
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
About the matter of splitting from the family,

286
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,180
don't ever mention it again.

287
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,110
In a family,

288
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,340
tiny hurdles are inevitable.

289
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,510
Tiny hurdles?

290
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,590
Uncle Shouren selling me off for widow burning

291
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,520
is a tiny hurdle.

292
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,220
Asking my mother for the child

293
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,980
she has been pregnant with for ten months

294
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,050
is a tiny hurdle.

295
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,960
Why do they get the right to adopt Eight?

296
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,870
Why should Eight take care of them and send them off when they pass away?

297
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,000
A bunch of vampires.

298
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,190
Yes, a bunch of vampires.

299
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:12,990
Man'er.

300
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
What is a vampire?

301
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,810
It's an evil spirit that specializes in sucking human blood.

302
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,670
But what your Grandpa

303
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,160
said today is right.

304
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,070
I'm just

305
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,990
a crippled farmer.

306
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,480
Your Uncle Shouren

307
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,060
is a respectable scholar.

308
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,950
Maybe...

309
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,870
Eight will have better prospects

310
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,190
by being with your uncle.

311
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,100
Are you still unclear of

312
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,580
what kind of people

313
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,060
Uncle Shouren and Aunt Gu are?

314
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,980
If Eight were raised by them,

315
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,440
he'd have

316
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,600
a bad character.

317
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,460
After we split from the family

318
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,340
and earn money, we can also

319
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,070
send Seven and Eight to school.

320
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,060
It's still uncertain which family

321
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,060
would have a higher quality of life.

322
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,010
But what your grandpa meant today was

323
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,770
that as long as he's alive,

324
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,580
the family can't be separated.

325
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,080
Don't always talk about

326
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,940
Grandpa's opinion.

327
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,140
What is your opinion?

328
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,430
Mother, tell me.

329
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,910
Your father only wants

330
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,670
to have a son now,

331
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,440
but he doesn't think about the future at all.

332
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,060
Your Aunt Zhang

333
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,150
pretends to be pitiful,

334
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,880
but I can tell

335
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
that she has planned out everything

336
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,700
to make us raise her son for her.

337
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,710
When the child grows up,

338
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,380
she will tell him the truth.

339
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,730
By then, how could the child choose not to be with her?

340
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,619
Not to mention your Aunt Zhang,

341
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,859
there's also Lian Man'er

342
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,609
and Seven.

343
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,980
There's not one of them who's easy to deal with.

344
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,710
In the future,

345
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,020
our household

346
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,630
will be dictated by that family.

347
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,470
Mother.

348
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,700
Hua'er.

349
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,800
When that day comes,

350
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,980
you would have married away long ago

351
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,790
and not be by my side.

352
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,950
I'll be all alone in misery.

353
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,900
How am I going to live that way, Hua'er?

354
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,750
Are you still upset

355
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,210
over the adoption matter?

356
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,440
I don't have time for that.

357
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,340
Instead of being gloomy,

358
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,190
I might as well listen to the sound of the wind and the insects.

359
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,870
Just now, when I was working,

360
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,710
I've already thought everything through.

361
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,660
Since my mother's child

362
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,520
is not born yet,

363
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,550
there's still room to turn things around.

364
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,020
For things that I can't do anything about,

365
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
I'll just give up.

366
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,180
Also,

367
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,030
the matter of us earning money together

368
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,030
can't be delayed.

369
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,960
I have to earn a lot of money.

370
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,190
Dare I ask

371
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,230
if you've figured out how to do that?

372
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,990
After collecting the peanuts,

373
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,680
we will pick up the leftover peanuts

374
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,540
and make garlic peanuts for sale.

375
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,740
It's much more profitable than picking firethorns.

376
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,780
Are you still unclear of

377
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,410
what kind of people

378
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,800
Uncle Shouren and Aunt Gu are?

379
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,250
If Eight were raised by them,

380
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,710
he'd have a bad character.

381
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,310
Zhang.

382
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,330
Chunzhu's grandmother.

383
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,040
Are you going to the fields?

384
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,440
The rice crops are almost all harvested.

385
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,770
I'm going to take a look.

386
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,300
Be careful.

387
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:00,910
Okay.

388
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,460
Shen Nuo.

389
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,700
Man'er.

390
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,320
What's wrong, Ye'er?

391
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,410
Aunt Zhang...

392
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,460
Aunt Zhang...

393
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,170
Go back now and take a look.

394
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,330
Mother.

395
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,630
My children's mother.

396
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,070
Mother.

397
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,850
My children's mother.

398
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,960
Mother, wake up!

399
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,320
-My children's mother.
-Mother.

400
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,070
Mother, wake up!

401
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,150
Mother, wake up!

402
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:16,910
Mother.

403
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,460
What happened to my mother?

404
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,420
She experienced a miscarriage-like symptom.

405
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,540
We didn't have time to wait for the midwife to come,

406
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,670
so I rushed her labor

407
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,680
and she gave birth to a boy.

408
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,850
Unfortunately,

409
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,990
after he was born,

410
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,040
he was already not breathing.

411
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,700
Not breathing?

412
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,350
W-What do you mean he wasn't breathing?

413
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,580
Where did you throw him away?

414
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,190
Let me see it.

415
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,120
Let me see it.

416
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,540
What do you mean he wasn't breathing?

417
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,700
Man'er, calm down.

418
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,360
Calm down.

419
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,940
Doctor Li.

420
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,940
Aunt still isn't

421
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,740
out of danger.

422
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,470
Can you think of another solution?

423
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,020
It's useless for me to stay here.

424
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,870
Zhang is bleeding non-stop.

425
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,610
I advise you to make plans in advance.

426
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,740
With her condition,

427
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,590
she won't last past eight hours.

428
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,130
We just agreed to the adoption

429
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,730
and something big happened.

430
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,670
Mother.

431
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,370
What

432
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,200
exactly happened to my wife?

433
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,140
Who knows what's wrong with her?

434
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,620
She didn't stay at home

435
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,780
and insisted on wandering around outside.

436
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,980
She fell and got carried back

437
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,510
by Chunzhu's grandmother.

438
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,930
The doctor said she couldn't be saved.

439
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,860
What do you mean?

440
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,310
If the doctors in the village can't save her,

441
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,420
we'll look for doctors in the town.

442
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,300
If the doctors in the village can't save her,

443
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,540
we'll look for doctors in the county.

444
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,870
My mother will be saved.

445
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,080
I-I'll go look for a doctor.

446
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,540
The doctor said she's bleeding profusely

447
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,600
and can't be saved.

448
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,810
I'll go get the doctor.

449
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,380
You guys stay here with Aunt.

450
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,150
Man'er.

451
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,540
Trust me.

452
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,980
Aunt will be fine.

453
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,530
You...

454
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,720
Mother, promise me by saying something.

455
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,220
Mother, please say something. Mother.

456
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,460
My children's mother.

457
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,950
Mother.

458
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,960
My children's mother.

459
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,700
Did you boil the water?

460
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,730
Get more cloth.

461
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,430
Okay.

462
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,780
They're trying to save someone inside.

463
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,340
Just now, when Youheng entered the room,

464
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,340
was he holding ginseng in his hands?

465
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,960
It's none of your business what medicine the doctor uses.

466
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,740
Just wait.

467
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,700
Shouxin.

468
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,750
Mr. Lian is at the main hall

469
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,950
waiting for the news.

470
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,020
Everyone in the village knows

471
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,020
that something happened to my aunt.

472
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,160
If you rush in now

473
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,370
and don't allow him to use the medicine,

474
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,030
Mr. Lian will get angry again.

475
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,810
You're right.

476
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,380
Shouxin.

477
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,740
We can't afford ginseng.

478
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,580
Besides,

479
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,240
who is this dubious doctor?

480
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,710
He's unreliable.

481
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,940
Shouxin.

482
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,710
Listen to Mother.

483
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,860
We can also save her

484
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,230
with cheap medicine.

485
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,020
Shouxin.

486
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,290
When I gave birth to you,

487
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,920
it was freezing cold.

488
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,030
It was so tough.

489
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,930
I was in so much pain

490
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,700
that I almost died.

491
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,210
Mother.

492
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,840
Mother.

493
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,650
Mother.

494
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,600
You're awake.

495
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,400
You're awake.

496
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,160
Mother.

497
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,960
My children's mother.

498
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,660
My children's mother.

499
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,130
Mother.

500
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,460
Seven.

501
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,150
I'm here.

502
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,760
Mother.

503
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,290
I'm here.

504
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,570
-Man'er.
-Mother.

505
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:46,900
My children's mother.

506
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,890
Hurry, my children's mother.

507
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,220
Here.

508
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:48,750
-My children's mother.
-Uncle.

509
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,300
Uncle.

510
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,220
Here.

511
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,930
Mother.

512
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,290
Don't fall asleep.

513
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,450
Don't fall asleep.

514
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,480
Mother.

515
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,860
She's still hanging by a thread.

516
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,390
Is there no other way?

517
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,750
There is.

518
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,620
Pierce needles into a few acupoints at the same time.

519
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,060
But

520
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,020
Aunt Zhang has been bleeding profusely.

521
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,380
After the needles are pierced in,

522
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,580
your mother might...

523
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,510
Uncle.

524
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,260
Uncle.

525
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,270
Go ahead and pierce the needles.

526
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:33,710
Okay.

527
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,780
Oh my goodness.

528
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,300
I want to save her too.

529
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,380
But our family is so poor.

530
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,210
Using such expensive medicine,

531
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,360
the whole family will have to live in poverty.

532
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,920
Why is my life so miserable?

533
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,960
I was just a little girl

534
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,800
when I came here

535
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,530
and got married...

536
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,390
Speak louder.

537
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,540
Let the villagers see who you really are.

538
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,950
Who do you think you are?

539
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,880
How dare you talk to me like that?

540
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,550
Grandma.

541
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,950
Grandma, look at me.

542
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,860
Let go of me!

543
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,620
Her life is at stake inside.

544
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,810
If Aunt got shocked

545
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,770
and die,

546
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,700
you'd regret it.

547
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,490
I...

548
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,880
Man'er.

549
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,960
Mother is awake.

550
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,830
I'm so angry.

551
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,380
When I came here

552
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,800
and got married,

553
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,060
I was a little girl too.

554
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,270
Stop shaking.

555
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,150
Father.

556
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,000
San'er.

557
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,190
How is it?

558
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,930
Father.

559
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,530
Your daughter-in-law

560
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,860
is saved.

561
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,450
That's good.

562
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,380
That's good.

563
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,230
This child

564
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,860
was not meant to be with our Lian family.

565
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,510
Just bury him properly.

566
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,820
All right.

567
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,070
Go back to your rooms and rest.

568
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,080
Shouyi.

569
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,150
Tomorrow,

570
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,080
go and harvest and transport back

571
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,680
the rice crops at the fields.

572
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,600
San'er.

573
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,240
Don't go down to the fields.

574
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,480
Stay at home and take care of your wife.

575
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,790
Everyone, go back and rest.

576
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,400
Father.

577
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,670
I want to discuss something with you.

578
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,750
Go ahead.

579
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,150
My children's mother

580
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,510
almost died.

581
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,640
Youheng specifically instructed

582
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,620
that she needs to rest well and recuperate.

583
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,390
Do you think

584
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,990
you can give my wife

585
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,430
some rice, white noodles,

586
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,290
and eggs for nourishment?

587
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Why are you looking for your father?

588
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,440
Prepare some white noodles and eggs

589
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,800
for Zhang.

590
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,540
If we don't have enough money,

591
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,150
pick some of

592
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,500
Xiu'er and your jewelry

593
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,300
and pawn them.

594
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,010
I'm so mad.

595
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,350
Why are you still here?

596
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,900
I thought

597
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,710
you would go back

598
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,140
after you sent Youheng off.

599
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,540
Did you stay up all night?

600
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
I couldn't sleep.

601
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,520
Something major happened to my family

602
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,760
and Seven is still young

603
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,620
so someone has to take care of him.

604
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,270
And my father

605
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,500
is always

606
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,320
being controlled by Grandma.

607
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,180
It's really one worrying thing

608
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,310
after another.

609
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,660
Then why are you wasting your time

610
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,900
lamenting here?

611
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,260
Have you fed the chickens?

612
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,750
Have you washed the dishes?

613
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,860
You promised to help me earn 200 taels of silver

614
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,310
to save my hometown friend.

615
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,770
Have you earned the money?

616
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,560
This is not the time

617
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,020
to talk to me about that.

618
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,910
Ye'er?

619
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,010
Why are you here?

620
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,910
How is Aunt Zhang?

621
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,180
Don't worry. She's fine.

622
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,260
That's good.

623
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,870
That's good.

624
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,660
Ye'er.

625
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,230
Do you have something to say?

626
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,220
No, I don't.

627
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,710
Is your mother

628
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,910
usually so careless?

629
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,710
Of course not.

630
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,980
I know what you're thinking.

631
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,710
But before Mother fell asleep just now,

632
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,840
I already asked her.

633
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,140
She said

634
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,380
that she did fall down accidentally

635
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,290
by herself.

636
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,870
Something is out of the ordinary.

637
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,130
Something must be off.

638
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,460
Are you going to the fields?

639
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,800
Be careful.

640
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,460
Okay.

641
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Aunt Zhang, what's wrong?

642
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,700
How did you fall?

643
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,660
What hit you?

644
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,140
Youheng, you're smart.

645
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,990
Why are you here?

646
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,670
When I was treating Aunt Zhang,

647
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,410
I accidentally found some scratches

648
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,610
on her belly.

649
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,740
It looks like they were left behind

650
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,470
after hitting something hard.

651
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,780
But I heard from Man'er's father that

652
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,380
Aunt Zhang

653
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,900
did fall in the fields.

654
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,469
When the farmers cultivate their fields,

655
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,520
they would never leave behind

656
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,719
such an obvious rock.

657
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,909
Maybe someone

658
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,780
did it on purpose?

659
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,980
I was suspicious last night,

660
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,389
but I didn't dare to make any assumptions.

661
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,290
Right now, seeing this rope,

662
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,989
I could guess the situation.

663
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,460
This rope

664
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,480
must have been used by the assailant

665
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,780
to trip Aunt Zhang

666
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,520
and thrown here after.

667
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,060
Youheng.

668
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,110
It's a pity that you're not going to the government

669
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,969
to solve cases.

670
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,400
What about you?

671
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,239
You didn't see Aunt Zhang's injury.

672
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,170
Why are you here?

673
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,030
Although I didn't see the injury,

674
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,540
judging from people's intentions,

675
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,870
I could see the details.

676
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,110
A few days ago,

677
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,080
Mr. Lian

678
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,170
wanted his eldest son

679
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,430
to adopt Aunt's child.

680
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,320
As soon as it was mentioned,

681
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,160
Aunt fell and had a miscarriage.

682
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,950
There is no such coincidence in this world.

683
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,600
Even though the Lian family

684
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,800
seem to be affectionate on the surface,

685
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,620
they each have their own intentions.

686
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,040
This time, I'm here to find out

687
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,590
who did it.

688
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,450
You already know

689
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,460
who did it.

690
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,880
This rope is not enough evidence.

691
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,320
There is someone

692
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,820
who can confirm my thoughts.

693
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,140
Ye'er.

694
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,540
Man'er.

695
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,910
Sit down.

696
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,870
Come, sit.

697
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,710
Every day,

698
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,730
we only eat millet and steamed bun.

699
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,300
I don't have a drop of oil in my stomach.

700
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,730
You also want to eat something good too, right?

701
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,090
Here.

702
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,030
This

703
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,330
is the egg I just fried.

704
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,890
Isn't this egg from Grandpa

705
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,470
for your mother?

706
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,200
How can you give it to me?

707
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,320
This is from my mother.

708
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,270
It's not from me.

709
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,460
She said

710
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,270
that in our family, you work the most

711
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,210
and are the most exhausted.

712
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,210
She told me that I must give it to you.

713
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,590
Eat up.

714
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,460
Later, when Grandma and the others come to the kitchen

715
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,660
to cook and notice it,

716
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,390
you won't be able to eat it.

717
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,840
I didn't expect

718
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,910
my mother to care for you so much.

719
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,640
It seems

720
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,510
that you're just distant on the surface,

721
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,250
but in private,

722
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,710
you're very close, right?

723
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,070
You have no idea

724
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,520
that when my mother gave birth to me

725
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,120
and found out that I was a girl.

726
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,180
she didn't like me.

727
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,100
My father didn't like me either.

728
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,790
So he sent me

729
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,970
to Aunt Zhang.

730
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:02,950
When I was young,

731
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,150
Aunt Zhang raised me.

732
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,010
You were not born yet then.

733
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,930
Aunt Zhang adored kids a lot.

734
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,560
But she lost

735
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,860
her own child.

736
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,950
Aunt Zhang must be very sad.

737
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,110
Yes.

738
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,300
All day,

739
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,480
she's just in a daze in bed.

740
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,660
Her daze lasts an entire day.

741
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,150
She kept reciting Eight's name.

742
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,030
My mother's physical injuries

743
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,430
are recovering quickly.

744
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,640
But I don't know

745
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,390
how long it'll take for her emotional pain to heal.

746
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,410
Besides,

747
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,880
her miscarriage wasn't an accident.

748
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,420
Right?

749
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,480
I don't know.

750
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,990
Ye'er.

751
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,330
You know about this?

752
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:23,860
I...

753
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,710
Man'er, I really don't know.

754
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,310
You said my mother was the best to you.

755
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,440
She thought

756
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,190
her miscarriage was her fault.

757
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,380
Every day, she can't eat

758
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,100
nor sleep.

759
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,430
Why won't you tell the truth?

760
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,710
Why can't you

761
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,280
make my mother feel better?

762
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,150
It's not me.

763
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,640
It's not that I don't want to tell you,

764
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,790
but that I can't.

765
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,950
Why not?

766
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,770
Is someone threatening you?

767
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,980
Don't force me.

768
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,780
You can't tell

769
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,720
because this rope is yours.

770
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,340
Man'er.

771
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,350
This rope

772
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,620
was found

773
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,790
at the area where your mother tripped.

774
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,940
Your mother was tripped

775
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,670
by this rope.

776
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,430
Isn't this

777
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,750
the rope you often use?

778
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,150
In our household, you're the only one

779
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,410
who goes up the mountain to get firewood.

780
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,620
Man'er.

781
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,380
The rope is mine.

782
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,710
But it really wasn't me.

783
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,060
I didn't say you did it.

784
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,470
The person who did it

785
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,500
is not smart.

786
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,380
When they tripped Aunt on the fields,

787
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,140
they used too much strength

788
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,270
and hurt their hand.

789
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,680
That's why there is blood

790
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,970
on one side of the rope.

791
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,530
But look at Ye'er.

792
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,630
There is no wound on her hand.

793
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,420
Someone must have

794
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,750
took the rope on purpose

795
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,590
so that they could frame her

796
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,370
when things come to light.

797
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,210
Right now, in the Lian family,

798
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,930
whoever has a wound on the hand

799
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,040
is the culprit.

800
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,580
It should be easy to find out.

801
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,890
When Aunt fell that dy,

802
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,890
you witnessed it with your own eyes.

803
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,460
So when you came over that day,

804
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:16,980
you were hesitant about

805
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,780
whether to tell the truth or not.

806
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,260
Should I say her name

807
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,740
or do you want to do it?

808
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,020
What?

809
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,620
These days,

810
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,980
you've been lying in bed

811
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,020
and turning and tossing like a pancake.

812
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,550
Such a big thing happened in this family

813
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,210
because...

814
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,820
That's not right.

815
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,160
I know how capable

816
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,590
my daughter is.

817
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,390
You wouldn't dare

818
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,180
to do such a thing.

819
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,190
Right?

820
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,990
Is Lian Hua'er messing with you?

821
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,380
I didn't say anything.

822
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,650
You said it yourself.

823
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,610
At this time,

824
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,100
why are you still protecting her?

825
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,820
You're just like your mother.

826
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,280
You have a one-track mind.

827
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,950
Lian Hua'er,

828
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,460
that wrench,

829
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,670
actually dared to use you as canon fodder.

830
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,950
It's all Lian Man'er's fault.

831
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,780
She bullies me all the time.

832
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,020
Hua'er just wanted to help me,

833
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,670
so she asked me along to mess with Zhang.

834
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,040
So that Lian Man'er

835
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,260
would be infuriated.

836
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,860
But who knew

837
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,600
that a trip

838
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,960
would result in such a severe fall.

839
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,430
You dim-witted girl.

840
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,740
Lian Hua'er is just using you as a scapegoat.

841
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,900
What good intention can she have?

842
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,090
Then what should I do now?

843
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,150
If Shouxin and Father find out,

844
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,160
will I be able to live?

845
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,060
Stop crying.

846
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,660
What's the use of crying?

847
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,750
She's really

848
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,830
cunning.

849
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,400
You must be careful of Lian Hua'er.
