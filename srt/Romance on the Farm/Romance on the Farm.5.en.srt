4
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,830
No matter why

5
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,710
you're staying by Man'er's side,

6
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,430
leave as soon as you're done.

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,479
What if I don't leave?

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,900
I won't let you

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,570
hurt her.

10
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,380
I'm just kidding.

11
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,920
Why are you so nervous?

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,010
Miss Xiu'er.

13
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,970
Wang Er,

14
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,220
Miss Xiu'er

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,370
doesn't like you.

16
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,220
She wants to marry a rich man in town,

17
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,820
just like Lian Hua'er.

18
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,510
You

19
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,190
should stop dreaming

20
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,470
and being delusional.

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,450
I'm glad you know.

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,340
But unfortunately,

23
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,800
the men that Xiu'er likes

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,030
don't like her back.

25
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,480
All she can do

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,579
is run into town every day

27
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,670
to look for a man.

28
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,710
What nonsense are you spouting?

29
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,510
You know

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,210
whether it's nonsense or not.

31
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,340
This is what Young Master Li

32
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,840
from Tongfu Inn

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
personally told my brother.

34
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,180
She

35
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,980
really went to Young Master Li's home

36
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,940
to wait for him.

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,710
The man didn't even glance at her.

38
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,600
It turns out that she looks noble,

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,070
but deep down, she's lowly.

40
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,350
She even says that Lian Man'er

41
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,430
is shameless and can't get married.

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,680
Look at how many men

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,960
are around Lian Man'er

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,500
and then look at yourself.

45
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,690
Honestly,

46
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,800
they're born from the same genes,

47
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,820
but why is that one

48
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,790
so beautiful and cute,

49
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,450
while our Xiu'er...

50
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,000
Looks all crooked?

51
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,710
Looks crooked!

52
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,270
Just you wait and see.

53
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,210
We'll wait.

54
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,110
Is she angry?

55
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,580
She fell down.

56
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,780
Xiu'er, here.

57
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,890
Go away. It's none of your business.

58
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,980
Go away!

59
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,380
The moon ritual begins.

60
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,829
The moon is bright tonight.

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,270
The night breeze is cool.

62
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,540
The spirit of the moon

63
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,020
is bright and clear.

64
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,500
Catch the wind,

65
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,640
filling the sky.

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,240
The stars dazzle,

67
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,450
making the world dull in comparison.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,510
The moon toad is pure

69
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,470
and the spiritual osthmanus is fragrant.

70
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,320
The moon is bright as a mirror,

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,300
cold as ice.

72
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,980
The lights at this moment

73
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,510
are lit in all households.

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,070
A ritual of a millennium,

75
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,630
challenges of ten thousand years.

76
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,260
Sincerely pay homage

77
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,540
to thank the heavens.

78
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,060
Bow to the moon.

79
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,020
Bow.

80
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,780
Rise.

81
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,900
Bow.

82
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,220
Rise.

83
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,640
Pray.

84
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,110
The events in this village

85
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,440
are quite interesting.

86
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,180
Thank you.

87
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,340
I said thank you. already

88
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,060
Come and help.

89
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,940
Is it okay now?

90
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,700
Hey,

91
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:54,770
you eat so much,

92
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,480
but you don't do any work.

93
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,890
So what if you carry some more?

94
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,890
Would it kill you?

95
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,340
Share these fruits

96
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,470
among the children.

97
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,230
Go,

98
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,760
ask Grandma for the fruits.

99
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,240
Here.

100
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,220
Put these mat away.

101
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,870
Put them away.

102
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
You're such a glutton.

103
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,860
Mother.

104
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,350
Mother, well...

105
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,140
Jizu didn't come back,

106
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,570
but we still need the things.

107
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,460
Can the food last the night

108
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,550
if it's put in your room?

109
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,010
Give me a pomegranate too.

110
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,130
Thank you, Mother.

111
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,900
Seven.

112
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,560
Mother.

113
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,300
You are seriously a glutton!

114
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,310
Look how round the moon is today.

115
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,670
Mother.

116
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,990
Thank you, Mother.

117
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,580
Thank you, Grandma.

118
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,710
Thank your Grandma.

119
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,010
Thank you, Mother.

120
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,560
Thank you, Grandma.

121
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,950
Thank you, Grandma.

122
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,280
Such a glutton.

123
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,230
Mother.

124
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,660
I guess your grandma

125
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,360
is still angry about what happened last time.

126
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,510
If she's angry, she can vent it out.

127
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,340
It's just a few crappy tangerines

128
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,660
and rotten pomegranates.

129
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,340
Who is she showing that attitude towards?

130
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
That's how she is.

131
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,440
Let's go back.

132
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,400
Mother, you go back first.

133
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,870
Xiu'er.

134
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,309
What's wrong?

135
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,860
It's all because of Lian Man'er.

136
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,640
She danced with so many men

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,820
during the group dance.

138
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,820
She's so popular!

139
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,700
She's just a lowly girl.

140
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,070
How dare she laugh at me?

141
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,370
She made fun of me!

142
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,520
If I get the chance,

143
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
I'll definitely teach her a lesson.

144
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,600
Listen, Xiu'er.

145
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,230
Come here.

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,860
Are you telling the truth?

147
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,250
Isn't it sweet?

148
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,420
If you swallow the seeds,

149
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,950
it'll sprout in your tummy.

150
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Spit the seed out.

151
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,400
Spit it out.

152
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,380
Grandma.

153
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,050
Mother.

154
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,270
How come you're here?

155
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,270
Xiu'er.

156
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,480
Grandma.

157
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,990
Grandma?

158
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,940
Mother, what are you doing?

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,920
Grandma, what are you looking for?

160
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,090
Mother.

161
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,810
What are you doing, Mother?

162
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,380
Grandma!

163
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,580
What happened?

164
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,330
What are you doing, Mother?

165
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,420
Grandma, what are you doing?

166
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,950
Grandma.

167
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:44,890
Mother.

168
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,700
How can you take people's money?

169
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,900
The money you earn should be given to me.

170
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,780
Our family hasn't split up yet,

171
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,410
but you're already hiding money.

172
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,260
How dare you!

173
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,500
Then, let's split up.

174
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,570
I won't give you a penny

175
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,770
of the money I earned.

176
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,940
What a bastard!

177
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,150
You want to split up?

178
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,060
Fine.

179
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,340
Kill me and your grandpa.

180
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,580
Look.

181
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,160
Look at your good daughter.

182
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Mother, calm down.

183
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,320
Man'er,

184
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,190
you can't talk to your grandma like that.

185
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,520
Please forgive Man'er.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,940
Mother, calm down.

187
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,970
She is still a child.

188
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,300
Don’t mind her.
Go away!

189
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:18,990
Mother.

190
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,580
My wife.

191
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,820
Mother.

192
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,740
My wife.

193
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,630
Mother, are you okay?

194
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,100
Mother, are you okay?

195
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,590
I'm fine.

196
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,450
Mother, are you okay?

197
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,710
I'm fine.

198
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,970
Go ahead.

199
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,230
Come, sit here.

200
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,190
Give me back my money pouch.

201
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,930
What are you doing?

202
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,590
You're going to hurt your aunt.

203
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,580
Return my money pouch.

204
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,460
No one can leave.

205
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,170
Let go!

206
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,680
Let go, Man'er.

207
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,460
Let go!

208
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,080
Let go!

209
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,560
Man'er.

210
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,710
My daughter and I

211
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,990
have no way to survive anymore.

212
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,720
How could you raise such a girl?

213
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,680
-Man'er.
-I can't live anymore.

214
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,190
What are you doing?

215
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,560
You're so unforgiving.

216
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,850
I'm unforgiving?

217
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,490
They took away

218
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,460
my hard-earned money.

219
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,860
You say I'm unforgiving?

220
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,120
She's like a robber.

221
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,710
How could you say that about your grandma?

222
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,700
We are family.

223
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,070
It's only natural

224
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,440
to give the money to her.

225
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,110
Seven,

226
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,050
who told Grandma

227
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,580
that I have money in my room?

228
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,580
It's Xiu'er.

229
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,980
She told Grandma

230
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,980
in the main room.

231
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,580
Man'er, you...

232
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,300
What are you doing?

233
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,670
Talk to your grandparents

234
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,410
if you need anything.

235
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,180
Don't come over.

236
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,980
If you come any closer,

237
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,040
I'll call for help.

238
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,740
I thought

239
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,830
you'd be fearless.

240
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,220
I didn't expect you to be afraid.

241
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,460
I'm here to tell you

242
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,170
that I admit defeat this time,

243
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,160
but if you try anything

244
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,930
behind my back again,

245
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,000
I won't hold back anymore.

246
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,350
Man'er,

247
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,590
what are you talking about?

248
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,810
How come I don't understand?

249
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,910
Xiu'er doesn't like me,

250
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,930
but she's not that cunning

251
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,170
to keep her eyes on me and think of harming me every day.

252
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,270
In this family,

253
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,610
only you, Hua'er,

254
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,030
can come up with such a horrible idea

255
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,970
and even encourage Xiu'er

256
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,170
to tattle to Grandma.

257
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,740
Xiu'er isn't that smart

258
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,980
and Grandma is obsessed with money.

259
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,710
My father is honest and filial,

260
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,820
so he naturally wouldn't protect me.

261
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,350
Hua'er,

262
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,420
you played these cards well.

263
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,180
It's such a waste

264
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,160
of your talents

265
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,190
to use them

266
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,680
on these trivial matters.

267
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,480
When you go to the Song family,

268
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,180
you'll definitely accomplish great things.

269
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,700
Man'er,

270
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,950
you misunderstood.

271
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,300
I've never mentioned

272
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,760
the money pouch to Xiu'er.

273
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,110
It's all Grandma.

274
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,140
She's paranoid,

275
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,100
so she had Xiu'er keep an eye on you.

276
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,710
Hua'er,

277
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,260
I said so much just now,

278
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,840
but did I mention the money pouch?

279
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,910
You did this on purpose?

280
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,870
I wasn't entirely sure

281
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,220
when I came here,

282
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,990
but now, it seems

283
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,270
that it's you.

284
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,900
Don't pretend

285
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,360
in front of me anymore.

286
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,370
Don't worry. I won't hit you.

287
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,740
Karma

288
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,380
will hit you for me.

289
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,460
Well, you're quite carefree.

290
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,500
Why don't you ask me what's wrong?

291
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,430
I know you'll tell me if you want to.

292
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,060
Your lovely Grandma Lian

293
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,660
took all the money we earned.

294
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,390
If I had known,

295
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,230
I wouldn't have

296
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,690
given all the money to you.

297
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,240
You're still smiling?

298
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,340
That's our

299
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,400
hard-earned money

300
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,420
and an old woman

301
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,950
took it away just like that.

302
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,930
Most importantly,

303
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,930
my father still thinks it's fine.

304
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,520
What is the logic?

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,660
You grew up in the Lian family.

306
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,470
You should

307
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,400
be used to these things.

308
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,460
I really...

309
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,300
Let's stop talking about useless things.

310
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,520
Grandma likes you so much.

311
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,980
Can you

312
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,190
use your

313
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,700
sweet-talking skills

314
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,060
and get the money back for me?

315
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,070
I'm an outsider.

316
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,490
If I ask your Grandma Lian for money,

317
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,100
there's no way she'll give it to me

318
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,760
with how much she loves money.

319
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,230
Is there really no hope

320
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,980
to get the money back?

321
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,890
You learn from your mistakes.

322
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,890
It's better

323
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,300
for Grandma Lian to take the money now

324
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,500
than if she took it later

325
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,900
after we made more money.

326
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,110
Spending some money to buy a great lesson

327
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,110
is not a bad thing.

328
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,200
Am I right?

329
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,350
Right.

330
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Why do I feel like I actually gained something?

331
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,990
Anyway, I thought about it.

332
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,390
In the long run,

333
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,700
we have only one way out.

334
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,240
Split from the family.

335
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,220
Only after we split up

336
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,460
can every penny we earn

337
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,220
be mine...

338
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,640
Ours.

339
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,280
That's easy for you to say.

340
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,230
Not only will your grandparents disagree,

341
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,070
but your parents also

342
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,870
won't agree.

343
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,110
We still have to.

344
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,740
I finally get it now.

345
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,750
My parents are not stupid.

346
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,200
They are always bullied

347
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,580
because they are too soft-hearted

348
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,780
and too sentimental.

349
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,820
They are always blinded by familial love,

350
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,580
but they don't know

351
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,230
that some people

352
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,560
don't have familial love in their hearts.

353
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,030
Have you decided how to split up?

354
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,940
Have you decided?

355
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,420
Me?

356
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,870
I'm an outsider.

357
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,690
You are my family.

358
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,580
I won't interfere with your family affairs.

359
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,460
It's getting late.

360
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,120
Go back to your room and sleep.

361
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,150
Hey.

362
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,700
You're so smart.

363
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,850
Just think a little!

364
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,550
Shen Nuo!

365
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,599
Shen Nuo.

366
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,619
Brother Shen Nuo.

367
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,619
Shen Nuo.

368
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,150
Think a little.

369
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,300
How long will it take

370
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,260
to reap the rice by hand?

371
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,350
The entire family is working

372
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,920
and so many eyes are watching.

373
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,850
Don't slack off.

374
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,360
Could it be...

375
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,460
Is it that obvious?

376
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,400
Aren't you a farmer from the Shen Village?

377
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,460
You had so much land

378
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,430
and you don't even know how to reap rice?

379
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,470
Let me teach you.

380
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,830
Grab a handful

381
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,870
and cut it off around five fingers' width

382
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,800
from the ground.

383
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,950
Be careful not to hurt your hand.

384
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,980
Your hands are big.

385
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,070
It's fine to grab more at a time.

386
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,540
Look.

387
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,440
Easy, right?

388
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,910
Mother,

389
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,180
how can you be so careless?

390
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,190
You almost fell.

391
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,810
Be careful of the baby.

392
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,760
What did you say?

393
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,060
I said

394
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,880
be careful of the baby.

395
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,670
Zhang,

396
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,310
stop reaping.

397
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,140
Go to the irrigation ridge

398
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,820
and tie up the rice.

399
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,830
Go ahead.

400
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
I guess you're smart.

401
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,790
Shouren,

402
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,260
about what I mentioned

403
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,220
a few days ago,

404
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,400
have you decided?

405
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,390
I'll do as you say.

406
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,500
I think it's good.

407
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,140
Is your wife willing too?

408
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,230
Of course.

409
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,490
I'll tell the family

410
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,290
after we finish harvesting the rice.

411
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,690
Lian Fang.

412
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,840
Shouren is a scholar now,

413
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,110
but he still comes back to work every year?

414
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,740
I told him already.

415
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,190
I told him he doesn't need to come.

416
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,700
He should study hard at home,

417
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,710
but he didn't listen.

418
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,280
He insisted on coming to labor here.

419
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,740
Father.

420
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,870
If one is not filial toward their family,

421
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,980
one would be nothing.

422
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,910
This is my duty.

423
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,900
My son is filial.

424
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,970
Great.

425
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,950
What's so tiring

426
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,790
about the little work he's done?

427
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,960
You're already late

428
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,960
and you still have time to chat?

429
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:37,710
Hurry up.

430
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,320
Go work on your own land.

431
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,700
Going to work?

432
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,670
Yes, work.

433
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,890
I don't see any filial piety.

434
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,150
He just pulls his son out

435
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,950
to put on an act

436
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,580
and make everyone in the village is jealous.

437
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,440
Later,

438
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,040
that useless guy

439
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,230
will definitely start complaining.

440
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,790
What's wrong?

441
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,390
What's wrong, Shouren?

442
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,710
I sprained my ankle.

443
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,410
I sprained my ankle.

444
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,270
Have a seat.

445
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,290
Let me take a look.

446
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:09,900
No need.

447
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,150
Father, I'm okay.

448
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,610
Go to the cooling shed and rest.

449
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,350
When the wagon comes

450
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,460
to transport the rice,

451
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,410
you can go home with it.

452
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,130
You don't have to come tomorrow.

453
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,190
-No, no.
-Go ahead.

454
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,550
Father, I can do it.

455
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,070
Go rest.

456
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,140
Father, I'm fine.

457
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,760
Shouren.

458
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,510
Shouren,

459
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,250
just do as Father says.

460
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,090
Shouyi and I

461
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,570
can take care of the field.

462
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,050
Go.

463
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,950
Look at this.

464
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,950
I'm sorry.

465
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm sorry.

466
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm counting on you two.

467
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,050
Be careful.

468
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,420
Be careful, Shouren.

469
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,190
Another limping man at home.

470
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,720
What's wrong? Are you limping too?

471
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,510
What's wrong, Father?

472
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,600
My goodness.

473
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,760
Shouyi.

474
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,410
Father!

475
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,030
Father, look at him.

476
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,180
If you're still breathing, then you can work.

477
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,310
We must finish reaping these few days.

478
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,570
Otherwise, if they're completely ripe and the wind blows,

479
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,120
they'll drop to the ground.

480
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,610
Will you two pick up the grains?

481
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,010
How come Shouren can rest

482
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,880
after he sprains his ankle?

483
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,760
Yes, look.

484
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,440
Can you compare with Shouren?

485
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,150
Shouren

486
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,580
is a scholar.

487
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,400
You are lazy and gluttonous.

488
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,010
If I let you go,

489
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,440
you'll be like before

490
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,230
and go to the casino

491
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,330
and lose my money.

492
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,240
What are you talking about?

493
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,200
I'll get to work.

494
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,020
-You sprained your ankle too?
-Mother.

495
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,670
No.

496
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,580
Oh no!

497
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,640
Father.

498
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,250
What's wrong with you now?

499
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,000
I need to go home to the toilet.

500
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,330
Mother.

501
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,540
How about I

502
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,240
find a place for you?

503
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,040
Go away.

504
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,520
Hurry.

505
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,550
The lazy ones are always full of excuses.

506
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,850
Your family really makes the capable ones work harder.

507
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,270
How come

508
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,740
so many seeds are moldy?

509
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,430
They're back.

510
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,220
Father.

511
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,470
Take it slowly.

512
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:21,910
Hua'er,

513
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,810
help me back to my room.

514
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,450
Father, what happened?

515
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,600
I sprained my ankle.

516
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,990
The harvest is great this year.

517
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,180
What are you doing?

518
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,110
Go away if you're not going to work.

519
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,170
You might get hurt.

520
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,250
You...

521
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
Xiu'er,

522
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,660
Man'er didn't do it on purpose.

523
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,580
Don't be angry.

524
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,550
It's too sunny out.

525
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,130
Hurry,

526
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,040
go on inside.

527
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,270
Xiu'er.

528
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,220
Xiu'er,

529
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,870
you're not eating sunflower seeds anymore?

530
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,670
Of course not.

531
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,270
Look at Lian Man'er.

532
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,930
She did it on purpose just now.

533
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,040
Man'er doesn't respect you

534
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,000
at all.

535
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,220
A few days ago,

536
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,750
when Mother took her money,

537
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:13,890
she even grabbed my hair,

538
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,940
but I didn't give her a hard time.

539
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,740
But look at her.

540
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,600
She's giving me trouble instead.

541
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,420
Xiu'er,

542
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,330
you don't provoke her,

543
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,060
but that doesn't stop her

544
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,460
from giving you trouble.

545
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,870
Your personality is too gentle.

546
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,510
If you go on like this,

547
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,040
you'll be bossed around

548
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,920
by these juniors sooner or later.

549
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,790
Yes.

550
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,860
Kind people are always bullied,

551
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,870
but if Man'er does this to me,

552
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,800
what should I do?

553
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,900
Xiu'er,

554
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,110
you are too soft-hearted.

555
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,500
How about

556
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,280
we think of another way

557
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,050
to teach her a lesson?

558
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,230
But...

559
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,540
We are family, after all.

560
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,140
If I go overboard

561
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,180
and have a huge conflict with Man'er,

562
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,040
Father will definitely scold me.

563
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,660
Yes, you're right.

564
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,590
After all, we are family.

565
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,830
I'll take care of them. Be careful.

566
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,030
Please show mercy.

567
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,270
I

568
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,960
have a gift for you.

569
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
Please accept it.

570
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,150
Please do us a favor.

571
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,520
In the past,

572
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,140
these taels of silver could satisfy me,

573
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,700
but today,

574
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,550
I brought a lot of men along.

575
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,970
Even if I want to let the goods go,

576
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,910
my men won't agree.

577
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,910
You're breaking

578
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,170
the rules of the trade.

579
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:42,910
Rules?

580
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,180
I make the rules.

581
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,190
Go!

582
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,710
This...

583
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,300
Go! Go!

584
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,830
Stop! Stop!

585
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,140
You are...

586
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,450
Do you know

587
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,230
whose goods you're robbing?

588
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,640
It belongs to the Song family.

589
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,770
The Song family is the one I'm robbing.

590
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,590
Tell me your name if you dare.

591
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,100
You want a name?

592
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,230
Bandits robbed the Song family's goods?

593
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,030
That's right.

594
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,960
I didn't expect someone

595
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,020
would beat us to it.

596
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,990
Who were they?

597
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,450
Young Master, did you discover anything?

598
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,630
I followed them all the way

599
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,470
to a fork road.

600
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,470
They tied branches behind the carriages

601
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,070
to wipe their tracks along the way,

602
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,080
so I lost them.

603
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,990
But judging from

604
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,940
their actions,

605
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,020
they're not an ordinary bunch.

606
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,880
It sounded like

607
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,730
they were targeting the Song family.

608
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,860
It turns out that someone

609
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,060
has long been watching the Song family.

610
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,030
The Song family

611
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,730
is one of the wealthiest families

612
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,630
in the area.

613
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,850
It's not surprising they're targeted by others.

614
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,940
Just like us,

615
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,540
we're not content with the small fries

616
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,140
and want a bigger one, right?

617
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,480
Someone intercepted it this time,

618
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,720
but we finally have some clues.

619
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,880
The Song family's goods

620
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,460
are the same as Sun Li's.

621
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,610
It's also salt.

622
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,800
It's indeed valuable.

623
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,620
The restaurant owner

624
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,820
that we got our eyes on

625
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,060
is indeed a downline of the Song family.

626
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,830
Now that the Song family was robbed,

627
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,660
I don't think they'll deliver goods

628
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,840
for the time being.

629
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,470
Don't worry, Young Master.

630
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,190
Changsui of the Song family

631
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,700
often comes to watch operas lately.

632
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,230
I will continue

633
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,830
inquiring for information.

634
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,350
What?

635
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,810
Is something wrong?

636
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,920
I feel like

637
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,740
I've seen those bandits before.

638
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,990
I can't bother with them now.

639
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,990
As usual, if there is any news,

640
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,300
tie a red cloth in front of Carters' Inn.

641
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
I'll meet up with you

642
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,880
after I see it.

643
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,390
Well,

644
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,540
the government

645
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,780
may be quiet lately,

646
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,900
but they definitely won't let you go.

647
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,710
Young Master, you need to be more careful.

648
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,760
You should also be more careful

649
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,620
when hiding with the Lian family.

650
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,900
It's the autumn harvest now.

651
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,450
The Lian family needs my help

652
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,650
and I'm happy to help.

653
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,950
Don't worry.

654
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,070
They won't suspect anything.

655
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,500
Okay.

656
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:07,780
Shouxin,

657
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,190
take the rice

658
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,150
you cut today

659
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,330
and tie them up.

660
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,090
Tonight,

661
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,910
we'll transport them together.

662
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,200
Grandpa.

663
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,510
You've never worked before, right?

664
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,830
Yes.

665
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,040
The work isn't as easy

666
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,510
as it seems.

667
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,710
My hands are all injured.

668
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,490
You could tell

669
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,370
right away.

670
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,080
It's not about your injuries.

671
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,260
Everyone who works in the fields

672
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,860
gets hurt sometimes.

673
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,070
It's normal.

674
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,970
But as long as they've worked

675
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,220
in the fields before,

676
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,900
they know how precious the rice is.

677
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,530
They're not as heavy-handed as you.

678
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,980
Look at the grains.

679
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,590
They're all over the floor.

680
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,910
Take a rest.

681
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,750
You've been with our family

682
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,620
for some time now.

683
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,470
Qingshan County suffered a disaster

684
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,550
and your aunt took you in,

685
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,980
but

686
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,440
men should have their own households.

687
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,950
It's not a long-term solution

688
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,570
for you to stay here.

689
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,610
What's your plan?

690
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,470
My plan

691
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,370
is to help you all with the harvest.

692
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,240
Then I'll find a job in town.

693
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,700
Grandpa,

694
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,810
I think the harvest is quite good this year.

695
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,260
Can we take the leftover grains to town

696
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,120
and exchange them for livestock?

697
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,550
How can you

698
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,150
be so naive?

699
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,420
I'm ignorant.

700
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,990
Please enlighten me.

701
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,120
For farmers,

702
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,620
everything from farm tools

703
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,390
and our straw shoes

704
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,680
to every acre of farmland

705
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,810
and every head of livestock,

706
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,520
tell me

707
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,350
which one we don't pay taxes for.

708
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,350
Besides, farmers are divided into five classes now.

709
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,960
The more you have,

710
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,870
the more taxes you pay.

711
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,370
Who dares to add livestock?

712
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,760
We just

713
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,110
manage to scrape by.

714
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,220
But I heard

715
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,090
there are many wars at the border.

716
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,520
The government set such a large tax,

717
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,920
but it's only temporary.

718
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,730
His Majesty

719
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,980
divided farmers into five classes

720
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,640
to collect taxes more fairly.

721
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,680
That's none of my business.

722
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,380
I only see

723
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,710
that the right to determine the classes

724
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,910
are all in the hands of local officials.

725
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,200
These years,

726
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,390
the local officials

727
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,210
colluded with rich businessmen

728
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,710
to steal the farmers' fields.

729
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,930
They stole them and called them the government's fields,

730
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,120
while official salt turned into private salt.

731
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,360
The common people

732
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,480
can't survive any longer.

733
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:05,910
Shouxin.

734
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,430
Shouxin,

735
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:08,889
go home

736
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,239
and get some water.

737
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:15,830
Father,

738
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,199
Shouxin reaps the rice so quickly.

739
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,770
We need him

740
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,860
in the fields.

741
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:20,639
I'll go.

742
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,270
Father,

743
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,550
I run fast. I'll go.

744
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,780
Wait, you...

745
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:28,659
We're a few miles away

746
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,530
from home.

747
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,070
The journey is so tiring.

748
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,469
I'll go. You stay.

749
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,290
My incompetence makes my wife suffer.

750
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,340
I can't let you do that.

751
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,830
I'll go.

752
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:36,650
You...

753
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,909
Let go! Let go!

754
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,370
I'll go.

755
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,440
You went to the toilet so many times already.

756
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,840
-I’ll go.
-Stop arguing.

757
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,489
You go.

758
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,320
Fine.

759
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,380
Here.

760
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,900
Go do what?

761
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,040
Come, Xiu'er.

762
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,280
It's not hot anymore.

763
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,990
Eat slowly.

764
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,910
Why are you back?

765
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,170
Grandpa asked me to get some water.

766
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,720
Grandma,

767
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:43,960
our lunch

768
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,880
is so delicious.

769
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,140
We even have meat pies?

770
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,390
You wish.

771
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,900
These meat pies were made for

772
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,700
me and Shouren.

773
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,360
Not for you.

774
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,120
Man'er has been laboring for days.

775
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,810
She has worked hard.

776
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,550
What's so hard for her?

777
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,400
She's used to

778
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,760
running out all day.

779
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,980
Uncle Shouren

780
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,850
sprained his ankle while reaping rice

781
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,640
and wanted to eat these meat pies.

782
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,550
Stop being a glutton

783
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,600
and thinking about food.

784
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,480
Don't say a word

785
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,580
about the pies

786
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,200
when you reach the fields.

787
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,300
Look at yourself.

788
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,680
Do you look like someone who deserves meat pies?

789
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,150
What are you looking at?

790
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,660
Nothing.

791
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,270
I'm just looking

792
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,300
at the meat pie in Xiu'er's hands

793
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,430
and getting hungry.

794
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,680
Can I have a bite?

795
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,570
I can't keep my mouth shut.

796
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:35,980
Mother,

797
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,070
look at her.

798
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,030
You brat!

799
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,110
You brat!

800
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:39,970
Grandma,

801
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,420
don't be angry.

802
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,350
I'll talk to her.

803
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,660
Man'er,

804
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,900
my father

805
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,150
has never worked in the fields before.

806
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,220
He fell and sprained his ankle.

807
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,270
He just wants to eat something nice.

808
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,080
Grandma only made

809
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,940
a few pies.

810
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,020
Take this one.

811
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,470
Eat it while it's hot.

812
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,180
After that,

813
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,540
go back to the fieds.

814
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,950
If you eat it, you can't tell anyone,

815
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,910
or else I'll tear your mouth apart.

816
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,770
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

817
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,440
If I do,

818
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,930
I'll choke to death when drinking water

819
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,020
and get struck by lightning.

820
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,780
If I walk out,

821
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,730
I'll get run over

822
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,630
by the cart drawn by four horses in the village

823
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,230
and become unrecognizable.

824
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,620
Where did you get

825
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,590
this meat pie?

826
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,250
I can't tell you.

827
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:45,910
Say it.

828
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,730
I'll protect you.

829
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,430
After I got the water at home,

830
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,530
I saw that Grandma,

831
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,750
Hua'er,

832
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,610
and Xiu'er

833
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,900
made a pot of meat pies.

834
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,260
I thought

835
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,060
that it's obviously

836
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,590
for the whole family to eat,

837
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,450
but Xiu'er said she won't give me any.

838
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,240
My goodness.

839
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,930
Hua'er

840
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,980
was afraid that I'll tell you all

841
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,110
about the meat pies,

842
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,560
so she finally gave me one,

843
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,890
but how can I eat it?

844
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:18,900
Even though

845
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,300
I only have one pie,

846
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,770
I must give it to Grandpa.

847
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,480
Yes.

848
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,540
Grandpa is the most hardworking person in the family,

849
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,440
but Grandpa,

850
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,780
I can't figure it out.

851
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,950
Shouldn't a family

852
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,190
shoulder all the troubles

853
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,120
and share the happiness together?

854
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,700
Have we already split up?

855
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,670
Who said that?

856
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,530
Why is life

857
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,790
so unfair right now?

858
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,050
Shouyi,

859
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,310
tell your mother

860
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,970
we'll have meat pies tonight.

861
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:45,970
Come back.

862
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,340
Father, you should be the one to say it.

863
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,140
If I go,

864
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,490
Mother will kick me out.

865
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,200
I'll go.

866
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,680
We'll all have meat pies tonight.

867
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:54,970
Yes!

868
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,910
You can have your fill.

869
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,500
Yes!

870
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,890
Let's go.

871
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,040
Yes, have our fill.

872
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,260
Oh, my.

873
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,270
Thanks to Man'er,

874
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,290
I have meat pies to eat.

875
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,630
Aunt He,

876
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,790
you're wrong.

877
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,000
It's because of Grandpa

878
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,350
that we have pies to eat.

879
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,430
You're right.

880
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,830
Don't just sit there.

881
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,900
Eat.

882
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,760
It's just this one meal.

883
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,700
The flour and pork

884
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,760
cost half a month's money for food.

885
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,760
You don't know how to work.

886
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,110
You're just

887
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,010
a spendthrift.

888
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,060
Who are you talking about?

889
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,460
I don't work?

890
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,830
You're the only one who works?

891
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,950
Do you think

892
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,450
every meal the family eats

893
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,310
flies down from the sky

894
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,950
and I just enjoy life at home

895
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,950
like the empress?

896
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,260
Mother, don't be angry.

897
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,340
Look at this

898
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,990
big family.

899
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:28,810
Yes,

900
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,320
you're the one who got meat pies for everyone.

901
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,580
After making the pies,

902
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,190
you're also the one reproaching me.

903
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,990
I worry endlessly for this family,

904
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,310
bustling

905
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,260
day and night,

906
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,520
and in the end, I get insulted

907
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,510
by you old man.

908
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,140
You brat.

909
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,720
I told you to keep it a secret,

910
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,940
but you went to sow discord.

911
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,100
Did you feed your heart

912
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,430
to the dogs?

913
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,680
Who was the one that crossed her heart and hoped to die?

914
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,130
How dare you spill the secret after eating the meat pie?

915
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,580
Aren't you afraid that your vow will come true?

916
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,320
I didn't eat the pie.

917
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,010
What am I afraid of?

918
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,810
I'll still ask the heavens

919
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,980
to strike you with lightning

920
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,100
and run into you with a carriage!

921
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,980
Shut up!

922
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,410
Bastard!

923
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,570
How can a sister-in-law

924
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,460
wish death on her own niece?

925
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,440
How could you

926
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,720
be such a vicious girl?

927
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,620
It's all because your mother spoiled you.

928
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,180
Father,

929
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,030
it's all Lian Man'er's fault.

930
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,620
Look at her.

931
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,180
You're talking back to me?

932
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:27,990
I didn't.

933
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,570
How dare you hit her?

934
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,470
I won't let you off!

935
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,980
Look at me.

936
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
I'm going all out.

937
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,650
Mother.

938
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,330
Mother.

939
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:35,830
Go back.

940
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,890
Go back to your room.

941
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,100
Go back.

942
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,770
[Carters' Inn]

943
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,630
Go.

944
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,890
You can go.

945
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,290
This old one

946
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,920
is the Zhang's son.

947
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,310
He's very honest.

948
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,700
Why are the officials here?

949
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,060
Who knows?

950
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,760
Wait.

951
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,610
Go.

952
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,890
What's going on today?

953
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,380
Stop!

954
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,560
Where are you from?

955
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,910
[Wanted]

956
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,470
I'm from Shisanli Camp.

957
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,720
I often come to Shisanli Camp.

958
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,910
How come I've never seen you before?

959
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,110
My hometown is the Shen Village of Qingshan County.

960
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,620
There was a flood at the start of the year,

961
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,570
so I came down south

962
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,100
to seek refuge with my aunt.

963
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,660
Did you have a permit when coming south?

964
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,950
You must be joking.

965
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,460
The natural disaster came out of nowhere.

966
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,860
Even the officials fled.

967
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,720
How could I get a permit?

968
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,660
This young man

969
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,900
is indeed living with the Lian family.

970
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,280
There's nothing wrong.

971
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,840
The government is arresting bandits.

972
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,430
Not only does he look similar

973
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,730
to the one in the portrait,

974
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,740
but he also doesn't have

975
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,050
official documents.

976
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,060
If we let the wrong person go,

977
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,070
even we

978
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,150
can't escape the responsibility,

979
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,480
let alone you, Lizheng.

980
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,110
Youheng,

981
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,320
come here.

982
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,290
I saw you chatting

983
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,980
with this young man

984
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,100
during the group dance.

985
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,190
You must be familiar with him.

986
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,260
Tell us.

987
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,650
Is this young man

988
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,080
really the Lian family's nephew?

989
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,660
[Mission: 1,000 taels of gold]

990
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,660
[Income: 0]

991
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,660
[Expenses: Grandma confiscated the money, 22 taels 56 coins]
