[For sale]

5
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,620
The location of the store is crucial.

6
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,630
To the east of this store

7
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,470
is He Village,

8
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,780
and to the west is Shiyili Camp.

9
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,590
It's a prime location

10
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,050
with lots of foot traffic.

11
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,530
If you two

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,050
can buy this store,

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,500
no matter what business you do,

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,690
whether you open a jewelry store

15
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,700
or run an inn,

16
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,220
even if you just open a grocery store,

17
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,500
we'll be rolling in it.

18
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,410
With such a great location,

19
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,550
this store will be sold immediately

20
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,010
after it's put up for sale.

21
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,990
Besides,

22
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,229
on the whole street,

23
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,960
this is the only store for sale.

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,320
Its owner had to go back

25
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,270
to his hometown for something urgent,

26
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,110
or he wouldn't have

27
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,570
put this store up for sale.

28
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,190
The location is great.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,720
But now,

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,480
we're cash-strapped.

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,750
Can you reserve it for us for a few days?

32
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,860
Of course.

33
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,600
As long as

34
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,780
you pay the deposit.

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,829
Well,

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,980
please do us a favor.

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,670
After we scrape together enough money,

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,150
we'll pay you in full.

39
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,390
What do you think?

40
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,390
You don't have money but want to buy a store?

41
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:41,800
We…

42
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,420
Five days.

43
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,680
Just five days.

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,280
Five days?

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,680
No.

46
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,110
How about three days?

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,260
Please give us three days.

48
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,230
It's a deal then.

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,500
Three days later,

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,010
if someone else wants to buy this store,

51
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,860
I won't reserve it for you

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,410
anymore.

53
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,900
Deal.

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,540
Okay.

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,220
See you in three days.

56
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,530
Thank you.

57
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,380
It's raining so heavily.

58
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,000
We only have three days.

59
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,770
We need to find a solution.

60
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,750
The creditors found us first.

61
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,230
Three, Four, Five, Six.

62
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,350
Be serious.

63
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,690
Do you know why we're here?

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,100
We're here for our money.

65
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,630
We do what we say.

66
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,760
You promised to pay for

67
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,020
those 568 jars of wine.

68
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,160
120 jars of them are 15 catties per.

69
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,720
200 jars of them are 10 catties per.

70
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,910
20 catties…

71
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,990
Forget about the numbers.

72
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,670
You need to pay us!

73
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,740
Three.

74
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,850
Most of that wine

75
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,070
is kept at your fortress.

76
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,950
Besides, we never said

77
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,950
we'd welsh on you.

78
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,850
Zhao Three.

79
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,060
We saved your life.

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,460
How can you be so ungrateful?

81
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,580
Yes. They saved my life.

82
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,020
Four, let's go back.

83
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,340
Have you forgotten what Two said?

84
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,800
We can't trust outsiders.

85
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,430
Yes.

86
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,000
You're outsiders. I can't trust you.

87
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,520
Fine.

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,080
Then can you

89
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,430
give us

90
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,320
a few more days?

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,080
No way.

92
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,630
Pay us now,

93
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,670
or go back with us.

94
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,030
Otherwise,

95
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,690
don't blame us for being rude.

96
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,150
Okay.

97
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,620
We'll go with you.

98
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,750
Let's go.

99
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,720
Four, they played us.

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,940
Catch him!

101
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,310
Are you okay?

102
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:58,909
Get up.

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,920
After them!

104
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,940
After them!

105
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,960
Lian Man'er and Shen

106
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,880
are so devious.

107
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,300
They have no morals.

108
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,950
How could they play us?

109
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,790
They're so bad.

110
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,700
Yu Xiangjin is so persistent.

111
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,280
We don't have money to buy the store

112
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,450
and are in debt to those at Black Tiger Fortress.

113
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,260
We lost them this time,

114
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,860
but they'll come to us again.

115
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,790
Don't worry about it.

116
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,570
Leave this matter

117
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,530
to me.

118
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
Let's go back now.

119
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,100
Thirteen must be

120
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,560
waiting for us anxiously.

121
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,960
Chang Feng.

122
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,540
I want to learn how to write your name.

123
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,820
Try it.

124
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,020
Something is going on between them.

125
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,750
Impossible.

126
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,110
I know Thirteen very well.

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,540
They can't be together.

128
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,120
They'll be together very soon.

129
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,780
It's absolutely impossible.

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,340
What's wrong with him?

131
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,730
Young Master.

132
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,900
If I did something wrong,

133
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,710
you can beat me up.

134
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,170
Don't look at me like that.

135
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,590
I can't stand it.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
Thirteen, let me ask you.

137
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,750
You like Lian Ye'er, don't you?

138
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,880
No. That's nonsense.

139
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,520
Good.

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
You like Miss Man'er.

141
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,150
Why can't I

142
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,190
like Ye'er?

143
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,470
The location

144
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
of the store we found today is great.

145
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,380
If we can buy it,

146
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,040
business won't be bad.

147
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,140
Black Tiger Fortress

148
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,400
owes us a batch of wine.

149
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,400
If we can get it back and sell it,

150
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,340
we'll have money

151
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,270
to buy the store.

152
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,500
For those at Black Tiger Fortress,

153
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,630
money is important,

154
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,170
but there's something

155
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,530
more important to them.

156
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,270
I'll go get it tomorrow.

157
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,700
Okay.

158
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,460
Young Master.

159
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,210
What do you think of Miss Ye'er?

160
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,520
What do you think of her?

161
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,590
I think

162
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,700
she's amazing.

163
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,650
Come to think of it,

164
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,470
if I and Miss Ye'er are together,

165
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,890
I'll become

166
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,570
your brother-in-law, right?

167
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,940
Young Master.

168
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,299
Young Master?

169
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,120
The relationship is too complicated.

170
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh, my heavens!

171
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,300
What should I do?

172
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,070
He.

173
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:11,840
What happened, Dad?

174
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,520
Get up.

175
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,800
What happened?

176
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,150
Your Aunt He gave the money

177
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,440
to your Uncle Shouren.

178
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,990
But Shouren took the money

179
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,390
and disappeared.

180
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,180
Seems that Shouyi

181
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,840
can't survive it this time.

182
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,030
Uncle Shouren disappeared.

183
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,030
How about Aunt Gu?

184
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,010
She ran away too.

185
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,440
He told me

186
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,340
that as long as I had money,

187
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,730
he could bribe the government

188
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,140
to release Shouyi.

189
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,740
I…

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,560
I lost my mind and shamelessly

191
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,630
stole money from my own family.

192
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,540
Shouren just left me in the lurch.

193
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,760
I don't want to live anymore.

194
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,930
Let me die!

195
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,950
He! He!

196
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,940
What are you doing?

197
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
You can't do this.

198
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,270
Don't do this.

199
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,600
-Fang…
-Don't do this.

200
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,230
Fang.

201
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,310
-Grandpa.
-Dad.

202
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,840
Grandpa!

203
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,460
Are you okay?

204
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,120
Don't move.

205
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,930
I'm fine.

206
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,700
Are you okay?

207
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,830
I'm fine.

208
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,960
I'm just having palpitations. I'm fine.

209
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,830
He.

210
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,320
It's not your fault.

211
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,710
It's Shouren's fault.

212
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,990
San'er.

213
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,530
Go to the town

214
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,710
for me.

215
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,190
Bring Shouren back.

216
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,750
Tell him I want him back.

217
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,580
He, what are you doing?

218
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,110
Shouxin.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,080
I'll count on you

220
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,700
to save Shouyi.

221
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,470
He.

222
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,950
Get up.

223
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,520
Get up.

224
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,930
-No!
-You…

225
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,210
You…

226
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,310
I'll go find Shouren now.

227
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,640
I'll go with you.

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,810
Get up.

229
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,580
Get up, He.

230
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,340
Come on. Get up.

231
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:24,900
[Sun Fulai Inn]

232
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,750
Shouren.

233
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,830
Shouren.

234
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,940
Uncle Shouren!

235
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,070
Sir.

236
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,950
Do you know

237
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,780
where the family living here is?

238
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,000
No one lives here. They just moved away.

239
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,130
-Moved away?
-What?

240
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,130
Where did they go?

241
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,470
Are you

242
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,010
their relatives?

243
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,560
Before they left,

244
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,390
they warned me

245
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,190
about relatives

246
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,520
who often came to borrow money

247
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,700
and were hard to get rid of.

248
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,430
He told me to stay away from you.

249
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,100
Man'er.

250
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,180
What should we do now?

251
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,110
We

252
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,510
have forgotten about someone.

253
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,790
I don't know where my father is.

254
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,330
You must know.

255
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,830
Your father took the money and ran away.

256
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,230
Uncle Shouyi will have to go to jail.

257
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,950
Aunt He

258
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,520
cried her eyes out at home.

259
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,970
Grandpa got sick because of it too.

260
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,570
Your father has to come back!

261
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,480
As you said,

262
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,360
it's my father who took your money.

263
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,160
Why are you here arguing with me?

264
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,700
Fine.

265
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,810
If you don't tell me,

266
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,450
I'll ask your in-laws.

267
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,430
Lian Man'er!

268
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,100
Don't go too far.

269
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,790
You're still in the Song Mansion

270
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,500
yet your parents ran away.

271
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,340
They've left you here

272
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
to cover for them.

273
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,250
They don't care about you at all.

274
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,450
Why are you still helping them?

275
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,060
Hua'er.

276
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,250
I know life is hard for you too.

277
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,830
If things weren't messed up at home,

278
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,360
I wouldn't have come to you.

279
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,640
You just need to tell me

280
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,970
where your parents are.

281
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,870
Once you tell me, I'll leave.

282
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,840
The Song family won't know

283
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,700
I've been here.

284
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,310
Why do you think

285
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,810
life is hard for me?

286
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,590
I've been required to learn the etiquette

287
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,450
in high society since I was young.

288
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,440
Do you really think my father

289
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
dotes on me?

290
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,750
After I finally married into the Song family,

291
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,990
I begged and begged

292
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,460
but still couldn't get anything for my father.

293
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,860
He blames me.

294
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,190
It's fine.

295
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,620
But he also blames my mom.

296
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
He's a loser.

297
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,310
He should blame himself.

298
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,210
Lian Man'er, do you know

299
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,870
what I hate the most about you?

300
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,190
How can you

301
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,460
speak truth like that

302
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,890
without any hesitation?

303
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,080
You never care about

304
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,160
social etiquette.

305
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,040
Neither do you care about

306
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,500
what people say about you.

307
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,070
Even many men

308
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,760
can't live as freely as you do.

309
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,670
But that's exactly

310
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,220
why I hate you so much.

311
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,440
Whether one can live freely

312
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,270
depends on oneself.

313
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,940
My father has spent all the money.

314
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,810
This is the money I saved up.

315
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,400
Take it

316
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,890
and don't come here again.

317
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,600
And don't make things hard for my mom.

318
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,930
Can't you sit down?

319
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,170
It was hard for me

320
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,990
to escape.

321
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,360
Your family must be looking for us everywhere.

322
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,620
You should think about

323
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,340
what we should do next.

324
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,100
What should we do next?

325
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,630
What can I do?

326
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,420
We've already moved out.

327
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,980
We've moved here.

328
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,480
Don't worry.

329
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,330
They can't find this place.

330
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,790
Even if anything happens,

331
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,230
Hua'er will help us.

332
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,190
She can cover for us.

333
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,300
But…

334
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,780
I shouldn't

335
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,500
have listened to you.

336
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,050
I shouldn't have taken

337
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,920
He's money.

338
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,590
How could you

339
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,520
blame it on me?

340
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,630
It's all your baby girl's fault!

341
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Official, official!

342
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,850
Why am I still not an official?

343
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,590
I'm not even anything close to it.

344
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,980
If it weren't for that,

345
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,370
I wouldn't have crawled to those big names

346
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,250
to make connections.

347
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,020
It was so degrading.

348
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,310
Hua'er failed to help you

349
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,590
and became "my baby girl"?

350
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,830
Everything we did

351
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,430
was to get a position for you.

352
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,870
All you do is blame others.

353
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,340
You should blame yourself.

354
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,020
If you were more…

355
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,040
Shouren.

356
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,150
Shouren.

357
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,430
Why did you run away?

358
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,869
Uncle Shouren.

359
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,740
It's hard to find you.

360
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,480
If Man'er hadn't gone to the government office to make inquiries,

361
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,280
we would still not know

362
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,590
that without evidence,

363
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,060
Shouyi would be released in a few days.

364
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,010
Why did you lie to us?

365
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,530
He wanted to fool me into stealing money.

366
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,290
I'll kill you!

367
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,470
He.

368
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,100
He.

369
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,730
Dad!

370
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,160
Have a seat.

371
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,550
Dad!

372
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,880
Shouyi!

373
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,690
Shouyi!

374
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,630
Dad.

375
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,750
I thought I'd never see you again.

376
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,320
It's good that you're back.

377
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,130
It's good that you're back.

378
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,020
Shouyi.

379
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,290
You're back.

380
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,070
You tricked my wife into stealing money

381
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,830
and made Dad fall ill!

382
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,430
How could you do that?

383
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,710
You're an animal!

384
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,630
Dad.

385
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,470
He kicked me.

386
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,210
Shut up.

387
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,330
Why did you stand up?

388
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,360
Kneel down!

389
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,790
Sit here.

390
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,250
Sit down, Shouyi.

391
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,970
All these years,

392
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,710
we've been providing for you

393
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,170
and caring so much for you.

394
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,960
How could you

395
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,700
do such a despicable thing?

396
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,220
In front of the whole family,

397
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,220
promise that you won't be such a jerk again!

398
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,900
Also, you need to pay He the money

399
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,260
you took from her.

400
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,380
What money?

401
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:09,980
Hold on.

402
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,210
I thought

403
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,490
Hua'er had paid her off.

404
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,290
She stole the money from Man'er.

405
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,300
You can't

406
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,550
play dumb

407
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,520
and let Hua'er clean up your mess.

408
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,190
Why do I

409
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,940
have to pay double?

410
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,840
Because we've been providing for you!

411
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,850
You have to pay the money back.

412
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,190
No.

413
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,090
I don't have money.

414
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,530
You stupid thing.

415
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,290
Look at you.

416
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,070
For you to pass the civil service exam,

417
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,150
the whole family tightened our belts to support you.

418
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,470
You wanted to be an official,

419
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,390
so we sold our crops

420
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,030
and pigs

421
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,670
to put up money for you.

422
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,400
Haven't we done enough for you?

423
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
I wanted to be an official?

424
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,700
I never ever wanted

425
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,770
to be an official!

426
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,010
You wanted me to be an official!

427
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,300
You…

428
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,190
You forced me to take the exam!

429
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,820
You…

430
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,820
What are you saying?

431
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,590
You know exactly

432
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,070
what I'm saying!

433
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,170
When we were young,

434
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,530
you thought Shouyi

435
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,060
was not cut out for studying

436
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,970
and asked me and Shouxin

437
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,990
to study hard

438
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,030
and become a dignitary.

439
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,110
Later, to save his wife,

440
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,380
Shouxin broke his leg

441
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
and became a cripple.

442
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,660
Since then,

443
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
you've been keeping your eyes on me.

444
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,410
You praised me

445
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,940
and encouraged me.

446
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,450
I understand.

447
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,200
You just want me to become an official

448
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,540
so that I can make money

449
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,390
to give you guys a better life

450
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,030
and honor the Lian family.

451
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,540
Am I wrong?

452
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,270
Beast.

453
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,520
You're a beast.

454
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,940
Beast! Beast!

455
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,350
-You beast!
-Fang. Fang.

456
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,150
You beast!

457
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,660
Brother, stop it.

458
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,870
Okay.

459
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,630
Let's put everything

460
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,720
on the table today.

461
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,540
If you

462
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,670
hadn't forced me to become an official,

463
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,950
I wouldn't have sold Man'er

464
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,760
to the Sun family

465
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,160
for just 500 teals of silver

466
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
and that stupid jade.

467
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,000
I wouldn't have tricked He

468
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,450
into stealing money.

469
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,370
I wouldn't have asked Hua'er

470
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,450
to grovel to the Song family

471
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,790
for a position for me.

472
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,390
Didn't I feel humiliated?

473
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,440
Now I ended up like this.

474
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,810
You think it's my fault?

475
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,520
You blame everything on me?

476
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,010
You can't blame it on me!

477
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,920
It's all your fault.

478
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,710
It's all your fault!

479
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,800
You forced me.

480
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,830
Can you shut up?

481
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,990
Stop it.

482
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,180
Get out.

483
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,230
Get out!

484
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,650
Actually, it's been hard for me too.

485
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,010
I'm not cut out to be an official.

486
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,110
I'm not made for it.

487
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,250
Don't count on me

488
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,360
anymore.

489
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,190
Lord Lian.

490
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Is Lord Lian home?

491
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,030
Lord…

492
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,950
Who is Lord Lian?

493
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,190
Lian Shouren.

494
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,590
Lord Lian?

495
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,810
Lord Lian.

496
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,350
I've been looking for you.

497
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,350
I searched for you

498
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,700
everywhere in the city and town

499
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,010
but couldn't find you.

500
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,820
I asked so many people

501
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,700
to finally find out that you're in Lian Village.

502
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,160
Why are you looking for me?

503
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,830
The bookkeeping official of the county

504
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,950
resigned due to illness.

505
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,250
You're expected to take his place

506
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,050
and start working immediately.

507
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,740
Take his place

508
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,030
and start working immediately.

509
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,530
Are you serious?

510
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,500
Yes.

511
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,300
Look.

512
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,710
It's the official appointment.

513
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,370
Take a look.

514
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,100
Lord Lian.

515
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,980
Please pack up and take up the post

516
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,830
as soon as possible.

517
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,890
I'll take my leave.

518
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,290
See you around.

519
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,210
Dad.

520
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,500
Have some water.

521
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,640
Shouyi is back,

522
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,410
so Man'er returned the money to Hua'er.

523
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,990
But she still hasn't got the money

524
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,920
to buy the store.

525
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,660
Our daughter

526
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,380
is sharp-tongued and stubborn,

527
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,350
but deep down,

528
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,740
she has a warm heart.

529
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,110
Fate is so unpredictable.

530
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,270
One second

531
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,100
Shouren was on his knees,

532
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,460
the next he became

533
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,440
the bookkeeping official.

534
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,830
Even if he's the bookkeeping official now,

535
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,670
we don't expect him

536
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,060
to help us in the future.

537
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,470
We have to rely on ourselves.

538
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,830
But to be honest,

539
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,660
it's a good thing

540
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,230
that he's become the bookkeeping official.

541
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,190
At least, Dad's wish has come true.

542
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,820
Finally, someone in this family

543
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,260
has become an official.

544
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,310
Was Dad happy

545
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,680
when he heard this news?

546
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,740
He…

547
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,270
Shouren.

548
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,480
Have some tofu.

549
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,770
It brings you good luck.

550
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,530
Okay.

551
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,660
Have some chicken.

552
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,070
You're the best.

553
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,070
This time,

554
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,730
after I take office,

555
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,040
I'll visit the magistrate first.

556
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,770
You should.

557
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,380
Then I'll meet

558
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,400
those friends of mine.

559
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,340
-Of course.
-We may need each other's help in the future.

560
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:22,880
Yeah.

561
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,250
I need to bond with them.

562
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,050
Right.

563
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,490
Here.

564
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,540
Dad.

565
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,150
Try this.

566
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,570
It's good for your health.

567
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,060
Dad.

568
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,190
Eat up.

569
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,450
Bookkeeping official

570
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,580
is a good position.

571
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,230
You finally got a position.

572
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,150
We pinched pennies to support you

573
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,420
and our efforts paid off.

574
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,350
Where's your wife?

575
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,990
She went to town.

576
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
She went to Hua'er

577
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,710
to tell her

578
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,070
this good news.

579
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,310
Mom.

580
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,430
How did Shouren suddenly get a position?

581
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,690
Stop asking. Just eat.

582
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,410
Yes. Eat up.

583
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,980
Congratulations, Shouren.

584
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,230
You got a good position.

585
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,060
Thank you.

586
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,180
Congratulations. You have a bright future.

587
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,710
Shouren.

588
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,060
When will you

589
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,030
set off?

590
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,470
That guy said

591
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,930
the former bookkeeping official

592
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,330
resigned due to illness.

593
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,530
I'm expected

594
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,100
to start working as soon as possible.

595
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,750
So,

596
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,970
without further delay,

597
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,230
I'll set off tomorrow.

598
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,250
So soon?

599
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,190
I see.

600
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,970
Then we have to hurry up.

601
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,040
We mustn't hold you up.

602
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,120
He.

603
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,540
Well,

604
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,030
go back and pack up.

605
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,490
Pack up.

606
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,100
-Throw away unnecessary things.
-Okay.

607
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,060
Don't pack too much.

608
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,930
I know.

609
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,670
Shouyi.

610
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm about to start working.

611
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,750
Why do you need to throw things away?

612
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,410
So that you can buy us new ones.

613
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,400
You're going with me?

614
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,000
-Of course.
-Of course.

615
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,920
We talked about this before.

616
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,670
After you become an official,

617
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,910
you'll help us live a better life.

618
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,830
Now that you did,

619
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,530
we'll stick with you.

620
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,300
Yeah.

621
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,860
No.

622
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,630
Shouren.

623
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,260
We're family.

624
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,170
Families stick together.

625
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,840
How can we let you

626
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,390
start working all alone?

627
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,430
Dad and Mom would be worried.

628
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,020
Yeah. I'm about to start working

629
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,470
and don't want to leave Dad and Mom.

630
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,440
But

631
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,670
have you ever heard of any bookkeeping official

632
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,410
who brought his whole family to work?

633
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,560
I'm just a bookkeeping official

634
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,920
who is even below Rank 9.

635
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,070
-Above me…
-So what?

636
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,680
Officials don't have families?

637
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,970
Officials

638
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,580
don't have parents

639
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,560
and brothers?

640
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,680
Fine.

641
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,450
He, don't get me wrong.

642
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,720
Shouren, take no offense.

643
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,870
You know your sister-in-law.

644
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,760
She doesn't think before she talks.

645
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,630
We're brothers.

646
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,820
I know you.

647
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,630
Abandoning your parents

648
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,950
and siblings after becoming an official

649
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,120
is not something you would do.

650
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,890
Are you still angry

651
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,660
about what happened yesterday?

652
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,940
No.

653
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,010
I just got out of prison

654
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,560
and wasn't thinking straight.

655
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,730
Please forgive me.

656
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,210
Shouyi, you…

657
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,230
If you're still angry with me,

658
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,140
you can hit me.

659
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,340
I'm not angry.

660
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,830
Okay.

661
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,430
We're good now.

662
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,050
Let's drink.

663
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,520
Dad.

664
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,210
Mom.

665
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,140
This village

666
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,320
is a good place.

667
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,910
It's much better than the city.

668
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,020
All the major criminals in nearby towns

669
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,410
are kept in the city.

670
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,110
I know what you want to say.

671
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,200
You're worried that I'll go to live with you.

672
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:35,940
Think about it.

673
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,870
You and your wife have been living in town.

674
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,350
It's not far from here.

675
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,320
Have I ever gone to your house?

676
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,030
Mom.

677
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,610
You misunderstand me.

678
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,840
There's no place

679
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,140
like home.

680
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,510
If you leave behind

681
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,230
those

682
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,280
chickens, ducks, pigs, cows,

683
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,390
and the field,

684
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,710
who will take care of them?

685
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,180
Right.

686
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,800
Besides,

687
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,470
you worked hard for years

688
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,550
to get everything you have now.

689
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,680
If you're gone for long,

690
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,810
who knows if anyone's gonna take them?

691
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,880
You have a point.

692
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,220
But

693
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,980
I need to ask your dad's opinion.

694
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,570
No one knows my dad

695
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,080
better than me.

696
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,670
He only has two wishes.

697
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,000
One is that I could become an official.

698
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It has come true.

699
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,700
Right?

700
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,720
The other

701
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,850
is that Xiu'er could get married.

702
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,980
If you two leave,

703
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,640
it'll be harder for Xiu'er to get married.

704
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,260
Why?

705
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,750
Think about it.

706
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,750
Family image

707
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,730
matters a lot in marriage.

708
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,270
If you all moved into the city

709
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,370
with me,

710
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,210
we'd be seen as displaced,

711
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,550
disgraceful,

712
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,390
and pathetic.

713
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,590
No one would want to marry Xiu'er then.

714
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,550
But things are difficult in the village.

715
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,680
Now that I, your son,

716
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,350
have become an official,

717
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm no longer a nobody.

718
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,390
You

719
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,430
are the mother of an official.

720
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,420
Xiu'er

721
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,080
is the sister of an official.

722
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,970
Don't worry.

723
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,540
I'll find a good match

724
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,350
for Xiu'er.

725
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,860
Shouren.

726
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,300
Do you mean what you said?

727
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,460
Then I'll count you

728
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,780
to marry Xiu'er off.

729
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,860
You can't leave home

730
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,280
for a better life

731
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,910
and forget all

732
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,370
about us.

733
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,780
Don't worry.

734
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,410
It's settled then.

735
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,170
Let me help you.

736
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,670
No need.

737
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,660
I can do it.

738
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,570
No need.

739
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,360
Mom.

740
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,000
Can you talk to Shouyi and his wife for me?

741
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,450
Tell them

742
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,560
to get off my back.

743
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,510
Your dad and I are not going.

744
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,030
Shouyi and his wife

745
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,010
will surely stay here too.

746
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,470
Okay.

747
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,690
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

748
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,920
Mom, let me help you.

749
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:45,950
How's it?

750
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,240
We can't

751
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,330
move into the city.

752
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,230
Why?

753
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,740
Shouren brought up

754
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,890
Xiu'er's marriage.

755
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,540
He promised to find a good match for her.

756
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,210
Mom changed her mind

757
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,340
and decided to stay.

758
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,510
Darn it.

759
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,870
I knew it.

760
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,660
Shouren is an ingrate.

761
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,060
He's going to work in the city without us.

762
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,190
He wants to dump us

763
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,420
and enjoy his life.

764
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,900
No.

765
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,470
We must extort some money from him before he leaves.

766
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,310
Think about it.

767
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,790
When you were in jail,

768
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,600
what did he do?

769
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,110
He fooled me into stealing Man'er's money.

770
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,440
He deserves worse than being shaken down.

771
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,980
Remember.

772
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,550
He owes us.

773
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,600
We must shake him down.

774
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,770
How?

775
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,370
Brother, it's me.

776
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,490
Shouyi?

777
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,470
What's wrong

778
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,230
with you two?

779
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,610
What are you doing?

780
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,210
Shouren.

781
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,450
Look at you.

782
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,340
Are you running away in the middle of the night?

783
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,940
Nonsense.

784
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,970
Get your hands off me.

785
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,980
You're so rude.

786
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,230
Shouren.

787
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,090
You haven't started working yet

788
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,219
but are already giving yourself airs.

789
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,900
Let me guess.

790
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,440
You must've brought up

791
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,040
Xiu'er's marriage again

792
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,239
to change Mom's mind.

793
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,989
You two twerps!

794
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,909
Can't you give up

795
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,260
the habit of eavesdropping?

796
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,790
No.

797
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,219
I see.

798
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,630
It's about me going to work in the city,

799
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,159
isn't it?

800
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,909
That's why you stopped me here.

801
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,070
I never said you couldn't go with me.

802
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,190
I've made a thorough plan.

803
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,639
I'll go first

804
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,469
and arrange everything for you.

805
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,120
Then you'll come.

806
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,550
This is the best

807
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,330
for all of us, isn't it?

808
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,600
When you arrive,

809
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,350
everything will be prepared.

810
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
Isn't that great?

811
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,220
You're so considerate.

812
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,020
Rest assured.

813
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,230
I'm not finished.

814
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,700
Say no more.

815
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,830
Shouren is not that kind of person.

816
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,760
Right, Shouren?

817
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,340
Yeah.

818
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,370
Shouren, here's the thing.

819
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,420
You're about to start working.

820
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,770
Just a teeny-tiny bit of money

821
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,510
out of your deep pockets,

822
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,030
just a tiny bit of it,

823
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,760
is enough to last us for a while.

824
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,710
Vulgar!

825
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,430
Can't you two

826
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,340
think about something

827
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,340
other than money?

828
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,740
In that case…

829
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,200
Shouren, don't go. You...

830
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,860
Shouyi.

831
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,180
You can't take that.

832
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,370
Help!

833
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,650
There's a murder here!

834
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,010
This man is trying to kill his brother!

835
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,460
You…

836
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,610
This murderer is going to work in the government!

837
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,740
Don't shout.

838
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,810
Don't shout.

839
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,310
How much do you want?

840
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:47,920
Tell me.

841
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,170
That's more like it.

842
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:04,250
[Song]

843
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,910
Hua'er.

844
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,990
Sorry, Hua'er.

845
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,930
We shouldn't have hidden behind you.

846
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,660
Did Man'er give you a hard time?

847
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,750
Thanks to you,

848
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,880
your father has become the bookkeeping official.

849
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,480
Well,

850
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,480
the moment we waited for years

851
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,140
finally came.

852
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,230
You should look for an opportunity

853
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,740
to beg Hailong again.

854
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,320
Maybe

855
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,520
your father can get promoted.

856
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,750
Mom.

857
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,540
It was hard for me

858
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,270
to convince Hailong to help me.

859
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,950
He spent lots of money and effort

860
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,190
in making connections

861
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,280
so that Dad could finally

862
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,360
get this position.

863
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,140
Dad hasn't even

864
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,850
started working

865
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,050
yet you're thinking about promotions.

866
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,350
I was just saying.

867
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
Calm down. Don't take it seriously.

868
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,090
Hua'er.

869
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,070
Hua'er.

870
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,840
You married into the Song family.

871
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,950
You married up

872
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,970
and are living

873
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,190
an enviable life now.

874
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,750
I'm truly happy for you.

875
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,820
How about…

876
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:35,780
How about

877
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,620
we have dinner together tomorrow?

878
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,950
Bring Hailong with you.

879
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,360
Your father

880
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,700
can have a drink with him.

881
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,370
No need.

882
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,830
I understand.

883
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,430
Hailong must be too busy

884
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,930
to dine with us.

885
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,670
Have you heard

886
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,900
about Man'er's plan?

887
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,430
She's going to

888
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,580
open a restaurant

889
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,800
in the boisterous East Market.

890
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,060
She's confident of making a lot of money.

891
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,670
I don't like her.

892
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,020
No matter how much money

893
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,670
she makes,

894
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,440
she's no match for you

895
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,430
who married into the Song family

896
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,440
and became a respected

897
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,280
fine lady.

898
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,660
Look at you now.

899
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,030
Mom.

900
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,510
You even have a maid.

901
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,070
It's getting cold.

902
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,470
If there's nothing else,

903
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,720
you should go back.

904
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,060
Hua'er.

905
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,790
Hua'er.

906
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,650
It's late. Where have you been?

907
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,340
I ate too much

908
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,130
and went out for a walk.

909
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,510
It helps digestion.

910
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,950
Bring me with you next time.

911
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,210
I can keep you company.

912
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,070
Okay.

913
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,020
By the way,

914
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,110
thank you.

915
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,270
My father has got a position.

916
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,590
I begged my brother for a long time.

917
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,820
I tried so hard

918
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,590
and talked his ear off.

919
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,630
Your father is lucky,

920
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,850
otherwise,

921
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,980
no one knows how long he'd have to wait.

922
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,370
My brother said

923
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,880
we must behave ourselves.

924
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,370
As long as we behave,

925
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,060
he'll beg Mom

926
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,430
to cut you some slack.

927
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,680
-So don't worry about…
-Honey.

928
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,990
Let's start a business.

929
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,540
If we can make our own money,

930
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,080
your mother and brother

931
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,610
won't look down on us again.

932
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,240
What kind of business should we do?

933
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,320
We must not go back

934
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,720
empty-handed this time.

935
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,430
Two.

936
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,920
Two.

937
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,350
What should we do with him?

938
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,550
He beat us hard.

939
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,790
You all came.

940
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,460
What's the matter, Two?

941
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,120
Not satisfied with being the mastermind,

942
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,390
you show up in person.

943
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,360
You

944
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,720
saved Three and Four,

945
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,500
but this time,

946
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,990
you broke your promise first.

947
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,750
Don't blame me for being hard on you.

948
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,910
Give us the money

949
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,870
and we'll go our separate ways.

950
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,590
That would be great.

951
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,100
Then please pay us now.

952
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,440
But I can't pay you.

953
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,320
He played us again.

954
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,060
Brothers, take him down.

955
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,600
Wait.

956
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,840
What's this?

957
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,900
It's our household registers.

958
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,720
Only government officials have access to them.

959
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,840
Who on earth are you?

960
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,090
Let me see them.

961
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,850
Let me see them.

962
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,980
You just need to know

963
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,300
that it was hard for me

964
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,470
to get them.

965
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,310
Household registers?

966
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,150
Yes.

967
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,250
We're not illegals anymore.

968
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,120
I didn't expect you

969
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,510
to do us such a great favor.

970
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,040
Sorry for being rude to you.

971
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,950
We're all friends.

972
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,490
It's okay.

973
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Get up.

974
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,180
Two.

975
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,110
Get up.

976
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,510
Get up.

977
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,040
Shen.

978
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,910
To be honest,

979
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,190
since the first time

980
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,280
you showed up at Black Tiger Fortress,

981
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,830
I've never trusted you.

982
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,990
I'm not an illegal anymore.

983
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,110
I said mean things about you

984
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,190
in front of Master

985
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,300
and egged Three and Four on

986
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,770
to ask you and Miss Man'er for money.

987
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,640
I'll never forget

988
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,670
your kindness to us.

989
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,420
If you're in trouble one day,

990
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,350
we'll do our best

991
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,840
to help you out.

992
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,050
Two.

993
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,240
I'm relieved to know that.

994
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,180
I do need your help with something.

995
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,110
Tell me about it.

996
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,390
If I remember correctly,

997
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,110
there is still some wine at the fortress.

998
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,040
Can you give it to me to tide me over?

999
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,100
In the future,

1000
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,310
I'll pay back all the money

1001
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,980
I owe you.

1002
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,480
Shut up.

1003
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,590
Brothers.

1004
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,940
Let's go bring him the wine.

1005
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,870
Okay.

1006
00:42:59,460 --> 00:42:59,990
Let's go.

1007
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,270
Let's go.

1008
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,510
