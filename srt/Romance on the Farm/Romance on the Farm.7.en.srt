[Episode 7]

4
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,470
Xiu'er.

5
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,390
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,850
I've been looking for you.

7
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,770
I'm worried.

8
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,259
I want to see Zhang.

9
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,259
Okay.

10
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,940
I'll go with you.

11
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,030
Hua'er.

12
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,080
Let's go.

13
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,110
Why are you hesitating?

14
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,560
I'm not going.

15
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,380
I'm just saying.

16
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,829
Xiu'er.

17
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,180
What happened that day was an accident.

18
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,670
We didn't mean it.

19
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,450
Don't worry.

20
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,730
The rope we used

21
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,510
that day

22
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,000
was Lian Ye'er's firewood rope.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,860
No matter what,

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
you won't be implicated.

25
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,270
But immediately after Dad mentioned adoption,

26
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,270
you tripped her.

27
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,250
-I really...
-Xiu'er.

28
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,579
Do you mean

29
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,170
I set you up?

30
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,990
Xiu'er, if you remember,

31
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,750
that day, it was you

32
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,120
who cried and begged me

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,890
to find a way

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,470
to teach Lian Man'er a lesson.

35
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,940
I told you I couldn't help you.

36
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,100
I told you.

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,230
Now that

38
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,080
things went south,

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,360
you're blaming me

40
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,260
for it.

41
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,070
Hua'er.

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,090
Hua'er, that's not what I mean.

43
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,310
Xiu'er.

44
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,200
You're too innocent.

45
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,990
She can play you like a fiddle

46
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,320
without you knowing it.

47
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,480
I hated to see her bully you

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,880
so I helped you.

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,400
Think about it.

50
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,460
Has Lian Man'er

51
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,720
messed with you again?

52
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,140
Every time I went to town

53
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,940
and saw

54
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,040
beautiful necklaces and bracelets,

55
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,450
I bought them

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,730
for you.

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,070
Have I ever

58
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,540
lied to you?

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,340
Hua'er. Hua'er.

60
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,079
I know.

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
I know you're the sweetest.

62
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,520
I trust you.

63
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,970
Stop crying,

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,630
will you?

65
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,520
Alright.

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,970
Let's go to my room

67
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,550
and pick some pretty hairpins for you.

68
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,900
Okay.

69
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,990
Mom.

70
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,340
Mom.

71
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,660
Mom.

72
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:23,990
Mom.

73
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,350
Isn't that Xiu'er from the Lian family?

74
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,370
Has she gone mad?

75
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,460
Mom! Mom!

76
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,570
Xiu'er! Xiu'er!

77
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,960
Xiu'er!

78
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,490
My face.

79
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,090
When I woke up this morning,

80
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,490
I found my face like this.

81
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,270
Are these

82
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,850
Eight's footprints?

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,930
Eight is back for revenge.

84
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,010
It's broad daylight. Shut up!

85
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,470
She…

86
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,020
What are you looking at?

87
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,370
Let's go home.

88
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,360
Go home.

89
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,230
Everyone is talking about her.

90
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,800
What are you looking at?

91
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,630
It's autumn now.

92
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,140
They are just rashes.

93
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,520
You're psyching yourself out.

94
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,380
There are no ghosts in the world!

95
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,020
Yeah. That's it.

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,760
Imagine

97
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,150
that you stepped on Grandma's hen.

98
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,950
Look shocked.

99
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,320
Grandma starts scolding you.

100
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,540
Take a few steps back.

101
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,200
Shake your head aggrievedly.

102
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,700
At this moment,

103
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:35,580
Grandma's spittle

104
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,710
gets in your eyes.

105
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,159
You rub your eyes hard,

106
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,100
wondering

107
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,520
whether they're wet with spittle

108
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,490
or inconsolable tears.

109
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,130
Try to explain in a hurry.

110
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,590
Make your lips tremble.

111
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,520
Raise your hand.

112
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,980
You stupid girl.

113
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,060
Don't try to spook us!

114
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,790
Grandma.

115
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,340
There's a little ghost behind Xiu'er.

116
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,670
He's thwacking her leg.

117
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,950
T-That's nonsense.

118
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,030
Xiu'er.

119
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,130
Doesn't your leg hurt?

120
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,700
He's holding a mace

121
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,520
and hitting the back of your leg.

122
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,990
Mom!

123
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,220
Don't scare yourself.

124
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,080
Even if there were a ghost here,

125
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,090
it might not be Eight.

126
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,230
Eight? Eight?

127
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,350
Weird.

128
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,390
He was here just now.

129
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,420
Eight.

130
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,940
Eight.

131
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,700
Eight.

132
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,580
Eight.

133
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:32,990
Eight.

134
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,000
Mom.

135
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,580
It's really Eight.

136
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,190
It's okay.

137
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,300
It's okay.

138
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,170
It's okay.

139
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,950
It's okay.

140
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,750
It's okay.

141
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,670
Go back.

142
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,440
Don't scare me.

143
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,710
It seems

144
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,490
that our trick worked.

145
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,140
Grandma may not be fooled

146
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,170
by anyone else.

147
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,370
But Ye'er is an honest person.

148
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,110
Her word

149
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,880
carries lots of weight.

150
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,110
I taught Ye'er all night.

151
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
No one would think

152
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,580
she was acting.

153
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,790
Besides,

154
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,790
the paint I used on Xiu'er's face

155
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,190
is made from rose balsam.

156
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,270
It'll take a few days to wash it off.

157
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,040
They'll surely be ill at ease.

158
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,710
In your family,

159
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,880
evidence doesn't mean a thing.

160
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,640
Anyone can bend the truth as they please.

161
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,550
Only after Lian Xiu'er confesses

162
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,299
will your family believe

163
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,830
that your mother's miscarriage

164
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,690
was caused by her and Lian Hua'er.

165
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,789
Are we all set

166
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,830
for the next step?

167
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,720
Of course.

168
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,520
There's nothing I can't do.

169
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,220
Money makes anything possible.

170
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,140
The sky is the shield.

171
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,880
The earth is the key.

172
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,110
Come, all good gods.

173
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,060
Be gone, all evil spirits.

174
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,000
Back off!

175
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,400
Back off!

176
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,750
Back off!

177
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,220
Back off! Back off!

178
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,020
Your daughter

179
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,290
isn't the only one who has sinned.

180
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,080
There's another girl.

181
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,830
Yes.

182
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,120
Sir, you're right.

183
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,800
She's just a naive girl.

184
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,850
Sir.

185
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,000
Please help her.

186
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,470
Let me have a closer look at you.

187
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,870
What's wrong

188
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,990
with my daughter's head?

189
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,940
What a pity.

190
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,690
What a pity!

191
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,310
It's a great pity.

192
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,520
Your daughter is surrounded

193
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,100
by dark energy.

194
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,660
Her eyes are empty

195
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,150
and unfocused.

196
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,980
Her fate has been altered by bad luck.

197
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,300
At best,

198
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,550
she can only be a mistress.

199
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,440
What was her original fate?

200
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,280
Judging from her full forehead

201
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,670
and square chin,

202
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,420
she could live a luxurious life

203
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,290
as the emperor's concubine in the royal palace.

204
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,830
R-Royal palace?

205
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,960
Where did you find him?

206
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,060
He's laying it on too thick.

207
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,060
They won't buy it.

208
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,540
Royal palace!

209
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,110
I want to live in the royal palace.

210
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,700
I don't want to be someone's mistress.

211
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,940
Please help her, sir.

212
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,300
I want to live in the royal palace.

213
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,900
I don't want to be a mistress.

214
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,830
Mom, help me.

215
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,950
Please help my daughter.

216
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,090
After she moves into the royal palace

217
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,460
as the emperor's concubine,

218
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,720
she'll make you the imperial preceptor.

219
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,080
Sir, please help her.

220
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,820
By the way,

221
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,100
how did you find out

222
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,570
who was behind it

223
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,210
just by checking the blood on the rope?

224
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,340
You even saw through

225
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,940
Lian Hua'er's trick

226
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,110
to frame Ye'er.

227
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,110
That's why Ye'er

228
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,180
didn't dare to speak the truth.

229
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,580
Is there anything wrong?

230
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,020
Nothing.

231
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,660
It's just

232
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,500
that you're a peasant from Shen Village

233
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,480
but are capable of

234
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,750
putting the pieces together so quickly.

235
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,740
You even made Ye'er

236
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,930
tell us the truth.

237
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,350
Is that why

238
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,560
you're called a key character?

239
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,590
Lian Xiu'er wants to live in the royal palace.

240
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,920
Do you want that as well?

241
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,620
Why would I want that?

242
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,460
I don't want to be the imperial preceptor

243
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,860
or the emperor's concubine.

244
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,350
I don't want to fight with a bunch of women

245
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,470
over a man.

246
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,720
I'd have to win his favor

247
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
and get pregnant.

248
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,190
I could never have peace of mind

249
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,990
and might be put in the doghouse.

250
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,070
You're just a village girl.

251
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,730
How did you know so much

252
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,060
about the life in the royal palace?

253
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,580
TV…

254
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,610
I heard it from a storyteller.

255
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,990
Don't you want to make money?

256
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,730
Emperor's concubines

257
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,180
get paid every month.

258
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,560
Doesn't that sound good to you?

259
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,360
You're talking like

260
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,780
you want to get me into the royal palace.

261
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,290
I

262
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,920
prefer

263
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,070
to make my own money.

264
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,050
After I have enough money,

265
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,820
I can go back to school

266
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
and travel to faraway places.

267
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,980
So,

268
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,550
I must earn 1,000 taels of gold.

269
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,590
Why 1,000 taels of gold?

270
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,590
Imperial Preceptor, I'm begging you.

271
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,830
What's done is done.

272
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,660
There's no turning back.

273
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,880
The only thing you can do now

274
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,980
is pacify the ghost

275
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,320
to keep your daughter safe.

276
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,850
How to pacify the ghost?

277
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,700
It's not difficult.

278
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,900
The kid wants revenge

279
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,310
on those who hurt his mother.

280
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,710
As long as you get the mother's forgiveness

281
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,680
and let the kid know

282
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,160
that his mother has let go,

283
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,520
he'll leave.

284
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,370
That's easy.

285
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,610
Go to Zhang now.

286
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,590
No.

287
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,900
I promised Hua'er

288
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,950
to keep it a secret.

289
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,950
Forget about her!

290
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,930
She used a few cheap earrings

291
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,360
to wrap you

292
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,700
around her little finger.

293
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,190
Are you stupid?

294
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,350
If you don't go, I will!

295
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,500
Hua'er is not that kind of person!

296
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,380
She is!

297
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,230
I'll be angry with you if you go.

298
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,990
Xiu'er. Xiu'er.

299
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,470
Xiu'er.

300
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,900
You dumb girl

301
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
You're so stupid!

302
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,440
Stupid girl.

303
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,710
Wait up!

304
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,100
It doesn't work.

305
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,600
In the battle of Changping,

306
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,950
King Zhao was defeated

307
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,850
because the seed of distrust

308
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,710
had already been sown in his mind.

309
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,260
The bag guys easily cajoled him

310
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,050
into replacing Lin Xiangru

311
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,180
with Zhao Kuo.

312
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,000
Say something I can understand.

313
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,300
Xiu'er refused

314
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,340
to rat Hua'er out.

315
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,990
But the seed of distrust

316
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,390
has been sown in her mind.

317
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,690
So now…

318
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,680
We just need to send a bad guy to her.

319
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,630
Grandma talked with Xiu'er for so long

320
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,210
but couldn't make her come around.

321
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,150
If I talk to her,

322
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,940
she'll only be more guarded.

323
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,910
So now, we have to find someone

324
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,790
who Xiu'er has no issues with

325
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,740
and is glib,

326
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,310
smart,

327
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,500
and good-looking.

328
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,290
We need a bad guy like that.

329
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,190
Anyone in mind?

330
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,160
She used a few cheap earrings

331
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,550
to wrap you

332
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,460
around her little finger.

333
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,980
Are you stupid?

334
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,040
Impossible.

335
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,400
Hua'er wouldn't have done that to me.

336
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,520
What happened to your face?

337
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,540
Nothing.

338
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,760
They're just rashes caused by the change of seasons.

339
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,460
You must be glad to have them.

340
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,560
What do you mean?

341
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,280
They make you look lovely.

342
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,250
But

343
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,750
your earrings look cheap.

344
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,560
If you can change them,

345
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,100
you'll look more elegant.

346
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,000
They're Green Jade's latest products.

347
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,710
They can't be cheap.

348
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,180
Whoever sold them to you

349
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,250
must have lied.

350
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,440
The jade on these earrings

351
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,300
is dim

352
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,300
and has black spots.

353
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,450
You can find such earrings in any trinket store.

354
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,870
They're worth five coins at most

355
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,050
and the store owners wouldn't even be upset

356
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,250
if they got stolen.

357
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,910
How is that possible?

358
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,550
Hua'er gave them to me.

359
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,940
Since they're from Hua'er,

360
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,070
they can't be cheap.

361
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,040
But…

362
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,010
What?

363
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,160
Xiu'er.

364
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,970
Don't go out

365
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,290
when you're wearing them.

366
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,140
Only those vulgar maidservants in town

367
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,510
wear such earrings.

368
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,230
How dare you!

369
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,180
Sorry.

370
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,860
Women know jewels better than men.

371
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,119
Perhaps I'm mistaken.

372
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,990
Hua'er is very kind.

373
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,550
I'm sure she didn't mean

374
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,180
to lie to you.

375
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,280
She must have played me!

376
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
Xiu'er, what happened to your face?

377
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,140
What are you looking for?

378
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,610
You can't afford to break any of these.

379
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,860
Xiu'er.

380
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,460
You don't like

381
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,190
the earrings

382
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,990
I gave you?

383
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,840
Pick the ones you like.

384
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,190
My mother went to town

385
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,390
and bought me new ones.

386
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,170
I can give them to you.

387
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,780
You don't want to give them to me!

388
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,150
Otherwise, you wouldn't have hidden them.

389
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,990
I've never seen

390
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,390
this jewelry box before.

391
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,380
What are you talking about, Xiu'er?

392
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,930
I was…

393
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,130
I was about

394
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,270
to give them to you.

395
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,070
You're lying.

396
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,100
I saw you wearing this hairpin.

397
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,870
I asked you for it and you said it was lost.

398
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,330
But you're hiding it here.

399
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,540
What's wrong with you today?

400
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,480
Why are you making a fuss

401
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,620
over some stupid earrings?

402
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,980
Is this about earrings?

403
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,480
For you,

404
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,310
for the earrings you gave me,

405
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,230
I actually

406
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,740
caused Zhang to suffer a miscarriage.

407
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,610
Hua'er.

408
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,520
Wait and see. This is not over!

409
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,070
How could you do this?

410
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,800
San'er.

411
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,780
San'er!

412
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,600
Calm down.

413
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,000
Sit down.

414
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,520
Brother.

415
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,050
Man'er

416
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,860
is always so mean to me.

417
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,070
She scratched my face

418
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,850
with wheat ears

419
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,300
and made my father

420
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,430
scold me.

421
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,520
I was beside myself with anger.

422
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,090
Hua'er told me to teach her a lesson

423
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,250
by tripping Zhang.

424
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,460
I just wanted to trip Zhang.

425
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,660
I didn't mean to cause her miscarriage.

426
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,570
Brother.

427
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,420
Please forgive me.

428
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,640
You mean you did nothing wrong?

429
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,340
I…

430
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,020
San'er.

431
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,240
You can't blame Xiu'er for it!

432
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,300
It's all Hua'er's fault.

433
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,680
Father.

434
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,490
We can't let this slide.

435
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,740
I.…

436
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,920
I've already punished her.

437
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,730
I've taught her a hard lesson.

438
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,690
She regrets it now.

439
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,780
She'll never ever do it again.

440
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,360
Grandpa, Grandma.

441
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,470
I didn't mean it.

442
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,140
I'm close to Xiu'er.

443
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,380
After she

444
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,630
was bullied by Man'er,

445
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,710
I wanted to help her.

446
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,140
I didn't know

447
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,200
things would turn out like this.

448
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,220
Yeah.

449
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,130
Hua'er

450
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,450
is too young

451
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,110
to know how fragile

452
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,230
a pregnant woman is.

453
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,190
Besides, Hua'er

454
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,270
will marry into the Song family soon.

455
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,450
If we punish her too hard

456
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,160
and leave scars on her body,

457
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,960
the Song family won't be happy

458
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,940
when they find out about it.

459
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,520
Don't talk about the Song family!

460
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,270
What a smooth talker.

461
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,680
You're so cunning.

462
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,550
This is the daughter you raised.

463
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,460
Mother.

464
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,200
You can't blame…

465
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,700
Shut up.

466
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,150
I can't scold her?

467
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,210
Mother.

468
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,490
All these years,

469
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,980
I've been

470
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,990
devoted to this family.

471
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,270
How thick-skinned do you have to be

472
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,860
to say something like that?

473
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,960
Since you married my son,

474
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,510
you've been giving yourself airs.

475
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,000
You wheedled my son into moving into town.

476
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,780
Father.

477
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,470
It's all my fault.

478
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,930
I've been too busy with my studies

479
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,170
to raise Hua'er properly.

480
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,140
If you want to punish someone,

481
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,080
punish me.

482
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,390
Hua'er

483
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,590
will marry into the Song family.

484
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,420
My career depends on that.

485
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,460
San'er.

486
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,230
You've suffered a lot these years.

487
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,230
Shouren left home to study.

488
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,650
Shouyi is a lazy bum.

489
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,040
You've done a lot

490
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,190
for this family.

491
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,220
I know that.

492
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,050
If that kid

493
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,590
wants revenge on Hua'er

494
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,440
and Xiu'er,

495
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,660
they'll accept the punishment

496
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,030
they deserve!

497
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,910
Hua'er will get married soon.

498
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,300
After Hua'er marries into the Song family

499
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,980
and helps your brother become a government official,

500
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,150
we won't have to

501
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,010
live such a miserable life anymore.

502
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,380
We can't let others

503
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,510
know about this matter.

504
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,600
From now on, no one

505
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,010
is allowed to bring it up.

506
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,530
Hua'er.

507
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,600
Xiu'er.

508
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,580
Go back to your rooms.

509
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,040
Reflect on your mistakes!

510
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:14,990
Dad!

511
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,870
Is that all?

512
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,380
Then…

513
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,080
Then what do you

514
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,770
want me to do?

515
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,780
Shouxin.

516
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,380
Back then, Mom and Dad expected you

517
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,250
to pass the civil service exam.

518
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,380
But your wife, that jinx,

519
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,150
caused you to break your leg.

520
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,940
You were bedridden for a long time.

521
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,480
How much money did we spend

522
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,990
on your treatment?

523
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,190
Do you have to make this family

524
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,390
fall apart?

525
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,700
I…

526
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,630
Answer me.

527
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,180
I…

528
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,710
I…

529
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,500
I…

530
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,980
Say something!

531
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,670
I…

532
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,660
It's just too painful.

533
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,030
Since my father wouldn't say it,

534
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,460
I will.

535
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,220
In my opinion,

536
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,470
this matter

537
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,830
should end here.

538
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,980
Aunt Gu.

539
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,930
There's something

540
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,240
I'm hesitating to say.

541
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,430
Man'er.

542
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,110
You can speak your mind.

543
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,700
As long as you don't have a son,

544
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,960
Grandma and Grandpa won't give up.

545
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,950
They'll keep trying

546
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,010
to make you adopt someone else's son.

547
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,510
If you kill an innocent baby

548
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,390
every time they try to do that,

549
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,790
you'll have lots of company

550
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,760
after you die.

551
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,500
What are you talking about?

552
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,020
Just do as Grandpa said.

553
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,630
Reflect on your mistakes.

554
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,090
Reflect on your mistakes.

555
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,350
Mother.

556
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,740
Why did Lian Man'er

557
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,980
go easy on us?

558
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,350
The whole family counts on you

559
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,140
to live a better life.

560
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,010
Your grandpa won't punish you severely.

561
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,750
Others

562
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,300
can't do anything to you.

563
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:00,860
Hua'er.

564
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,350
What's wrong?

565
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,220
Hua'er.

566
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,630
Is that you, Hua'er?

567
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,150
Mom.

568
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,290
Who did this?

569
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,520
Who did this to you?

570
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,750
Are you okay?

571
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,410
Blood.

572
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,110
Are you hurt anywhere else?

573
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,670
I don't know.

574
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,300
Mom.

575
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,230
Let's go.

576
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,610
Let's go in.

577
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,710
Here. Take my arm.

578
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,790
Lean on me.

579
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,260
Slowly.

580
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,970
Slowly.

581
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,700
Careful.

582
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,280
Who did this to you?

583
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,460
Don't let me find them,

584
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
or I'll kill them.

585
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,950
Careful.

586
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:45,750
You…

587
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,190
Move away!

588
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,710
Give it to me.

589
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,020
No. I got it first.

590
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,130
-I got it first.
-Give it to me.

591
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:52,970
I got it first.

592
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Take it if you can.

593
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,030
Give it to me.

594
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,120
Give it to me.

595
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,180
Grandpa!

596
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,370
Give it to me, you stupid girl.

597
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,740
Mother, it's time for lunch.

598
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,740
I made eggs with brown sugar for you.

599
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,500
What were you hiding?

600
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,190
You're still on the mend.

601
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,260
Why did you waste your energy on this?

602
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,920
It's called a longevity knot.

603
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,140
It can ward off bad luck

604
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,380
and keep the wearer safe.

605
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm making this

606
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,660
as a way

607
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,950
to pray for Eight.

608
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,290
I didn't get to be his mother.

609
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,040
I hope

610
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,670
he can be reincarnated in a good family.

611
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,030
Also,

612
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,660
I want to make a few of them

613
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,820
for sale

614
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,150
so that you and Seven

615
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,210
can live a better life.

616
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,700
Mom.

617
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,720
Don't worry about money.

618
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,700
I'll make it.

619
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,380
Recently, I've found a way

620
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,640
to make a load of money.

621
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,950
You'll soon become

622
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,310
a rich mistress.

623
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,590
By then,

624
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,550
all you need to do

625
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,950
is count coins

626
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,950
and order the servants around.

627
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,700
I knew it.

628
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,930
My Man'er

629
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,900
is the best.

630
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:04,960
Father.

631
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,810
Shouxin.

632
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,510
Didn't Shouyi's wife

633
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,680
come back and bring lunch to the field?

634
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,500
He must be worried about you

635
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,100
and came back to check on you.

636
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,000
What are you hiding?

637
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,420
Look.

638
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,540
I picked them on our farm.

639
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,940
Shouxin.

640
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,090
I think

641
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,170
we should move out.

642
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,860
Is it

643
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,990
because of Hua'er and Xiu'er?

644
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,520
They're part of the reason.

645
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,390
Actually,

646
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,810
on the day of the accident,

647
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,380
I went to the field

648
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,360
to talk about moving out with you.

649
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,300
If we don't move out,

650
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,490
in the future,

651
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,900
they'll bully us again.

652
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,230
They'll bully Man'er and Seven again.

653
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,910
For the sake of our children,

654
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,970
I want to move out.

655
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,570
But we're all family.

656
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:34,990
We…

657
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,540
Family, family.

658
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,720
Why is it

659
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,540
that Mom got hurt again and again

660
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,270
yet they always had something to gain?

661
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,870
That's not the case, Man'er.

662
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,240
Your mother had a miscarriage

663
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,780
because Hua'er and Xiu'er

664
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,270
were too young and impulsive.

665
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,160
Your Uncle Shouren, Aunt Gu,

666
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,230
and the others in the family

667
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,630
had nothing to do with it.

668
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,250
Now,

669
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,590
we've lost the baby.

670
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,030
Your grandpa and grandma

671
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,290
are very sad about it.

672
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,950
I can't make it harder for them

673
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,000
at this moment.

674
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,990
Why do you always

675
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,340
put other people first?

676
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,670
What about me?

677
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,580
What about Mom?

678
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,700
What about Seven?

679
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,870
What about the unborn Eight?

680
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,380
Don't you care about us?

681
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,330
Of course I care about you.

682
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:20,870
But…

683
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,260
I…

684
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,490
Dear.

685
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,490
I need to go back to the field to harvest peanuts.

686
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,470
Have a good rest.

687
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,630
We'll talk when I'm back.

688
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,030
We'll talk when I'm back.

689
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:37,990
Dad!

690
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,010
The Lian family, the Lian family.

691
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,190
All he cares about is the Lian family.

692
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,620
We have peanuts at home

693
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,080
but I have to come out to steal peanuts.

694
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,670
After the peanuts are sold,

695
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,180
the money is hidden away.

696
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,650
Who is the lunatic

697
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,350
who designed this ridiculous game?

698
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,220
I'm driven mad

699
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
before I even complete the mission.

700
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,240
Shen Nuo.

701
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,050
She's scary.

702
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,980
Stop!

703
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,050
Where are you going?

704
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,140
Nowhere.

705
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,180
I think this peanut plot

706
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,270
can only yield a dozen kilos of peanuts at most.

707
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,670
They won't be worth much.

708
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,430
How about

709
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,230
we try another way

710
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,030
to make money?

711
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,220
We won't sell the peanuts directly.

712
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,360
Youheng told me

713
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,200
that Mr. Laojin left home

714
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,230
to collect debts.

715
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,950
So,

716
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,460
after we dig up all the peanuts here,

717
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,770
we'll go to his house to make garlic peanuts.

718
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,310
Before we harvest all the peanuts in this plot,

719
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,710
neither of you can leave.

720
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,140
What are you thinking?

721
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,980
Are you thinking about running away?

722
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,780
Running away?

723
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,500
I'm not running away.

724
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,460
Seven.

725
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,710
I need to borrow your head for a few minutes.

726
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,470
No problem.

727
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,190
Do you believe it?

728
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,290
No.

729
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,420
If I do,

730
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,730
I'll be damned.

731
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,420
Master.

732
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,790
Whoever gathers the most peanuts

733
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,330
can learn that move from me.

734
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,570
Don't move!

735
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,630
Here are the peanuts.

736
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,060
Good.

737
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,310
Try it.

738
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,270
How is it?

739
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,800
Not bad.

740
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,330
Not bad?

741
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,070
What a perfunctory comment.

742
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,750
Delicious.

743
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,170
It's more delicious

744
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,380
than those in the market.

745
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,370
Great!

746
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,510
After drying them,

747
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,440
we can sell them.

748
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:11,720
Let's go to

749
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,180
Fuchun Restaurant first.

750
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,090
Fuchun Restaurant

751
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,750
is the leader in the industry.

752
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,030
If Mr. Zhang

753
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,030
buys our peanuts,

754
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,160
our peanuts

755
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,900
will be in high demand.

756
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,840
Our boss is not here.

757
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,050
He's busy with something big at home.

758
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,740
Waiter.

759
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,130
Coming.

760
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,620
Something big?

761
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,340
Great!

762
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,100
Perfect timing.

763
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,850
Let's go to his house.

764
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,300
We can easily sell him our peanuts

765
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,630
when he's in a good mood.

766
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,560
Are you sure

767
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,520
the timing is perfect?

768
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,290
I went to the temple at seven.

769
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,860
I thought of my mother.

770
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,350
She was pregnant with me for ten months.

771
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,910
She looked haggard.

772
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,900
She lost her appetite.

773
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:37,110
She worked hard all her life.

774
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,140
She gave her children all her love.

775
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:49,420
I'll pray for her every day.

776
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,550
Thirteen?

777
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,460
Every day.

778
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:01,060
I went to the temple at nine.

779
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,430
I thought of my mother.

780
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,660
Why are you here?

781
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,380
Mr. Zhang paid Shengde Troupe

782
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,180
to wail at his mother's funeral.

783
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,850
Who is this?

784
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,240
She's Miss Lian,

785
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,820
the girl who saved me in the woods.

786
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,080
I mentioned her to you.

787
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,860
You're Miss Lian.

788
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,760
Thank you for saving Young Ma…

789
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,790
Y-Young…

790
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,110
Young?

791
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:30,950
Young

792
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,110
is my pet name.

793
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,440
He is the guy

794
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,340
whose freedom

795
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,800
I've been saving up to buy.

796
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,840
He calls you by your pet name.

797
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,320
You two must be very close.

798
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,260
Then Young,

799
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,440
since your friend

800
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,490
works in the troupe,

801
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:45,850
he…

802
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,380
I don't work in the troupe.

803
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,030
Then why were you

804
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,980
wailing so sadly just now?

805
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,110
I'm just worth my salt.

806
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,100
I love whatever I do.

807
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,820
I didn't find it hilarious at all.

808
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,310
Since you're worth your salt,

809
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,070
you must've checked

810
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:55,790
your client's background

811
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,250
before wailing that song.

812
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,380
To be honest,

813
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,720
We're here

814
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,000
to sell garlic peanuts

815
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,930
to Mr. Zhang.

816
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,070
Can you tell us something about him?

817
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,930
Why are you out here making money?

818
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm making money to buy your freedom!

819
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,750
Cut the crap.

820
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,580
That Mr. Zhang,

821
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,190
have you looked into him?

822
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,550
Yes.

823
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,570
I did a simple investigation.

824
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,330
Mr. Zhang's

825
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,880
full name is Zhang Ping'an.

826
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,630
He's the owner of Fuchun Restaurant.

827
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,680
He's 56 years old

828
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,630
and has three sons and three daughters.

829
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,830
He has seven older sisters.

830
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,110
His father died when he was young.

831
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,240
His family was poor.

832
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,530
His mother, Old Madam Zhang,

833
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,230
raised him

834
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,510
and his seven sisters

835
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,140
-all by herself.
-All by herself.

836
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,430
His mother always told him

837
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,090
to be kind to others.

838
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,620
Go.

839
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,170
Go.

840
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,380
If I get beaten,

841
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,650
come out to protect me.

842
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,630
Don't worry.

843
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,730
Go.

844
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,800
Old Madam Zhang's parents were peasants.

845
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,940
Her hometown was Kaifeng.

846
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,470
She was outgoing and often sat cross-legged.

847
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,620
Son.

848
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,260
She was very strict with Mr. Zhang when she was alive.

849
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,140
She often used a ruler

850
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,820
to knock Mr. Zhang's head.

851
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,430
What are you doing?

852
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,790
Can't you recognize your mother?

853
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,050
Who is this crazy girl?

854
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,930
Get out!

855
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,390
I'm so sad.

856
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,470
It's Old Madam Zhang who's speaking.

857
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,110
Old Madam Zhang is speaking.

858
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,820
Look.

859
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,340
When Mr. Zhang first opened his restaurant,

860
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,390
he couldn't make much money.

861
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,150
Old Madam Zhang kept telling him

862
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,620
that life was all about being happy

863
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,820
and that money didn't matter that much.

864
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,510
Son.

865
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,470
Have you forgotten what I told you?

866
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,570
When you smile a lot,

867
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,190
good luck will come your way.

868
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,290
Why are you pulling a long face?

869
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,770
Mother.

870
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,620
You left me.

871
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,270
You fool!

872
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,740
How did your father die?

873
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,330
My father

874
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,970
died of illness.

875
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,650
When your father died,

876
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,020
he was in a lot of pain.

877
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,740
I lived

878
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,520
for 80 years

879
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,040
and died of old age.

880
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,270
I'm already very lucky.

881
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,610
You shouldn't be sad.

882
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,100
I

883
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,580
am going to become a star in the sky.

884
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,240
When you miss me,

885
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,790
look up at the sky.

886
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,600
I care about you

887
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,700
the most.

888
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,890
If you want me to be happy,

889
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,980
you have to be happy first.

890
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:53,980
Understand?

891
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,380
Yes.

892
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,880
You've lost weight.

893
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,460
You must

894
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,560
have skipped meals these days.

895
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,150
Eat it.

896
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,070
How do you like it?

897
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,540
My son.

898
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:29,990
I

899
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,390
am going to heaven.

900
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,550
When you miss me,

901
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,610
look up.

902
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,140
Look up at the sky.

903
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,980
I can see you from above.

904
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:47,550
She...

905
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,610
Man'er.

906
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,540
Are you okay?

907
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,160
Where am I?

908
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,000
Why am I here?

909
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,470
You scared the crap out of me.

910
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:56,970
Come.

911
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,390

Sorry.

Sorry, guys.

914

Let's go.

915
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,340

916
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,050
Can you

917
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,990
sell this bucket of peanuts to me?

918
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:10,680
No.

919
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,540
You have to buy ten buckets at least.
