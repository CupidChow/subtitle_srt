00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,440
Go and die!

5
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,950
Wu Zhonglian!

6
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,990
Come out!

7
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,700
Master Wu!

8
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,530
Master Wu.

9
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,340
They are inside!

10
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,070
Tear it down!

11
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,940
Tear the door down for me.

12
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,550
Leave no one alive.

13
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,220
Got it.

14
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,820
Shen Nuo.

15
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,760
I’m sorry.

16
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,710
I came late.

17
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,010
No, I am the one that's sorry.

18
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,990
If I didn't go to the mine

19
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,190
and got caught there,

20
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,990
you would have escaped long ago.

21
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,390
I'm really sorry.

22
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,470
This is the evidence I've been looking for.

23
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,810
You've been helping me.

24
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,120
What did you do wrong?

25
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,470
Shen...

26
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,530
Shen Nuo!

27
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,720
Are you alright?

28
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,710
Shen Nuo.

29
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,290
I promised you

30
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,970
that we will always be together,

31
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,320
even if it's not for a lifetime,

32
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,120
or for one day,

33
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,710
or even for just a few hours.

34
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,730
I just didn't expect

35
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,120
I would no longer be able to honor what I had promised.

36
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,990
Tear down the door.

37
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,830
Wude Bureau is here!

38
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,350
Get them all!

39
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,590
Go! Stop him!

40
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,620
If you dare to kill my brother,

41
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,680
I'll kill you today!

42
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,620
Are you alright?

43
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,670
Shen Nuo.

44
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,150
Let's go.

45
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,040
Wude Bureau is here.

46
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,710
Drop your weapons and surrender now!

47
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,370
Otherwise,

48
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,030
we will kill with no mercy!

49
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,220
Just stop now.

50
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,670
If I die,

51
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,810
even if you know

52
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,250
the location of the mine,

53
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,350
you all wouldn't be able to take down Marquis Ningyuan

54
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,230
without my testimony.

55
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,080
Do you really think by helping

56
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,190
Marquis Ningyuan,

57
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,960
you will be able to

58
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,720
achieve your great ambitions?

59
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,620
Stop dreaming.

60
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,210
You're just

61
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,230
a small pawn.

62
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,570
You don't have to serve him

63
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,520
up till your final moments.

64
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,210
Even up till now,

65
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,490
you still don't get it?

66
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,090
What do you all know?

67
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,830
I have also once

68
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,050
worked hard for ten years.

69
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,910
I also once had dreams and aspirations.

70
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,170
I have also once dreamed of making it big

71
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,570
in the court.

72
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,830
But in the end,

73
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,850
I got sucked into the partisan feuds,

74
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,070
and was slandered.

75
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,430
I was like a homeless dog,

76
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,090
abandoned in the wilderness.

77
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,610
If he hadn't helped me,

78
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,400
I would have long died

79
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,170
in the wilderness.

80
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,990
So,

81
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,650
even if His Lordship

82
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,130
wants to turn over the sky,

83
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,730
I will

84
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,950
do my best to help him

85
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,460
at all costs.

86
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,260
Stop lying to yourself.

87
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,970
When Lord Lin started to catch

88
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,850
Boss Cao,

89
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,620
he already knew that

90
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,320
the mining operations will be exposed.

91
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,240
In order to destroy any form of evidence,

92
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
the Marquis Ningyuan whom you trust

93
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,880
has already started cleaning up his act.

94
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,970
All of you

95
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,870
will die.

96
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,270
Impossible.

97
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,660
That's impossible.

98
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,930
His Lordship and I

99
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,770
are friends for life.

100
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,510
I know all his plans.

101
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,310
He won't give up Jinyang County so easily.

102
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,590
He won't give up on me so easily.

103
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,430
Liu Fugui’s death

104
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,430
is just a warning.

105
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,110
He just

106
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,060
wants to get rid of you through my hands.

107
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,260
After I die,

108
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,710
you'll be next.

109
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,710
You...

110
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,640
You have nowhere else to go.

111
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,710
No.

112
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,420
That won't happen.

113
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,910
His Lordship won't do this to me.

114
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,440
He will protect me.

115
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,880
Don't talk nonsense.

116
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,880
Wu Zhonglian,

117
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,950
you live in darkness.

118
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,460
That's why the world is also dark

119
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,350
in your eyes.

120
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,070
But,

121
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,330
you've lost.

122
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,070
I...

123
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,770
haven't...

124
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,600
lost.

160

and conspired to rebel.

161
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,320
He has been captured,

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:37,580
[Royal Notice]

163
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,430
and put in prison.

164
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,830
However,

165
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,080
the other party still exists.

166
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,830
There could be no excuse to such a crime.

167
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,030
We will do our best to arrest all of them.

168
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,400
As for the vacant position of the magistrate of Jinyang,

169
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,680
I have appointed a wise man

170
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,920
to take office soon.

171
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,020
Look,

172
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,110
there are so many people inside.

173
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,680
Of course.

174
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Business is good.

175
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,870
Here are the dishes.

00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,230
Please take care.

177
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,000
Jinyang County is suffering

178
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,490
because of the rebels running amok.

179
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,820
It hurts me very much as the Emperor

180
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,750
as I view the people as my children.

181
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,350
Today, I'm exempting Jinyang County's taxes for three years,

182
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,600
and I will return the fertile fields to the people.

183
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,350
Irrigation works will be carried out

184
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,760
to revitalize farming,

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,580
so that we can restore the prosperity of Jinyang,

186
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,380
and guarantee peace and happiness for the people.

Of course we will be back.

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,440
It's still best to spend the New Year's Eve

195
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,040
at one's own home.

196
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,430
When we're done packing,

197
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,830
come to my place for some soup noodles.

198
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,470
Okay.

199
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,220
[May we have prosperous livestock]

200
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,120
Dear, come on.

201
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,710
I have applied the glue.

202
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,230
Yes.

203
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,250
Put it higher up.

204
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,750
No other place could be better than your own place,

205
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,610
no matter how luxurious it may be.

206
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,960
It's best to be home.

207
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,140
That's right.

208
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,350
Man'er previously said that

209
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,830
she would buy a house in town

210
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,430
when she has the money.

211
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,180
In my opinion,

212
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,860
this old compound of ours is pretty nice.

213
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,100
Although it's plain,

214
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,180
but I feel at ease.

215
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,420
Yes.

216
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,270
Shouxin.

217
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,069
Sister-in-law.

218
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,450
Shouyi, Sister-in-law.

219
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,710
-You’re back.
-This is

220
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,670
pork knuckle from Man'er's restaurant.

221
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,040
that was made just today.

222
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,880
Seeing that the restaurant has closed for the day,

223
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,750
we couldn't bear to see it go to waste,

224
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,950
so we brought it back.

225
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,550
Later,

226
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,829
let's eat together.

227
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
We just came back.

228
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,859
We still have some work to do.

229
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,990
We'll go over later.

230
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,160
Wouldn't it be great if we have Shen Nuo around?

231
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,940
You can leave all these chores

232
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,900
to him.

233
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,030
Forget it.

234
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,710
Thirteen is still the best.

235
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,710
He's always eager to do anything.

236
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,710
Enough.

237
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,950
Shouxin,

238
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,400
when will Shen Nuo and the rest

239
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,470
come back?

240
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,400
Well,

241
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,960
I really miss them.

242
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,880
It's all thanks to Shen Nuo,

243
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,280
who saved the whole camp,

244
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,470
that we are able to move back safely.

245
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,220
I've never seen anything like this

246
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,620
even at my age.

247
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,640
Exactly.

248
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,940
I didn't expect that he's a court official.

249
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,140
Even Eldest Brother will have to bow to him when they meet.

250
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,910
You... go heat up the pork knuckle.

251
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,470
Let's go.

252
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,140
When Man'er is done,

253
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,990
I'll go and find you.

254
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,470
Okay.

255
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:14,930
Man'er.

256
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,180
This is yours.

257
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,950
Thank you.

258
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,560
Man'er,

259
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,140
has Shen Nuo

260
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,390
send you a letter?

261
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:28,990
No, not yet.

262
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,890
If we count the days,

263
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,300
he should be back soon.

264
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,150
I wonder if he and Thirteen

265
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,440
have fully recovered?

266
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,280
Did they take their medication on time?

267
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,230
Exactly how are things going?

268
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,400
You have been saying these same words to me

269
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,730
up to 800 times a day.

270
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,920
Have you forgotten

271
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,980
where are they now?

272
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm just worried.

273
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,570
It would be bad if

274
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,400
his illness turns chronic.

275
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,960
You see,

276
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,390
they've been gone for so long.

277
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,630
Why haven't they thought of coming back?

278
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,750
Thirteen wouldn't stay in the capital,

279
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,920
get married there

280
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,360
and not come back, right?

281
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,230
He said he will come back,

282
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,560
so he definitely will come back.

283
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,290
Don't worry.

284
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,900
I trust you.

285
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,070
I'll clean up myself.

286
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,960
Go back and rest.

287
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,400
Okay.

288
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,070
Call me if you need anything.

289
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,180
[1.1 gold]

290
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,300
[999.8 gold]

291
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,940
[Congratulations to the player for completing the mission.]

292
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,940
[999.8 gold]

293
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,170
Father,

294
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,080
please just don't go today.

295
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,780
Leave me alone.

296
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,370
Father.

297
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,670
Father?

298
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,430
I'm fine.

299
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,200
Aunt He brought you some pork knuckle.

300
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,760
Let's go.

301
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,600
Let's go eat.

302
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,630
Let's go.

303
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,610
Mother.

304
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,890
What's wrong with Father?

305
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,070
Ever since Aunt Gu dropped by,

306
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,080
there has been no news about Aunt Gu and Uncle Shouren.

307
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,870
We have no idea where they might have gone.

308
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,280
Your grandpa went out to look for them every day.

309
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,210
Your father advised him not to look for them anymore,

310
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,010
but he didn't listen,

311
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,340
and had just gone again.

312
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,310
Mother,

313
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,170
what happened?

314
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,580
Why are you up so late?

315
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,560
I just don't want to deal

316
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
with your father.

317
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,420
It's as if he is being possessed.

318
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,320
It's cold outside, but instead of being at home,

319
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,980
he only knows to find Shouren.

320
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,890
What happened?

321
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,000
Why did you guys call me this late at night?

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,260
What's so urgent?

323
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,930
It's still the same issue.

324
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,390
Lian Shouren

325
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,580
is his son.

326
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,470
You two are not.

327
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,410
When I think of Xiu'er

328
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,000
and how she was hurt by Shouren,

329
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,430
it is as though my heart has been pricked by needles.

330
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,950
But your father

331
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,620
insists on finding him back.

332
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,650
When you think about Xiu'er...

333
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,510
Exactly what have I done to deserve this,

334
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,370
my dear Xiu'er.

335
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,710
Grandma,

336
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,330
you've been with Grandpa

337
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,230
for so many years.

338
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,960
Don't you know him well enough?

339
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,010
If

340
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,080
he doesn't find Uncle Shouren back,

341
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,880
he definitely would not give up.

342
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,430
If anything happens to Uncle Shouren,

343
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,910
he will feel guilty for the rest of his life.

344
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,740
I mean...

345
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,160
are the two of you

346
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,050
going to be at loggerheads for the rest of your life?

347
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,300
Besides,

348
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,590
I think not only Grandpa

349
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,230
wants to find Uncle Shouren.

350
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,510
Uncle Shouyi,

351
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,440
my father...

352
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,170
although the whole family

353
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,010
say it's taboo to mention,

354
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,710
but actually,

355
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,710
we are all thinking about Uncle Shouren.

356
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,430
Yes.

357
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,850
Eldest Brother must have suffered a lot

358
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,000
to be in this circumstance.

359
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,710
It's almost

360
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,980
the New Year,

361
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,210
but Uncle Shouren and his family is still not yet home.

362
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,710
Did you really think our family

363
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,170
could really feel at ease?

364
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,230
I don't care if you guys want to go and look for him.

365
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,020
But if anyone bullies Xiu'er,

366
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,100
or finds trouble with Xiu'er,

367
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,960
I wouldn't be able to accept that.

368
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,960
Mother.

369
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,530
It's okay, Father.

370
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,310
Grandma...

371
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,830
just has a lot of pent-up emotions.

372
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,720
Actually,

373
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,940
she's also worried about Uncle Shouren.

374
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,150
Even so,

375
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,970
no one can persuade your grandma now.

376
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,990
How about

377
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
we go out tomorrow

378
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,950
and try to find?

379
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,550
At least...

380
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,150
we find out what is Uncle Shouren's family situation now.

381
00:23:59,230 --> 00:23:59,910

If I hadn’t been liked by Liu Fugui,

394
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,960
Eldest Brother wouldn’t have to suffer this way.

395
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,560
He was driven to a dead end

396
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,600
by Liu Fugui.

405
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,350
the biggest sin that I tried so hard to avoid.

it's been hard on both sides.

Now that Eldest Brother has been driven crazy,

418
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,470
Father and Mother must be upset.

00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,060
So, I weaved a little pony

574
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,350
and named it Benxiao.

575
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,590
When we meet again,

576
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,920
I'll give it to you personally,

577
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,850
in lieu of my thoughts.

578
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,500
I should be the one

579
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,300
who is filled with regrets.

580
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,790
I thought

581
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,980
we could meet again.

582
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,560
I should go.

583
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,850
Have you seen this person?

584
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,030
No.

585
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,340
Have you seen this person?

586
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,050
No.

587
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,860
Have you seen this person?

588
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,930
No.

589
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,910
Have you seen this person?

590
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,560
No.

591
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,080
♫Chasing the past♫

592
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:50,080
♫Filled with empty and sad faces♫

593
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,070
♫Chasing the past♫

594
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:57,020
♫I can only sigh and worry♫

595
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,980
Lunatic! He's a lunatic!

596
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,870
Court!

597
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,990
Officers of the third class,

598
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,790
please take a seat on both sides.

599
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,990
The lunatic hit me!

600
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,430
Get up!

601
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,790
The lunatic hit me!

602
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,850
-He hit me!
-Get up!

603
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,800
Go, let's all go.

604
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,600
The lunatic hit me!

605
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,350
He hit me!

606
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,280
Let's go.

607
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:11,920
Let's go.

608
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,910
We will go.

609
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,400
We will go, we will go.

610
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,310
We will go.

611
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,410
Meet His Majesty!

612
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,080
Shou Ren,

613
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,480
where have you been?

614
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,660
Where did you go?

615
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,220
I have been looking for you.

616
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,600
Who are you?

617
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,800
Don't you recognize your father?

618
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,560
How dare you!

619
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,940
I am the Elder Master.

620
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,550
I'm a court official.

621
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,510
I want to see His Majesty.

622
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,150
I have something to report.

623
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,910
My dear Elder Master,

624
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,500
let's go home.

625
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,510
Everyone has been looking for you.

626
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,950
Everyone has been looking for you.

627
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,750
Let's go back.

628
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,660
Go back?

629
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,470
Shoo!

630
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:47,840
Shouren!

631
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,870
Tell me.

632
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,660
Where can Shouren go?

633
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,840
We've searched the whole town,

634
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,100
but there was absolutely no news.

635
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,350
Wake up.

636
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,970
I'm talking to you.

637
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,720
The guests are gone.

638
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,050
What are you doing here?

639
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,740
I have calculated.

640
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,040
If we can

641
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,550
pull in a bit more business for the restaurant this month,

642
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,270
and with the money we have saved up earlier,

643
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,270
we will have enough to buy the store.

644
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,210
Have you decided?

645
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,190
Yes.

646
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,040
All these years,

647
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,670
we have nothing to give Ye'er.

648
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,270
Yes.

649
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,910
If we can buy the store,

650
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,510
Ye'er can be a rouge,

651
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,860
and do something else if she wants.

652
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,120
Think of it as dowry.

653
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,150
Okay.

654
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,430
When...

655
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,590
When that store officially opens,

656
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,470
I'll go help our daughter.

657
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,890
You can stay here

658
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,080
and help Man'er on your own.

659
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:47,930
No.

660
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,310
Man'er.

661
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,750
How's things, Man'er?

662
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,070
We've been walking all morning.

663
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,080
There are just no leads.

664
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,680
It's okay.

665
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,100
Take a rest.

666
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,790
Your uncle and I will go this afternoon.

667
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,140
It's time for court.

668
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,790
It's time for court!

669
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,310
Stop running!

670
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,190
Who is it?

671
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,870
Who's that?

672
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,740
That was definitely my father's voice.

673
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,530
Yes.

674
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,920
I heard it too.

675
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,680
It's time for court!

676
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,960
It's time for court.

677
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,000
It's time for court.

678
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,280
It's time for court.

679
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,990
It's time for court.

680
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,470
-Uncle Shouren?
-Eldest Brother?

681
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,310
Father!

682
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,630
Where did you find him?

683
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,500
In front of the government office.

684
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,440
Stop babbling.

685
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,400
Chase after him!

686
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,150
Go!

687
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,910
Shouyi.

688
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,700
After him!

689
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,130
[One Fresh Move]

690
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,780
Go!

691
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,270
What are they doing?

692
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,530
Screaming up and down?

693
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,790
Elder Brother!

694
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,030
Shouren!

695
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,530
Uncle Shouren!

696
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,930
Shouren!

697
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,910
Shouyi!

698
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,840
I can't take it anymore.

699
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm dying.

700
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,290
Quick! We are catching up!

701
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,770
He's too good at running.

702
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,010
Let's have pork knuckle later.

703
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,490
Hurry.

704
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,550
Report!

705
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,990
Report!

706
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,600
Report!

707
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,500
Report!

708
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,350
Uncle Shouren!

709
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:07,990
Uncle Shouren!

710
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,800
Stop! Wait!

711
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,830
Dad, listen.

712
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,160
Brother is definitely in good health.

713
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,220
You can be rest assured now.

714
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,470
Let's forget about it, okay?

715
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,940
Let's go.

716
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,510
Chase him down!

717
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:16,970
Father!

718
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,890
Father!

719
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,700
Eldest Brother!

720
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,430
Father!

721
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,470
Where did they run to?

722
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,310
Father!

723
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,420
Uncle Shouren!

724
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,280
Eldest Brother!

725
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,140
Uncle, can we please stop running?

726
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,270
It's time for court.

727
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,280
It's time for court.

728
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,790
Shouren.

729
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,110
It's time for court.

730
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,150
-Come with me.
-It's time for court.

731
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,630
Go back.

732
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,510
It's time for court.

733
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,650
-Come with me.
-It's time for court.

734
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,290
Grandpa.

735
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,110
It's time for court!

736
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,650
Uncle Shouren,

737
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,800
do you live here?

738
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,750
What?

739
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,230
He lives here?

740
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,870
-This is too...
-It's time for court.

741
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,100
It's time for court.

742
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,070
Hua'er.

743
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,910
Hua'er, your father...

744
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,470
Gu.

745
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,740
Let me do it.

746
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,180
Why are all of you here?

747
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,340
Father happened to meet Eldest Brother

748
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,750
in front of the government office today,

749
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,350
so we followed him here.

750
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,950
Otherwise,

751
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,000
we wouldn't have come to know that

752
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,660
you guys are living like this.

753
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,510
It's freezing.

754
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,070
How can you spend the winter here?

755
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,830
Yes.

756
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,350
Gu,

757
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,910
why are you guys

758
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,040
living here?

759
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,020
Don't touch it.

760
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,010
Don't touch it.

761
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,640
Don't touch it.

762
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,280
Hailong's brother

763
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,680
worked for Wu Zhonglian.

764
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,270
Although he died,

765
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,480
we can't escape from the punishment.

766
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,620
The government has confiscated

767
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,990
the Song family's residence and business.

768
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,650
Many people were implicated.

769
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,070
Fortunately, Madam Song said

770
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,670
Hailong is not her biological son.

771
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,320
And he's not like his brother,

772
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,950
who did

773
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,350
all of those evil things.

774
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,990
That's why the government

775
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,450
left a way out for Hailong.

776
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,830
Look at your brother.

777
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,560
He's gone crazy.

778
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,570
Naturally, he lost his position as an official.

779
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,630
We don't have any money.

780
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,620
Tell me,

781
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,680
where can we go?

782
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,860
Now,

783
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,910
I'm just glad

784
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,360
we have this bowl of porridge.

785
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,210
Aunt Gu,

786
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,800
why didn't you tell us

787
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,260
when things have already come to this state?

788
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
When my mother previously asked

789
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,710
you guys for help take care of my father,

790
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,240
did any of you offer to help?

791
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:43,790
I'm back.

792
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,660
Grandpa.

793
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,110
Man'er.

794
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,800
Uncle Shouyi, Aunt He.

795
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,610
Why are all of you here?

796
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,270
Mother.

797
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,640
This...

798
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,130
Don't buy any medicine for your father

799
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,380
from now on.

800
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,130
It costs too much money.

801
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,340
It doesn't matter.

802
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,590
As long as the physician said that

803
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,720
if it's possible to treat, we'll do it.

804
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,280
Grandpa,

805
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,920
we didn't know you would come.

806
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,570
There's nothing

807
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,040
we could offer at home.

808
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:29,410
Sorry, everyone.

809
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,680
Have a seat.

810
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,420
We won't.

811
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,440
Your mother-in-law

812
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,450
has explained your family's situation to us just now.

813
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,710
What are you going to do

814
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,630
in the future?

815
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,420
I want to find a job.

816
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,260
But now,

817
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,050
everyone in the town

818
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,540
is fearful of the fact that I'm from the Song family.

819
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,800
No one dares to hire me.

820
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,480
But it's okay.

821
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,030
Grandpa,

822
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,960
I believe

823
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,720
they will

824
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,340
forget about this very soon.

825
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,370
By then,

826
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,430
I can earn money to support my family.

827
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,570
Work?

828
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,510
Can... can you do it?

829
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,180
Why not?

830
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,610
For Hua'er,

831
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,900
Mother,

832
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,700
Father,

833
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:18,660
I will have to do it,

834
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,140
no?

835
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,530
Come home.

836
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,190
As long as I have something to eat,

837
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,970
I won't starve you.

838
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,000
No need.

839
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,630
We're doing relatively well now.

840
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,980
It's getting late.

841
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,280
You should all go back and rest.

842
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,030
Hua'er.

843
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,550
Brother-in-law,

844
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,850
let me speak to Hua'er.

845
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,770
[Mission: 1,000 gold]

846
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,770
[Restaurant income: 4,648 taels]

847
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,770
[Restaurant operations expenses: 138 taels]

848
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,770
[Two taels left before meeting the mission target]
