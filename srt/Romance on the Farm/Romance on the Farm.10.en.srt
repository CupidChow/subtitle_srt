4
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,460
My chickens...

5
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,600
How dare you split?

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,650
How dare you build a wall?

7
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,180
I won't pay you.

8
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,350
How long will it take for you

9
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,350
to finish fixing the wall like this?

10
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,670
What else can I do?

11
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,380
If my parents wake up and see it,

12
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,840
they'll feel upset again.

13
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,130
Stop it.

14
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,870
I have a better idea.

15
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,890
What is it?

16
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,750
What are you laughing at?

17
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,640
I didn't expect

18
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,110
to be able to meet you here.

19
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,020
What do you mean?

20
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,020
At least I'll have

21
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,730
a place to stay now.

22
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,100
It's good to have these roses.

23
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,670
Okay.

24
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,280
This way, even if the wall collapses,

25
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,980
your parents won't be upset.

26
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,110
Finally, we're done splitting the house.

27
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,910
In the future,

28
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,310
I can make money without worries.

29
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,570
Go back to sleep.

30
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,100
I have something to do tomorrow.

98

Take it.

99
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,870
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

100
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,570
Miss Lian, Mr. Shen,

101
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,450
have you thought about

102
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,290
selling the recipe for

103
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,870
the garlic peanuts?

104
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,110
There are more and more people

105
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,180
who like these peanuts.

106
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,980
We've sold peanuts

107
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,360
to many restaurants and stalls.

108
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,480
I want to make more money with this.

109
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,120
If others can figure out

110
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,700
a recipe for even tastier peanuts,

111
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,620
then your recipe

112
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,080
won't be special anymore.

113
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,290
Why don't you

114
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,740
sell this recipe to me now?

115
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,670
You can make money and buy more land

116
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,450
so that you won't have to work so hard all day.

117
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:08,950
Mr. Zhang,

118
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,770
if our recipe

119
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,140
is so easy to figure out,

120
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,580
you wouldn't be here

121
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,980
persuading us to sell it.

122
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,120
We're from the countryside. We're not afraid of hard work.

123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,150
With this recipe,

124
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,280
we can make more money every year.

125
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,420
It's a long-term business.

126
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,550
It's a good thing

127
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,600
for both of us.

128
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,870
Don't you think so?

129
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,700
Fine.

130
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,690
In the future,

131
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,480
if you change your mind,

132
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,620
come to me first.

133
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,710
Sure.

134
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,340
What time is it now?

135
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,230
You haven't started cooking.

136
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,100
Do you want to starve the whole family to death?

137
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,980
Take a look at the village.

138
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,610
See if any other daughter-in-law is as lazy as you.

139
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,220
Back then,

140
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,040
when I was a daughter-in-law...

141
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,710
Your mother is reminiscing about the past again.

142
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,460
Where is the eldest daughter-in-law?

143
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,460
Come out and work!

144
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,980
Are you waiting for me

145
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,260
to invite you out?

146
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,960
Coming, Mother.

147
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,120
Coming.

148
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,620
Honey,

149
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,330
when are we

150
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,440
going back to town?

151
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,220
When we first came here,

152
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,500
we agreed

153
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,180
to only stay here for a few days.

154
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,870
We were supposed to return after the harvest.

155
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,540
But now,

156
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,650
we're still staying here.

157
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,400
Winter is coming.

158
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,520
Your youngest brother

159
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,140
and his family split away from us.

160
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,670
Shouyi's wife is pregnant.

161
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,870
Your mother is still furious

162
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,440
about the family splitting.

163
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,100
I'm the only one she can order around.

164
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,990
She scrutinizes me all day.

165
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,310
How can I bear this torture?

166
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,650
Let go.

167
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,820
Do you remember

168
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,620
what you promised

169
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,500
my family

170
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,910
when you proposed to me?

171
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,850
You said you were going to become an official soon

172
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,780
and I would be the official's wife.

173
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,750
In the future,

174
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,590
I would enjoy endless glory

175
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,830
and wealth.

176
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,700
You even swore that

177
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,020
you would never

178
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,530
never let me suffer

179
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,230
or feel wronged in the future.

180
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,460
But look.

181
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,060
Look here.

182
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,680
Here. And here.

183
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,110
Mother, have some tea.

184
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,460
Mother.

185
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,150
I have something

186
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,400
to tell you.

187
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,290
The festival is over.

188
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,830
The harvest is done too.

189
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,170
Tomorrow,

190
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,270
I'm going back to town.

191
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
First, I want to calm down and study.

192
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,760
Second,

193
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,540
I want to find a school

194
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,200
and get a tutoring job.

195
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,450
Okay, go back now.

196
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,840
Don't delay your work.

197
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,070
Yes, Mother.

198
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,930
I'll go back and pack my things.

199
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,070
Come back. Only Shouren needs to go.

200
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,070
You'll stay here.

201
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,000
Shouyi's wife is pregnant.

202
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,190
If you don't stay here and work,

203
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,640
do you want me

204
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,800
to serve the whole family instead?

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,220
Mother.

206
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,620
She has to go.

207
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,950
If she doesn't go back with me,

208
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,990
who will do the laundry and cook for me?

209
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,350
Who will clean my house?

210
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,260
Besides,

211
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,630
don't you always

212
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,990
want a grandson?

213
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,760
If you keep her here,

214
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,060
how will you

215
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,590
get your grandson?

216
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,830
I've made up my mind.

217
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,420
I know what she's capable of.

218
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,460
Laundry and cooking?

219
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,030
Do you think I'm a fool?

220
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,010
She didn't learn anything good in town,

221
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,980
only those dirty tricks.

222
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,960
Not only did she lead Hua'er astray,

223
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,470
she even implicated Xiu'er.

224
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,420
Stay with me

225
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,430
and learn

226
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,600
how to manage the family.

227
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,460
You can go back

228
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,930
when you have learned it.

229
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,410
As for Hua'er, I don't care if she

230
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,430
leaves or stays.

231
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,340
Mother.

232
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,380
If you have no time to tend to your house,

233
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,280
when you return to town,

234
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,770
just hire a maid.

235
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,710
I'll give you five taels later.

236
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,610
Why are you just standing here

237
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,220
like a block of wood?

238
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,390
Go and feed the pigs,

239
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,680
sweep the yards,

240
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,960
and wash the vegetables in the backyard.

241
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,190
Go.

242
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,710
Mother.

243
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,750
Are you really not going to see Father off?

244
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,480
Why should I?

245
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,030
He has no conscience.

246
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,190
He left me

247
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,220
just like that.

248
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,690
What?

249
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,940
Am I supposed to put on a smile,

250
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,530
chase after him, and beg him

251
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,640
to let me serve him?

252
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,470
He.

253
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,620
Look, I'm clumsy and busy.

254
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,740
You are always so efficient

255
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,750
when you work.

256
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,060
Why don't you give me a hand?

257
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,580
Gu.

258
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,700
it's not that I don't want to help.

259
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,880
It's just that

260
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm pregnant.

261
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,950
I can't stand the smell of oil and smoke.

262
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,680
I just came in to get some water.

263
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,240
Enjoy your water then.

264
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,840
Isn't this Hua'er?

265
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,350
Finally, you stopped hiding in your room

266
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,860
and came out to see people.

267
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,040
Are you feeling better?

268
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,870
Ignore her.

269
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,230
Mother.

270
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,770
I...

271
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,790
Shouren's wife.

272
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,080
Are you stupid

273
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,200
or just clumsy?

274
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,600
The food is burnt.

275
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,930
Look at you.

276
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,070
You're so troublesome.

277
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,380
I can't look away for a single moment.

278
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,230
You need to

279
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,700
learn from He.

280
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,570
She's more competent in her work.

281
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,090
Seriously.

282
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,550
Is the sun rising from the west today?

283
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,990
Didn't you say you couldn't stand oil and smoke?

284
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,400
Why are you still here?

285
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,330
I'm leaving.

286
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,010
Right away.

287
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,810
You're right.

288
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,590
The pot is burnt.

289
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,630
Grandma.

290
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,339
It's not winter yet.

291
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,500
Aunt He is wearing so many layers.

292
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,010
Isn't she hot?

293
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,230
She's just fat.

294
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,230
Mother.

295
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,040
Easy does it.

296
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,200
How much did we make this time?

297
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,730
According to the amount

298
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,700
confirmed with the restaurants,

299
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,790
we still have to make more.

300
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,320
We need to buy some peanuts.

301
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,100
We still have some money.

302
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,360
Let's buy some more.

303
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,730
Why don't you buy it from your grandpa?

304
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,660
If my grandma knows

305
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,540
we are selling garlic peanuts to make money,

306
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,070
she'll make trouble again.

307
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,970
We sold it so openly.

308
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,460
All the restaurants know that

309
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,060
Miss Lian is doing business.

310
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,030
But your grandparents don't know?

311
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,130
We just split from the family.

312
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,730
My grandma must be furious.

313
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,220
She has no time for us.

314
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,910
Stop!

315
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,870
Mother! Mother!

316
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,310
Mother, listen to me.

317
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,030
I didn't want my belly to be cold

318
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,310
so I wrapped a cloth around it.

319
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,670
Be careful of my baby.

320
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,120
Even if you're actually pregnant,

321
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,250
I'll still beat you up, you lazy woman!

322
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:11,870
Mother!

323
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,260
You're right.

324
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,510
I'll beat you.

325
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:17,990
Come on.

326
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,170
You lazy woman!

327
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,170
People over there.

328
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,030
Stop working. Go over there.

329
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,700
Don't waste time.

330
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,710
Got it.

331
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,710
Hurry up.

332
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,470
Come here.

333
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,400
Come here.

334
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,230
Tell the people behind to hurry up.

335
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,370
Those below.

336
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,180
Come up.

337
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,240
Hurry up.

338
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,650
Why are the officials here?

339
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,850
Let's talk when everyone is here.

340
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,400
Come on.

341
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,140
The tax is

342
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,230
10 taels.

343
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,930
Ten taels?

344
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,690
That much?

345
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,330
Didn't we already pay the land

346
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,820
and head tax this year?

347
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,280
The higher-ups have issued a new order.

348
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,740
The treasury is empty now.

349
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,470
It demands the people

350
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,000
to pay another poll tax.

351
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,430
Besides,

352
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,860
your field was originally

353
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,390
under Scholar Lian's name,

354
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,510
so the taxation amount was reduced.

355
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,910
But now your field

356
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,700
is no longer under Scholar Lian's name.

357
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,430
Naturally,

358
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,190
the land tax cannot be reduced.

359
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,380
But we got a poor field.

360
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,450
How can we be taxed the same amount

361
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,310
as rich fields?

362
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,440
No matter the fields

363
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,930
or the yields,

364
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,090
you have to pay.

365
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,470
Magistrate.

366
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,110
His Majesty has always been considerate of the people.

367
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,910
Why would he issue such an order?

368
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,720
He cares about the people.

369
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,600
Who told you that?

370
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,390
Go and argue with them instead.

371
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,600
Enough.

372
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,610
I have to go to the next village.

373
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,000
Hurry and pay up.

374
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,550
Where do we get so much money?

375
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,860
We have no money. We just paid recently.

376
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,500
Father.

377
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,470
I spent all the money I have

378
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,540
to buy peanuts.

379
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:30,900
Sir,

380
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,770
can you give us a few days?

381
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,760
No delays.

382
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,150
If you can't pay,

383
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,150
your leader

384
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,790
has to go back to the government office with us.

385
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,030
Can you be reasonable?

386
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,700
Why are you arresting him?

387
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,540
This...

388
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,960
Be reasonable.

389
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,440
How can you arrest people?

390
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,440
But now,

391
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,180
we really can't fork out

392
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,910
10 taels.

393
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,930
How about this?

394
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,760
We have some dried fruits,

395
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,960
chickens, and ducks.

396
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,740
Can we pay with that instead?

397
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,830
We just split houses,

398
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,950
and this is all we have left.

399
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,980
Why is the tax so heavy?

400
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,950
Not every place is the same.

401
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,470
Ever since His Majesty took the throne,

402
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,930
he has always insisted on minimizing taxes.

403
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,910
I didn't expect that over here,

404
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,470
the local officials pretend to be obedient

405
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,600
and secretly come up with so many ways

406
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
to extort the people.

407
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,440
The taxation here is far higher

408
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,850
than the amount submitted to the imperial government.

409
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,180
Most of the silver

410
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,060
must have ended up

411
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,120
in the pockets of corrupt officials.

412
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,310
How do you know so much?

413
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,010
I heard about it when

414
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,360
I went to the capital in the past.

415
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,260
I thought there was someone above you.

416
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,070
The life of ordinary people here

417
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,000
is so miserable.

418
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,810
I want to go back.

419
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,550
Where will you go back to?

420
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,690
Another world.

421
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,870
A world on a star.

422
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,740
There,

423
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,270
there are no exorbitant taxes.

424
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,120
In fact, subsidies are distributed

425
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,250
when disasters and accidents happen.

426
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,910
It has advanced agricultural technology.

427
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,330
You can plant crops

428
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,090
without bending over the soil.

429
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,240
Are you having a fever?

430
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm not.

431
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,070
I'm telling the truth.

432
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,810
I was...

433
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,480
Go and dry the peanuts.

434
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,930
People in the restaurants are waiting.

435
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,010
Right.

436
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,980
When the garlic peanuts

437
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,820
make it big

438
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,340
and make a lot of money,

439
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,260
this little money

440
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,590
wouldn't hurt anymore.

441
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,590
Are you that confident?

442
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,930
Are you not confident?

443
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,860
Are you not confident

444
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,120
in our garlic peanuts?

445
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,410
I guess I am.

446
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,550
The crops are rotten.

447
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,810
Did the officials go to your house?

448
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,880
Yes.

449
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,810
The taxation is

450
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,540
getting higher over the years.

451
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,380
Yes. They almost

452
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,310
took away the pot and utensils too.

453
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,550
My family too.

454
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,090
We've paid land tax for a whole season.

455
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,350
Now we have to pay again.

456
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,200
Don't you think it's too much?

457
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,060
Exactly.

458
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,120
Mother, have some peanuts.

459
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,660
I have bad teeth. It's hard to eat.

460
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,560
You can have it.

461
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,990
Mother, try it.

462
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,030
It's really good.

463
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,530
No need.

464
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,860
You can have it.

465
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,970
Mother, try it.

466
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,430
This is really different.

467
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,300
I bought it yesterday.

468
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,330
It's really good. Just try it.

469
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,620
No need. Save it for yourself.

470
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,060
Mother, I've peeled them for you.

471
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,180
Try it.

472
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,420
Try it, Mother.

473
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,340
It's really delicious.

474
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:12,850
No need.

475
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,460
You have it.

476
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:13,900
Try it.

477
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,960
I have good teeth. I'll eat.

478
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,430
These peanuts are so good.

479
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,980
If not for the additional taxes,

480
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,390
we could have bought two bags of these too.

481
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,980
You don't need to buy them.

482
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,500
What do you mean?

483
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,860
Isn't this made by

484
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,120
Man'er of your family?

485
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,980
They sell really well in restaurants.

486
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,840
We have to wait in line to buy them.

487
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,710
Yes.

488
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,830
Let me peel some more for you.

489
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:55,600
Oh no.

490
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,600
Oh no.

491
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,720
What's wrong now?

492
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,180
Look at you.

493
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,810
I forgot I have

494
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,410
family matters to attend to.

495
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,670
I have to go.

496
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,340
It's always your family.

497
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,760
You are so troublesome.

498
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,300
You always have things to do.

499
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,740
It tastes so good.

500
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,620
Eat up.

501
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,990
What's wrong?

502
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,500
Your tooth fell out?

503
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,220
I see how it is.

504
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,700
We don't have enough vegetables, so we're cooking stones now.

505
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,320
All our money went to paying taxes.

506
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,920
Don't eat if it's too little.

507
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,600
What are you doing?

508
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,670
Saving some for my wife so she doesn't starve.

509
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,810
She won't die if she starves a little.

510
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,420
What took you so long?

511
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,660
Let's eat.

512
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,680
Our food

513
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,000
is too shabby

514
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,400
compared to Shouxin's family.

515
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,140
He.

516
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,920
Did you have dinner with Shouxin?

517
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,160
His family had

518
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,060
stir-fried eggs with chives, eggplant with minced meat,

519
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,980
stewed ribs, and...

520
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,700
Pork ribs?

521
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,510
Shouyi, listen.

522
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,750
Although the ribs were stewed,

523
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,180
they tasted so good.

524
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,210
Smell it. It still smells like ribs.

525
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,500
What else?

526
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,540
And stewed chicken,

527
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,600
stir-fried pork with mushrooms,

528
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,480
and tofu.

529
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,300
Dishes cooked with meat and seasoning

530
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,220
taste so good.

531
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,150
I've never eaten

532
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,940
such delicious dishes

533
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,060
and drank such delicious soup before.

534
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,950
The dishes smelled and tasted so good.

535
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,350
You...

536
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,410
Mother, stop talking.

537
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,590
Sit down and eat.

538
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,360
I can't eat. I'm full.

539
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,580
Where did Shouxin's family

540
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,050
get the money to buy ribs?

541
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,070
Don't they need to pay taxes?

542
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,060
Their family is not short of money.

543
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,300
Man'er has been selling

544
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,370
garlic peanuts recently.

545
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,800
They sell very well.

546
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,670
She even gave me a pack.

547
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,900
Let me try.

548
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,860
When Shouxin wanted to

549
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,160
split from the family,

550
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,670
I was worried about them.

551
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,540
I was wondering how

552
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,220
they would make a living in the future.

553
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,160
I didn't expect

554
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,670
our girl Man'er

555
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,190
to be so capable.

556
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,290
They just split from us

557
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,360
and already

558
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,140
thought of a way to make money.

559
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,640
Shouxin and the others

560
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,070
looked so honest.

561
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,390
I didn't expect

562
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,240
them to be so capable

563
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,550
of earning money.

564
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,390
Mother,

565
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,350
you can rest assured now.

566
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,480
It's delicious.

567
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,560
Delicious.

568
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,230
Shouxin.

569
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,210
Mother.

570
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,750
Come out!

571
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:14,940
Mother.

572
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,110
Why did you call me here?

573
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,420
What's wrong?

574
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,290
Are you so busy that you can only

575
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,090
come here if something is wrong?

576
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,680
Mother.

577
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,120
That's not what I meant.

578
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,580
You made a lot of money selling peanuts recently.

579
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,190
Every time I see you returning from the market,

580
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,300
you're holding

581
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,990
either a fish or a big piece of meat.

582
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,710
Man'er started a small business

583
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,810
and made some money.

584
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,670
The money she earned

585
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,360
is only enough to buy some food

586
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,180
to snack on.

587
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,730
What are you afraid of?

588
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,230
I won't borrow money from you

589
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,620
even if I have to beg for food.

590
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,350
Don't worry.

591
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,990
Don't say that.

592
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,410
You didn't ask me for anything.

593
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,940
But if you do,

594
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,980
I should be filial and give it to you.

595
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,500
Fine.

596
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,540
Give me

597
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,000
the recipe for the garlic peanuts.

598
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,790
Give it to me.

599
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
No, Mother.

600
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,110
I don't know

601
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,830
the recipe for the garlic peanuts.

602
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,470
Well done, San'er.

603
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,330
You've become smarter.

604
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,150
Now you know how to fool me.

605
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,470
No.

606
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,380
I really don't know.

607
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,050
Don't think I don't know that

608
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,290
the garlic peanuts

609
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,850
were invented before our families split up.

610
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,230
You want to earn money without telling me and your father?

611
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,140
I've never thought about that.

612
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,140
I should have strangled you to death

613
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,220
before you were born.

614
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,370
Then you wouldn't be treating me

615
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,330
like a thief right now.

616
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,220
I'm so disappointed.

617
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,440
Mother, I...

618
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,110
Sister, what should we do?

619
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,110
Don't worry.

620
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,260
Let me think about it.

621
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,620
Go get Grandpa.

622
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,270
Hurry up.

623
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,840
I already have

624
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,550
one leg in the coffin.

625
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,490
Mother.

626
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,710
I'm going to town

627
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,600
to have tea with my friends later.

628
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,260
You've been working hard lately.

629
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,590
Do you need me

630
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,870
to bring you anything?

631
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,370
It's okay. Go by yourself.

632
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,050
Sit. Why is your grandma kicking up a fuss again?

633
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,220
I told Grandma this morning that

634
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,110
my friends in town mentioned it before.

635
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,520
Uncle Shouxin's family started

636
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,290
selling garlic peanuts a long time ago.

637
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,950
It has been sold all over the town.

638
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,550
Actually, the recipe for garlic peanuts

639
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,390
was created before we split up.

640
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,900
Logically speaking,

641
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,710
this recipe

642
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,100
belongs to the entire Lian family.

643
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,340
If Grandma gets it,

644
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,910
we can do business too.

645
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,900
Life must be better than now.

646
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,390
You.

647
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,120
You don't care that your parents are

648
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,270
eating coarse grains and vegetables.

649
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,920
I care, I care.

650
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,550
You have no conscience.

651
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you trying to kill us?

652
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,930
What are you doing?

653
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,940
Man'er. Get up.

654
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,260
Man'er.

655
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,990
Stop it.

656
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,990
Mother, get up.

657
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,850
Don't touch me.

658
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,420
Can we

659
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,650
live in peace for a few days?

660
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,190
Do you have to lure the villagers here

661
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,200
and laugh at us

662
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,920
so you would feel better?

663
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,620
No.

664
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,040
Go back to your room.

665
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,870
It's embarrassing.

666
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,300
Mother, let's go back in.

667
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,180
All right, you guys go back too.

668
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,250
No one will ask you for the recipe.

669
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,960
I've never been at peace.

670
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,970
Why are you crying?

671
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,600
I didn't do anything wrong.

672
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Let's go, Father.

673
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,360
A dream by the West Lake.

674
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,260
I had everything in my dream.

675
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,870
There is everything.

676
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,020
A pretty girl fell from the sky.

677
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,990
You can play with her in the rain.

678
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,180
As expected of

679
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,980
the daughter of the magistrate.

680
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,020
This tea is

681
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,960
like lotus flowers blooming among snowflakes,

682
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,450
refreshing and refined.

683
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,130
You're about to get married.

684
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,600
The tea you made is so delicious.

685
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,020
Your in-laws must be so happy.

686
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,630
Really?

687
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,270
My engagement with Young Master Song

688
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,320
is happening soon too.

689
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,110
It seems that our wedding dates

690
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,660
will be close to each other.

691
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,080
What do you mean by ours?

692
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,700
Please enjoy.

693
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,410
These garlic peanuts

694
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,910
have been popular lately.

695
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,600
I ordered it in advance

696
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,719
so we could have it today.

697
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,780
I only managed to buy it a few times too.

698
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,989
But I heard that

699
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,400
the peanuts

700
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,139
were made by Hua'er's cousin.

701
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,630
Your cousin made these peanuts?

702
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,630
My cousin earned a lot of money

703
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,400
selling these garlic peanuts.

704
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,580
Even so,

705
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,380
I've been worried about it.

706
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,690
Why?

707
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm just worried that

708
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,280
my cousin

709
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,420
shows her face too much

710
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,820
doing business outside.

711
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,050
How will she get married in the future?

712
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,580
It's really inappropriate.

713
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,780
I tried to persuade her several times,

714
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,040
but she didn't listen.

715
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,739
She's running the garlic peanuts

716
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,940
business in secret

717
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,429
without telling our family.

718
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,330
I'm afraid this will upset

719
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,730
the elders of the family,

720
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,570
so I dare not tell them either.

721
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,270
I'm out of ideas.

722
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,130
I wonder...

723
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,330
Sister.

724
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,390
Sister, do you have any idea?

725
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,250
It's easy.

726
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,550
Leave it to me.

727
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,790
Thank you, Sister.

728
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,520
I brought you

729
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,600
a small gift.

730
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,170
Please accept it.

731
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,290
This lame thing?

732
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,540
Even the maids at home are tired of it.

733
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,940
How dare she gift it to me?

734
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,940
Then why did you accept it

735
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,740
and promise to help her?

736
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,540
I have nothing to do anyway.

737
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,620
Why not find some fun?

738
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,820
Besides,

739
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,990
do you think Lian Hua'er has good intentions?

740
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,880
She just wants to use us

741
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,470
to deal with her cousin.

742
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,940
How do you know?

743
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,880
If she really cared about

744
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,240
her cousin's reputation,

745
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,700
she wouldn't tell us this.

746
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,890
I have a fun idea.

747
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,190
Are you Lian Man'er?

748
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,210
You didn't report your garlic peanuts business

749
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,320
to the government.

750
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,610
How dare you do business without a business document?

751
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,750
You sure are bold.

752
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,830
Pay the tax you missed out on.

753
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,630
100 taels.

754
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,910
100 taels?

755
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,210
Are you crazy?

756
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,670
You might as well rob us.

757
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,910
Magistrate,

758
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,200
do you have any

759
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,420

761
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,470
How dare you ask me for an official document?

762
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,530
Within three days,

763
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,960

764
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,830
As far as I know,

765
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,780
we only need to report to the government

766
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,250
if we're doing business in a foreign land.

767
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,220
The business volume must exceed 30 taels

768
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,750
to qualify for tax payment.

769
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,690
This is just a small business.

770
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,020
Do we need to report it to the government?

771
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,750
Besides, according to our law,

772
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,270
whoever gets more than 50 taels of fine

773
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,670
will be given seven days.

774
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,960
I wonder how you

775
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,830
came up with the three-day limit?

776
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,560
Cut the crap.

777
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,360
If you can't deliver the money in three days,

778
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,620
you'll be imprisoned.

779
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,420
Imprisoned for how long?

780
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,620

782
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,420
You're not going to jail.

783
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,740

I don't want to waste time talking to you.

786

788
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,500
I'm just a vegetable seller.

789
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,360
Why do I need a business document?

790
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,660
The tax collectors

791
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,430

792
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,880
There's no end to it.

793

If the local government officials

794
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,440
get some power,

795
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,090
they will do whatever they want.

796
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,430
They don't give the people a way out.

797
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,470
Without the business document,

798
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,600
I can't do anything.

800
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,680
100 taels of silver?

802
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,830
My father went to another town to collect debts.

803
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,170

807

810

I...

812
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,910
I just want to borrow some money

813
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,770
from Mr. Laojin for an emergency.

814
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,690

00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,020
I didn't report my garlic peanuts business

to the government.

819
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,370
The government officer gave me a fine

820
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,170
of 100 tales.

821
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,520

I have some money here.

824
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,620
It's not enough for 100 taels.

825
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,480
Take it for now.

826
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,710
Thank you, Youheng.

827
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,430
I'll pay you back when I have the money.

828

No hurry.

829
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,270
I'll think of a way to get more.

Youheng, do you think this matter is strange?

831
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,100
Although

832
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,540
we do need to report businesses to the government,
