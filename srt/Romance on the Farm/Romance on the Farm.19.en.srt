Lady Hua'er,

5
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,490
I saw that Boss Wu

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,310
went to Lian Man'er's restaurant just now.

7
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,050
The wagon of vegetables

8
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,910
was pulled to her restaurant too.

9
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,690
Alright, I got it.

10
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,509
You may leave.

11
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,170
Honey,

12
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,210
your sister

13
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,180
is quite smart.

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,660
Where did she get so many

15
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,120

16
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,140
No.

17
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,050
Why are you complimenting others

18
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,510
to ruin your own prestige?

19
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm not blaming you,

20
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,150
but why didn’t you go up

21
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,210
to Boss Wu just now?

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,230
I don't dare.

23
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,230
Why not?

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,490
You just have to

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,090
I'm just worried for you.

29
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,740
Have you forgotten what I told you?

30
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,630
As long as

31

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,870
not only will we get a foothold in the household,

33

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,620

35
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,340
Hua'er, it's okay.

36
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,940
There are more chances.

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,660
Master Wu,

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,250
these two are indeed

39
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,130
quite capable,

40
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,260
especially that young man surnamed Shen.

41
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,430
Although he is a farmer,

42
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,470
he doesn't look

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,280

Why didn't you call them here?

143
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,280

197
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,070
You've been squatting there all morning.

198
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,330
You're still not done?

199
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,200
Mother, I...

200
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,320
My stomach hurts so much.

201
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,230
I can't stand up, Mother.

202
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,030
Who told you to eat alone?

203
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,790
You deserve it.

204
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,560
What happened to me?

205
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,920
Grandma, who's inside?

206
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,060
I want to go to the toilet.

207
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,710
Your mother.

208
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,970
She's been squatting there all morning.

209
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,590
Why are you all vomiting and have diarrhea?

210
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,900
Open the door, Lian Man'er!

211
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,650
Lian Man'er, come out!

212
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,520
Come out!

213
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,650
Lian Man'er!

214
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,280
Lian Man'er!

215
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,520
Lian Man'er.

216
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,120
She's out.

217
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,360
Lian Man'er.

218
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,760
Everyone,

219
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,070
what’s wrong?

220
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,960
You're asking us what's wrong?

221
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,300
What did you give us

222
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,720
to eat at the restaurant last night?

223
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,200
Yes.

224
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,750
What did we eat?

225
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,690
Nothing.

226
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,950
Dongpo pork knuckles,

227
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,710
stewed fish,

228
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,710
stir-fried bamboo shoots,

229
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,230
cooked greens...

230
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,890
Man'er.

231
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:39,950
You still have time

232
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,080
to recite your menu?

233
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,110
My diarrhea is so bad

234
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,240
that I'm almost leaking.

235
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,110
Everyone has diarrhea?

236
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,250
Yes.

237
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,120
After coming back last night,

238
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,710
I immediately started experiencing diarrhea.

239
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,350
I really couldn't stand it anymore,

240
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,350
so I came here this morning.

241
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,670
That's right.

242
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,490
Impossible.

243
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,600
I ate the food too.

244
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,080
Look,

245
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,350
I'm totally fine.

246
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,170
Do you think

247
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,850
we're lying to you?

248
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,310
There must be something wrong with your food.

249
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,840
Either

250
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,810
you treat us,

251
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,710
or

252
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,310
I'll report to the government immediately.

253
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,230
Report to the government immediately!

254
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,870
Don't get off topic.

255
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,600
Why are you talking about that?

256
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,100
What happened?

257
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,950
They said they have diarrhea and vomiting

258
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,110
after eating our food.

259
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,040
We got poisoned.

260
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,430
Quickly resolve this.

261
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,950
Calm down, everyone.

262
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,130
We will

263
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,690
definitely get to the bottom of this matter.

264
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,340
If it's truly

265
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,670
a problem with our food,

266
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,670
we will take full responsibility.

267
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,290
Look.

268
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,920
We can't waste any time.

269
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Hurry up.

270
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,400
Listen to me.

271
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,260
Miss Man'er

272
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,840
was kind to treat you all to a meal.

273
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,460
Man'er,

274
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,790
go find Wang Youheng.

275
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,230
-Don’t worry.
-Man'er, don’t go.

276
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,630
We will give you everyone an answer.

277
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,630
We will give you everyone an answer.

278
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,830
Youheng, come with me.

279
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,870
Man'er, where are we going?

280
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,830
Many people in the village are sick.

281
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,720
Come and have a look.

282
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,370
Man'er.

283
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,630
I...

284
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,910
I won't go.

285
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,110
Go to the town

286
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,170
and find a real doctor.

287
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,340
Are you still concerned about that matter?

288
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,840
Youheng,

289
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,850
if there were

290
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,340
another dying person lying in front of you

291
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,040
right now,

292
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,220
would you save them?

293
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,990
If you say no,

294
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,120
I'll leave immediately

295
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
and find another doctor.

296
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,760
But if you

297
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,970
have any hesitation,

298
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,350
that means you haven't given up.

299
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,590
Where are they?

300
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,230
Come on.

301
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,470
Ye'er, does it still hurt?

302
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,930
I feel much better.

303
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,250
I'm fine.

304
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,510
I'll put you down.

305
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,110
I really...

306
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,360
Don’t worry. Take a seat.

307
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,370
Shen Nuo!

308
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,600
Come here.

309
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,310
Youheng, here.

310
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,990
Check your Aunt He first.

311
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,680
Okay.

312
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,860
Come, Aunt He.

313
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,990
Let me check your pulse.

314
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,320
Hurry up and take a look.

315
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,580
Why are you two

316
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,320
able to get treated first?

317
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,080
Go away.

318
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
This is our child.

319
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,020
Youheng.

320
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,520
One by one.

321
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,830
Everyone will be treated.

322
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,540
Look at you.

323
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,280
Okay.

324
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm in a lot of pain too.

325
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,600
How is it?

326
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,760
I'll do acupuncture first.

327
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,960
I can't stand the constant

328
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,710
bathroom trips.

329
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,430
Give me acupuncture first.

330
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,820
It's urgent for me too.

331
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,680
Don't panic.

332
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,440
Calm down.

333
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,310
Calm down.

334
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,360
Hurry up.

335
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,080
It's urgent for me too.

336
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,840
One by one.

337
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,620
One by one.

338
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,070
One by one.

339
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:46,800
Okay.

340
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,430
One by one.

341
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,030
One by one.

342
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,990
We'll treat everyone.

343
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,870
Don't worry.

344
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,340
Don't panic.

345
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,200
One by one.

346
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,460
Don't panic.

347
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,010
Hurry up.

348
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,470
Okay.

349
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,740
What's going on?

350
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,320
Father.

351
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,700
They...

352
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,750
Don't panic.

353
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,780
Serious cases will get acupuncture.

354
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,230
Light cases can take the medicine

355
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,470
and the diarrhea can be stopped immediately.

356
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,990
Man'er,

357
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,520
find a way to get some fresh garlic.

358
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,120
Burn the garlic and peel the skin off to eat.

359
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,870
This can relieve diarrhea and stomachaches.

360
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,310
Hurry.

361
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,320
Okay.

362
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,350
Does garlic work?

363
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,410
Yeah, does it work?

364
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,230
Hurry up.

365
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,830
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

366
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,360
No hurry.

367
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,320
What are you waiting for?

368
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,830
Take off your shoes first.

369
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,110
Here.

370
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,480
No.

371
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Don't kill me from the acupuncture.

372
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,200
Don't.

373
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,590
Don't kill me from the acupuncture.

374
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,430
No, no, no.

375
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,480
Treat us.

376
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,360
I believe in Mr. Jin.

377
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,210
Give it to the others.

378
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,030
How is it?

379
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,050
How are you?

380
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Doctor, put it in.

381
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,400
Why aren't you moving?

382
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,290
Okay.

383
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,660
Don't panic.

384
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,280
It's okay.

385
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,750
Everyone will be treated.

386
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,710
Okay, can you walk?

387
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,630
Yes, I can.

388
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,830
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

389
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,580
Be careful.

390
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,230
Father.

391
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,820
Why are you...

392
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,430
I started studying medicine

393
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,110
when I was around 14 or 15,

394
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,250
but

395
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,950
I gave up in the end.

396
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,710
Son,

397
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,220
do you know

398
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,640
what doctors fear the most?

399
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,390
Maybe

400
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,920
it's to face death.

401
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,880
Death is the inevitable of life.

402
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,670
The scariest thing

403
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,270
is drowning in the pain of death

404
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,040
and losing one's vigor.

405
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,990
Back then, I gave up on being a doctor

406
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,150
because of that.

407
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,850
I didn't allow you to study medicine before.

408
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,650
I thought that practicing medicine

409
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,910
wasn't as good and easy

410
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,570
as collecting interest.

411
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,060
I didn't want you

412
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,520
to repeat my steps either,

413
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,750
but when I saw you

414
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,630
save people without hesitation,

415
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,630
I knew it.

416
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,850
You're better than me.

417
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,610
If you truly love this field,

418
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,990
don't give up.

419
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,960
You can't lose the chance

420
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,390
to heal the sick and dying

421
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,050
just because of one accident.

422
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,330
If one day,

423
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,820
you don't want to do this anymore,

424
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,980
I can still take care of you.

425
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,560
Mr. Laojin, Youheng,

426
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,270
thank you so much for today.

427
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,910
Without you two,

428
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,710
I wouldn't have known what to do.

429
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,390
But

430
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,810
I'm lucky today too.

431
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,150
I saw Mr. Laojin show off his skills,

432
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,480
and Youheng too.

433
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,630
Can you two determine

434
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,530
what the villagers ate

435
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,130
that caused this emergency?

436
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,670
I was in a hurry to save people earlier.

437
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,330
I forgot to tell you in detail.

438
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,330
When I checked their pulse,

439
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,130
I found their pulse was erratic.

440
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,130
The meal that Man'er invited

441
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:14,990
the villagers to eat yesterday

442
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,390
was all homemade dishes.

443
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,230
Logically,

444
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,070
it shouldn't cause

445
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,470
such serious consequences.

446
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,010
So,

447
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,880
there is only one possibility.

448
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,270
Someone poisoned

449
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,990
the food.

450
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,490
The symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea are obvious.

451
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,150
It's Rheum palmatum.

452
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,330
Rheum palmatum has weak toxicity and slow potency.

453
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,190
This is why the villagers

454
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,600
didn't immediately get poisoned

455
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
after eating Man'er's food.

456
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,790
It has a fresh fragrance

457
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,170
and is hard to notice.

458
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,080
Overdosing it leads to diarrhea.

459
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,120
Youheng,

460
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,220
go to the restaurant with Man'er

461
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,420
and see if you can find anything.

462
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
I'll go to these people

463
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,180
to make sure they are fine.

464
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,660
Okay.

465
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,830
I'll go with you.

466
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,830
Look.

467
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,370
I dug this out of

468
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,370
the swill bucket.

469
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,900
There are other vegetables in here.

470
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,700
Can you find anything from this?

471
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,920
They're inside.

472
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,380
I found it.

473
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:42,980
What?

474
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,720
It is indeed Rheum palmatum.

475
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,760
This herb causes major diarrhea.

476
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,130
After eating it, one may have a stomachaches, diarrhea,

477
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,130
and indigestion.

478
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,130
In serious cases, one's life could be in danger.

479
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,350
Whoever did it is cruel.

480
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:55,920
Let's go.

481
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,160
Constable, you're just in time—

482
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,860
Someone reported

483
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,890
that your restaurant's food

484
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,730
is not clean.

485
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,730
We were ordered to investigate.

486
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,290
You are not allowed to take away

487
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,690
anything from this shop.

This is the document.

490
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,450
Listen to me.

491
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,690
We were framed.

492
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,390
Look.

493
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,390
The Rheum palmatum on the spoon

494
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,320
is the evidence.

495
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,560
This can't prove anything.

496
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,530
Constable,

497
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,320
please handle the case impartially

498
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,270
and clear our name.

499
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,230
The magistrate will see

500
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,030
whether you're innocent or not.

501
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,050
You may leave.

502
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,060
We're going to tape the seal now.

503
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Seal it.

504
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,800
Yes.

505
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,450
Who reported this?

506
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,130
Who is the most jealous

507
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,270
that our restaurant is popular?

508
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,270

[Sealed by Jinyang County Magistrate]

510
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,100
Stop looking.

511
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,360
The restaurant has been closed by the government.

512
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
It won't open.

513
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,400
I didn't know it's Master Lian.

514
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,630

515
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,200
rumor has it

516
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,720
that your hot spring vegetables are poisonous.

517
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,570
Why are you here

518
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,760
instead of keeping a low profile?

519
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,260
Auntie,

520
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,050
my food is not poisonous.

521
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,840
It's not?

522
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,150
Then why did the government

523
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,870
seal your shop?

524
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,520
We were framed,

525
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,360
but we've already found

526
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,820
evidence of being framed.

527
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,290
However, the officials didn't believe it.

528
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,230
They didn't even give us

529
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,490

I have to warn you.

547
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,620
In business,

548
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,710
you can't have so many fancy tricks.

549
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,760
Some things

550
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,570
seem novel and gimmicky,

551
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
but they're also prone to problems.

552
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,150

Yes, in business,

557
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,080

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,870
I sincerely hope

560
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
that you're not the one who did this.

561
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,110
Do you really think

562
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,130
it was Lian Hua'er?

563
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,640
I'm not sure.

564
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,110
It was such a vicious act.

565
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,320
I hope it wasn't her.

566
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,070
As soon as it happened,

567
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,180
the government came with an official document

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,470
to seal the restaurant.

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,270
The speed is indeed suspicious.

The person who reported it

571
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,460
is most likely partners

572
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,520
with the poisoner.

I'm scared just thinking about it.

581
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,350
Don't worry.

582
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,290
It will pass.

583
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,920
Right now,

584
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,870
the restaurant is already closed.

585
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,930
Rumors about the food being poisoned

586
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,990
will spread soon.

587
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,160
With such a bad reputation,

588
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,450
we won't be able to

589
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,380
start a new store

590
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,020
quickly.

591
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,900
Then there's no hope

592
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,630
for you to enter the Jinyang Guild,

593
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,490
not to mention

594
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,050
approaching Wu Zhonglian.

595
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,480
This matter hasn't ended yet.

596
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,150
It may not be hopeless.

597
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,840
Why do you say that?

598
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,020
Do you remember

599
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,500
when Wu Zhonglian came to our restaurant

600
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,830
and agreed for me to bring him vegetables?

601
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,590
But the food in our restaurant

602
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,850
are all poisonous now.

603
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,290
Is this a good time?

604
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,460
Instead of being sitting duck,

605
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,730
we should take the initiative.

606
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,020
[Shufang Garden]

607
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,460
Shen.

608
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Shen,

609
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,690
what is this for?

610
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,520
Sorry to bother you, Master Wu.

611
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,480
These are the vegetables that I agreed

612
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,740
to bring to you before.

613
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,210
I've delivered them now.

614
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,670
As far as I know,

615
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,470
something went wrong

616
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,700
with your hot spring vegetables

617
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,270
and you've been sealed by the government.

618
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,770
How dare you

619
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,390
still deliver them to me?

620
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,170
Truly nothing

621
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,770
can be hidden from Master Wu.

622
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,790
However, you are far-sighted.

623
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,670
You're no ordinary man.

624
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,400
Whether there's something wrong with the vegetables or not,

625
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,230
I believe you'll have

626
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,290
your own judgment.

627
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,020
Shen, you didn't come

628
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,930
just to deliver the food, right?

629
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:08,930
As I said,

630
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,230
I want to join the Jinyang Guild.

631
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,990
But your store

632
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,080
has already been sealed.

633
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,830
Master Wu,

634
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,690
I encountered difficulties today

635
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,470
because I don't have any support

636
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,270
in this place,

637
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,850
letting those who envy and hate me

638
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,650
act wantonly.

639
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,670
Master Wu,

640
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,400
I won't ask for your help,

641
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,360
but if I can solve this,

642
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,360
can I join the Jinyang Guild

643
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,100
and rely on you to make a living?

644
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,230
I will

645
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,800
accept the vegetables.

646
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,940
As for whether you can join the Jinyang Guild or not,

647
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,050
it depends on your ability this time.

648
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,910
Master Wu, thank you in advance.

649
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,760
Goodbye.

650
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,970
Man'er.

651
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,490
Man'er.

652
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,260
Man'er.

653
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,440
Man'er.

654
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,750
Man'er.

655
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,870
As soon as I came in, Ye'er told me

656
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,270
that your restaurant was closed.

657
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,250
What happened?

658
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,470
I'm so worried.

659
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,300
A few days ago,

660
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,870
I invited the villagers who helped us harvest the vegetables

661
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,710
to a meal.

662
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,290
I didn't expect

663
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,040
that everyone would get food poisoning.

664
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,550
The government also found out,

665
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,660
so we got sealed.

666
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,680
If we'd known,

667
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,360
we wouldn't have

668
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,660
sent vegetables to your grandma.

669
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,230
At least

670
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,780
I could've helped keep an eye out for you.

671
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,360
Man'er,

672
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,990
if the government

673
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,230
comes to arrest someone,

674
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,770
you can blame this on me.

675
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
I'll deal with it.

676
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,410
It's okay, Father.

677
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,680
At most,

678
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
they'll just close the restaurant.

679
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,270
It's obvious someone framed us.

680
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,310
Once the government solves the case,

681
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,910
our restaurant will reopen.

682
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,890
But...

683
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,000
It's okay.

684
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,250
How many times have I encountered

685
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,250
things like this?

686
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,000
Every time,

687
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,770
we find a solution.

688
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,700
It will be fine this time.

689
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,360
But...

690
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,800
Go and rest.

691
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,820
Man'er, listen.

692
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,480
We trust you,

693
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,480
but if anything happens,

694
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,950
you have to tell us promptly.

695
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,320
You can't bear it alone.

696
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,160
Okay, okay.

697
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,710
That's right.

698
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,840
Go back to your room.

699
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,030
You must tell us if anything happens.

700
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,330
-Okay.
-Yes.

701
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,310
We're back now.

702
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,670
Hurry and go sleep.

703
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Where is Shen Nuo?

704
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,760
He went to keep an eye on someone.

705
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,850
Who? Lian Hua'er?

706
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,210
If it's as we expected

707
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,810
and Lian Hua'er is the culprit,

708
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,960
do you think she's dumb enough

709
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,060
to do it herself?

710
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,460
If you were her

711
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,680
and you ordered someone to do this,

712
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,820
what would you do next?

713
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,750
Of course,

714
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,160
I wouldn't keep him by my side anymore.

715
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,470
I would kick him out.

716
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,270
That's right.

717
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,610
Young Master

718
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,630
has already found out who left the Song family.

719
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,720
He's keeping an eye on that man

720
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,250
to see what he can discover.

721
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,030
Alright.

722
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,040
Although Shen Nuo is investigating,

723
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,590
the truth is still unknown.

724
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,620
We can't just sit and do nothing.

725
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,710
[Bounty Notice]

726
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,050
You want to use a bounty

727
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,580
to find the person who framed the restaurant?

728
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,510
Will this work?

729
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,590
What I want is the attention.

730
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,710
The more people know, the better.

731
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,960
Even if people only come for the money,

732
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,610
we must use these people

733
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,410
to spread the news of the bounty.

734
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,340
This way,

735
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,290
the person who did it

736
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,330
will feel that there's danger everywhere

737
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,260
and give themselves away in panic.

738
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,370
Then...

739
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,550
In that case,

740
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,030
there's something wrong with your writing.

741
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,990
What's wrong?

742
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,220
Look here.

743
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,150
[50 taels]

744
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,510
Fifty taels per piece of information.

745
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,260
It's so expensive.

746
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,460
Who would believe it?

747
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,730
You don't understand.

748
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,400
Look.

749
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,560
Even you're surprised

750
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,020
by this bounty amount.

751
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,420
If you post this,

752
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,010
others would be extremely excited.

753
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,600
It'll help us more

754
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,630
to achieve our goal.

755
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,160
Right?

756
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
That makes sense.

757
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,880
How about

758
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,490
we change the 50 taels

759
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,780
into 100 taels?

760
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,010
That's even better.

761
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,950
This is quite novel.

762
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,530
There's actually someone

763
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,860
who wants to buy information these days.

764
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,010
More importantly,

765
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,920
they have such a high bounty.

766
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,860
Is this real or not?

767
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,520
The notice is posted all over the city.

768
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,710
I don't think it's a joke.

769
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,510
Probably not.

770
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,540
Probably not.

771
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,800
I only heard about

772
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,920
the poisonous food matter,

773
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,390
but I don't know who the perpetrator is.

774
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,000
What a pity.

775
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
You don’t know, but I know.

776
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,590
-I’m going to get the bounty now.
-You know?

777
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,990
Me too.

778
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,720
Wait for me!

779
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,800
Does that mean I can get the money too?

780
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,530
Wait for me!

781
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,480
One hundred taels.

782
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,440
Go, go.

783
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,120
Boss Zhang often faces One Fresh Move

784
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,270
and grits his teeth,

785
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,800
complaining about you stealing his business.

786
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,890
The noodle restaurant next door

787
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,280
says your malatang isn't as good as their noodles.

788
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,080
A few days ago,

789
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,870
I saw a burly man

790
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,100
standing on the wall of One Fresh Move.

791
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,100
Thank you.

792
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay, remember to

793
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,390
let me know.

794
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,080
Next.

795
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,310
Kid, you don't have time for the bounty.

796
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,910
Do you know

797
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,310
who framed our restaurant?

798
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,940
Of course.

799
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,330
I really saw it.

800
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,530
Great. Hurry.

801
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,190
Tell us now.

802
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,240
I saw someone

803
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,370
poisoned your food.

804
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,330
When? Where?

805
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,050
It was that day.

806
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,770
The day before

807
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,310
news spread that your food caused diarrhea,

808
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,160
I saw someone

809
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,860
in the back alley of your kitchen.

810
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,340
He had a medicine bag

811
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,230
about this big.

812
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,480
That big?

813
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,239
And then he went in

814
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,219
the back door of your kitchen.

815
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,139
That's when he put in the poison.

816
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,600
What kind of person was he?

817
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,540
What was his physique?

818
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,739
What did he look like?

819
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,570
A man.

820
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,830
His height was about...

821
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,020
About this tall.

822
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,639
And

823
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,790
he had a pretty big face.

824
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,510
That's pretty big.

825
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,510
He had a beard too.

826
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,449
It was too dark.

827
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,780
I didn't see it clearly,

828
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,690
but I swear

829
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,420
I really saw that person.

830
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,590
He obviously didn't look like a good person.

831
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,280
Well said.

832
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,940
We must

833
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,679
record this.

834
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,739
I'll write it down.

835
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,010
Can I get the bounty now?

836
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,280
Not yet,

837
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,000
but when we catch him,

838
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,969
we'll delivery the money to you immediately.

839
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,100
Let's make it clear.

840
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,239
As long as

841
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,060
the person you catch

842
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,810
looks similar to the description,

843
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,739
all the credit is mine.

844
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:50,310
Okay.

845
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,290
What's your name?

846
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,909
Where do you live?

847
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,980
Dong Si'er, the back alley.

848
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,639
Sure thing.

849
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,570
Man'er,

850
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,030
haven't you realized

851
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,440
that all these people are lying?

852
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,370
They don't know

853
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,610
who framed our restaurant at all.

854
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,130
They just want the bounty.

855
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,040
I know.

856
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,000
Then why are we still wasting time?

857
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,480
Look back there.

858
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,280
There are so many people in line.

859
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,460
Maybe in your eyes,

860
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,660
they're taking advantage of me,

861
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,950
but in other people's eyes...

862
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,780
Did you hear about the bounty?

863
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,060
Of course I know.

864
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,200
When I came here,

865
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,340
I saw many people giving reports for the bounty.

866
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,450
The line is so long.

867
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,630
She offered so much for the bounty.

868
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,520
Even if her restaurant

869
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,130
had great business previously,

870
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,660
could she really make that much money?

871
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,560
She's risking everything

872
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,840
to catch

873
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,770
the mastermind.

874
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,580
Does this mean

875
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,300
she really was framed?

876
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,640
I think it's probably true.

877
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,470
If her food

878
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,720
really was poisonous,

879
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,030
how could she have the confidence

880
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,010
to offer so much money

881
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,870
for the bounty?

882
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,400
Lady, what's wrong?

883
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,160
Wang, right?

884
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,650
Didn't we let him go?

885
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,880
Why are you asking about him?

886
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,080
Keep your voice down.

887
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,180
He is so greedy.

888
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,000
If he sees

889
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,350
Lian Man'er's bounty,

890
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,490
what if he

891
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,750
betrays me?

892
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,850
If he has already left,

893
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,460
he won't be able to see the bounty notice.

894
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,080
No.

895
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,340
You have to take me to his house.

896
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,840
I have to see with my own eyes

897
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,260
that he's already left Jinyang County

898
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,410
before I can be at ease.

899
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:22,890
Okay.

900
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,700
Okay, go work now.

901
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,840
[Long stay]

902
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,200
Someone suspects

903
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,120
that the steamed buns seller at the entrance

904
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,100
often steals firewood from the restaurant.

905
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,930
No wonder

906
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,030
the firewood in our store

907
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,360
gets used up so quickly.

908
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,260
It turns out someone has been taking it.

909
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,760
Look.

910
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,860
Zhang Lao'er reported Li Laosan

911
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,320
for poisoning our store.

912
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,560
There's another one.

913
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,220
Li Laosan reported Zhang Lao'er

914
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,430
for secretly poisoning our store.

915
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,430
What's with this?

916
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,820
Who's the one that did the poisoning?

917
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,840
-Blaming each other.
-Blaming each other.

918
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,900
The response to the bounty

919
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,710
is quite big.

920
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,770
It's quite big,

921
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,200
but it's not very useful.

922
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,640
It's definitely useful.

923
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,490
The notice was a great help.

924
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,990
You found something?

925
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,150
That's right.

926
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,380
I've been watching Wang,

927
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,670
a servant of the Song Mansion these days.

928
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,220
Steamed buns. Hot steamed buns.

929
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,530
I'll take two.

930
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,460
Okay.

931
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,400
Here.

932
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,880
Put it on the tab.

933
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,330
What's wrong, Wang?

934
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,240
You lost all your money again?

935
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,650
Hot steamed buns! Hot buns!

936
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,640
Fresh steamed hot buns!

937
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,800
Wang is a gambler.

938
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,300
He did this

939
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,480
to get money to pay off his debts.

940
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,860
Are you bringing me money

941
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,810
because you know

942
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,500
that I lost all my money?

943
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,990
After your bounty notice was released,

944
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,220
I followed Wang today

945
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,890
and had a new discovery.

946
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,860
However,

947
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,830
Lian Man'er's bounty

948
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,160
is more than this.

949
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,040
You're too greedy.

950
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,040
We already gave you

951
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,880
a sum of money

952
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,300
to leave Jinyang County.

953
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,540
It's fine if you don't leave,

954
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,930
but we're giving you another sum now

955
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,050
and you still think it's not enough?

956
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,710
If you're going to be so petty,

957
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,220
let's talk to the government together.

958
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,620
You're the one who put in the poison.

959
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,090
If you report it,

960
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,220
what's in it for you?

961
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,020
Cut the crap.

962
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,450
Lady, give me a better amount.

963
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,090
If you don't,

964
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,860
I'll expose everything.

965
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,590
The government will give me prison meals every day.

966
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,250
I won't need to worry anymore,

967
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,700
but I'm afraid you won't like the food.

968
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,050
So, it really is Hua'er.

969
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
She's too much.

970
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,470
Let's send Wang to the court.

971
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,200
A scoundrel like him

972
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
won't tell the truth

973
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,320
even in front of the government.

974
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
What should we do?

975
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,760
We know who it is.

976
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,680
Is there nothing we can do?

977
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,220
Don't worry.

978
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,210
I thought of a solution.

979
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,820
What time is it?

980
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,830
It's 9 o'clock.

981
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,130
Nine o'clock.

982
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,250
It's time.

983
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,370
Why is Wang so slow

984
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,800
even when getting money?

985
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,130
What if he really went

986
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,960
to get Lian Man'er's reward?

987
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,020
Lady, don't worry.

988
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,140
I don't think he dares

989
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,940
to admit it.

990
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,240
Brother.

991
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,870
I mean, sir,

992
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,180
aren't you beating the wrong person?

993
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,200
Wrong person?

994
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,380
You're the one I want to beat up.

995
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,280
You're the one

996
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,300
I'm beating.

997
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,890
Sir, sir.

998
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,430
Sir, let's talk.

999
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,770
No need to fight.

1000
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,750
You want money, right? I have money.

1001
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,280
I'll pay.

1002
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,360
I'm going to get

1003
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,400
a sum of money soon.

1004
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,860
I'll give it to you after I get it.

1005
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,320
How dare you take money from the Song family.

1006
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,080
The Song family's money.

1007
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,550
You dare take

1008
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,950
the Song family's money?

1009
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,740
The Song family?

1010
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,530
Sir,

1011
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,750
please spare my life.

1012
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,170
I promise I won't stay here anymore.

1013
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,490
I promise to get lost.

1014
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,480
I won't harass the Lady anymore.

1015
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,520
It's not up to me.

1016
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,680
Go tell them yourself.

1017
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,800
Get up. Let's go.

1018
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,710
Young Master Song,

1019
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,040
I brought the man to you.

1020
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,280
Wang?

1021
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,990
Young Master, please spare my life.

1022
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,210
Young Master, please spare my life.

1023
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,810
I shouldn't have been greedy

1024
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,430
and extorted the Lady.

1025
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,180
Wang,

1026
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,200
what do you mean?

1027
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,190
Why did you extort her?

1028
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,880
Well...

1029
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,850
Tell the truth.

1030
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,350
The Lady...

1031
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,630
[Mission: 1,000 taels of gold]

1032
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,630
[Income: restaurant income, 1757 taels]

1033
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,630
[Expenses: restaurant expenses, 99 taels]
