4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,650
You good?

5
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,259
Hello, Zhang.

6
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:10,949
Hello.

7
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,710
I'm going home.

8
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,410
Zhang, you picked so many grapes.

9
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,829
Yeah.

10
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,110
More grapes.

11
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,110
Shen Nuo, bring me another bucket of water.

12
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,850
Mom.

13
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Where is Dad?

14
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,150
I haven't seen him for a while.

15
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,500
He went

16
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,050
to make

17
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,390
the vat you need

18
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,420
for distilling the wine.

19
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,860
I forgot about it.

20
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,579
It's okay.

21
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,090
Seven, let's hurry up.

22
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,370
Youheng needs more juice

23
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,320
for fermentation.

24
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,020
Let me do it.

25
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,950
Give it to me.

26
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,980
Man'er.

27
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,700
Shen Nuo has left.

28
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,650
What's your plan?

29
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,020
Plan for what?

30
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,250
I just have one less person to chat with,

31
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,440
ask for advice,

32
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,660
and talk business with.

33
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,180
It's no big deal.

34
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,010
I can help you.

35
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,330
You've been helping me.

36
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,070
I mean,

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,790
I can help you more.

38
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,960
Picking grapes.

39
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:29,990
Making juice.

40
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,020
Fermenting.

41
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,700
You need help with all of those things, don't you?

42
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,900
Thank you, Youheng.

43
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,850
But these things don't suit you.

44
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,530
You

45
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,390
should focus on your medical books.

46
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,060
When I need your help,

47
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,270
I'll tell you.

48
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,540
Why do you think they don't suit me?

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,870
I can do everything Shen Nuo could.

50
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,780
Okay.

51
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,340
I'll take you to a place tomorrow.

52
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,160
If that herbalist was right

53
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,910
about the bandits' fortress nearby,

54
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,030
it should be up ahead.

55
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,110
We don't know

56
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,780
about the situation there.

57
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,670
I'm afraid breaking in

58
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,080
isn't gonna work.

59
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,660
Do we need to get some help?

60
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,250
No hurry.

61
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,270
Yu Xiangjin is hot-tempered.

62
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,350
We can't go head-to-head with her.

63
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,180
She took the registration book

64
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,350
because she thought

65
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,440
she could get something

66
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,810
out of it.

67
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,950
Let's try her out first.

68
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,740
Maybe we can

69
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,680
make a deal with her.

70
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,710
Let's go.

71
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,300
It should be here.

72
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,720
There are many guards at the entrance.

73
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,680
Check the perimeter first.

74
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,020
Let's split up.

75
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,820
Okay.

76
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,100
Hello, Three, Four.

77
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,090
Like I said,

78
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,760
we'd definitely meet again.

79
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,810
We met again so soon.

80
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,460
Right?

81
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,540
Wipe that grin off your face.

82
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,440
If it weren't for you two,

83
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,760
we would've brought back

84
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,770
all the valuables of the Song family.

85
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,450
You can't say that.

86
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,880
We didn't get

87
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,350
what we wanted either, did we?

88
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,560
I can see

89
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,460
you've been waiting for us here.

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,280
Master said

91
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,770
she took something from you

92
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,140
and you'll definitely come to her.

93
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,780
Whether you can get it or not

94
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,400
totally depends on you.

95
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,700
We didn't expect you

96
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,390
to really show up at Black Tiger Fortress.

97
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,020
All right. Let's go.

98
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,100
Move.

99
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,010
Keep moving.

100
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,750
Master is right ahead.

101
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,950
Come here.

102
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,230
Come on.

103
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,750
Slow down.

104
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,570
Slow down.

105
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,830
Don't fall.

106
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,940
You look amazing.

107
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,870
Master.

108
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,340
Two.

109
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,860
Master. Two.

110
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,820
Two.

111
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,640
You really came to me.

112
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,340
Nice to meet you, Troupe Master Yu.

113
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,920
How did you two

114
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,350
find this place?

115
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,870
You're quite smart.

116
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,360
Troupe Master Yu.

117
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,130
Why are there so many old people, women, and children

118
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,010
in the fortress?

119
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:08,740
What?

120
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,530
Do you really think

121
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,420
this place is a bandits' den?

122
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,280
Most people here

123
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,710
are homeless

124
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,590
ordinary people.

125
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,530
Some were robbed of their land

126
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,290
by rich people.

127
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,780
Some suffered horrible disasters,

128
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,900
got expelled,

129
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,100
and became outcasts.

130
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,110
Having nowhere to go, they came here.

131
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,250
As time passed,

132
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,580
more and more poor souls

133
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,590
gathered here

134
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,060
and built the village

135
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,340
you call Black Tiger Fortress.

136
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,580
Then,

137
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,470
why did you pretend

138
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,580
to be a troupe and rob passers-by?

139
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,050
What's wrong with that?

140
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
The people we robbed

141
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,760
were all profiteers

142
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,560
and corrupt officials.

143
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,420
We've never robbed

144
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,300
any civilian.

145
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,400
Look around

146
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,110
at this place.

147
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,750
It's in the middle of nowhere.

148
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,830
If Master doesn't lead us

149
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,960
to rob something back,

150
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,480
how can we

151
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,360
feed so many people?

152
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,710
Good timing.

153
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,110
Come with us, you two.

154
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,060
It's a piece of cake.

155
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,680
Let's do it when they arrive.

156
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,050
Look at this road.

157
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,210
This is a state road.

158
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,310
It's often guarded by soldiers.

159
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,860
There are also soldiers on patrol.

160
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,820
It's too dangerous to rob them there.

161
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,740
Yes.

162
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,320
Then let's take action

163
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,910
when there are no soldiers on patrol.

164
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,820
That will work.

165
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,430
Do you think I'm afraid of the government?

166
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,350
I can't wait to kick their asses!

167
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,500
The owner of the caravan

168
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,680
used to run an armed escort agency.

169
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,560
His subordinates

170
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,950
must be hard to take down.

171
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,430
Three.

172
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,400
Think about it again.

173
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,870
You're such a coward.

174
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,870
Men at Black Tiger Fortress are fearless.

175
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,010
Yes, you coward!

176
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,210
We shouldn't be afraid of him!

177
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,000
Get lost!

178
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,740
No one asked for your opinion.

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,850
You meathead.

180
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,740
Did you just call me a meathead?

181
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,640
Yes, meathead.

182
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,390
You're a meathead!

183
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,580
Shut up, all of you.

184
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,110
Two.

185
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,830
This spot

186
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,810
is where we shall ambush them.

187
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,420
Okay.

188
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,670
Keep your eyes open.

189
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,370
Okay.

190
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,670
When Mr. Hu

191
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,310
turns around this corner…

192
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,010
Four, Five.

193
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,580
Yes.

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
You'll cut off their escape

195
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,310
from the back and right.

196
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,060
Okay.

197
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,820
Six.

198
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,610
You'll stay here that day.

199
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,950
Okay. Leave it to me.

200
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,480
Yu Xiangjin

201
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,200
knows

202
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,310
we're here for the registration book

203
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,800
but didn't say anything about it.

204
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,510
She just brought us here to listen to

205
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,410
their robbing plan.

206
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,900
Do you know why?

207
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,100
Of course.

208
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,160
She wants to daunt us.

209
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,980
She's trying us out

210
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,560
to see if we're on her side.

211
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,230
Is everyone clear?

212
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,180
Yes!

213
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,900
All of you should stay sharp that day.

214
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,950
Sure!

215
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,310
Three.

216
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,480
This merchant is the man

217
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,030
who milked you of all your money

218
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,710
and ruined your family.

219
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,460
On that day,

220
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,770
you'll take the lead.

221
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,630
No.

222
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,340
Guys.

223
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,170
I'd like to say a few words.

224
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,660
The Mr. Hu

225
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,950
you're planning to rob

226
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,250
used to run an armed escort agency.

227
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,800
He's hard to deal with.

228
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,670
If you get rough with him,

229
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,840
I'm afraid you can't get the goods

230
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,200
and are very likely

231
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,400
to suffer great losses.

232
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,950
The price

233
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,070
is too high.

234
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,970
I think

235
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,570
it's a stupid idea.

236
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,550
Are you saying Master is stupid?

237
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,080
-I'm gonna rip your face off!
-Three.

238
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,320
Let him finish.

239
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,370
I can help you

240
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,430
get it done

241
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,490
without losing anything.

242
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,750
Really, bro?

243
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,210
We don't need big talk here.

244
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,170
Troupe Master Yu.

245
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,770
You knew we'd come to you

246
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,620
and let us listen to your plan.

247
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,700
You're trying us out, aren't you?

248
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,930
You want to see

249
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,650
if we can give you some advice.

250
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,830
Since that's the case,

251
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,870
I'll just be honest with you.

252
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,810
I hate corrupt officials

253
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,450
and money-oriented merchants too.

254
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,920
I'll help you to the best of my ability.

255
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,270
As for how,

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,160
I have a great idea.

257
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,470
But after it's done,

258
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,360
you have to give me back my registration book.

259
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,830
Troupe Master Yu.

260
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,470
Master.

261
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,220
What do you think?

262
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,340
Master.

263
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,500
We know little about those two men.

264
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,540
I don't think we should trust them

265
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,220
with such a serious matter.

266
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,230
He planted Thirteen

267
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,320
in our troupe

268
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,700
and introduced Song Changsui to me

269
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,890
so that he could sneak into the Song family's house

270
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,990
when we held a banquet there.

271
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,060
In the Song family's house,

272
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,740
he didn't take anything

273
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,990
but the registration book.

274
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,300
There must be more to the story.

275
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,460
We can take this opportunity

276
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,350
to take his measure.

277
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,720
In all the time I've collected herbs on the mountain,

278
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,580
I've never noticed

279
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,740
there's a cave with hot springs here.

280
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,230
Man'er.

281
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,380
We're planting leafy vegetables,

282
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,230
but it'll be winter soon.

283
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,680
Will they survive?

284
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,660
This place has the right temperature and humidity.

285
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,790
I don't know if it'll work or not.

286
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,180
Let's give it a try.

287
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,530
Okay. Let's give it a try.

288
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,450
Man'er. Man'er.

289
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,250
Man'er.

290
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,860
What's wrong?

291
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,820
Mr. Laojin…

292
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,440
Mr. Laojin said…

293
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,470
Catch your breath.

294
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,190
Mr. Laojin said

295
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,820
he just told the villagers

296
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,460
that you and Youheng

297
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,740
are getting married.

298
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,110
What else did he say?

299
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,590
He said the wedding date has been set

300
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,800
and you'll be expecting very soon.

301
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:54,950
Man'er.

302
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,990
What does it mean you'll be expecting?

303
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,120
It's just something

304
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,670
that happens

305
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,980
after a woman gets married.

306
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,380
What will happen after she gets married?

307
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,280
She'll…

308
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,990
Seven.

309
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,619
There seems to be a cricket over there.

310
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,710
Go find it.

311
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,260
Man'er.

312
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,109
I'm really sorry.

313
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,750
My dad must have said that

314
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,740
because he saw us hang out a lot

315
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,060
these days.

316
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,620
If word spreads

317
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,400
through the village,

318
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,430
your reputation will be stained.

319
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,060
I'll go talk to him now.

320
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,710
Youheng.

321
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,460
Shisanli Camp is a small place.

322
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,270
It doesn't take the rumor more than two hours

323
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,150
to reach everybody's ears.

324
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,780
Just leave it be.

325
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,510
Don't be mad at Mr. Laojin

326
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,580
because of this.

327
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,430
You don't mind?

328
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,940
It's not true.

329
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,970
Why should I mind?

330
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,160
Youheng.

331
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,170
I've been curious about something.

332
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,900
Why does Mr. Laojin

333
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,080
object to you becoming a physician?

334
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,740
I don't know.

335
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,540
I asked him several times.

336
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,140
He just said

337
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,330
being a physician

338
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,310
can't earn as much as working in a private bank.

339
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,130
As time went by,

340
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,940
I stopped arguing with him.

341
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,120
I just read medical books in secret

342
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,230
and treat the villagers sometimes.

343
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,120
If Mr. Laojin

344
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,940
never agrees to it,

345
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,680
you'll have to

346
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,840
keep practicing medicine in secret.

347
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,150
Don't you want your own clinic?

348
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,660
Of course I want my own clinic.

349
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,770
But I'm just

350
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,470
an amateur now.

351
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,510
To be a real physician,

352
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,810
I still have a long way to go.

353
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,800
If one day,

354
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,710
I can have Dad's support

355
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,390
and train under a famous physician

356
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,320
to study medicine seriously,

357
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,790
it'll be great.

358
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,940
Sounds like

359
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,060
there are physicians

360
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,610
whom you admire very much.

361
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,030
Gao Yang from Beichuan

362
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,600
and He Zhixiang from Lingnan

363
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,600
are both famous physicians.

364
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,950
Imperial Physician Hu

365
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,710
is a top-notch expert in traditional Chinese medicine.

366
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,230
But because they're all so famous,

367
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,640
without a recommendation,

368
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,960
one can't even meet them,

369
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,730
let alone train under them.

370
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,980
Since you have a goal,

371
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,700
you should give it a shot.

372
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,140
You may succeed in the end.

373
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,750
How about this, Youheng?

374
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,030
You

375
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,900
can read in this cave.

376
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,330
No one will disturb you here.

377
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,180
Besides, there are mountains behind it

378
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,480
where you may find

379
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,510
lots of herbs.

380
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,670
Okay.

381
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,100
When I read here,

382
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,800
I can take care of the vegetables for you.

383
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,790
It's killing two birds with one stone.

384
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,180
Thank you, Youheng.

385
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,830
I have to

386
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,990
make good use of this cave.

387
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,500
You must help me.

388
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,990
Then it's a deal.

389
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,840
Pinky swear.

390
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,800
Don't break this promise,

391
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,090
or you'll be a big fool.

392
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,780
Time for dinner.

393
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,200
Seven, remember.

394
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,630
From now on,

395
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,700
there are just the four of us at every meal.

396
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:58,730
Man'er.

397
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,910
Where is Shen Nuo?

398
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,550
I don't know.

399
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's eat.

400
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,470
Man'er.

401
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,300
Actually,

402
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,720
I've been wanting to ask you this.

403
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,940
Shen Nuo

404
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,900
left without saying goodbye.

405
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,750
Did something happen to him?

406
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,990
He's a grown man.

407
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,900
What could have happened to him?

408
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,950
Besides,

409
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,710
he's not family or anything.

410
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,460
It's none of our business where he wants to go.

411
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,700
You can't say that.

412
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,870
Technically speaking,

413
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,030
Shen Nuo is your mother's nephew.

414
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,360
Even your grandparents

415
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,620
have asked where he is

416
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,940
many times.

417
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,310
After living with us for so long,

418
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,770
he's already part of the Lian family.

419
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,300
Dad.

420
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:04,980
Mom.

421
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,220
Sorry.

422
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,540
Shen Nuo left all of a sudden.

423
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,990
You've been bothered by it.

424
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:13,980
Man'er.

425
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,730
Actually,

426
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,050
we're not bothered

427
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:18,770
because Shen Nuo left.

428
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,550
We're bothered

429
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,420
because after he left,

430
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,950
our Man'er

431
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,790
never laughs again.

432
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,740
In our lives,

433
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,860
there are inevitably

434
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,370
things

435
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,780
that we can't understand or get over.

436
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,460
However,

437
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,530
as long as there are still crops in the fields,

438
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,540
we shall move on

439
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,450
with our lives

440
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,940
and eat three meals a day

441
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,960
as we usually do.

442
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,330
And the wine,

443
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
we'll keep making it too.

444
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,470
Right?

445
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,390
Yes.

446
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,950
So, no matter what happens,

447
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,430
you should keep moving forward.

448
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,060
What's wrong?

449
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
Nothing.

450
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,540
I'm just surprised

451
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,500
that my father

452
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,460
can be so eloquent.

453
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,590
Come on. Eat up.

454
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,550
Eat up.

455
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,140
Thank you, Mom.

456
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,610
You finally smile again.

457
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,310
That's enough.

458
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,950
Eat up, Seven.

459
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,790
Who are you?

460
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,220
Shouyi?

461
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,390
What are you doing here?

462
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,250
I…

463
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,780
I was passing by.

464
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,480
Passing by?

465
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,220
Wait.

466
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,860
You live

467
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,240
in the opposite direction.

468
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,030
How did you pass by here?

469
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,870
I was passing by.

470
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,200
Just passing by.

471
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,350
It seems

472
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,630
that from now on,

473
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,630
we have to be careful.

474
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,200
Many people want to know

475
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,000
how we make wine.

476
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,070
It's okay.

477
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,080
Those

478
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,300
are just a few fermenting vats.

479
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,430
The fermentation is not done yet.

480
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,150
The last secret step…

481
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,220
He…

482
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,290
Why did he suddenly run away?

483
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,990
He's afraid

484
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,720
if he knows

485
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,900
how you make wine,

486
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,010
he won't be able to keep it a secret

487
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,860
and your Grandma will squeeze it out of him.

488
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,620
So he would sooner stay in the dark.

489
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,760
Then let's keep him in the dark.

490
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,980
Yeah.

491
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,230
No wonder he ran away so fast.

492
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,950
The distillation is finally done.

493
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:56,810
Here.

494
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,640
Let's see if the distilling vat

495
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,450
your dad made worked well.

496
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,640
The first fermentation

497
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,380
was not long enough.

498
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,990
It doesn't taste very good.

499
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,460
Let me try it.

500
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,660
Man'er.

501
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,240
The wine

502
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,950
tastes great to me.

503
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,090
Let me take a sip.

504
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,690
How's it?

505
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,220
I don't know much about wine,

506
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,250
but it tastes good to me.

507
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,370
Great!

508
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,720
I've had a grasp of

509
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,790
how long the fermentation should be.

510
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,340
The distillation of this batch of wine

511
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,980
will be finished soon.

512
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,310
Great.

513
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,740
Mom, I want to try it too.

514
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,680
Seven, you can only have a sniff of it.

515
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
Just sniffing at it made you drunk.

516
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,460
It seems that the wine

517
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,320
is strong enough.

518
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,410
Man'er.

519
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,660
Have you named the wine?

520
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,340
It's distilled from grapes.

521
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,600
So it should be called

522
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,460
distilled grape wine.

523
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,060
No.

524
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,110
Think about it.

525
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,210
Champion Red, Daughter Red.

526
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,750
Famous wines

527
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,500
all have amazing names.

528
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,510
So,

529
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,320
if we want the wine to sell well,

530
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,310
we need to give it a good name.

531
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,390
You have a point.

532
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,700
Yeah.

533
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,460
What should we call it?

534
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,550
Brandy?

535
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,060
How do you like it?

536
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,660
You don't like how it tastes?

537
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,230
No.

538
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,180
I don't like this wine.

539
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,470
I love it!

540
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,350
That's great!

541
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,140
The wine tastes amazing.

542
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,340
But in this town,

543
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,660
there has never been a wine

544
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,670
called brandy.

545
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,910
I'm afraid

546
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,630
it won't sell well.

547
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,230
I've figured out a way

548
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,980
to sell this wine.

549
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,990
Would you like to hear it?

550
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,130
The prefectural exam will be held soon.

551
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,710
Let's name this wine

552
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,310
Champion Red Brandy

553
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,570
and promote it actively.

554
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,040
I've even got a slogan.

555
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,950
Drink Champion Red Brandy

556
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,340
and become the champion!

557
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,770
That's a good idea.

558
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,280
Before every prefectural exam,

559
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,230
candidates all scramble

560
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,820
to buy champion porridge

561
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,900
and fortune trotters

562
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,620
because of their auspicious names.

563
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,810
That's right.

564
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,160
Anyone who buys the champion wine

565
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,060
can get a champion cake for free.

566
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,180
That will be even more auspicious.

567
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,420
Buy three big jars of wine,

568
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,860
get one small jar of wine free.

569
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,460
We can also offer poor candidates prizes.

570
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,580
I can provide champion porridge

571
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,350
and other side dishes for free.

572
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,290
We can also prepare

573
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,450
complimentary items

574
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,440
like plates and bowls.

575
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,670
[Fuchun Restaurant]

576
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,020
It's finally sold!

577
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,700
I can make 1,000 taels of gold soon.

578
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,580
I think something is wrong.

579
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,670
My Lord.

580
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,020
The state road is on the left.

581
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,590
There are soldiers patrolling along the way.

582
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,470
It's relatively safe.

583
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,900
But it'll take us at least a day and a night

584
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,060
to walk out of this mountain.

585
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,720
There's a shortcut right ahead of us.

586
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,540
It can save us lots of time.

587
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,220
However,

588
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,620
we may encounter bandits along the way.

589
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,450
There are so many of us. Don't be afraid.

590
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,140
Yeah.

591
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,620
In this area,

592
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,880
no one dares to trifle with us.

593
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,200
Back then,

594
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,100
we helped the prefect

595
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,260
fight bandits seven or eight times.

596
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,860
At that time, we…

597
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,420
Help! Help!

598
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,720
Has something happened ahead?

599
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,300
There are bandits on the state road.

600
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,140
You'd better run.

601
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,690
Let's go.

602
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,470
Let's go.

603
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,660
Should we take the shortcut?

604
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,740
You ingrates.

605
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,350
I didn't pay you to be cowards.

606
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,280
A bunch of losers.

607
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,540
You'll take the state road.

608
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,660
Stop the bandits if you run into any.

609
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,750
You guys, join them.

610
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,220
The rest will bring the goods

611
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,260
and take the shortcut with me.

612
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,040
Don't worry. I'm here.

613
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,150
Hurry up. Go.

614
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,020
Hurry. Keep up.

615
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,550
We're set up.

616
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,250
Sir.

617
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,680
I can tell you're a kind man.

♫I've lost count of how many battles I've fought♫

622

You're wrong about me.

646
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,180
Mr. Hu is a loser.

647
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,420
When we drew our swords,

648
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,350
he was scared to death.

649
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,380
Let me tell you.

650
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,900
Shen nailed it today.

651
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,900
Shen, you don't look like a bandit at all.

652
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,680
I'm impressed.

653
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,550
He raised his hand

654
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,190
and held up five fingers.

655
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,810
Mr. Hu thought

656
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,070
he wanted to make a deal with him.

657
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,020
You're so bad.

658
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,740
You're so bad.

659
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,370
Now you all know what Young…

660
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,010
What Shen is capable of.

661
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,990
He lured them into the trap

662
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,140
and then created the distraction.

663
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,020
In the end,

664
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,360
they became fish in a barrel

665
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,350
and we just took everything they had

666
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,910
without a fight.

667
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,030
Amazing!

668
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,990
Let's drink up.

669
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,770
Let's drink up.

670
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,700
Come on.

671
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,410
I'm so happy.

672
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,380
Come on. Drink up.

673
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,190
Come on.

674
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,300
Drink.

675
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,330
You're really something.

676
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,800
We've had our differences

677
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,370
but from now on, we're friends.

678
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,420
Friends.

679
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,110
It's my honor

680
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,739
to get your recognition.

681
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,900
What about our deal?

682
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,889
There are rules here.

683
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,350
What you did today

684
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,199
will be considered a gift for us.

685
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,550
It's just a small gift.

686
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,409
We need more than it

687
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,110
to give you what you want.

688
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,870
So,

689
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,080
are you going back on your word?

690
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,469
Master doesn't want to be rude.

691
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,530
She wouldn't ask you this

692
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,460
so I'll ask it for her.

693
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,270
What do you

694
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,560
want that thing for?

695
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,930
I just want to use it

696
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,720
to soak the rich.

697
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,020
I don't think

698
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,400
it's that simple.

699
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,540
Come on.

700
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,030
It's such a lovely night.

701
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,490
Let's just drink and put everything else aside.

702
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,770
Come on.

703
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,770
Shen.

704
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,090
You're a brave man.

705
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,220
I like you.

706
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,530
Why don't you

707
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,980
stay here for a few days?

708
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,500
We can chat over drinks

709
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,500
and the boys can have a chance

710
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,410
to pick your brain.

711
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,470
Cheers.

712
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,550
Cheers.

713
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,470
Shen.

714
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,580
Thirteen.

715
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,310
Stay here, will you?

716
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,860
Tomorrow, I'll take you

717
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,310
to Yufeng Restaurant

718
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,020
to try braised pork trotters.

719
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,280
They're so delicious

720
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,150
that you'll want to have them again.

721
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,070
How can you guys…

722
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,590
That'll be great!

723
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,200
Come on.

724
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,130

Come on. Drink.

729
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,190
We don't know where the registration book is.

730
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,780
Let's play it by ear.
