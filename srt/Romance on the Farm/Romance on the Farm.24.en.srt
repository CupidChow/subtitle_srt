4
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,750
My daughter Xiu'er.

5
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,300
Xiu'er.

6
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
Mother, here.

7
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,750
Drink the medicine first.

8
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:52,970
Come on.

9
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,440
I won't drink it.

10
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,960
If I can't get Xiu'er back,

11
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,720
I don't want to live anymore.

12
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,110
Enough!

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,060
Making a fuss and saying you want to die.

14
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,350
What's the use of it?

15
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,840
Look at the son you raised.

16
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,229
He sold his own sister and made her someone's concubine.

17
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,550
If anything happens to Xiu'er,

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,380
no one in this family shall live.

19
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,850
Father.

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,730
This...

21
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,840
Shouyi. Shouxin.

22
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,950
How did it go?

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,520
Well,

24
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,860
we've asked around Liu Mansion,

25
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,190
but we got nothing.

26
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,370
We also went to Shouren's.

27
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,990
Shouren...

28
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,010
He...

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
Shouren...

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,240
I'll go see Shouren myself.

31
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,670
Let me ask him

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
what he's up to.

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,610
Mother.

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,750
I won't let him

35
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,150
-live in peace
-Don't go, Mother.

36
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,750
-with his wicked wife.
-Mother.

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,740
Mother, listen to us

38
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,830
and rest here in the room, okay?

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,870
There's no use

40
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,220
you going to Shouren's.

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,150
What do you mean there's no use?

42
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,470
He's the one who set all this up, isn't he?

43
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,530
Shouren...

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,500
Shouren went insane.

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,010
Insane?

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:28,730
Shou...

47
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,820
What happened to Shouren?

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,579
Gu said

49
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,670
after Xiu'er disappeared,

50
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,980
Liu Fugui went to their house

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,390
and beat Shouren up.

52
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,950
When we were there,

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,180
we saw Shouren.

54
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,990
He did look insane.

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
He was so healthy.

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,870
How...

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,390
How could he suddenly go insane?

58
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,550
He deserves it!

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,100
He should be punished.

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,940
It's good that he went insane.

61
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,920
This is karma.

62
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,400
Stop it!

63
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,550
At this point,

64
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,050
why are you still defending Shouren?

65
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,550
You only care about Shouren, right?

66
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,290
Mother.

67
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:08,850
Fine.

68
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,880
Xiu'er is not your biological daughter.

69
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,710
You don't feel sorry for her,

70
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,910
but I do.

71
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,269
My poor Xiu'er.

72
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,290
Where did my poor Xiu'er go?

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,400
Mother.

74
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,560
If I can't find Xiu'er,

75
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,280
I don't want to live anymore.

76
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,610
My poor Xiu'er.

77
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,800
Mother.

78
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,510
What did I do to deserve this?

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,500
Stop crying, Mother.

80
00:04:59,170 --> 00:04:59,740
Xiu'er.

81
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,910
Mother.

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,330
Xiu'er!

83
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,070
Father.

84
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,350
Mother, look.

85
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,130
Xiu'er.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,060
Mother.

87
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,500
Xiu'er is back.

88
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,270
Mother.

89
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,230
Xiu'er.

90
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,330
Xiu'er, is that you?

91
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,290
It's me.

92
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,160
Where have you been?

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,790
I was so worried, Xiu'er.

94
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,080
Man'er saved me

95
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,770
from Liu Fugui's.

96
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,350
She was worried that Liu Fugui would come look for me,

97
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,610
so she asked me to hide.

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,520
Look.

99
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,110
I only dare to come back home

100
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,390
now that I know Liu Fugui is dead.

101
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,270
Mother.

102
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,830
I've suffered so much.

103
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,409
Don't cry.

104
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,150
All is well now that you're back.

105
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,650
Man'er.

106
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,180
Man'er.

107
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,590
Man'er.

108
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,730
How did you save Xiu'er?

109
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
Why didn't you

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,010
tell us about it?

111
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,330
I agree with Grandma.

112
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,330
All is well now that she's back.

113
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,300
Shen Nuo!

114
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,060
Shen Nuo!

115
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,340
It's weird.

116
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
We said we'd meet here.

117
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,860
Shen Nuo!

118
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,020
Shen Nuo!

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,220
How did it go?

120
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,230
Wu Zhonglian has given me

121
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,190
the location of the mine.

122
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,880
He also assigned the delivery to me.

123
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,900
And Thirteen has informed

124
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,710
Wude Bureau.

125
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,770
Now,

126
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,020
as long as I find the mine

127
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,110
and get the evidence,

128
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,240
Wu Zhonglian won't be able to get away.

129
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,470
Will Thirteen go with you?

130
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,800
He'll stay here and wait for Wude Bureau.

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,690
I'll take some of my men

132
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,550
from Black Tiger Fortress along.

133
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,620
What about you?

134
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
How are things going at home?

135
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
After Xiu'er got home,

136
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
everyone in my family was relieved.

137
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,780
I need to thank you for this.

138
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,670
If it weren't for your idea,

139
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,520
and if you hadn't asked

140
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,790
your men from Black Tiger Fortress to help,

141
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,650
Xiu'er couldn't have been saved.

142
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,250
If it weren't for

143
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,490
Xiu'er being captured,

144
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,270
I couldn't have thought of a way

145
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,880
that fast

146
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,150
to get rid of Liu Fugui,

147
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,970
make Wu Zhonglian lose his right-hand man,

148
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,030
and give me the map.

149
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,790
So, come to think of it,

150
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,170
I should thank you.

151
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,650

[One Fresh Move]

198
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,090
Zhangzi, hurry up.

199
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,750
We have many customers today since it's the winter solstice.

200
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,430
Got it.

201
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,110
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a festival today.

202
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,880
We'll gift each of you

203
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,830
a side dish.

204
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,600
Thank you.

205
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,310
Thanks a lot.

206
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,510
Thank you for coming.

207
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,920
The next two.

208
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,070
Please come in.

209
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,500
It's finally our turn.

210
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,710
Come and sit inside.

211
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,060
We're next.

212
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:12,880
Man'er.

213
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,870
Why don't you go and ask Xiu'er

214
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,950
to come out and

215
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,070
make wontons with us?

216
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,430
This way, she can catch some rays.

217
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,140
I wonder

218
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,370
how much money Shouren

219
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,630
received from Liu Fugui.

220
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,290
How could he do this to Xiu'er?

221
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,110
Mother told me that

222
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,400
last night,

223
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,200
Xiu'er had nightmares

224
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,900
and was delirious all night.

225
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,690
You're all here.

226
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,570
Father.

227
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,190
Speak of

228
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,140
the devil.

229
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,650
I just want to know

230
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
if you've found Xiu'er.

231
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,430
Yes.

232
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,080
That's good.

233
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,520
It's good that she's back.

234
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,140
Gu.

235
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,950
So you're here to...

236
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,820
Here's the thing.

237
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,190
Shouren

238
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,640
is insane now.

239
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,740
All he does is making trouble

240
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,980
and running out into the streets.

241
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,900
I have to do everything myself,

242
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,320
including doing chores,

243
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,680
decocting and feeding him medicine,

244
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,700
and looking for him

245
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,580
in the streets.

246
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
I can't

247
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,350
take care of it all.

248
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,230
So I thought

249
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,180
maybe you could...

250
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,160
What do you mean?

251
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,420
You want us to look after Shouren?

252
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,940
Don't even think about it.

253
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,350
He.

254
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,130
Gu.

255
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,310
If it weren't Man'er who found a way

256
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,170
to save Xiu'er,

257
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,340
Xiu'er might have become

258
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,690
a wandering ghost.

259
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,710
You did that kind of thing,

260
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,840
yet you want us to take care of Shouren?

261
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,800
How dare you?

262
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,880
He, stop it.

263
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,540
I'm just telling the truth.

264
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,040
Mother has

265
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,130
disowned this son.

266
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,870
Of course he's no longer our relative

267
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,630
as well.

268
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,010
Whether Lian Shouren is crazy or not

269
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,850
has nothing to do with us.

270
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,710
Why don't you go find

271
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,310
Hua'er?

272
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,040
Hua'er

273
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,990
depends on the Song family

274
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,360
for all her

275
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,710
basic necessities now.

276
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,840
Look.

277
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
As parents,

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,790
it's bad enough that we can't do anything for her.

279
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,960
If I ask her to take in

280
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,720
an insane father to look after,

281
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,350
the Song family

282
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,580
will definitely make an issue of it

283
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,280
and treat Hua'er badly in the future.

284
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,110
Then how should

285
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,120
Hua'er live

286
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,320
in the Song family?

287
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,330
Look.

288
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,530
When things are good, you want to keep everything to yourself.

289
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,580
When something bad happened, you thought of us.

290
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,430
What kind of person are you?

291
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,690
Aunt Gu.

292
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,490
You only think about

293
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,430
how Uncle Shouren's running around like crazy

294
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,630
and how you can't take care of him alone.

295
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,030
But have you ever thought about Xiu'er?

296
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,430
She has nightmares all night.

297
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,690
She cries all the time.

298
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,780
If we take Uncle Shouren in

299
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,840
and look after him,

300
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,230
won't Xiu'er freak out

301
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,230
when she sees him?

302
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,350
Exactly.

303
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,440
Besides,

304
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,260
even if we agree,

305
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,180
Grandma won't.

306
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,500
Father.

307
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,820
What are you doing?

308
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,860
Well,

309
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,740
Today's the winter solstice.

310
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,670
I...

311
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,080
I'll go get some wine in the streets.

312
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,310
Is Man'er's wine not good

313
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,280
or what?

314
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,660
Why do you want to go buy wine outside?

315
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,690
Stop pretending.

316
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,700
Shouren deserves it.

317
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,320
If you help them,

318
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,410
I won't let you off.

319
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,600
Even if you don't let Shouren come back here,

320
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,520
we can at least give

321
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,380
Gu some money

322
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,550
so that she can find a nanny

323
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,560
to take care of Shouren, right?

324
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,540
No matter what,

325
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,330
he is our own son.

326
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,030
No.

327
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,520
I don't have a son like this.

328
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,590
But...

329
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,530
Let go!

330
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,210
But...

331
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,460
Did you take any money?

332
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Stop it. I didn't.

333
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,730
Ye'er. Come on.

334
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
Let me help you.

335
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,310
Let's go cook the wontons together.

336
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,440
Go by yourself then.

337
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,130
Okay.

338
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,750
If

339
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,290
your uncle Shouren is seriously insane

340
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,690
and makes a mess, since he's quite strong,

341
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,680
your aunt Gu won't be able

342
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,030
to handle him.

343
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,440
It must be very difficult for her.

344
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,849
How about

345
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
we tell Hua'er

346
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,819
about this?

347
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,300
What if Hua'er

348
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,040
doesn't want to get involved in this as well?

349
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,410
Man'er.

350
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,359
Your father

351
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,270
went to the clinic to get medicine for your grandma.

352
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,329
When he comes back,

353
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,829
ask him to make a trip to the Song Mansion.

354
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,830
Forget it.

355
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,600
Father is an elder.

356
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,990
If he gets turned down,

357
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,660
he'll feel humiliated.

358
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,660
I'll go.

359
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,660
Guys.

360
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,090
Cheer up.

361
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,790
Yes!

362
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,300
We won't receive any guests today.

363
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,730
Miss Lian, please leave.

364
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,580
I really have some important family affairs

365
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,040
to discuss with my sister.

366
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,360
Please inform her, Sir.

367
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,980
You...

368
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,600
You're making things difficult for me.

369
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,890
I can only give it a try.

370
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,150
If Her Ladyship still refuses to see you,

371
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,600
there's nothing I can do.

372
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,020
I told you not to drink.

373
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,640
Are you happy now?

374
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,310
You got up late,

375
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,660
and I have to be punished as well.

376
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,830
Eldest Young Master will definitely scold you.

377
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,380
Stop nagging.

378
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,710
You make it sound like you didn't drink.

379
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,590
If we delay his delivery,

380
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,390
both of us will be done for.

381
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,990
Let's hurry up the mountain.

382
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,840
Delivery?

383
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,380
Over there.

384
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,940
What's wrong?

385
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,560
We're about to get scolded again.

386
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,110
Come on. Hurry up.

387
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,580
You two losers.

388
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,440
Don't you know what day it is today?

389
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,120
If the delivery is delayed,

390
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,190
I will bury you

391
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,270
under this cave.

392
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,200
I was wrong.

393
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,830
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,770
What are you waiting for?

395
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,100
Go get the goods loaded.

396
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,710
Come here, you.

397
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,420
After the goods are loaded,

398
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,350
follow the route marked on the map.

399
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,450
Leaving the team on the way is forbidden.

400
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,870
You guys

401
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,370
signed the contract of life and death with us.

402
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,450
You know what to do.

403
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,960
Don't worry, Eldest Young Master.

404
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
We will follow you.

405
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,160
Wu Zhonglian has given me

406
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,160
the location of the mine.

407
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,220
As long as I find the mine

408
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,420
and get the evidence,

409
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,680
Wu Zhonglian won't be able to get away.

410
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,160
Who's that?

411
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,080
Who brought that spy here?

412
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,470
You, stay here and load the goods.

413
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,500
The rest of you, go after her!

414
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,180
-Yes.
-Yes.

415
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,200
Stop!

416
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,250
Stop! Don't run!

417
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,440
Get her!

418
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,670
Don't let her escape!

419
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,790
Get her!

420
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,220
As expected from Wude Bureau,

421
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,440
you are indeed skilled.

422
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,380
But today,

423
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,300
you won't be able to escape.

424
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,410
Where is she?

425
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,570
Where did she go?

426
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,680
Is she there?

427
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,240
Not here either.

428
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,910
Keep quiet.

429
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:39,900
Five.

430
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,190
Thirteen.

431
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,720
Miss Man'er.

432
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,570
What happened?

433
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,480
During the day,

434
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,230
I made a trip to the Song Mansion.

435
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,030
I overheard the servants saying

436
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,870
they were going up the mountain to receive and deliver goods.

437
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,330
I thought it was too weird,

438
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,710
so I followed them.

439
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,880
As expected,

440
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,360
I saw Song Haikun

441
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,080
in front of a mine.

442
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,910
Wu Zhonglian sent Young Master to deliver the ore.

443
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,140
Why did he let Song Haikun

444
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,280
do the same thing?

445
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,440
He's in danger.

446
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,990
Where Shen Nuo went to probably isn't a mine,

447
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,710
but a trap.

448
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,310
Don't worry.

449
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,720
Before Young Master left,

450
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,610
I read the map

451
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,670
that Wu Zhonglian gave him.

452
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,130
Let's go there right away.

453
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,870
Let's go.

454
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,670
I was wondering who it is.

455
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,050
Aren't you Boss Song?

456
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,870
We met in Master Wu's mansion.

457
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,750
We solved business riddles together.

458
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,680
Do you remember?

459
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,990
Stop pretending.

460
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,440
See how many people I brought?

461
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,470
Do you think I'm here

462
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,870
to make friends with you?

463
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,000
You go first.

464
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,940
Since Boss Song

465
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,520
is straightforward,

466
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,140
I'll stop pretending then.

467
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,340
Go.

468
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:51,910
Don't move!

469
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,600
Let go of me!

470
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,190
I got her!

471
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,710
Let go!

472
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,800
Let go!

473
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,130
Go.

474
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,150
Let go of me!

475
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,300
Thirteen, go!

476
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,200
No.

477
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,430
Neither of us can survive if you don't go.

478
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,750
Go save Shen Nuo.

479
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,910
Go! Go!

480
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,720
Go after him!

481
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,230
Stop! Stop!

482
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,310
You brat.

483
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,020
Do you want to die?

484
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,150
How dare you screw Master Wu's business up?

485
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,610
He'll definitely kick your ass.

486
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,410
Take her away.

487
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,560
[Shufang Garden]

488
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,020
Master Wu.

489
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,620
Why haven't His Lordship's men

490
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,140
brought back any news yet?

491
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,330
They couldn't have let that brat get away, could they?

492
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,820
Given their ability,

493
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,480
Shen Nuo won't be able to hold on much longer.

494
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,410
But if he really managed to escape,

495
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,710
will he

496
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,440
come to us

497
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,190
with Wude Bureau's officials?

498
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,860
Now, that Miss Lian

499
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,570
did find out

500
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,110
the location of the mine.

501
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,070
But I have her kept here.

502
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,150
Even if Wude Bureau's officials come here,

503
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,370
what can they possibly do to me

504
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,870
with no evidence?

505
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,590
Right.

506
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,970
We are under His Lordship's protection.

507
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,790
Even the current government

508
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,660
has to show due respect for His Lordship.

509
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,720
No matter who comes,

510
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,230
we will

511
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,430
get rid of them altogether.

512
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,720
[Desperate Warrior of Marquis Ningyuan, Wu Qiu]

513
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,790
Come on. Have a rest.

514
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,800
Have some water.

515
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,440
They're all dead.

516
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,490
Our men are all dead.

517
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,750
I'm too ashamed to go back to Black Tiger Fortress.

518
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,310
I'm too ashamed to face their families.

519
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,870
I'm too ashamed to face Master.

520
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,800
Four, don't worry.

521
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,680
I will definitely take revenge for them.

522
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,940
Young Master.

523
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,230
Are you all right?

524
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,960
What happened exactly?

525
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Wu Zhonglian set up a trap to kill us.

526
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,900
Only Four and I survived.

527
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,020
Why are you here?

528
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,790
Why are you hurt?

529
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,790
I'm okay.

530
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,520
But Miss Man'er...

531
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,460
Miss Man'er... She...

532
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,360
She was taken away by Song Haikun.

533
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,930
What?

534
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,300
She went to the inn to find me.

535
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,510
She said she followed those from the Song Mansion

536
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,440
and found the location of the mine.

537
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,490
So she thought

538
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,720
you must have fallen into

539
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,880
Wu Zhonglian's trap.

540
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,140
We were about to set off

541
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,470
when Song Haikun and his men got there.

542
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,130
He started fighting with us without a word. I...

543
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,910
She... I'm sorry.

544
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,510
I failed to protect her.

545
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,380
Take Four back to the Fortress.

546
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,710
Young Master, no.

547
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,910
Our men haven't arrived yet.

548
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,050
It's too dangerous

549
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,720
for you to go save her by yourself.

550
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,050
Man'er is in danger now.

551
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,280
How can I just stay here and do nothing?

552
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,780
If Man'er gets hurt,

553
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,560
I will make Wu Zhonglian

554
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,520
suffer the pain a thousandfold.

555
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,750
Young Master.

556
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,990
Take Four back to the Fortress.

557
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,790
Young Master.

558
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,670
Here.

559
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,340
Come on.

560
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,120
You're just a girl.

561
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,170
Why do you have to overestimate yourself

562
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,250
and be my enemy?

563
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,890
You must be joking, Master Wu.

564
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,990
I'm just a restaurant owner.

565
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,660
How can I be your enemy?

566
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,909
Miss Lian, you schemed

567
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,860
to approach me together with Shen.

568
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,820
You even helped him find the Hematite.

569
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,750
I really underestimated you.

570
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,830
I just happened to overhear

571
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,570
the servants talking about

572
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,350
going up the mountain and delivering goods

573
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,719
when I went to the Song Mansion to see my sister.

574
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,560
I thought,

575
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,239
wasn't Shen Nuo also going to deliver

576
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,570
a batch of goods for you?

577
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,350
I thought he must be on the mountain as well,

578
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,409
so I followed them.

579
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,409
I really don't know

580
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,750
about

581
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,989
the mine or anything else.

582
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,730
[Champion Red Brandy]

583
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,830
Champion Red Brandy.

584
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,570
Nice name.

585
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,660
How did you come up with it, Miss Lian?

586
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,210
You made the butler of Liu Mansion drunk

587
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,240
and let Concubine Liu go.

588
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,960
You also stole

589
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,470
Liu Fugui's jade pendant

590
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,990
to frame Boss Cao.

591
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,310
Am I right?

592
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

593
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,480
The one who arrested Boss Cao

594
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,560
was an official sent by the government.

595
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,660
And the goods Boss Cao was delivering

596
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,780
didn't come

597
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,680
from my mine.

598
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,980
Having government officials patrol

599
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,980
such a small place as Linshui City.

600
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,000
All the credit

601
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,230
goes to your lover,

602
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,350
Deputy Commissioner of Wude Bureau,

603
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,070
Shen Yi, Lord Shen.

604
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,790
Since you already know it, Boss Wu,

605
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,950
you could have killed me.

606
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,750
Why do you have to go through all this trouble

607
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,680
and trap me here?

608
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,530
It's easy to kill you.

609
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,840
But what if Shen

610
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,590
comes to me?

611
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,150
You two love each other so dearly.

612
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,810
Of course I have to wait for him

613
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,500
so that your love

614
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,720
can be fulfilled.

615
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,540
Boss Wu,

616
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,230
you really overestimated us.

617
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,030
I'm just one of his female companions

618
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,030
on the farm.

619
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,210
I'm not important at all.

620
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,070
It's okay.

621
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,560
Neither of you can get away.

622
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,300
Master Wu, he's here.

623
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:11,630
Who is that?

624
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,580
Stop!

625
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,110
Go!

626
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,990
Surround him!

627
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,230
Stop!

628
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,510
Where's Lian Man'er?

629
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,440
I knew you'd come.

630
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,190
Shen.

631
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,750
No.

632
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,120
I should call you Deputy Commissioner.

633
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,340
Deputy Commssioner.

634
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,540
You're indeed skilled in martial arts.

635
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,990
His Lordship's Desperate Warrior ambushed you,

636
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,450
yet you managed to escape.

637
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,030
Now you even dare to come here alone.

638
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,870
I, Wu,

639
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,150
really admire you.

640
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,530
I'm asking you, where is Lian Man'er?

641
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,740
Shen.

642
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,690
You failed my trust.

643
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,910
I guess

644
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,780
you've had your eyes on me

645
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,210
the first time you saw me.

646
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,030
Have you ever thought

647
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,440
it might be even earlier than that?

648
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,070
Since you are so honest with me, Shen,

649
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,070
I'll also be more straightforward.

650
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,750
No matter why Wude Bureau sent you here,

651
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,030
today,

652
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,270
don't you think about

653
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,530
leaving this mansion.

654
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,990
And this one.

655
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,190
Miss Lian.

656
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,240
Go.

657
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,960
-Man'er.
-Shen.

658
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,420
Don't act rashly.

659
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,390
What on earth do you want?

660
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,050
How about

661
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,870
we play another round of business riddles?

662
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,490
It's neither above nor below us.

663
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,930
Human is not as big as it, and the sky is bigger than it.

664
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,830
One.

665
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,430
It's not above, but below.

666
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,270
It's stuck in the middle.

667
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,190
It's right on both sides.

668
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,270
There's no need to beat around the bush, Master Wu.

669
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,000
You mean one-for-one.

670
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,190
I have to trade my life

671
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,550
for her life, right?

672
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,230
You're still so smart, Shen.

673
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,950
Well,

674
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,990
you may start.

675
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,430
Let her go!

676
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,950
Shen.

677
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,310
Your relationship with Miss Lian

678
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,770
is indeed extraordinary.

679
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,320
But why aren't you willing

680
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,980
to kill yourself now?

681
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,780
Let her go.

682
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,090
Shen.

683
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,580
It's all thanks to you

684
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,580
that I'm where I am today.

685
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,370
Go to hell!
