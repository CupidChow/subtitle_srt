[Episode 21]

4
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,060
Xiu'er, check it out.

5
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,830
Your wedding

6
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,410
is happening too soon.

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,410
Otherwise,

8
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,910
I would have asked someone

9
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,950
to make you a more expensive dowry.

10
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,180
It's quite a pity, coming to think of it.

11
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,380
I don't even have time

12
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,390
to make more clothes for you

13
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,720
with those new fabrics.

14
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,870
Mother.

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,120
The Liu Mansion isn't short of any of these.

16
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,910
Keep the fabrics and make some good clothes

17
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,880
for yourself.

18
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,110
You look so pretty.

19
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,310
Man'er.

20
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,840
Grandpa.

21
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,680
Grandma.

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,340
Father told me

23
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,270
Xiu'er is getting married.

24
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,780
Yes.

25
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,970
Check it out.

26
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,720
These are all betrothal gifts

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,650
Xiu'er's husband-to-be gave her.

28
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,000
Look, there're so many.

29
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,070
There are more in that room as well.

30
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,840
There's something that

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,990
I don't know if I should say.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,770
Go ahead.

33
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,590
Xiu'er

34
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,890
can't get married like this.

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,730
What nonsense are you talking about?

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,530
You just don't want Xiu'er to live happily, do you?

37
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,490
What do you mean by that?

38
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,710
To be honest,

39
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,270
Liu Fugui

40
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,790
doesn't have a son at all.

41
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,400
Lian Man'er.

42
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,640
I don't mind

43
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,550
that you always like to meddle in others' business.

44
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,270
But you even want to meddle in my marriage?

45
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,670
You just can't take it that I'm happy, can you?

46
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,150
I just think

47
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,420
something is fishy about this.

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,790
That's why I'm here to remind you.

49
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,830
Yes.

50
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,720
I think Man'er is right.

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,470
Your marriage is very important.

52
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,130
It shouldn't be done hastily.

53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,110
Why don't we ask around first?

54
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,270
Also, according to Shouren,

55
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,710
the wedding must be set on the 15th.

56
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,590
I also think

57
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,400
it's a bit too hasty.

58
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,860
It's better to figure it out first.

59
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:29,910
Father.

60
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,050
You've agreed to this marriage.

61
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,240
If you ask around now,

62
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,230
what if the Liu family

63
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,940
finds out?

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,460
They would think we don't trust them.

65
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,590
What should we do

66
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,490
if the marriage gets canceled?

67
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,440
Exactly.

68
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,850
Tell me.

69
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,390
If there isn't a Young Master Liu,

70
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
then who's this?

71
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,710
Do you think the Liu family

72
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,990
is some poor and humble family?

73
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,790
Why would they

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
tell us nobodies

75
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,880
how many people there are in their family?

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Besides,

77
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,510
Eldest Brother

78
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,620
personally arranged this marriage for me.

79
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,420
Are you saying

80
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,910
Eldest Brother lied to us?

81
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,950
Xiu'er.

82
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,320
You shouldn't let your guard down.

83
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,870
-You don't even know...
-I don't care.

84
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,440
Mother.

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,570
I'm determined to marry into the Liu family.

86
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,520
Xiu'er finally

87
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,010
got her marriage settled.

88
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,410
Besides, that's such a prestige family.

89
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,150
Listen up.

90
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,990
If anyone dares

91
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,360
to ruin this marriage,

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,420
I won't let her off.

93
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,240
Alright, go away.

94
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,589
Grandma.

95
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,230
Leave now.

96
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,160
-This is too weird.
-Shut up and go back.

97
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,170
-Grandpa!
-Shut up!

98
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,300
-Grandpa!
-Go back!

99
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,230
Come on, sit here.

100
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,920
Don't listen to her.

101
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,120
So you lied to

102
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,480
our parents and Xiu'er.

103
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,790
Don't you know who Lord Liu is?

104
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,909
Even the government

105
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,520
has to show due respect for him.

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,710
He already said it.

107
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,030
Xiu'er has to marry him,

108
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,909
no matter what.

109
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,670
That means

110
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,950
if we don't obey him,

111
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,170
not to mention my job,

112
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,770
even my life will be at risk.

113
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,780
We can't afford to offend

114
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,430
Jinyang Guild.

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm in such a dilemma.

116
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,780
On the one hand,

117
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,470
I dare not say no

118
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,590
to Lord Liu at all.

119
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,630
On the other hand,

120
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,290
if our parents know

121
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,790
Xiu'er will be a concubine,

122
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,990
they wouldn't agree.

123
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,600
For now,

124
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,420
I can only lie to them.

125
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,430
If Xiu'er knows it,

126
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,830
she'll definitely get mad, right?

127
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,640
What if she refuses to marry him?

128
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,320
Then Lord Liu...

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
I can't think that far ahead.

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,490
As long as this doesn't get exposed

131
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,480
before the wedding.

132
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,370
As soon as she arrives at the Liu Mansion,

133
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,430
my job will be done.

134
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,320
But she will

135
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,520
find it out

136
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,110
after she marries into that family.

137
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,110
Do you think

138
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,680
Xiu'er will accept that?

139
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Stupid.

140
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,870
People are flexible.

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,770
Once she marries into the Liu family

142
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,100
and lives happily for a few days,

143
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,770
she'll come round.

144
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,730
Lord Liu promised that

145
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,350
as long as Xiu'er marries him,

146
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,810
she'll live a luxurious

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,409
and even extravagant life.

148
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,350
I think

149
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,230
it's not a bad thing.

150
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,640
God, please bless us.

151
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,940
Don't let anything go wrong.

152
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,560
All right.

153
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,390
Stop nagging.

154
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,570
How much money do we have left?

155
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,090
So naggy.

156
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,760
You can't take it all.

157
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,390
It may not even be enough.

158
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,710
We should at least give some to Xiu'er.

159
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,800
She's the one who's marrying into the Liu family.

160
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,120
If things get exposed,

161
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,790
I...

162
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,120
I just hope

163
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,020
she wouldn't hate me that much.

164
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,490
Give it to me.

165
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,790
Leave one.

166
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,590
Leave some...

167
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,190
Alright. Here you are.

168
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,990
What kind of nonsense is this?

169
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,860
I put in a good word for you

170
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,730
in front of Master Wu.

171
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,250
Master Liu.

172
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,850
Are all the goods inside?

173
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,560
Yes. Those with seals.

174
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,070
No mistakes are allowed

175
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,000
on this mission.

176
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,860
Let's sneak in there and have a look.

177
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,500
Okay.

178
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,680
[Seal]

179
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,350
Why isn't it salt?

180
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,049
Come on.

181
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,299
Let's go inside.

182
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,920
All the stuff

183
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,430
is here.

184
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,730
Boss Cao.

185
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,590
Just follow

186
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,970
the route on the map

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,530
and get the goods delivered.

188
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,710
-Okay.
-Be careful on your way there.

189
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,490
When you arrive,

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,480
take this jade pendant out.

191
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,960
Someone will be there to receive the goods.

192
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,420
Keep it well.

193
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,230
Return it to me when you come back.

194
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,560
No problem, Master Liu.

195
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,080
One more thing.

196
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,310
Do not open the boxes.

197
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,670
I know

198
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,800
what we should do

199
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,510
and what we shouldn't do.

200
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,990
It's nothing.

201
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,680
That should be a stray cat.

202
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,400
If you do it well,

203
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,740
Master Wu's next assignment will also be yours.

204
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,670
If you fail, however,

205
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,430
you know what happened to Song Haikun.

206
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,450
Got it.

207
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,250
All the bosses in the guild

208
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,560
have their eyes on

209
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,330
this big deal Master Wu gave me.

210
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,090
Please rest assured, Master Liu.

211
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,410
I won't make

212
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
any mistake.

213
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,590
It's Hematite.

214
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,340
Hematite?

215
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,780
Hematite is the ore

216
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,950
used to forge weapons.

217
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,350
Private mining and transportation

218
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,480
is strictly banned by the government.

219
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,750
Why did Wu Zhonglian send Cao to...

220
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,410
-Could it be Marquis Ningyuan wants to...
-Yes.

221
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,830
It can only be for force expansion without permission

222
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,470
that he needs to avoid the government

223
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,310
and get the ore mined to forge weapons.

224
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,510
Marquis Ningyuan is evilly ambitious.

225
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,590
I'm afraid he's up to rebellion.

226
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,350
I thought Jinyang Guild

227
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,410
was only involved in salt smuggling.

228
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,590
I didn't expect that salt smuggling

229
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,790
is just a camouflage.

230
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,550
Boss Cao is not

231
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,710
a dispatcher at all.

232
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,130
He's Wu Zhonglian's ore delivery handler.

233
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,200
What he does on the surface

234
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,330
is just a disguise for his real doings.

235
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,400
Fine.

236
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,760
Marquis Ningyuan is really scheming.

237
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,070
If we had known this,

238
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,950
we should have

239
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,950
followed Boss Cao

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,110
to the garrison of Marquis Ningyuan

241
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,830
to have a look.

242
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,350
No.

243
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,070
If the Wude Department

244
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,310
gets caught trespassing on their garrison,

245
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm afraid they'll be spooked.

246
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,050
It'll be harder for us to investigate in the future.

247
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,670
What should we do now?

248
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,280
If this lasts for any longer,

249
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,830
once he makes a move,

250
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,350
the consequences will be unimaginable.

251
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,990
Marquis Ningyuan is very powerful.

252
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,390
Without solid evidence,

253
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,230
it will be hard for the government

254
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,760
to criminalize him openly.

255
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,590
The priority for now

256
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,430
is the ore.

257
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,710
Only by finding the mine

258
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,410
can we possibly find solid evidence.

259
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,460
What's wrong?

260
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Why the long face?

261
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,680
Is it for Xiu'er's matter?

262
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,610
Did you solve it?

263
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,040
What happened?

264
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,150
Lian Shouren

265
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,890
arranged a marriage for Xiu'er.

266
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,850
The person Xiu'er is going to marry

267
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,020
is Liu Fugui's son.

268
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,350
But, as you know,

269
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,950
Liu Fugui doesn't have a son.

270
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,510
Your uncle Shouren is really something.

271
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,230
He always sets his own family up.

272
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,020
And your grandparents haven't learned any lesson.

273
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,070
Since you've talked to them and they wouldn't listen,

274
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,870
there's nothing else you can do.

275
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,760
Calm down.

276
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,840
Yes.

277
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,140
Maybe

278
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,160
they even blame you for being nosy.

279
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,840
You guessed it right.

280
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,830
Xiu'er is determined

281
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,490
to get married no matter what.

282
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,160
At this point,

283
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,400
I can only hope

284
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
things won't be as bad

285
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,290
as I thought.

286
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,590
After marrying into the Liu family,

287
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,900
you can't behave like you're at your own home.

288
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,160
You need to be careful about everything.

289
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,100
When you arrive at the Liu Mansion,

290
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,680
don't hurry off the sedan

291
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,360
or rush into the house.

292
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,320
Only after the beans are sprinkled

293
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,720
can you get off the sedan.

294
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,840
Mother.

295
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,490
I'm getting married.

296
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,990
I'm not a child anymore.

297
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,560
In my eyes,

298
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,320
you'll always be a little girl.

299
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,810
In a blink of an eye,

300
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,360
you're getting married.

301
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,830
Mother.

302
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,930
I'm just getting married and moving to the town.

303
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,280
I won't be far from home.

304
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,320
When we have time,

305
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,830
we can visit each other.

306
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,600
Will the Liu family allow you

307
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,130
to come and go as you please?

308
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,120
I'll be the wife of Young Master Liu.

309
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,210
Let alone visiting,

310
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,920
it won't be a problem

311
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,340
even if I want you two to come live with me.

312
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,200
Of course.

313
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,070
My daughter will be the Young Master's wife.

314
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,590
Look.

315
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,900
Here.

316
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,990
Good girl.

317
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,980
Up.

318
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,790
Higher.

319
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,930
Higher. Good.

320
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,170
Congratulations.

321
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,330
Today is your daughter's wedding day.

322
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,030
Wedding attendant.

323
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,470
The bridal procession has arrived.

324
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,270
But...

325
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,490
Where is the groom?

326
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,600
Exactly.

327
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,990
Our Young Master

328
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,220
is waiting for the bride in the mansion.

329
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,430
Well...

330
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,050
Where's the groom?

331
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,590
I've never seen a groom

332
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,920
being absent from the bridal procession.

333
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,730
Today's a big day.

334
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,320
Don't get us wrong

335
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,170
or get upset.

336
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,700
We didn't mean

337
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,980
to snub your daughter.

338
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,430
It's just because...

339
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,110
Nanny.

340
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,110
Although our family

341
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,710
is not wealthy or honorable,

342
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,090
the rules of a wedding

343
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,480
should still be followed.

344
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,070
If the groom doesn't show up, we won't let her go.

345
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,470
Yes.

346
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:46,880
This...

347
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,520
Man'er.

348
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,170
We are a humble family.

349
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,320
How can we know

350
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,530
the rules of a prestige family?

351
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,160
Maybe their traditions

352
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,250
are different.

353
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,470
Bookkeeping Official Lian, you know things better.

354
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,870
The day before yesterday,

355
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,840
our Young Master

356
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,110
went to Taiyi Temple

357
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,070
and asked the Taoist priest

358
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,420
to read his fortune.

359
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,440
The priest said

360
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,700
your daughter

361
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,780
was born to be rich and lucky.

362
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,910
Of course. That's for sure.

363
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,930
However,

364
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,410
coincidentally,

365
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,290
our Young Master

366
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,230
is unlucky this year.

367
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,480
He's afraid that it may affect your daughter's luck

368
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,280
and make the wedding less merry.

369
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,330
That's why

370
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,310
he asked me to come here instead of him.

371
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,220
But don't worry.

372
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,840
To show

373
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,960
his sincerity,

374
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,040
besides the betrothal gifts,

375
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,870
our Young Master asked me to bring

376
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,530
a few more boxes of gold, silver, and satin here.

377
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,330
Here, take a look.

378
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,460
So much.

379
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,570
It must be worth a lot.

380
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,590
Nanny.

381
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,240
Although the gifts from your mansion

382
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,120
are valuable,

383
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,240
Xiu'er

384
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,100
is also the apple of our eye.

385
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,050
How could her wedding

386
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,970
be so hasty?

387
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,990
Please ask Young Master Liu

388
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,990
to come in person.

389
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,400
Man'er is right.

390
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,359
It's not about gold, silver, or satin.

391
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,740
Our daughter is not for sale.

392
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,670
Man'er.

393
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,470
Nanny has made it very clear.

394
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,069
You're just a junior here.

395
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,130
How dare you talk back to your elders?

396
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,550
If you make Xiu'er miss the auspicious time,

397
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,630
can you afford it?

398
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,190
Exactly.

399
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,990
Our Liu family

400
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,960
is a prestigious family.

401
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,990
How can we possibly lie to you?

402
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,020
Rest assured, everyone.

403
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,350
Our Young Master said

404
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,950
when the bride comes back to visit,

405
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,220
he'll prepare another gift

406
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,130
and send it here.

407
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,070
That's ridiculous.

408
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,130
Enough. Stop it.

409
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,140
You're just a junior.

410
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,230
How can you talk back to your elders?

411
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,540
How inappropriate.

412
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,600
Exactly.

413
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,710
Look.

414
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,790
They've sent so many betrothal gifts here.

415
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,470
No other girl from all over the county

416
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,610
can compete with that.

417
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,130
Right?

418
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,630
If you ask me,

419
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,270
we shouldn't miss the auspicious time.

420
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,990
Hurry up.

421
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,990
Mother.

422
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,560
Let her serve the tea.

423
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,550
The bride serves the tea.

424
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,640
Thank you, Father,

425
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,630
for raising me for all these years.

426
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,760
Xiu'er.

427
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,970
Your life after being married won't be the same as here.

428
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,550
You must never forget

429
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,670
to be gentle and virtuous.

430
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,310
Hope you can take good care of your husband and children,

431
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,080
and live a happy life.

432
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,180
I will bear it in mind, Father.

433
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,550
Mother.

434
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,670
Xiu'er.

435
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,180
I have nothing else to say.

436
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,790
I'll be at ease

437
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,780
as long as you live happily after getting married.

438
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,250
Mother.

439
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,090
Take care of yourself as well.

440
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,860
I'm about to leave.

441
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,210
The auspicious time has arrived.

442
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,320
Time for the bride to depart.

443
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,150
So she just got married and left like this?

444
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,560
Wedding attendant.

445
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,920
Have you ever seen Young Master Liu?

446
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,800
Is he kind and friendly?

447
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,150
Young Master Liu is very kind

448
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,610
and easy to get along with.

449
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,930
I'm sure he will

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,460
treat you very nicely in the future, My Lady.

451
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,650
Shouldn't beans be sprinkled for the wedding?

452
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,870
It's unnecessary.

453
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,230
The rules of a prestigious family

454
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,220
are indeed different

455
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,680
from those in our village.

456
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,140
By the way,

457
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,450
I haven't gone through the wedding rites yet.

458
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,040
Why was I sent directly into the bedroom?

459
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,470
Just stay here.

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,400
They just want me to have a rest here, right?

461
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,750
Who... Who are you?

462
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm whoever

463
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,360
you're marrying today.

464
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,480
You are...

465
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,740
The one I'm marrying is Young Master Liu.

466
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
Why are you here?

467
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,440
I'll make you

468
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,980
Lord Liu's concubine.

469
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,330
Isn't that even better?

470
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,890
I...

471
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,780
I... You...

472
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,520
I...

473
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,280
Go away!

474
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,050
Go...

475
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,020
Go away!

476
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,940
This is my mansion.

477
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,310
Where do you think you are going?

478
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,270
Don't come over.

479
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,690
If you come any closer,

480
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,380
I'll kill myself.

481
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,810
You brat!

482
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:20,840
Come on.

483
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,660
Hurry!

484
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,480
Move!

485
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,680
Help!

486
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,980
Let go of me! I...

487
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,580
Let go of me!

488
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,310
You...

489
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,630
I'm not going.

490
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,730
No.

491
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,600
No.

492
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,310
-I'm not going in there!
-Hurry!

493
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,550
Let go of me! Help!

494
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,370
Help! Let me go!

495
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,690
You're just a country girl.

496
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,920
You took so much from me,

497
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,940
yet you refuse to behave yourself.

498
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,370
Stay here and think.

499
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,390
I won't let you out until you come to your senses.

500
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,830
Lock her up.

501
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,410
Yes.

502
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,640
My Lord.

503
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,780
Master Wu asked someone to deliver a message.

504
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,910
He wants to see you as soon as possible.

505
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,390
Mother.

506
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,030
I want to go home.

507
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:47,850
Master Wu.

508
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,070
You called me here at such a late hour.

509
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,580
Is there an emergency?

510
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:53,810
Sit.

511
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,060
What happened to your hand?

512
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,930
Master Wu, sorry to let you see this.

513
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,220
The new concubine I got

514
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,730
has quite a strong temper.

515
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,680
I just taught her a lesson.

516
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,510
It's nothing.

517
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,910
The higher-ups have given a new order,

518
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,670
complaining our shipment was too slow.

519
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,730
They want us to hurry up.

520
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,950
Why are they suddenly in such a hurry?

521
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,170
Master Wu.

522
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,750
We haven't been slacking off.

523
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,070
It's just our current ore shipment route

524
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,700
is meant to avoid the crowd.

525
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,830
So we've been making a detour

526
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,210
by taking the mountain road in the northwest.

527
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,050
Therefore, a single trip takes at least

528
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,850
half a month.

529
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,630
If we want to speed up,

530
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,770
we can only take the east route, where more people live.

531
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,990
But we won't be able

532
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,610
to avoid the villages there.

533
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,030
Take the east route.

534
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,550
So we won't avoid being noticed anymore?

535
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,140
If something goes wrong,

536
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,380
it'll be very bad.

537
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,190
If no one lives there,

538
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,810
we won't need to avoid them anymore.

539
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,880
Master Wu, you mean...

540
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,100
Assemble everyone

541
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,460
in the merchant guild.

542
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,400
Got it.

543
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,890
[Shufang Garden]

544
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,340
Right here.

545
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,710
Master Wu.

546
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,050
Are you planning

547
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,090
to buy all the land within 20 miles

548
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,750
to the east of Jinyang County?

549
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,040
There are a dozen villages,

550
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,230
including Shisanli,

551
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,690
Zhaihu and Taoxingsheng.

552
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,830
Master Wu, you're making such a big deal.

553
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,640
What kind of business are you planning to do

554
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,390
that requires such a large space?

555
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:27,890
Yes.

556
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,470
Master Wu

557
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,280
invited you here today

558
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,400
to see which of you

559
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,280
can take on the task of land acquisition.

560
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,670
Land acquisition?

561
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,920
Master Wu.

562
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,960
The villagers of these villages

563
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,130
in this area

564
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,330
have lived there for generations.

565
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,020
If you want those people to move out

566
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,860
and sell their villages to you,

567
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,760
it'll be very hard.

568
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,470
Even if we want to,

569
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,350
we won't be able to do that.

570
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,720
Exactly.

571
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,880
Master Wu.

572
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,180
May I ask

573
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,180
what your purpose

574
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,920
of land acquisition is?

575
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,880
You only need to tell me

576
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,580
whether you can take on the task or not.

577
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,500
As for the rest,

578
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,340
don't ask.

579
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,700
Whoever is able to get this done

580
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,880
will get

581
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,990
the next assignment.

582
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,980
It's a good deal.

583
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,340
Boss Zhang.

584
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,780
Do you want to have a try?

585
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,720
I do want to.

586
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,470
Master Wu.

587
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,360
I'm at your service.

588
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,820
Good.

589
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,640
Show me

590
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,880
what you're capable of, Boss Shen.

591
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,780
Wait for my good news.

592
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,110
Boss Shen is young.

593
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,550
I'm afraid he can't do it.

594
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,830
Let me do it.

595
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,970
I'll definitely get it done for you.

596
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,800
Master Wu, please think twice.

597
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,440
Think about it.

598
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,190
Give it more thought.

599
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,720
Exactly.

600
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,230
Think twice, Master Wu.

601
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,490
Are you really going to acquire that land?

602
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,410
If I don't do it,

603
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,010
someone else will.

604
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,310
Have you made up your mind?

605
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,420
Do you still have doubts?

606
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,750
Only by becoming the new dispatcher

607
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,990
can I get the chance to approach the mine.

608
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,240
Isn't this

609
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,470
what we got in Jinyang Guild for?

610
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,630
Then, have you figured out

611
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,670
how you should explain

612
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,670
to the villagers?

613
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,270
After all, it's where Miss Lian's home is.

614
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,480
If she knows,

615
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,680
she'll be upset.

616
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,080
We'll have to take it one step at a time.

617
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,480
This...

618
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,430
Grandma.

619
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,560
Grandma!

620
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,070
What are you doing?

621
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,300
Waiting for Xiu'er to visit.

622
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,700
It's been three days.

623
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,950
Man'er.

624
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,480
Do you think something may have gone wrong?

625
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,240
Uncle Shouren.

626
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,730
Come here.

627
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:48,920
Mother.

628
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,250
You...

629
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Are you chatting?

630
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,800
Where is Xiu'er?

631
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,910
Why hasn't she come back to visit us?

632
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,710
Maybe she's busy with the etiquette

633
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,920
since she just married into their family.

634
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,990
She'll come visit you

635
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,250
in a few days after she's done.

636
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,310
Let's talk inside.

637
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,450
Visiting her maiden family is such an important matter.

638
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,040
She has to complete the etiquette before she can come back?

639
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,670
The Liu family

640
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,910
is so impolite.

641
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,940
Kid.

642
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,640
So nosy.

643
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,670
It's the elders' business.

644
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,930
Why are you butting in?

645
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,250
Go get some water.

646
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,470
Mother.

647
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,870
Let me tell you.

648
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,550
Shouren.

649
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,230
Don't interrupt me.

650
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,750
Tell me the truth.

651
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,760
When will Xiu'er

652
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,920
come back and visit?

653
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,440
I've told you.

654
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,310
She'll come back in a few days

655
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,180
after she completes the etiquette.

656
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,160
Mother, check this out.

657
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,620
It's from the Liu Mansion.

658
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,540
This is all good stuff.

659
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,130
They asked me

660
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,200
to bring back

661
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,520
all these maiden-family-visiting gifts.

662
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,200
Poria,

663
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,130
Codonopsis pilosula,

664
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:39,950
Angelica sinensis,

665
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,850
and Polygonum multiflorum.

666
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,080
They spent quite a lot.

667
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,620
The Liu family treats Xiu'er

668
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,000
so well.

669
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,640
Yes.

670
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,070
She won't be mistreated.

671
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,740
Are you going to deliver the vegetables?

672
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,190
Yes.

673
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,670
Master Lian.

674
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,940
Why hasn't Boss Shen

675
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,830
come to the restaurant recently?

676
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,740
He has other business to attend to.

677
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,710
Why?

678
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,750
These are the vegetables

679
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,930
he promised to send

680
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
to the bosses of Jinyang Guild.

681
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,130
These are for Boss Cao

682
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,890
from Kaibu Village.

683
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,410
These are for Boss Liu.

684
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,510
I'll go deliver the vegetables to Boss Liu

685
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,430
with you.

686
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,180
Okay.

687
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,680
[Liu]

688
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,710
Master.

689
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,070
We've arrived.

690
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,610
Stop.

691
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,840
Who are you?

692
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,040
We're from One Fresh Move Diner.

693
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,170
We're here to deliver hot spring vegetables to Boss Liu.

694
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,850
Why haven't I heard of it?

695
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,540
Then please

696
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,500
inform him, Sir.

697
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,770
[Lofty Ambition]

698
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:17,909
Wait.

699
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,870
Are you from One Fresh Move?

700
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,350
Yes.

701
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,159
This is Master Lian.

702
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,469
You don't look like

703
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,219
a servant who does menial work.

704
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,469
Turns out you are the master.

705
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,920
Thank you

706
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,370
for coming here in person, Master Lian.

707
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,570
You're welcome, Sir.

708
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,790
Our Boss Shen is Master Liu's colleague

709
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,989
in Jinyang Guild.

710
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,310
We're just delivering some vegetables here.

711
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,370
It's not a big deal.

712
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,830
Take it to the kitchen.

713
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,260
Yes.

714
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,469
Wait.

715
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,179
Just leave the vegetables

716
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,510
here.

717
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,820
I'll ask my men to carry them in later.

718
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,190
Don't go any further inside.

719
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,810
The Liu Mansion

720
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,160
is really magnificent.

721
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,260
Even your compound

722
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,720
is better than other mansions' courtyards.

723
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,830
I heard that

724
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,420
there's been a wedding here at the Liu Mansion.

725
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,180
May I ask you for some wedding candies

726
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,240
for good luck, Sir?

727
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,040
Wedding?

728
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,570
That...

729
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,650
That wasn't really a wedding.

730
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,870
It's just His Lordship

731
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,660
got another concubine

732
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,950
from outside.

733
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,710
We're already used to it.

734
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,010
Concubine?

735
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,680
Is she the one

736
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,970
that married into your family 5 days ago?

737
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,680
I was thinking,

738
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,030
if there were a wedding in Liu Mansion,

739
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,030
you should have invited those from the merchant guild

740
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,630
here for the wedding banquet.

741
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,440
It seems

742
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,520
that wasn't some formal wedding.

743
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,210
Exactly.

744
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,990
Why would His Lordship

745
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,440
hold a banquet

746
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,250
for such an occasion, right?

747
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,580
Moreover,

748
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,800
that concubine

749
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,280
is an ungrateful country girl.

750
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,430
Judging from your tone,

751
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,140
did that new concubine

752
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,220
offend Master Liu?

753
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,900
Don't get me started.

754
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,860
She made a scene all night

755
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,390
on her first day here.

756
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,990
His Lordship was so angry that

757
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,670
he locked her up

758
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,840
in the woodshed.

759
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,270
She's still

760
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,980
reflecting on herself there.

761
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,390
This girl

762
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,720
is really stubborn.

763
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,670
She wouldn't yield no matter what.

764
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,950
She threw out

765
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,300
all the food and drinks that we gave her.

766
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,460
She's making it hard

767
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,630
for us servants, right?

768
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,960
Exactly.

769
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,280
Well,

770
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,630
the vegetables have been delivered.

771
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,360
Master Lian,

772
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,690
forgive me for not asking you to stay longer.

773
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,750
-Please.
-See you.

774
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,820
Hey, you.

775
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,620
Come here.

776
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,140
You order peanuts

777
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,020
and beans all day.

778
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,500
Can't you order some meat for me?

779
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,100
Okay.

780
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,500
Go.

781
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,670
I still have to eat this.

782
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,240
What took you so long?

783
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,270
It'll be ready soon.

784
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,800
Come to my place for dinner.

785
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,620
Man'er.

786
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,850
Ye'er.

787
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,640
Neither of them is here.

788
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,340
Are you here for Thirteen?

789
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,060
Yes.

790
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,000
It's easy to catch a cold in this season.

791
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,820
I brought some medicine here

792
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,550
so that he can carry it with him.

793
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,020
They've been away a lot recently.

794
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,280
They just joined Jinyang Guild.

795
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,430
Maybe they're busy.

796
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,650
I'll go put it in the room.

797
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,170
Ye'er.

798
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,810
Something happened to Xiu'er.

799
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:48,920
Do you remember

800
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,990
I told you

801
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,390
Liu Fugui

802
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,860
might not have a son?

803
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,760
I thought something was fishy about it,

804
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,220
so I went to the Liu Mansion

805
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,970
in the name of delivering food.

806
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,870
As expected,

807
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,360
Xiu'er was tricked

808
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,050
to be Liu Fugui's concubine

809
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,520
by Uncle Shouren.

810
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,430
After Xiu'er found out about this,

811
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,360
she made a scene.

812
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,350
Now she's locked up.

813
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,370
How could Uncle Shouren

814
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,780
lie to our whole family?

815
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,550
We should tell our grandparents right away.

816
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,610
Let's go to the Liu Mansion to get her.

817
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,700
No, we can't.

818
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,430
If we go get her now,

819
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,410
they won't hand her over to us.

820
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,800
I'm afraid we'll make things worse

821
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,720
if we go there.

822
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,240
We may not only fail to get her out,

823
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,660
but also irritate Liu Fugui.

824
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,920
Then Xiu'er will be...

825
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,920
Can Liu Fugui

826
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,590
kill Xiu'er?

827
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,570
Who knows?

828
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,030
Liu Fugui managed

829
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,570
to instigate Uncle Shouren to set up a fake marriage,

830
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,640
and he can do whatever he wants

831
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
in Jinyang Guild.

832
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,240
He's definitely difficult to deal with.

833
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,150
Xiu'er is the most important person to Grandma.

834
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,140
If Grandma knows,

835
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,680
she'll definitely go make a scene at the Liu Mansion.

836
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,220
So don't tell anyone in our family

837
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,400
about this.

838
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,120
Man'er.

839
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,960
We can't just do nothing about it, right?

840
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,280
You still haven't come round yet?

841
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,410
I want to go home.

842
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,690
I don't want to be a concubine.

843
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,950
I thought it would be interesting to deal with

844
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,610
someone with a strong temper.

845
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
Stubborn like a mule.

846
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,670
I don't keep idlers in my mansion.

847
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,200
Either

848
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,050
you serve me well,

849
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,070
or you die.

850
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,490
Think about it yourself.

851
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,160
Don't go!

852
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,840
I want to go home.

853
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,690
I don't want to be a concubine.

854
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,380
Go home?

855
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,640
Your home is about to be gone.

856
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,250
Where are you going?

857
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,760
What do you mean?

858
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,670
Come back!

859
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,070
Tell me clearly.

860
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,970
Why is my home about to be gone?

861
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,900
Come back.

862
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,670
Tell me.

863
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,850
Why is my home about to be gone?

864
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,900
Hurry up.

865
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,550
Buy land?

866
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,770
So, the government...

867
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,630
[Land Acquisition Announcement]

868
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,040
All families...

869
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,720
What is this?

870
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,970
What does it say?

871
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,380
Jinyang Guild?

872
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,270
It's that big chamber of commerce in town.

873
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,110
They want to buy the land of our village.

874
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,140
Buy land?

875
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:11,940
Look.

876
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,470
They not only want the land,

877
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,130
but also our yards and houses.

878
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,910
How can we live in the future?

879
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,150
Yes.

880
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:18,730
Exactly.

881
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,810
They say they'll buy it with money.

882
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,850
With that money,

883
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,270
we can go live in town.

884
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,640
Isn't that a good thing?

885
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,030
You don't understand.

886
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,870
Knock it off.

887
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,390
We are farmers.

888
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,770
How can we make a living

889
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,270
in town?

890
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,900
Yes.

891
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,740
Exactly.

892
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,730
It won't be enough

893
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,800
if Jinyang Guild

894
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,150
only gives us the money to buy new houses.

895
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,730
They have to give us enough money

896
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,100
for living and doing business.

897
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,010
Or I won't sell

898
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,950
my house and land.

899
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,470
Yes.

900
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,910
They must give us all the money we need.

901
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,280
Yes.

902
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:44,910
Exactly.

903
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,670
I won't go no matter how much they pay me.

904
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,690
We've lived here generation after generation.

905
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,740
This is where our roots are.

906
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,690
Well said.

907
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,410
Well said.

908
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,230
That's right.

909
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,490
Well said.

910
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,370
I won't go.

911
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,360
You can go if you want.

912
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,950
Yes.

913
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,140
Father.

914
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,950
You are finally back.

915
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,180
Ye'er told me about it.

916
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,510
What happened exactly?

917
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,290
Today,

918
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,990
after the land acquisition announcement was put out,

919
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,950
the villagers have been in confusion.

920
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,980
Some agree,

921
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,030
and some wouldn't agree no matter what.

922
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,070
They even tore off the announcement.

923
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,590
So I called you back

924
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,960
to discuss with you.

925
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,680
About what?

926
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,950
There's nothing to discuss.

927
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,750
We won't sell.

928
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,830
Father.

929
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,030
I heard we can get a large sum of money from this.

930
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,670
Yes.

931
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,560
[Not for sale]

932
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,430
Father.

933
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,420
Think about it.

934
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,270
If we get that money,

935
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,030
we can go buy a house

936
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,350
in town, right?

937
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,360
Yes, Father.

938
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,790
We didn't make it to the town

939
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,110
last time when Eldest Brother got promoted, right?

940
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,630
This time,

941
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,030
let's move to the town together.

942
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,310
We can reunite there.

943
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,630
You always say

944
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,640
a family

945
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,670
should be together, right?

946
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,350
Nonsense.

947
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,370
If we moved to the town with your eldest brother,

948
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,190
that would have been moving into our own house

949
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,790
thanks to your brother, who's a bookkeeping official.

950
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,750
Now,

951
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,000
it's about selling the land.

952
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,130
They're kicking you out.

953
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,460
Your roots will be gone.

954
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,020
This is called being homeless

955
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,010
and uprooted.

956
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,550
How can this be the same?

957
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,520
Shouxin.

958
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,490
Say something.

959
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,930
Of course I listen to you, Father.

960
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,190
If you agree to sell it, I'll do it.

961
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,950
If you say no,

962
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:21,690
I won't sell it.

963
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,250
Shouyi.

964
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,590
Our Lian family has been

965
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,650
living on this land for generations.

966
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,270
Although we've never been rich,

967
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,790
our life has always been peaceful.

968
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,310
We can't

969
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,890
lose our roots.

970
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,990
Fine.

971
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,230
Since you said so,

972
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,210
I'll listen to you, Father.

973
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,150
I asked around just now.

974
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,190
This is not only about our village.

975
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,520
They're acquiring land

976
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,550
in the nearby villages as well.

977
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,750
I heard that

978
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,890
Jinyang Guild has something up their sleeve.

979
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,880
Many people weren't willing to sell,

980
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,070
but they were forced to sell

981
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,000
the land by them.

982
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,810
It's Jinyang Guild that's acquiring the land?

983
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:09,370
[Mission: 1,000 taels of gold]

984
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:09,370
[Income: Restaurant income,1454 taels]

985
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:09,370
[Expenses: Restaurant management cost, 280 taels]
