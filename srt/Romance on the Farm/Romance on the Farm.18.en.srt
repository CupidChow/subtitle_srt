00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,380
Black Tiger Fortress gave you the wine?

5
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,940
You had no money.

6
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,539
How did you get the wine back?

7
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,340
It's a secret.

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,460
Fine, I don't want to know anyway.

9
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,330
By the way,

10
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,509
have you decided on the menu?

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,000
We can buy the store soon.

12
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,410
To run a successful restaurant,

13
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,840
you must have some signature dishes.

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,970
I remember when I was in the capital...

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,470
I remember all the good things I ate

16
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,860
when I was there.

17
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,270
I got it.

Everything is ready.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,920
We just need the final touch.

22
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,380
Do you think

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,329
the peach one looks better,

24
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,500
or this color?

25
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,110
I think...

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,130
It'll look good as long as

27
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,800
you draw it.

28
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,130
You look good in any color.

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,780
We've recruited a few staff.

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,590
We agreed on a

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,430
three-day hold.

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,570
It's not even three days yet.

40
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,010
How could you reserve it for someone else?

41
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,680
Both of you are business people.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,829

neither a deposit

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,660
nor a contract to bind the agreement.

47
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,420
This three-day hold

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,880
was just a verbal promise.

49
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,090
Why can't it change?

Okay.

56
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,670
let me tell you the truth.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,100
My cousin and I

58
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,240
have been engaged.

59
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,050
But not long ago,

60
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,740
the doctor said that she...

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
It's a long story.

62
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,090
Looks like it's not easy for you too.

63
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,700
But what does it have to do

64
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,860
with buying the store?

65
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,100
For the past four generations,

66
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,590
my cousin's family only had one offspring.

67
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,540
But now, as the only child,

68
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,820
she is also a daughter.

Her biggest wish

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,960
is to open a tavern like this

71
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,060
so that she could make her ancestral wine

72
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,120
known to the world.

73
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,850
But she can't buy the store now.

74
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,150
What should she do?

75
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,310

76
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,530
I understand your difficulties.

77
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,339
But I have accepted the buyer's deposit.

78
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,680
If I go back on my word now,

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,440
not only will I offend the buyer,

80
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,459
I have to pay the deposit three times back.

81
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,950
Sir, this...

82
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,430
You'd better think of another way.

83
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,460

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,700

90
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,190
It's not your fault.

91
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,450
You've tried your best.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,420
But we can't buy the store now,

93
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,570
and we have so much wine at home.

94
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,820
What should we do?

95
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,380
My ill fate is to be blamed.

96
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,820
I can't

97
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,150
carry forward the legacy of

98
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,640
our ancestors.

99
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,600

these things anymore.

104
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,530

105
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,480
I really feel bad.

106
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,520

107
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,310
You're right.

108
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,880
How should we

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,320
break this news to my father?

110
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,840
If my father finds out,

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,400
he will certainly break us up.

112
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,190
Cousin,

113
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,110
maybe after we leave today,

114
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,400
we'll have to say goodbye

115
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,659
to each other forever.

116
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,170
I was thinking that

117
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,870
after we open the tavern

118
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,680
and make some money,

119
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,780
we could find a place

120
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,780
close to the lake.

121
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,850
There will be mountains by the lake

122
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,980
and fish in the lake.

123
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,350
We will harvest rice together,

124
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,850
roast taros together,

125
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,100
tend to the family together,

126
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,760
and bicker over

127
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,650

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,460
I still want

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,810
the identity of a local.

162
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,400
This way, I can seize the chance

163
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,060

164
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,409
to Jinyang Guild without alarming them.

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,050
-I really need your help.
-I promise you.

167
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,120
Okay?

168
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,740
What a perfect couple.

169
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,900
Should I also

170
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,260
call you my cousin?

171
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,310
Shen.

172
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,050
When did you get

173
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,350
engaged to Man'er?

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,460
This...

175
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,880
What act is this?

176
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,620
This act is called

177
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,580
"a hopeless lover sacrificing himself to buy a store."

178
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,510
Man'er must have fallen for it too.

179
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,659
I'm just here to buy a store with my cousin.

180
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,830
I saw that the boss was troubled

181
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,090
and felt deeply emotional.

182
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,210
So I said a few words from the bottom of my heart.

183
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,180
Right, Cousin?

184
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,700
I'm leaving.

185
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,130
I see how it is.

186
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,590
You were trying to fool me

187
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,650
with a lover's act!

188
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,330
To think I was genuinely touched by your story...

189
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,240
But now,

190
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,300
no matter what you say today,

191
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,960
I won't sell this store to you.

this way, please.

194
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,250
Let's settle the deed

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,960
today.

196
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,080
You two bought the store?

197
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:18,730
Yes.

198
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,830
Cousin.

199
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,570
Thank you.

200
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,570
This way, please.

201
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,880
Miss Man'er.

202
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,820
Why are you back alone?

203
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,360
Did the store purchase go well?

204
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,060
No. Someone else bought it.

205
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,490
Can we check out

206
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,570
other stores then?

207
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,940
I don't know.

208
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,350
Wait.

209
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,100
This matter is very important

210
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,860
to the Young Master.

211
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,460
How could you...

212
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,390
How could I what?

213
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,070
Ever since your Young Master

214
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,290
came to Shisanli Camp,

215
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,570
I’ve helped him a lot.

216
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,230
Now that we failed to buy the store,

217
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,470
you're going to blame me?

218
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,950
I...

219
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,250
So in your heart,

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,580
in your Young Master's heart,

221
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,730
only your tasks

222
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,750
are top priority.

223
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,970
To achieve the tasks,

224
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,160
you can deceive and make use of others.

225
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,730
Do you not care about

226
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,130
what others think at all?

227
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,690
Miss Man'er.

228
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,470
Don't you know by now

229
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,070
what is most important

230
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,360
to the Young Master?

231
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,830
Before coming back from Black Tiger Fortress,

232
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,070
Young Master had a chance

233
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,000
to get the registration book back.

234
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,830
But when he found out that

235
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,180
the wine was yours,

236
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,090
he asked

237
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,770
Yu Xiangjin to give them back.

238
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,910
Yu Xiangjin made it difficult for him

239
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,220
and made him choose between the registration book

240
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,950
and the wine.

241
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,240
He chose the wine without hesitation

242
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,960
and gave up on the evidence

243
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,360
he worked so hard to find.

244
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,550
If we had

245
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,700
gotten the registration book,

246
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,720
we would have gone back to the capital by now.

247
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,370
We wouldn't have

248
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,100
to go around the bush right now.

249
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,860
He never mentioned any of these to me.

250
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,920
There are many things

251
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,100
he cannot reveal.

252
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,690
I know you're angry

253
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,700
because you care.

254
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,690
Right?

255
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,850
Don't you know

256
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,330
Young Master's feelings?

257
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,190
Lian Man'er.

258
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,060
What happened to you just now?

259
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,050
We were about to

260
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,130
persuade the Boss.

261
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,010
Why did you leave so suddenly?

262
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,250
If we can't get the store,

263
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,100
we'll lose the chance

264
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,710
to get close to Jinyang Guild.

265
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,340
This was the only store

266
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,520
available in the east market.

267
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,190

Here, eat more.

302
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,220
Man'er.

303
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,970
Try this.

304
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,220
Here.

305
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,840
Eat more.

306
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,530
The chicken smells so good.

307
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,140
Be careful.

308
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,800
Try this.

309
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,730
This eggplant is your favorite.

310
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,820
Have some vegetables.

311
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,450
How about we

312
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,600
eat our own food?

313
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,910
Your mother said

314
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,280
you wanted to buy that store.

315
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,000
But Hua'er bought it instead.

316
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,430
Then,

317
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,580
what about opening the restaurant?

318
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,330
In the whole east market,

319
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,930
only that store was for sale.

320
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,820
I don't think we can find another one

321
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,810
in a short time.

322
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,590
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

323
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,960
I remember Chunzhu's family

324
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,020
had an empty store in the east market.

325
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
It should not be far away.

326
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,950
How big is the store?

327
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,910
Does it come with furniture?

328
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,320
I only know

329
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,980
there is such an empty store.

330
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,340
I don't know

331
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,400
about the details.

332
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,030
But Hua'er is also

333
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,310
opening a restaurant.

334
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,840
I'm afraid it's not good to compete with them.

335
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,190
There were two time-honored brands

336
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,920
called Yuqing Hall

337
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,850
and Qingyu Hall.

338
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,950
The two stores opened close to each other.

339
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,020
But over the past hundred years,

340
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,880
both stores have been doing well.

341
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,610
I think business isn't just about

342
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,980
how good we can be on our own.

343
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,990
It also depends on how others can complement us.

344
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,000
Only by mutual comparison

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,880
and competition,

346
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,280
can business get better.

347
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,320
I agree.

348
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,340
Even if she wants to open a restaurant,

349
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,240
I will definitely

350
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,630
run a better restaurant than her.

351
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,760
No matter the store,

352
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,390
I'll make it the best and biggest one out there.

353
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,850
Father.

354
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,150
Where is this store?

355
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,240
[Changle Tavern]

356
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,240
[Store For Sale]

357
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,420
I'm taking back

358
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,630
what I said before.

359
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,730

360
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,560
It's okay.

361
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,280
Now that we have

362
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,970
a store,

363
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,360
we just need manpower.

364
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,360
The staff are here. It's them.

365
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,780
Where are you going?

366
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,440
The last store that opened here

367
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,700
closed down after two months.

368
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,030
They didn't even pay us.

369
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,870
You should find someone else.

370
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,410
What should we do?

371
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,420
It's okay.

372
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,500
It's easy to find good staff.

373

374

It seems that...

381
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,620
He was preparing to run away.

382
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,760

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,340
is to gather the crew.

385
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,590
An accountant?

386
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,110
Uncle Shouyi, I've long heard that

387
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,970
you're very good with the abacus.

388
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,380
No one within a radius of 100 miles

389
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,840
is better than you at that.

390
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,470
Although I’ve already witnessed your skill

391
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,940
when we split from the family,

392
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,930
my father said that

393
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,500
you are

394
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,610
really capable.

395
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,780
Of course.

396
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,920
In terms of calculating with the abacus,

397
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,190
no one dares to say

398
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,569
they are better than your Uncle Shouyi.

399
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,500
No one dares to say they're better!

400
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,069
Uncle Shouyi.

401
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,329
I'll be frank.

402
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,599
If you work as my accountant,

403
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,440
in the first three months,

404
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,460
I'll pay you one tael of silver per month.

405
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,550
When business gets better,

406
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,980
I'll raise it by ten coins.

407
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,580
If you think it's not enough,

408
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,900
you can pull some crowd in

409
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,390
whenever you're free.

410
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,080
By then,

411
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,060
I'll give you a dividend according to

412
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,250
the number of customers you introduced.

413
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:41,840
Anyway,

414
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,130
the better the business is,

415
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,350
the more you'll earn.

416
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,820
Don't worry.

417
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,980
Your uncle

418
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,170
has many friends in town.

419
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,410
When the time comes, we'll get them

420
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,950
to all support our restaurant.

421
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,470
Okay.

422
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,400
Right, Shouyi?

423
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,460
Enough.

424
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,540
Just ignore him.

425
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,200
Have some sunflower seeds.

426
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,580
Uncle Shouyi.

427
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,220
Let's not talk about other things.

428
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,850
But I did a lot

429
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,120
to get you out of jail.

430
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,860
The debt of gratitude...

431
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,480
Man'er.

432
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,610
Since Uncle Shouyi doesn't want to,

433
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,850
let's go back for now.

434
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,470
I have a few good friends

435
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,800
who want to work with us.

436
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:26,900
Let's go.

437
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,700
Good friends?

438
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,090
I'll leave now, Aunt He.

439
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,950
We're leaving.

440
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:30,790
Well...

441
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,090
He didn't decline either.

442
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,760
W-well...

443
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,540
Shouyi.

444
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,840
Say something.

445
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,940
See?

446
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,460
Come on.

447
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,790
It's not that I don't want to do it.

448
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,770
Who wouldn't do it when there's money to earn?

449
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,310
But you should know

450
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,550
the situation in our family.

451
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,010
You split from the family.

452
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,980
Your Uncle Shouren and Aunt Gu left too.

453
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,450
With your Grandma's temper,

454
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,810
do you think she'll allow us to leave home

455
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,740
and work in town?

456
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,520
It's mainly because of your Grandma.

457
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,050
Don't worry.

458
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,610
If Grandma Lian is your concern,

459
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,180
I have a way to address it.

460
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,310
However,

461
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,450
the two of you

462
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,440
need to put up an act with me.

463
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,680
An act?

464
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,740
Xiu'er.

465
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,980
Your Eldest Brother said that

466
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,130
once he takes office,

467
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,790
he'll find you a good husband.

468
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,860
Didn't the master also

469
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,190
say it will happen soon?

470
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,230
When I become a rich lady in town,

471
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,530
I'll take you there

472
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,730
so you can enjoy life.

473
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,120
I know you are filial.

474
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,990
Mother!

475
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,450
Mother!

476
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,350
Mother!

477
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,940
Help me!

478
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,190
Are you two crazy?

479
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,550
Help me! Mother!

480
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,140
Go on, keep running.

481
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,010
Even if you run to

482
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,120
the Heavenly King,

483
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,850
you still have to pay me back.

484
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,860
Who are you?

485
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,080
Who am I?

486
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,330
Ask your son.

487
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,510
Shouyi.

488
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,570
You don't dare to say it?

489
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,420
Fine, I'll say it for you.

490
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,170
Your son, Lian Shouyi,

491
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,830
borrowed 100 taels of silver to gamble.

492
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,420
He lost completely.

493
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,980
You good-for-nothing!

494
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,990
Why did you gamble again?

495
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,510
Mother.

496
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,940
This is not the time to talk about this.

497
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,700
Save me!

498
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,390
Old Madam.

499
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,140
It's only right to pay your debts.

500
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,120
Return the money to us

501
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,270
and everything will be fine.

502
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,820
Dream on!

503
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,980
Even if you kill and eat us, we have no money!

504
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,630
No money?

505
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,700
No money!

506
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,050
I'll kill them then!

507
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,450
This girl is pretty.

508
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,070
Go back with me and be my wife.

509
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,760
It has nothing to do with me.

510
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,710
It has nothing to do with me.

511
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,240
Three.

512
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,830
Didn't we agree on it?

513
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,590
You can have the house,

514
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,510
but the woman is mine.

515
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,980
Mother.

516
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,680
I want her as my wife.

517
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,870
I will treat you well.

518
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,440
No.

519
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,470
Don't touch my daughter!

520
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,020
Don't touch my daughter.

521
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,400
Pay me back then.

522
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,000
I have no money...

523
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,060
Mother, give her the money.

524
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,240
How about this?

525
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,860
I have a restaurant in town.

526
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,290
Either let your son

527
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,720
work at the restaurant and pay me back,

528
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,050
-Shouyi.
- or...

529
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,750
Let your daughter

530
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,650
become their wife.

531
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,430
Don't.

532
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,520
Old Madam.

533
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,900
Your son or your daughter. Choose one.

534
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,140
Mother.

535
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,020
Let her be their wife.

536
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,590
Mother.

537
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,620
Marry her to them.

538
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,230
Yes, that's right.

539
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,940
Mother!

540
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,330
Marry her to them. Mother!

541
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,670
Mother, how could you do this?

542
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,410
-How could you do this to me?
-Mother!

543
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,710
Help me, Mother!

544
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,540
How could you do this to us?

545
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,130
Mother!

546
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,260
Mother, I'm going to die.

547
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,860
I don't want to go to the restaurant.

548
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,390
Let's go.

549
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,100
Let's go.

550
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,400
Let's go.

551
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,260
Mother!

552
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:19,660
Hurry!

553
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,900
Save us! Mother!

554
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,220
Mother!

555
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,020
Mother!

556
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,670
Mother!

557
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,480
Mother.

558
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,380
What should we do now?

559
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,580
[Employee Recruitment Station]

560
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,730
Chen Ahcai.

561
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,300
Where are you from? Any work experience?

562
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,210
I'm from Qingliu Town.

563
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,740
I worked as a cook at Piaoxiang Restaurant,

564
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,020
fed the horses at Wanlong Inn,

565
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,910
and served as a waiter at Tongchun Restaurant.

566
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,220
Be it working in an inn, teahouse, or tavern,

567
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,120
I am familiar with all of it.

568
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,650
That's a lot of experience.

569
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,060
Why don't you work in the kitchen?

570
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,580
Okay.

571
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,950
It's my turn.

572
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,630
My name is Zhang Xiaoer.

573
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,020
I'm strong and I can endure hardships.

574
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
I'm agile on my feet and I'm not lazy.

575
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,020
Then you'll be the waiter.

576
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,630
Okay.

577
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,850
Come on.

578
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,980
It's your turn.

579
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,780
Uncle Dafu.

580
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,420
Yes.

581
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:55,500
Yes.

582
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
You used to be a butcher.

583
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,450
How about cutting vegetables?

584
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,200
No problem.

585
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,420
I did this when I was young.

586
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,910
Okay, I'm counting on you.

How did it go?

590
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,410
Need you ask?

591
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,820
The moment they took out

592
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,520
their knives,

593
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,220
your grandma was scared to death.

594
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,460
This was the first time

595
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,590
I've ever seen your grandma like that.

596
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,070
Uncle Shouyi.

597
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,970
I'll leave it to you.

Come on.

601

I'll count on you in the future.

602
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,180
Uncle Shouyi.

603
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,910
Don't worry.

604
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,390
Your uncle is very capable.

605
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,670
Looks like Yu Xiangjin and the gang

606
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,730
did a very good job.

607
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,650
Of course.

608
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,260
Don't forget what she previously did

609
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,310
for a living.

610
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,390

Ye'er.

614
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,210
I saw that your room was still bright.

615
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,940
It's late, why are you still up?

616
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,880
Thirteen.

617
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,230
How's the recruitment going?

618
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,940
Not bad.

619
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,110
We've recruited all the staff.

620
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,160
Your parents have been

621
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,930
recruited by Miss Man'er

622
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,590
to work in the restaurant too.

623

Ye'er.

624
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,720
I think the rouge you make

625
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,630
is getting better

626
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,690
and more delicate.

627
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,580
These are made to complement

628
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,780
the lipstick colors.

629
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
I think if there is a chance,

630
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,640
we can sell them as a set.

631
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:31,840
Right.

632
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,470
I also

633
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,920
prepared

634
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,110
small sachets in this color.

635
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,190
We can pack them together this way. What do you think?

636
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,920
Sounds good.

637
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,720
I'll help you with it.

638
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,340
Isn't this your money pouch?

639
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,140
Why is it here?

640
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,310
This...

641
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,030
It's not my money pouch. It's...

642
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,610
The running water is loud, and the music from the strings is soft.

646
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,660
Did you not mean to

647
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,530
borrow money from me last time?

648
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,810
It's a poem

649
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,990
I embroidered from a book.

650
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,480
I don't know if it's suitable.

651
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,940
For me?

652
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,290
Is it really for me?

653
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,490
Thirteen,

654
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,100
can you understand my feelings?

655
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,210
Yes, I...

656
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,950
Of course I understand.

657
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,980

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,740
you can take the chance

766
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,510
to get on Boss Wu's good side.

767
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,320
I don’t think it’s a good idea.

768
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,320
Why not?

769
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,940
If you can get on

770
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,070
Boss Wu's good side,

771
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,390
the bosses in the merchant guild

772
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,240
will surely give you more respect.

773
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,210
By then, not only will they

774
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,740
visit our restaurant often,

775
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,790
we might even be able

776
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,140
to collaborate on

777
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,630
future projects with them.

778
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,620
Only with real capability

779
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,700
can you gain a foothold in the mansion.

780
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,870
Then, everyone in the mansion

781
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,270
will think highly of you.

782
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,170
You're right.

783
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,890
It's been so many days.

784
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,830
I've changed the menu

785
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,990
two times.

786
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,560
Why is business still not good?

787
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,440
No need to rush.

788
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,390
No matter what you do,

789
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,300
it's impossible to be successful

790
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,140
in one go.

791
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,390
If you want to blame someone,

792
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,540
blame your parents.

793
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,900
We are all farmers.

794
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,320
We can't think of

795
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,990
any good ideas

796
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,150
in such a short time.

797
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,950
Mother, that's not what I meant.

798
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,970
I just think that

799
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,060
the location of our shop

800
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,250
is too remote.

801
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,660
The business is probably not going to be good.

802
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,150
I don't think so.

803
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,270
You know what?

804
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,980
When you were little,

805
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,710
I went to town with your father.

806
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,850
That was when I saw a store

807
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,350
called Wang Erniang's Pickle Store.

808
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,290
The location of that store

809
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,420
was also very remote.

810
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,660
It was in an alley.

811
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,670
But the line for their pickles was

812
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,470
all the way down the street.

813
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,590
Truly,

814
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,080
good wine does not fear deep alleys.

815
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,910
As long as our dishes are delicious,

816
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,130
no matter how remote the place is,

817
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,930
the customers will come for you.

818
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,020
Good wine does not fear deep alleys...

819
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,600
But we need to have good wine first.

820
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,700
Mother.

821
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,040
What if your daughter

822
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,830
lost all the money?

823
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,110
What can we do?

824
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,910
We'll just take care of you.

825
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,660
I can't possibly let my daughter starve.

826
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,230
A few days ago,

827
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,340
your granny and grandpa

828
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,600
sent me a letter.

829
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,610
They said they missed me.

830
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,010
I thought about it

831
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,150
and decided

832
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,230
not to let them take the trip.

833
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,260
I'll go

834
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,490
visit them instead.

835
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,260
So,

836
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,160
before I leave,

837
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,670
I have to harvest

838
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,770
all these radishes

839
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,420
and pickle them.

840
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,230
Winter is here,

841
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,310
fresh vegetables are scarce.

842
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,300
Your father

843
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,460
is waiting for my pickled radish

844
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,610
to go with his rice.

845
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,440
Mother.

846
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,900
What did you just say?

847
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,460
Your father

848
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,610
is waiting for my pickled radish

849
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,620
to go with his rice.

850
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,350
Before that.

851
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,100
Winter is here,

852
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,880
fresh vegetables are scarce.

853
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,260
Great.

854
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,410
I know what our "good wine' is.

855
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,710
I got it!

856
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,180
I know what our "good wine' is!

857
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,750
You...

858
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,160
What did I say?

859
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,260
No business? No business...

860
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,500
How can there be no business?

861
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,500
Thirteen.

862
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,710
Tomorrow morning,

863
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,520
gather some village folks and enter the mountains with me.

864
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:16,980
Ye'er.

865
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,920
Tomorrow,

866
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,970
take your rouge and lipstick

867
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,770
and go to the restaurant with me.

868
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,710
It's time

869
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,170
to use my trump card.

870
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,580
She has finally gone mad.

871
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,820
You're here.

872
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,260
Here.

873
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,270
Here.

874
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,810
Thank you for your help.

875
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,800
After this,

876
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,380
I'll treat you to dinner at the restaurant.

877
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,040
Okay.

878
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,790
Where did they get the fresh vegetables?

879
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,550
Excuse me.

880
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,940
Fresh vegetables are here.

881
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,760
Excuse me.

882
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,590
Fresh vegetables are here.

883
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,440
Come and have a look.

884
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,410
Excuse me.

885
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,990
The fresh cucumber

886
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,780
is so nice.

887
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,780
We can have fresh food.

888
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,190
Come and take a look.

889
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,920
The freshest vegetables.

890
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,300
I've never heard of it.

891
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,950
Where did they get so many

892
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,470
fresh vegetables in the winter?

893
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,800
Let's go and have a look.

894
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,930
Ever since winter started,

895
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,480
my family has not eaten any fresh vegetables.

896
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,810
Let's go and have a look.

897
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,060
Coming.

898
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,400
Fresh vegetables.

899
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,350
Excuse me.

900
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,810
Fresh vegetables.

901
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,450
This is the one!

902
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,790
Welcome to One Fresh Move.

903
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,950
This way, please.

904
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,900
Please come in.

905
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,620
Okay.

906
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,980
Mr. Zhao, let’s go.

907
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,350
Please come in.

908
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,780
Come and take your number plate.

909
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,100
If you miss your number,

910
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,050
you will be delayed by three tables.

911
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,760
Everyone,

912
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,870
listen to me.

913
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,360
Every young lady who comes to eat

914
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,440
can do nails and makeup for free.

915
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,870
We have the most popular colors

916
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,360
and makeup available.

917
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,390
Let me see.

918
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,620
What do you mean by doing our nails?

919
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,110
Coming.

920
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,510
Malatang!

921
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,710
Malatang!

922
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,380
A bowl of malatang in winter.

923
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,990
It's good for your body.

924
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,030
What is malatang?

925
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,830
Sir,

926
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,740
this is the special dish

927
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,620
of our restaurant,

928
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,390
malatang with hot spring vegetables.

929
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,440
We specially select fresh vegetables not available

930
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,090
in season

931
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,100
and cook them on a strong flame.

932
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,760
It's hot, spicy, and warming.

933
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,990
Everyone,

934
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,840
if you have a bowl

935
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,530
of malatang

936
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,690
in the cold winter,

937
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,650
it can satisfy your hunger and warm your stomach.

938
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,060
It's the best warming product of the season.

939
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,070
Not only that,

940
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:40,930
If you like

941
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,170
the hot spring vegetables here,

942
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,370
you can order them on the spot.

943
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,940
Our shop will deliver them

944
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,310
to your doorstep for free.

945
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,260
Okay.

946
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,110
Thank you.

947
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,500
Please support us.

948
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,000
Enjoy yourselves.

949
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,740
Eat more.

950
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,500
There's a new restaurant ahead.

951
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,470
I heard it's pretty good.

952
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,430
Let's go.

953
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,250
Where is this One Fresh Move?

954
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,070
Master Wu,

955
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,610
Chunhuai Pavilion is right ahead.

956
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,470
We'll be there soon.

957
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,350
Let's go.

958
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,680
Their dishes are very unique.

959
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,740
Yes, there's a long line at the door.

960
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,760
What happened?

961
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,360
Eat more later.

962
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,190
Let's go.

963
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,750
They are here.

964
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,020
So lively.

965
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,180
So many people.

966
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,620
Hurry up.

967
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,750
Over there.

968
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,790
Hurry up.

969
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,030
So many people.

970
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,940
How long will it take?

971
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,550
Honey.

972
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,750
Didn't Master Wu agree

973
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,210
to come to our restaurant?

974
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,250
Why did they leave again?

975
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,290
Ten geese sold.

976
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,130
Dear customers.

977
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,470
350 grams.

978
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,310
Six wild rabbits sold.

979
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,400
980 grams.

980
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,500
Make way.

981
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,080
Ten chickens sold.

982
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,990
Excuse me.

983
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,450
There's nothing wrong with my account.

984
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,460
Thank you, Uncle Shouyi.

985
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
Don't mention it.

986
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,190
No problem.

987
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,700
Master Wu.

988
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,540
It's noisy here.

989
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,540
Let's go to the Song family's restaurant instead.

990
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,590
No hurry.

991
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,530
Waiter, private room.

992
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,930
Waiter.

993
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,300
Sir,

994
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,360
I'm really sorry.

995
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,680
We don't have

996
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,900
private rooms here, only the main hall.

997
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,670
Although it's a bit shabby,

998
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,660
we offer unique dishes

999
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,260
and vegetables that are not available in season.

1000
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,720
Why don’t you try it first?

1001
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,750
Master Wu, how about...

1002
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,660
Gentlemen, you don't look like commoners.

1003
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,840
You must be used to

1004
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,590
delicacies.

1005
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,430
Today,

1006
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,940
why don't you try something new

1007
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,660
in our shop?

1008
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,620
Okay.

1009
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,490
I'll try it.

1010
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,460
Please come in.

1011
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,120
Customers, this way, please.

1012
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,650
Master Wu?

1013
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,160
Could it be

1014
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,300
Wu Zhonglian, the chairman of Jinyang Guild's Chamber of Commerce?

1015
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,160
It's possible.

1016
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,770
Let's play it by ear.

1017
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,980
Here, have a taste.

1018
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,840
Sir, this way, please.

1019
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,840
I only heard that

1020
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,310
folks in Sichuan eat like this.

1021
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,730
Those who know this food

1022
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,070
must be well-educated

1023
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,700
scholars

1024
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,960
from rich families.

1025
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,070
May I know

1026
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,750
how to address you, Sir?

1027
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,710
The richest man in Jinyang, Wu Zhonglian, Master Wu.

1028
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,660
Boss Wu, it's you.

1029
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,980
I’ve heard a lot about you.

1030
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,550
It's an honor

1031
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,140
to meet you today.

1032
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,110
That's impressive.

1033
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,550
You have heard of Master Wu?

1034
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,280
Master Wu is

1035
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,470
famous here.

1036
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,950
Everyone knows him.

1037
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,860
Although rich families

1038
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,730
would store some vegetables

1039
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,060
in the cellar in winter.

1040
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,270
But at this time,

1041
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,340
you make fresh vegetables

1042
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,070
available to the common folks.

1043
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,530
Young man,

1044
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,510
you are quite capable.

1045
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,510
Thank you, Master Wu.

1046
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,720
You must have seen all kinds of things

1047
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,920
during your travels.

1048
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,620
Our small tricks

1049
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,610
are not worth the mention

1050
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,040
in your presence.

1051
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,710
It's not easy to run a business

1052
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,010
in this remote alley.

1053
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,630
You managed your business

1054
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,620
so well.

1055
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,330
It's even more impressive.

1056
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,820
To attract customers with fresh vegetables

1057
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,110
and make the customers stay with nail polish and makeup.

1058
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,230
Today,

1059
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,310
I've met a real eye-opener.

1060
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,340
Don't worry.

1061
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,960
I’ll visit you more in the future.

1062
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,740
Thank you, Boss Wu.

1063
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,860
I

1064
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,650
have a favor to ask.

1065
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,760
Just say it.

1066
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,980
I’ve long heard

1067
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,570
that Boss Wu controls

1068
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,020
the only merchant guild in Jinyang County,

1069
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,080
the Jinyang Guild.

1070
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,480
It's my honor

1071
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,850
to meet you here.

1072
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,910
But after we part today,

1073
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,920
considering your busy schedule,

1074
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,650
I don’t think we can meet again.

1075
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,370
But if there is a chance

1076
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,900
to join the merchant guild,

1077
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,850
there will be many opportunities

1078
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,860
to meet you again.

1079
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,620
I was hoping

1080
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,320
I could learn more from you.

1081
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:30,820
Kid,

1082
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,280
you are ambitious.

1083
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,440
You dare to ask Master Wu

1084
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,580
for this reward on your first meeting.

1085
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,980
Sir, you misunderstood.

1086
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,270
We are

1087
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,970
from a small farmer's family.

1088
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,360
It was not easy for us

1089
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,760
to open this restaurant.

1090
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,470
Since we bought this store,

1091
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,050
we had no business.

1092
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,910
We had no choice but to

1093
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,310
come up with these ideas.

1094
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,340
But these new ideas

1095
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,260
can't be thought up

1096
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,260
whenever we want.

1097
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,980
If we don't have a backer in the future,

1098
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,470
business will be tough.

1099
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,120
But we have the great honor of meeting Master Wu today.

1100
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800
Surely, no one would easily give up

1101
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,400
on such a fated opportunity.

1102
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,650
Young man,

1103
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,420
what’s your name?

1104
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,150
I’m from Shisanli Camp.

1105
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,480
My name is Shen Nuo.

1106
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,750
Shen Nuo.

1107
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,550
May I have your address, Master Wu?

1108
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,280
I’ll pick some good vegetables

1109
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,170
and send them to your mansion in person.

1110
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,170
What do you think?

1111
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,720
I'll cook some new dishes

1112
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,020
and send them to you.

1113
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,540
Thank you, Master Wu.

1114
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,940
Please take care of us in the future.

1115
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,060
Goodbye.
