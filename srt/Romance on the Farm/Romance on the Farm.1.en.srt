00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,600
to me.

194
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,730
Seven, let me ask you.

195
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,080
How much

196
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,980
is a cucumber here?

197
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,270
Cucumber? I don't know.

198
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,360
But I know

199
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,860
toffee apples are five coins each.

200
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,510
That means

201
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,710
one coin in this world

202
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,330
equals one yuan in the real world.

203
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,510
1,000 taels of gold

204
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,920
equals 10,000 taels of silver.

205
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,220
One tael of silver is worth 1,000 coins.

206
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,720
That means 10 million yuan.

207
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,340
10 million yuan?

208
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm wearing patched clothes.

209
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
How can I possibly

210
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,070
make 10 million yuan?

211
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,430
It's 10 million!

212
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,300
10 million.

213
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,490
It's an impossible mission.

214
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,700
Man'er.

215
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,510
Are you okay?

216
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,610
10 million.

217
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,340
Ye'er.

218
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,070
Do you know

219
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,230
how to earn 1,000 taels of gold?

220
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,990
1,000 taels of gold?

221
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,740
Are you crazy?

222
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,170
Let alone earn it,

223
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,850
we can't even see so much money

224
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,510
in our whole life.

225
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,470
How many mus of land do we have?

226
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,500
35 mus.

227
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,760
35 mus?

228
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,610
Logically speaking,

229
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,170
the crops we can harvest every year

230
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,200
are worth a lot.

231
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,710
Why are we still so poor?

232
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,570
Don't you know our situation?

233
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,830
Uncle Shouren is a scholar.

234
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,040
Grandpa and Grandma hope he can become a dignitary.

235
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,450
Once he does,

236
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,580
the whole Lian family can live a better life.

237
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,640
So over the years,

238
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,090
all the money we earned

239
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,710
has been sent to Uncle Shouren.

240
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,980
After all, he and his family live in town.

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
Everything there is expensive.

242
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,960
Peasants like us

243
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,790
can never enjoy that kind of life.

244
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,970
Besides, the government

245
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,330
is collecting more and more taxes.

246
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,300
We just paid the land tax.

247
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,490
Money is very tight now.

248
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,550
Grandma is opening the cabinet!

249
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,070
What's wrong?

250
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,670
Only when Uncle Shouren

251
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,530
comes back from town

252
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,060
does Grandma open the cabinet.

253
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,990
Are there treasures in it?

254
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,750
Ye'er.

255
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,980
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

256
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,450
Pork belly?

257
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,630
Pork belly is the most delicious.

258
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,150
One.

259
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,430
Two.

260
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,670
Three.

261
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,460
Four.

262
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,190
Five.

263
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,760
We only got four slices for the Spring Festival.

264
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,440
That's the sixth slice!

265
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,130
Seven.

266
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,300
Eight!

267
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,110
[Shisanli Camp]

268
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,100
We're almost there.

269
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,410
[Uncle Shouren's daughter,  Lian Hua'er]

270
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,830
Mother.

271
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,590
The match

272
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,660
we made for Man'er,

273
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,300
will she agree to it?

274
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,420
After all, that man is…

275
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,130
Don't worry.

276
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,530
Your Grandpa, Grandma,

277
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,710
[Uncle Shouren's wife, Gu]

278
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,170
Uncle Shouxin, and Aunt Zhang

279
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,710
have all agreed to marry Man'er

280
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,220
to that man.

281
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,050
Shouren.

282
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,190
Shouren?

283
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,030
What do you think?

284
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,820
[Father's oldest brother, Lian Shouren]

285
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,550
If

286
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,510
she were your slick second uncle's daughter,

287
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,820
things might not go smoothly.

288
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,860
Your third uncle and his wife

289
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,430
are simple people.

290
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,470
They won't have objections.

291
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,110
You've heard what your father said.

292
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,500
Tomorrow,

293
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,480
once the matchmaker takes her away,

294
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,300
the 500 taels of silver

295
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,150
will be ours.

296
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,470
I made this deal

297
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,000
for the Lian family.

298
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,740
As long as

299
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,520
Hua'er can successfully

300
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,170
marry up,

301
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,170
I can buy a position.

302
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,170
The day I take office,

303
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,660
the Lian family's miserable life

304
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,730
will come to an end.

305
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,740
Yes.

306
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,150
Remember.

307
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,790
My parents must not

308
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,870
know about this.

309
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,780
Father, look.

310
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,109
[White Pear]

311
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
This is top-notch wine.

312
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,420
It's called White Pear.

313
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,420
[Grandpa, Lian Fang]

314
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,130
This is better.

315
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,700
They are first-class desserts.

316
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,050
They're called One Bite Cookies.

317
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Dignitaries

318
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,619
love them.

319
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,510
Try them later.

320
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,230
My goodness.

321
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,780
We're already very glad that you're back.

322
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,460
You don't need to bring any gifts.

323
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,290
They must have cost you lots of money.

324
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,380
They didn't cost a penny.

325
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,580
Really?

326
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,050
[Father's second oldest brother, Lian Shouyi]

327
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,980
Someone gave them to you as gifts?

328
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,990
These years, I've been down on my luck

329
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,560
and failed many exams.

330
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,380
But

331
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,370
it's undeniable that I'm erudite.

332
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,720
While I prepare for the exams,

333
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,020
I teach students

334
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,220
in a private school.

335
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,710
My students

336
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,660
all admire me very much.

337
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,190

338
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,900
Have you been busy recently?

339
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,500
No. Not much work in the fields now.

340
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,820
I'll be busy when the autumn harvest starts.

341
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,970
Father.

342
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,560
I've put the firewood in the backyard.

343
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,640
Stop chatting here.

344
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,630
Dinner is ready.

345
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,750
Okay. Let's eat.

346
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,630
Okay.

347
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,110
Here.

348
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,040
Let's eat.

349
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,500
Here.

350
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,460
Fill the glass.

351
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,230
Shouren, eat more.

352
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,670
Alright.

353
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,710
Fill the glass.

354
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,740
Xiu'er.

355
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,420
You look

356
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,180
so beautiful

357
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,650
with that gold-plated hairpin.

358
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,540
Hua'er wouldn't wear

359
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,050
this hairpin.

360
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,500
She wanted to save it for you.

361
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,700
Here, Hua'er.

362
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,100
The meat is delicious. Have some more.

363
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,690
Have some meat.

364
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,990
How dare you!

365
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,370
What's in your mouth?

366
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,430
Meat.

367
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,590
Look.

368
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,890
Look at your good daughter.

369
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,620
She's a glutton!

370
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,970
You keep eating the meat.

371
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,710
Don't think I can't see through

372
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,460
what you're thinking.

373
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,140
I can get meat for myself.

374
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,230
Shut up!

375
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,470
Shouren seldom

376
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,100
comes back.

377
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,420
Just let children have the meat.

378
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,060
I haven't even

379
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,950
had one bite of the meat!

380
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,250
Man'er,

381
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,660
you're so shameless!

382
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,230
Both of them ate it.

383
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,700
Why couldn't I?

384
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,480
I gave the meat to Hua'er.

385
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,620
What did you do to deserve meat?

386
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,980
I washed seven eggplants,

387
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,030
eight cabbages,

388
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,230
and 29 string beans

389
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,280
I earned it.

390
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,940
You dumb girl.

391
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,040
Are you so arrogant

392
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,470
because you're going to marry a rich man?

393
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,860
How dare you talk back

394
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,060
to your elders again and again?

395
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,910
This is the daughter you raised!

396
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,660
I'm getting married?

397
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,700
Man'er.

398
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,150
Think about it.

399
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,810
You're about

400
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
to marry the son of the Sun family.

401
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,030
In the future,

402
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,120
you'll be showered

403
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,980
with riches.

404
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,730
Why do you have to

405
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,760
fight with your grandma

406
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,480
over a piece of meat?

407
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,230
Yeah.

408
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,460
The Sun family?

409
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,760
[Memorial Tablet of Sun Li, a Beloved Son]

410
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,660
Which Sun family?

411
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:14,900
Sun Li?

412
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:15,990
Yes.

413
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,230
As we all know,

414
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,490
the Sun family is one of

415
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,420
the richest families here.

416
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,870
Man'er.

417
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,380
Your life

418
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,540
is going to be better and better.

419
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,090
Not the Sun family again.

420
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,670
If I marry into it, I'll probably be burned alive again.

421
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,380
I refuse!

422
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,020
Nonsense!

423
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,660
Marriage is serious.

424
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,940
The decision

425
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,140
is not yours to make!

426
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,450
I'm getting married, not you.

427
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,260
Why can't I make the decision?

428
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,920
Brother.

429
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,130
I pulled strings

430
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,180
to make this match.

431
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,310
It's a favor to me!

432
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,620
The Sun family is not just any family.

433
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,190
It's such a good match.

434
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,770
Back then, Father, Mother,

435
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,990
and you two

436
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,540
all gave the nod.

437
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,420
Tomorrow,

438
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,940
the matchmaker will come to pick her up.

439
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,620
If I go back on my word,

440
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,590
how can I face the Sun family again?

441
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,400
Do you want me to lose face?

442
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,470
Young Master Sun is young and rich.

443
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,710
Why is he in such a hurry

444
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,420
to marry a country girl like me?

445
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,270
Who knows

446
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,990
what he's up to?

447
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:20,980
Maybe

448
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,780
I'd be burned as his widow.

449
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,430
Man'er.

450
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,050
You can't talk to Uncle Shouren like that.

451
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:30,980
Man'er.

452
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,140
You're overthinking.

453
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,300
The Sun family has chosen you

454
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,840
because you're lucky.

455
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,920
The fortune teller said

456
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,470
you're a good match for Young Master Sun.

457
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,380
As a girl,

458
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,270
you'll get married sooner or later.

459
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,180
Marrying into the Sun family

460
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,520
is what every girl dreams of.

461
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,050
-Yeah.
-It'd be a pity if you missed your chance.

462
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,060
Aunt Gu.

463
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,780
If it's really as great as you said,

464
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,710
you should let Hua'er be the bride.

465
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,340
You…

466
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,770
That's nonsense.

467
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,140
Hua'er

468
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,190
is engaged to the son of the Song family.

469
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,980
Without your uncle,

470
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,660
such a good thing

471
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,340
would never happen to you!

472
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,950
The Sun family is so rich.

473
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,940
You can't ask for more!

474
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,060
Do you expect

475
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,710
to marry into the royal family?

476
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,380
How ungrateful you are!

477
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,230
Shouxin, He.

478
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,380
What do you two think?

479
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,110
We've given consent to this marriage,

480
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,850
but since Man'er is strongly against it,,

481
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,980
I don't think we should force her.

482
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,000
Luckily, the Sun family

483
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,490
hasn't taken Man'er away.

484
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,720
Given the Sun family's influence,

485
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,480
it won't be hard for them

486
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,700
to find another good match.

487
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,110
Brother.

488
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,790
Mother.

489
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,630
Mother.

490
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,470
What's wrong with you guys?

491
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,540
Why do you

492
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,540
have to give up

493
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,510
the beautiful life at hand?

494
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,140
Shouren made the match

495
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,130
for your good!

496
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,460
How could you

497
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,090
turn him down like this?

498
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,310
You ingrate!

499
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,470
Mother.

500
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:10,980
Mother!

501
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,420
Mother!

502
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,610
Mother!

503
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,810
Look.

504
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,070
It's a great thing.

505
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,610
Can't you just say yes?

506
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,010
Look how angry you've made Mother!

507
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,480
I'm not getting married!

508
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,690
I'll in no way get married!

509
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,390
If you force me again,

510
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,510
I'll jump into the well.

511
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,670
I'm not getting married!

512
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,750
Jump! Don't stop her.

513
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,610
Man'er doesn't want to get married.

514
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,270
Grandma is pushing her too hard.

515
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,740
This is too much.

516
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,610
Beast!

517
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,110
Jump into the well or get married!

518
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,130
How dare you threaten me?

519
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,300
Fine.

520
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,730
I'm going to tell everyone

521
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,280
that the Lian family

522
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,820
forces their daughter into marriage for money.

523
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,430
Let's see what people will think!

524
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
Stop her!

525
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,980
I'll cook meat for whoever stops her!

526
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,650
I can stop her!

527
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,020
Man'er, don't do anything stupid.

528
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,710
Girl.

529
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,700
Stay back!

530
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,790
If you come closer, I'll jump off.

531
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,550
Stay back.

532
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,220
I want to eat meat.

533
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,060
S-Stay back.

534
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:16,690
Come over.

535
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,390
Man'er, don't jump!

536
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,660
Stay away!

537
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,260
Man'er.

538
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,180
Why am I so unlucky?

539
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,860
I was burned to death last time.

540
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,640
I don't think being drowned is any better.

541
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,690
Man'er.

542
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,060
Man'er!

543
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,430
Man'er.

544
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,020
Man'er!

545
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,160
Hold on to me!

546
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,190
Hold on.

547
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,080
Man'er.

548
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,630
Man'er.

549
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,760
Man'er. Man'er.

550
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,740
Man'er.

551
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,100
Man'er.

552
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,620
Don't do something so stupid again.

553
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,150
Mother.

554
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,180
What do you think

555
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,440
made Man'er change her mind?

556
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,930
Don't worry.

557
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,150
Nothing will go wrong.

558
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,670
After the matchmaker comes tomorrow

559
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
and takes her away,

560
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,510
it'll be a done deal.

561
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,620
Mother, I'm confused.

562
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,090
How did Man'er know

563
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,100
that after she marries into the Sun family…

564
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,940
No! I'm not going in there!

565
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,660
Get in!

566
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
No!

567
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:23,920
Get in!

568
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,860
No.

569
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,310
Stay here.

570
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,700
Let me out!

571
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,260
Let me out!

572
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,120
You want me to die? No way!

573
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,140
If anyone dares force me again,

574
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
I'll throw ginger juice at their face!

575
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:06,760
Who's it?

576
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,690
Who's it?

577
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,620
Seven?

578
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,700
Amazing. I'm impressed.

579
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,460
Man'er, come with me.

580
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,550
What?

581
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,390
You don't have to get married.

582
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,930
I'll protect you from now on.

583
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,570
So cute.

584
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,410
Let's go.

585
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,050
Man'er.

586
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,710
Man'er.

587
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,950
Man'er,

588
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,020
Seven.

589
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,750
Why are you hiding here?

590
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,400
He sawed off the wooden bar.

591
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,690
Man'er.

592
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,460
I've packed your things.

593
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,350
Go hide in my brother's place for a few days.

594
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,740
Go.

595
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,310
I'm useless.

596
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,510
I failed to protect you.

597
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,230
All these years,

598
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,740
I've been sucking it up in this family.

599
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,210
But this marriage

600
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,270
concerns your happiness.

601
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,020
I can't sit by anymore.

602
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,110
Go.

603
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,460
Hurry.

604
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,660
Go.

605
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,210
If Grandma finds out,

606
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,670
tell her I ran away myself.

607
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Stay safe.

608
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,300
♫We met above the clouds♫

609
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,900
♫It's a dream come true♫

610
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,030
♫A wisp of smoke♫

611
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,230
♫A passing thought♫

612
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,310
What's the point of creating

613
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,640
so many difficult relatives in a farming game?

614
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,890
♫Always on my mind♫

615
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,060
The developer must be insane.

616
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,430
I'm sent to find my uncle,

617
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,610
but no one has told me

618
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,470
where my uncle is.

619
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,840
Yellow!

620
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,900
I'm here!

621
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,290
What are you doing here?

622
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,670
How long have you been following me?

623
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,310
Good boy. You're a good dog.

624
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,070
Let's go.

625
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:54,990
Go.

626
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:55,880
This way.

627
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,200
You… You can't

628
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,270
fool me!

629
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,590
I didn't even touch you!

630
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,560
[Identity Unknown]

631
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,190
Is the system

632
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,390
giving me a boyfriend?

633
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,120
I'll pass.

634
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,270
Why did he faint?

635
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,110
Maybe because of low blood sugar.

636
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,610
A strange and mysterious

637
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,350
non-player character.

638
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,960
If I trigger a hidden plot

639
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,880
by saving him,

640
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,950
I'll be in lots of trouble.

641
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,620
I'm on the run now.

642
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,430
Sorry, bro.

643
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,110
You can't be serious!

644
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,430
[Hint: Save the key character.]

645
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,860
Stupid game!

646
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,790
Can you hear me?

647
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,660
Fine.

648
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,540
I've never done this before,

649
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,900
but I know how it works.

650
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:40,330
[CPR is performed incorrectly here for entertainment purposes. Do not imitate.]

651
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,290
What's wrong with you?

652
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,670
What should I do?

653
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,100
What should I do?

654
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,199
I have to play my ace.

655
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,989
Yellow.

656
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,300
Sorry for offending you.

657
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,170
What are you going to do?

658
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,739
I saved you

659
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,150
yet you want to strangle me!

660
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,100
Is that how you say thank you?

661
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,139
You were trying to save me?

662
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,270
What else could it be?

663
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:00,770
You don't understand.

664
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,870
Since you're a key character,

665
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,660
you must know how to help me out.

666
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,650
Let me ask you something.

667
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,210
My uncle

668
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,800
wants to sell me for widow burning.

669
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,780
What should I do?

670
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,460
Burning people alive

671
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,200
is the worst atrocity.

672
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,150
According to the law, the persecutor should be executed

673
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,040
and the accomplices should be exiled.

674
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,540
No matter who wants to do that to you,

675
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,320
report it to the government.

676
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,520
I thought

677
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,740
you had a better solution.

678
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,770
I don't have any evidence.

679
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,910
Reporting it to the government can't change anything.

680
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,790
The government

681
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,800
must be looking for me everywhere.

682
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,950
Maybe I should take this opportunity

683
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,290
to change my identity

684
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,200
so that I can find Thirteen as soon as possible.

685
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,250
-Maybe I can help you.
-Can you do me a favor?

686
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,780
What's your plan?

687
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm exhausted.

688
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,900
Did you find her?

689
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,490
It's so dark.

690
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,810
Finding her is hard.

691
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,250
There are so many bandits lately.

692
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,870
Could they have kidnapped her?

693
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,470
Maybe. Let's resume looking tomorrow.

694
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,460
You look so tired.

695
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,030
My lower back.

696
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,980
You must be exhausted.

697
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,340
What should we do?

698
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,900
Father, Mother.

699
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,860
Matchmaker Wang

700
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,440
will come to pick her up tomorrow.

701
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,790
No matter what, we must

702
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,940
find Man'er today.

703
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,750
Did you

704
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,600
let that stupid girl go?

705
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,990
Did you do it?

706
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,060
Say something.

707
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,900
Good.

708
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,780
It's really you. What a jinx!

709
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,600
Kneel if you want.

710
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,950
Stay on your knees

711
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,480
until that stupid girl

712
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,420
comes back!

713
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:18,740
Man'er?

714
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,810
What's all that noise at this ungodly hour?

715
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,330
Lian Man'er?

716
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,670
You didn't escape?

717
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,540
Where can I escape?

718
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,050
I couldn't sleep in the woodshed

719
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,060
so I went to sleep somewhere else.

720
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,460
You're pregnant.

721
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,630
Kneeling is bad for you.

722
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,660
You're making things hard

723
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,410
for Grandma.

724
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,300
Why…

725
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,950
Alright.

726
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,610
She's fine.

727
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,580
We can all be relieved.

728
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,870
Let's all go back in and rest.

729
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,210
You troublemaker.

730
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,390
Sleeping like a dead pig.

731
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,740
You could've let us know!

732
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,190
Mother.

733
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,910
Everyone stayed up late to look for you.

734
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,900
Don't be angry.

735
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,440
Why did you come back?

736
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,220
Don't worry. I'll stay.

737
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,090
I have a better way

738
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,480
to break off the engagement.

739
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,460
Let's go.

740
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,820
You good-for-nothing

741
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,180
lazy bums.

742
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,150
The sun has risen!

743
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,730
Get up!

744
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,320
When I was

745
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,580
a daughter-in-law,

746
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,980
I took good care of everything.

747
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,470
Man'er.

748
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,650
Get up.

749
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,180
Grandma is cursing outside.

750
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,460
Man'er.

751
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,370
Where's my phone?

752
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,360
No phone.

753
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,600
No air conditioner.

754
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,350
This life is unlivable.

755
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,060
What time is it now?

756
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,510
What time?

757
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,540
Nine o'clock.

758
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,510
Six, seven, eight, nine.

759
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,460
Nine o'clock?

760
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,820
He should've been here.

761
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Why hasn't he come?

762
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,910
Coming.

763
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,380
Please come in.

764
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,900
Father, Mother.

765
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,870
The matchmaker is here.

766
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,800
Father, Mother, come out!

767
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,270
I have to put on an act.

768
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,690
Man'er.

769
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,500
Man'er.

770
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,180
Are you sick?

771
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,140
Gentle.

772
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:36,950
Grandpa.

773
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,510
Grandma.

774
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,570
Sorry.

775
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,130
I caught a cold a few days ago.

776
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,940
I thought I'd recover in a few days.

777
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,380
I didn't expect it

778
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,940
to get so much worse.

779
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,370
I'm afraid

780
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,110
I can't marry into the Sun family.

781
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,380
It's just an ailment.

782
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,480
You'll be fine.

783
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,880
After you get married,

784
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,960
the Sun family will surely

785
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,990
send for the best physician to treat you.

786
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,440
Maybe the next day,

787
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,270
you'll fully recover.

788
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,930
That will be great.

789
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:18,990
However,

790
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,460
if I didn't recover,

791
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,080
the Sun family would think

792
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,420
the Lian family

793
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,350
marry a sickly daughter to them.

794
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,780
That

795
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,350
would not only bring shame to our family

796
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,330
but also ruin Uncle Shouren's reputation.

797
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,710
Man'er is right.

798
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,270
Now that she's seriously ill,

799
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,590
marrying her off

800
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,940
can wait.

801
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,390
Father.

802
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,170
Father.

803
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,770
I think

804
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,010
if Man'er

805
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,380
stays at home,

806
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,990
we can only

807
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,880
find a physician for her.

808
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,040
We'll have to

809
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,900
leave the rest to God.

810
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,060
The Sun family is rich.

811
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,390
If she marries into the Sun family,

812
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,510
she'll surely be taken better care of.

813
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:04,940
Man'er.

814
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,220
Man'er.

815
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,790
Man'er.

816
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,270
The Sun family lives so far from our village.

817
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,020
Man'er is too ill

818
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,910
to travel that far.

819
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,360
All country people

820
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,140
get sick sometimes.

821
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,950
She's not that fragile.

822
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,050
Grandma is right.

823
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,510
I'm not that fragile.

824
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,740
Grandpa,

825
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,990
a deal is a deal.

826
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,750
No matter what happens,

827
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,580
I have to go.

828
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,710
I may die halfway,

829
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,700
but it'll be my fate.

830
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,630
I'm afraid

831
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,210
that after I leave,

832
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,180
I can't

833
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,940
come back to see you again.

834
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,870
Grandpa.

835
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,590
Man'er.

836
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,110
Man'er!

837
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,990
In that case,

838
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,380
let's do as Shouren says.

839
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,400
Okay.

840
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,550
Hurry up.

841
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,500
Let's go. Wait. Wait.

842
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,940
I have something to say.

843
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,700
I'm not done yet.

844
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,130
Wait.

845
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,470
I'm not done yet.

846
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,190
I'm not done yet.

847
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,220
She's not feeling well.

848
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,180
Man'er.

849
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,550
Is Lian Man'er home?

850
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,260
I guess you're Man'er's grandpa.

851
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,830
Nice to meet you.

852
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,150
You are...

853
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,800
Lian Man'er's husband.

854
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:55,740
This child's

855
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,740
father.

856
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:16,850
Is Man'er

857
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,870
really this child's mother?

858
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:20,820
Impossible.

859
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,730
Man'er seldom goes out.

860
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,580
How could she possibly have a child?

861
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,990
Where are you from?

862
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,070
You're

863
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,680
throwing mud at the Lian family!

864
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,860
I'm from the Shen Village, Qingshan County.

865
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,480
Three years ago, I left for Lotus Town

866
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,630
with my father and brother.

867
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,820
When I passed here,

868
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,580
I and Man'er fell in love with each other at first sight.

869
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,780
She often ran out to meet me

870
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,590
and soon

871
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,900
got pregnant.

872
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,850
Shen Nuo.

873
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,520
- Man'er.
-You finally came.

874
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,330
Why do you look so pale?

875
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,910
It's all your fault.

876
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,270
You're late!

877
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,180
What took you so long?

878
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,390
Look.

879
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,770
I brought our child with me.

880
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,110
Look.

881
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,310
Our

882
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,940
child?

883
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,020
[Mission: Earn 1,000 teals of gold which equals to 10,000 teals of silver]

884
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,020
[Income: 0]

885
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,020
[Expenses: 0]
