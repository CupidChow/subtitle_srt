I don't need your charity.

9
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,260
Is it charity for your family

I never said I would forgive you,

It's not easy.

164
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,310
It's rare that our family

166

and have a reunion dinner.

167
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,590
There's happiness in my heart

168
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,450
that I can't describe with words.

169
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,690
In the past,

170
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,110
many things happened to our family.

Why are you talking about this?

176
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,680
No, I mean,

177
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,470
I want to tell the kids

178
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,960
that no matter what happened in the past,

179
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,510
our whole family

180
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,750
is safe and sound

181
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,730

182
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,539

191

I'll toast you.

192

Without you,

194
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,810

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,990
I should propose a toast to you.

198
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,630
Come.

199
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,090
Slowly.

200
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,220
Slow down.

201
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,470
Your brandy

202
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,310
is even more bitter than coptis.

203
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,820
Xiu'er,

204
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,900
how about you come make wine

205
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,290
with my mother after the New Year?

206
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,750
Really?

207
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,390
Yes.

208
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,410
It's a deal.

209
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,580
I'll teach you.

210
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,190
Okay.

211
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,680
I want to say...

212
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,320
Gu,

213
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,300
this is a toast to you.

214
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,190
I shouldn't have...

215
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,070
I shouldn't have

216
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,590
said so many mean things

217
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,430
when you came to us.

218
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,510
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,800
For this matter,

220
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,190
it was our fault.

221
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,430
I feel sorry too.

222
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,220
Then,

223
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,140
let's drink this together.

224
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,230
After we drink it,

225
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,100
we'll let go and forget

226
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,750
what should be forgotten.

227
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,950
Okay. Come.

228
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,590
Uncle.

229
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,190
I...

230
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,990
Give me a chance.

231
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,490
Give me a chance.

232
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,770
Go ahead.

233
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:04,990
What?

234
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,630
You want to say something

235
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,030
at the Lian family's New Year's Eve dinner?

236
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,470
Elders,

237
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,680
since it's New Year's Eve,

238
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,570
I would like all of you

239
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,500
to be witnesses.

240
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,310
I want to

241
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,720
officially

242
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,210
propose marriage to the Lian family.

243
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
Oh my, this is great news.

244
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,470
I waited for so long.

245
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,750
He's finally speaking up.

246
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,990
Thirteen, go ahead.

247
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,880
Thirteen,

248
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,210
although you and Ye'er

249
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,210
love each other,

250
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,910
marriage is a big matter.

251
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,680
You need to follow

252
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,520
all the rules

253
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,110
and traditions.

254
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,470
Yes, yes.

255
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,110
I agree.

256
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,510
Yes.

257
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,590
I came in a hurry this time.

258
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,350
I didn't prepare the betrothal gifts,

259
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,940
but

260
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,230
I have

261
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,230
these things.

262
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,810
This includes

263
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,290
my official badge

264
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,850
[Wude Bureau Supervisor]

265
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,700
and my house and land deed

266
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,980
in Yingjiang.

267
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,240
Other people give money

268
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,860
and gifts for proposals.

269
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,060
I want to give my everything

270
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,990
to Ye'er.

271
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,310
Good.

272
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,830
I will definitely

273
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,400
let Ye'er

274
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,630
have a peaceful life.

275
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,450
I plan to take her

276
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,320
to my hometown after the New Year

277
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,350
and meet my parents.

278
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,880
I'll also let my family know

279
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,120
that I will marry

280
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,120
such a good girl.

281
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,580
The betrothal gifts

282
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,910
are not that important.

283
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,320
The important thing

284
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,560
is to ask Ye'er

285
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,520
for her opinion.

286
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,100
Yes, yes.

287
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,830
Ye'er,

288
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,830
are you

289
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:47,890
willing?

290
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,580
Yes.

291
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,170
She agreed?

292
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,490
She agreed!

293
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,950
She's willing.

294
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,590
She's willing.

295
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,110
Great.

296
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,240
Great.

297
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,590
Thirteen.

298
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,190
Thirteen.

299
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,100
You must treat Ye'er well.

300
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,780
Otherwise, I won't forgive you.

301
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,080
Don't worry, Uncle Shouyi.

302
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,710
What are you doing

303
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,830
to him?

304
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,110
Talk to him nicely.

305
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,760
Why are you still calling him uncle?

306
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
Right, right.

307
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:29,830
Father.

308
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,840
Mother.

309
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,870
Great!

310
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,110
Great!

311
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,640
Great!

312
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,710
Great!

313
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,420
You're making me cry.

314
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,320
The two of us

315
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,270
should toast everyone.

316
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,110
How about that?

317
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,680
Come on.

318
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,510
This is great.

319
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,190
Come, come.

320
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,470
It's snowing.

321
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,350
It's snowing.

322
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,190
It's snowing.

323
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,510
It's so pretty.

324
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,130
It's snowing.

325
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,860
So nice.

326
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes.

327
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,500
So beautiful.

328
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,710
The Lian family opens the year with good fortune.

329
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,350
The auspicious snow will bring a bountiful year.

330
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,630
The auspicious snow will bring a bountiful year!

331
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,350
Come.

332
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,350
To a bountiful year.

333
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,190
Congratulations.

334
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,350

390
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,500
♫Being drunk on it♫

391
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,220
♫I've been comforted before♫

392
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,970
♫By sweet tears♫

393
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,800
♫I've been softly pushed before♫

394
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,030
♫Next to you♫

395
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,690
♫Pursuing and pursuing♫

396
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,540
♫Helplessly♫

397
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,550
♫My expectations are too high♫

398
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,300
♫They've faded away♫

399
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,619
♫Walking and walking♫

400
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,150
♫So hard to bear♫

401
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,329
♫I crossed the crowd♫

402
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,880
♫But you're no longer there♫

403
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,869
Shen Nuo,

404
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm leaving.

405
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,670
♫You and me♫

406
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,210
♫It's hard for us to be separated♫

407
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,869
♫The arrangement of fate♫

408
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,790
Let's go, Father.

409
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,350
Look at what your mother prepared.

410
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,320
Grandma,

411
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,510
Grandpa, Xiu'er,

412
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,390
happy New Year.

413
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,150
Happy New Year.

414
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,310
Happy, happy.

415
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,810
Father, have a seat.

416
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,000
It's another year.

417
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,900
You're being so formal.

418
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,370
Happy New Year.

419
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,900
Hand over the red envelope.

420
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,820
I've already prepared

421
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,240
New Year's money for you.

422
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,650
Here, Man'er.

423
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,780
Thank you, Grandpa.

424
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:00,800
Grandma.

425
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,330
Okay.

426
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,650
Thank you, Grandma.

427
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,750
Mother, where's mine?

428
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,950
I have it. Here you go.

429
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,270
Just one?

430
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,490
I have more.

431
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,590
Thank you, Xiu'er.

432
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,640
I hope Grandpa, Grandma,

433
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,550
and Xiu'er's wishes

434
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,230
will all come true

435
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,110
next year,

436
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,570
next, next year,

437
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,470
and next, next, next year.

438
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,760
Be safe and healthy

439
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,540
and may everything go according to your wishes.

440
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,230
I also wish Man'er

441
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,900
all the best.

442
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,390
This...

443
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
Are you really going to

444
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,600
give us the restaurant?

445
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,740
Uncle Shouyi is already in charge of the restaurant's accounting

446
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,570
and Aunt He, you're familiar with the kitchen

447
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,800
and regular customers.

448
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,230
It's the most suitable to hand you two

449
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,160
the restaurant.

450
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,870
If you give it to us,

451
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,360
what are you going to do?

452
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,900
I have other things to do.

453
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,450
Have you come up with

454
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,910
another way to make money?

455
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,720
You're going to start a new trade?

456
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,070
Our Man'er's brain

457
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,720
has an endless stream of business ideas.

458
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,340
-She's so smart.
-Of course.

459
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,920
Before I leave the restaurant to you,

460
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,100
I have one request.

461
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,330
You...

462
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,230
Say anything.

463
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,470
Didn't I tell you before?

464
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,640
No matter what it is,

465
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,930
I'll do it if you ask me.

466
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,760
Our business is expanding.

467
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,820
We're a little short-handed.

468
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,950
I wonder if we can ask

469
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,210
Hua'er and her husband

470
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,860
to help at the restaurant.

471
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,890
For their salary,

472
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,070
use the same rate that I gave you before.

473
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,430
Of course.

474
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:45,630
Don't worry.

475
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,480
You can count on me.

476
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,440
Thank you, Uncle Shouyi.

477
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,250
Thank you, Aunt He.

478
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,370
You're being too polite again.

479
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,620
This kid...

480
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,080
You take it.

481
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:58,930
Here.

482
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,920
Man'er,

483
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,450
it's too cold. Go back.

484
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,640
We're already here.

485
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,500
Alright.

486
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,970
Let's stop here.

487
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,370
Remember to write back

488
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,830
when you reach Yingjiang.

489
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,180
Take care of yourself.

490
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,470
Don't worry. I will.

491
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,800
You too.

492
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,990
Don't just focus on the restaurant business.

493
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,720
Take good care of yourself too.

494
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,150
I'll hand Ye'er to you now.

495
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,040
I will definitely take good care of her.

496
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,700
I won't let her

497
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,960
suffer any injustice.

498
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,510
Okay, Man'er.

499
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,770
I'll only be away for a few months.

500
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,940
I'll be back soon.

501
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,060
At that time,

502
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,020
I'll make a lot of beautiful rouges

503
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,440
and give them all to you.

504
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,000
Wait for me to come back.

505
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,520
I will definitely wait for you.

506
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,750
Let's go.

507
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,230
Go ahead.

508
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,720
Here.

509
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,080
Be careful.

510
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,430
Come on.

511
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,570
We're leaving.

512
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,360
Take care.

513
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,650
How many times have I told you?

514
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,080
Shake your legs.

515
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,510
Look ahead.

516
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,600
Mr. Laojin,

517
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,510
didn't you agree

518
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,710
to let Youheng study medicine?

519
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,840
Why are you still...

520
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,890
Halt!

521
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,620
Halt for what?

522
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,990
Mr. Laojin.

523
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,990
Man'er is here.

524
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,860
This is...

525
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,910
This is my distant nephew.

526
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,070
I'm teaching him self-defense.

527
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,870
What do you think?

528
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,060
He does have some of your charisma.

529
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,360
He's much smarter than Youheng.

530
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,360
Man'er.

531
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,220
You two talk.

532
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,770
Come.

533
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,740
How come you're here?

534
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,850
I'm here to deliver a letter.

535
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,000
The virtuous Youheng,

536
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,990
I am willing to accept you as my personal disciple.

537
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,560
Ming Fu?

538
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,480
Imperial Physician Hu from the Imperial Hospital?

539
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,040
It's his handwritten letter.

540
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,280
Shen Nuo

541
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,270
recommended you to Imperial Physician Hu.

542
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,530
He has agreed to take you as his disciple.

543
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,360
In the future,

544
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,630
you can study medicine from a famous teacher.

545
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,690
In the near future,

546
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,680
you'll definitely be able to enter the Imperial Hospital.

547
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,910
I've always said that the Wang family

548
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,670
is capable at everything.

549
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,390
Let me see.

550
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,010
Thank you, Man'er.

551
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,930
Thanks to Shen Nuo too.

552
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,230
No problem.

553
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,130
After you go,

554
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,020
take good care of yourself.

555
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,540
May your heart follow its desires

556
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,920
and may you have a bright future.

557
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,290
Man'er,

558
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
I'm still here.

559
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,240
Why do you sound like you're saying goodbye?

560
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,190
I'll have to say this sooner or later.

561
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,390
It sounds like a farewell.

562
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,380
Chubs,

563
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,830
go buy some pork knuckles.

564
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,240
Let's celebrate. I'm happy today.

565
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,670
Man'er,

566
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,530
eat here today.

567
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,200
I can't.

568
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,710
No.

569
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,490
I have something to do at home.

570
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,420
I have to go back.

571
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,770
You two can eat without me.

572
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,370
No, don't.

573
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,130
I'm leaving.

574
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,090
Man'er!

575
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,670
Good for you.

576
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,520
You're much better than me.

577
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,470
Ming Fu

578
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,750
is the best imperial physician.

579
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,320
Father.

580
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,010
You're really something.

581
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,070
You're much better than me.

582
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,030
Good for you.

583
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,350
Let me see.

584
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,330
What are you looking at? You can't read.

585
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,790
Father,

586
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,400
let's have a drink tonight.

587
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,950
Youheng,

588
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,390
goodbye.

589
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:30,820
Stop.

590
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,640
Come,

591
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,950
let's write "two."

592
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,710
Put the brush down.

593
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,150
Horizontal.

594
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,020
Seven

595
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,300
can go to the private school in town after the New Year

596
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,050
to study.

597
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,370
The teacher

598
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,590
is a very cultured scholar.

599
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
If Seven studies under him,

600
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,870
he'll definitely turn out well.

601
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,930
That's awesome.

602
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,610
I can go to private school now!

603
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,880
Don't celebrate yet.

604
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,270
You must practice calligraphy well

605
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,930
before meeting your teacher.

606
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,290
Practice hard.

607
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,950
What's this?

608
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,440
One is for the restaurant

609
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,010
and one is for the new house.

610
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
I bought you a new house.

611
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,940
You can move there later.

612
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
Uncle Shouyi will pay you

613
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,180
the restaurant's profits every month

614
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,380
to ensure a worry-free life for you two.

615
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,500
Man'er,

616
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,590
what are you going to do instead of the restaurant?

617
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,270
I am

618
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,760
going to open a bigger restaurant,

619
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,990
so I'm gifting this small restaurant

620
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,740
to you.

621
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,430
Keep your voice down.

622
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:45,710
Man'er,

623
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,930
we still have the strength to make money.

624
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,050
Don't make things hard for yourself.

625
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,570
How about this?

626
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,960
I'll keep the land deed

627
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,030
for you.

628
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,900
If you need money in the future,

629
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,820
just tell me.

630
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,430
Got it?

631
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,370
Got it.

632
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,550
Here.

633
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,930
Hold tight.

634
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,820
Dab some ink.

635
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,010
Just take it.

636
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,730
One horizontal stroke.

637
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,530
Stop.

638
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,310
What word is this?

639
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,150
One horizontal. Stop.

640
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,870
Two.

641
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,470
What is this word?

642
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,950
Set.

643
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,990
After the New Year,

644
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,950
Seven will go to a private school

645
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,230
and learn a bunch of words,

646
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,870
right?

647
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,120
Happy, right?

648
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,450
Man'er,

649
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,720
let me give you new blankets.

650
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,790
Here.

651
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,700
Try it.

652
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,770
See if it's comfortable or not.

653
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,470
Here.

654
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,720
They are all made of new cotton.

655
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,610
If you find it comfortable,

656
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,870
I'll make two more for you.

657
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,500
How is it?

658
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,640
It's so soft.

659
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,360
Good.

660
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,420
It's good as long as you feel comfortable.

661
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,050
Mother.

662
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,140
Sleep with me tonight.

663
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,370
How old are you?

664
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,700
No matter what age, I'm still your daughter.

665
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,190
Okay,

666
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,910
I'll sleep with you tonight.

667
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,710
Come.

668
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,360
Come.

669
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,180
In the blink of an eye,

670
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,810
my Man'er is all grown up.

671
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,990
It's time to get married too.

672
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,080
Mother,

673
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,560
if I leave,

674
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,780
will you miss me?

675
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,990
Of course, I'll miss you.

676
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,690
I don't want you to leave either.

677
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,470
But

678
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,840
as long as you live peacefully

679
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,970
and happily,

680
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,100
I'll be content.

681
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,310
Mother, sing a song for me.

682
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,030
Okay.

683
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,290

Man'er!

698
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,000
Man'er, something happened.

699
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,830
Hurry and go look in the fields.

700
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,740
What happened?

701
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,400
You'll see when you get there.

702
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,880
Slow down.

703
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,680
Man'er, hurry up.

704
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,430
Be careful.

705
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,800
What's going on?

706
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,250
You'll see when you get there.

707
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,110
Man'er, hurry.

708
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,990
You won't tell me?

709
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,590
Slow down.

710
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,250
There's nothing here.

711
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,170
You lied to me again.

712
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,870
Man'er, look.

Miss Man'er.

Miss Man'er, you're awake.

727
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,730
Miss Man'er?

728
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,470
Miss Man'er?

729
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,190
Do you feel unwell?

730
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,050
No.

731
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,580
Congratulations.

732
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,980
You passed all the missions successfully.

733
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,840
Are you okay?

734
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,390
It feels like

735
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,300
I had a dream.

736
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,380
This is

737
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
is the Lian family's courtyard.

738
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,760
This circle

739
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,510
is where Yellow moves around

740
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,630
and these are the paths

741
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,730
of the others.

742
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,410
You can check them here.

743
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,050
You said

744
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,210
it felt like a dream.

745
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,250
This is the most magical part

746
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,130
of our game.

747
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,870
It gives you a 360-degree

748
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,270
immersive experience of the game world

749
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,080
with no blind spots or dead ends.

750
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,960
So,

751
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,159
everything we went through

752
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,000
was all designed.

753
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:19,659
Yes

754
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,030
and no.

755
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,030
After the mission was triggered,

756
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,960
all your actions

757
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,380
were subjectively controlled by yourself,

758
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,909
but the main mission

759
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,880
and the ending

760
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,100
was all designed.

761
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,860
The ending?

762
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,380
To earn 1,000 taels of gold.

763
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,620
You also completed

764
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,620
a hidden mission,

765
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,830
which was to defeat

766
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,770
the biggest enemy boss, Wu Zhonglian,

767
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,230
and let the villagers return to the village.

768
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,010
Then, the people we met

769
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,790
were actually all non-player characters?

770
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,639
