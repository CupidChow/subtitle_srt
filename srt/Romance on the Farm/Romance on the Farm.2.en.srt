[Episode 2]

4
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,390
Shen Nuo,

5
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,259
-You’re finally here.
-Man'er.

6
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,020
What happened to you?

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,630
It's all your fault.

8
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,900
We agreed on the time.

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,100
What took you so long?

10
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,979
Look.

11
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,550
I brought our child here.

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,759
Here.

13
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,890
Our child?

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,620
Our?

15
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,870
Our child.

16
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,540
Our poor child.

17
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,000
I won't be able to see you grow up anymore.

18
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,100
We're so sorry to you.

19
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,670
Man'er.

20
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,350
This...

21
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,700
Man'er,

22
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,670
I've heard you mention before

23
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,410
that your family members

24
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,670
are all very sensible.

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,610
This was indeed

26
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,470
our mistake.

27
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,160
But I believe

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,460
that as long as we explain things,

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,490
the elders in your family

30
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,940
won't give us a hard time.

31
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,110
Grandpa, I hope you'll give us your blessings.

32
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,450
Scholar Lian,

33
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,740
you said she's unmarried,

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,310
but now, she even has a baby!

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,260
How can I

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,750
explain this to Lord Sun?

37
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,380
No.

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,480
That's not true.

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,510
Don't listen to their nonsense.

40
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,170
Man'er, look at you.

41
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,850
As a girl,

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,370
reputation is the most important thing.

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,710
No matter how unwilling you are to get married,

44
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,410
you shouldn't pull this kind of trick

45
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,290
and ruin your reputation

46
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,660
for no reason.

47
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,110
Man'er,

48
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,000
I think this baby

49
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,470
looks like a newborn.

50
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,740
When my parents and I

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,310
came home to pray to our ancestors,

52
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,100
you didn't show any signs of pregnancy yet.

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,780
How could this child be yours?

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,220
Hua'er, you're so knowledgable in this.

55
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,870
Could it be

56
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,560
that you've had a baby too?

57
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,579
Man'er, you're so shameless!

58
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,720
If you ruin the Lian family's reputation,

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,320
how can my Xiu'er get married?

60
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm going to give you a beating today.

61
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,940
Thanks to your mess,

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
my Xiu'er

63
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,990
won't be able to get married anymore.

64
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,600
Mother.

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,829
I'll kill you today!

66
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,440
Mother!

67
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,550
Stop hitting him.

68
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,579
You worked hard.

69
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,090
Thanks.

70
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,810
Hit me if you want.

71
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,800
Don't hurt Man'er anymore.

72
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,880
I'll be honest with you.

73
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,950
All of them

74
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,570
know about me and Shen Nuo.

75
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,829
They were afraid that I would ruin their reputation.

76
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,350
That's why they're in such a hurry

77
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,079
to marry me into the Sun family.

78
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,810
How many betrothal gifts did the Sun family give?

79
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,070
We'll return them all.

80
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,420
That's not true.

81
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,630
She made it up.

82
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,460
Which girl

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,610
would mess around with her innocence?

84
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,860
I think

85
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,630
you’d better spit out

86
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,420
the 500 taels of silver.

87
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,220
I

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,280
will just view it

89
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,960
as a waste of my time.

90
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,360
Five hundred taels?

91
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,900
That much silver?

92
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,970
Uncle,

93
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,890
you said you didn't sell me for a widow burning.

94
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,570
In the village,

95
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,700
getting 20 taels of silver in betrothal gifts

96
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,700
is already very high for marriages.

97
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,100
Shouren,

98
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,130
Matchmaker Wang said 500 taels.

99
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,160
What does this mean?

100
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,780
Father,

101
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,170
this...

102
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,470
The Sun family

103
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:36,580
did give us 500 taels of silver.

104
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,590
However,

105
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,930
the Sun family

106
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,530
is a famous local elite

107
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,090
of the Qingfeng County.

108
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
It's not a big deal

109
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,860
for them to offer 500 taels.

110
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,580
I...

111
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,240
Man'er is already going above her level

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,630
to marry them.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,560
I have no selfish motives.

114
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,470
It's all for Man'er's sake.

115
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,580
The Sun family of Qingfeng County?

116
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,740
Return the money.

117
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,210
Send Matchmaker Wang away.

118
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,110
Tell the Sun family

119
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,280
that Man'er is not getting married anymore.

120
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,000
Your granddaughter can't get married anyway

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,460
and you think she's some kind of precious phoenix.

122
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,840
Scholar Lian, let me tell you.

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,270
Return the money to me.

124
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,920
Otherwise, none of you will get away with it.

125
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,710
I borrowed

126
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,310
the child

127
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,280
from this woman.

128
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,930
She came all the way here.

129
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,220
I should give her 50 coins in gratitude,

130
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,350
but my family suffered from a flood

131
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,950
and I don't have a penny to me.

132
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,790
I hope you can pay the money.

133
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,080
You little brat.

134
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,610
How dare you lie to us!

135
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,330
If

136
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,180
she stays here for too long,

137
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,160
she might hear something.

138
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,530
Give her the money and send her away.

139
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,020
Brat.

140
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,180
You ruined

141
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,880
Man'er's great marriage.

142
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,270
I haven't even dealt with him yet,

143
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,940
old man.

144
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,020
Look at you.

145
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,560
Instead, you're blackmailing us

146
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,120
and asked us

147
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,690
for 50 coins.

148
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,490
I told you to give her the money.

149
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,710
Move.

150
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,330
Brat.

151
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,720
You idiot.

152
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,380
Grandpa,

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,159
although this child is fake,

154
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,820
my relationship with Man'er

155
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,780
is true.

156
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,800
After the flood,

157
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,590
I'm the only survivor

158
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,490
in my family.

159
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,990
Please

160
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,930
let me stay by Man'er's side.

161
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,720
You want to live with our family?

162
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,530
Grandpa,

163
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,040
just let him stay.

164
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,470
If not,

165
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,770
he will sit outside the door every day.

166
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,760
If the villagers passing by see him...

167
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,390
Shut up!

168
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,850
Let me think about it.

169
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,710
Scram!

170
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,140
Close the door.

171
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,100
Father.

172
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,270
There are no outsiders here.

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,300
Tell me the truth.

174
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,460
What exactly is the situation

175
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,850
with the 500 taels of silver?

176
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,110
This amount is more than

177
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,780
what an ordinary family

178
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,040
can make in a lifetime.

179
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,340
Did you really sell Man'er

180
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,240
for a widow burning?

181
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,880
No, no.

182
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,840
Father.

183
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,020
I'm innocent.

184
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,980
The Sun family

185
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,110
was willing to pay

186
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,900
the 500 taels of silver

187
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,980
after they read Man'er's horoscope.

188
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,710
The Sun family

189
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,700
is extremely wealthy.

190
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,150
They're willing to offer so much in betrothal gifts.

191
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,930
I can't

192
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,480
send it back like this.

193
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,820
That's good.

194
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,820
But

195
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,650
you shouldn’t have

196
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,560
kept the silver matter from us.

197
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,980
Father,

198
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,890
I did this

199
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,480
for the sake of our family.

200
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,490
The Sun family

201
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,860
has a good relationship

202
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,830
with the prefectural governor of Yun.

203
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,520
If we become his in-laws,

204
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,409
we'll have a chance of becoming an official too.

205
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,330
Then we can change—

206
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,190
Enough.

207
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,570
Man'er had an affair with someone.

208
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,340
Don't worry about

209
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,610
her marriage anymore.

210
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,250
Seven.

211
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,590
Seven?

212
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,250
Where is he?

213
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,330
Man'er.

214
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,750
You little brat.

215
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,340
There was such a big commotion earlier.

216
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,620
Why didn't you come check it out?

217
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,750
Mom wouldn't let me.

218
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,270
Just kidding.

219
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,160
This is Shen Nuo.

220
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,960
This is my brother, Seven.

221
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,580
Shen Nuo.

222
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,820
Shen Nuo.

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,260
Why did he faint again?

224
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,980
Where can I find a doctor for you?

225
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,080
Man'er, find Brother Youheng.

226
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,300
Brother Youheng?

227
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,010
I don't think it's Brother Youheng.

228
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,490
He looks more like Uncle Youheng to me.

229
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,360
[Wang Youheng, the eldest son of the Wang family]

230
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,830
Father.

231
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,470
That's more like it.

232
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,600
What's the most important thing

233
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
about collecting interest?

234
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,330
I don't know.

235
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,060
Be ruthless.

236
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,640
How can you collect debts if you're not ruthless?

237
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,760
Come on.

238
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,030
Show me

239
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,920
a ruthless expression.

240
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,410
Come on.

241
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,220
You need the power.

242
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,700
Be fierce.

243
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,440
You won't pay up?

244
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,190
Do you know the consequences

245
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,720
of going back on your words?

246
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Break one of his fingers.

247
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,060
Your turn.

248
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,270
You won't pay up?

249
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,710
Fine.

250
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,530
It's not fine!

251
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,220
No,

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,930
are you allowing it?

253
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,400
You're not forcing them to pay the debt.

254
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,060
You have to be fierce. Come on.

255
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,110
Shake your legs.

256
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,700
Be tough.

257
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,220
Shake your legs like this.

258
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,080
Come on. Shake.

259
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,640
Look at him.

260
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,480
Point at him.

261
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,450
Point with the sugar cane.

262
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,030
Take a bite and spit it on his face.

263
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,580
Watch where you're spitting.

264
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,820
Spit on my face.

265
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,230
Father,

266
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,430
I don't think it's a good idea.

267
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,290
Spit on my face.

268
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,870
Who is it?

269
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,360
Man'er, run!

270
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,570
Stop! Stop!

271
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,960
Don't move.

272
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,060
Man'er,

273
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,110
what are you doing there?

274
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm looking for Youheng.

275
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,560
Then go inside. You...

276
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,640
Why were you peeking through the fence?

277
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,190
Hurry.

278
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,060
Wait, aren't you going to marry

279
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,100
into the Sun family in Qingfeng County today?

280
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,360
Why are you still here?

281
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,850
I broke off the engagement.

282
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,860
I won't get married.

283
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,340
You...

284
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,290
Broke off the engagement?

285
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,980
That's great.

286
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,790
You can't get married.

287
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,130
They wanted to marry our Man'er,

288
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,990
but the Sun family

289
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,460
didn't prepare any of the traditions.

290
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,340
They just sent a matchmaker

291
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,400
to come pick you up.

292
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,970
What kind of marriage is this?

293
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,970
-If my Youheng marries...
-Man'er.

294
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,140
How come you're here?

295
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,790
I'm going to collect a debt now.

296
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,650
She broke off the engagement.

297
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,030
Okay, you two talk.

298
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,020
Break his finger first.

299
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,130
And then we'll talk.

300
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,790
How long has your father been like this?

301
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,770
Young Master Shen,

302
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,110
how did you get poisoned?

303
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
I ran into bandits

304
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,350
and fought desperately for my life.

305
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,480
The bandits hurt me.

306
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,100
I see.

307
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,230
I'll use acupuncture

308
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,230
to force the poison out of you first.

309
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,760
I haven't used needles on real people in a long while.

310
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,430
Shen Nuo,

311
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,700
it's fortunate you brought our child

312
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,350
here.

313
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,030
Shen, please forgive me.

314
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,940
How about you find

315
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,740
an experienced doctor instead?

316
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,220
I made a mistake just now.

317
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,480
It won't happen again.

318
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,230
It's good enough to have Youheng.

319
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,840
Go on.

320
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,220
Be careful.

321
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,470
With that baby,

322
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,240
the matchmaker immediately believed our story.

323
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,580
The matter of the 500 taels of silver

324
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,780
was exposed quickly.

325
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,230
Thank you, Young Master Shen

326
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,300
for solving my crisis

327
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,040
so easily.

328
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,280
The mutual help was a success this time.

329
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,420
My grandpa definitely won't want you

330
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,180
to sit outside the door every day

331
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,460
and get gossiped about.

332
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,660
You can stay here now.

333
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,450
Shen is going to live here?

334
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,860
We agreed to it.

335
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,390
It's mutually beneficial.

336
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,270
Shen,

337
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,940
take a good rest.

338
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,940
Man'er,

339
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,480
let's go out first.

340
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,860
We shouldn't disturb Young Master Shen.

341
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
I’m leaving then.

342
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,390
He's already dead

343
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,710
and they want people to be buried alive with him.

344
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,240
Aunt Zhang.

345
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,110
I heard you fainted just now.

346
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,970
Are you feeling better?

347
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,480
I'm okay.

348
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,530
Man'er told me

349
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,460
about you.

350
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,160
I know

351
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,330
your family suffered from a flood

352
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,470
and you ran into Man'er while fleeing.

353
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,750
Now, you plan on staying with the Lian family

354
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,760
for a few days.

355
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,310
There's no one around now.

356
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,420
What do you want to say?

357
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,220
Say it here.

358
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,340
As far as I know,

359
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,820
the Shen Village in Qingshan County

360
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,420
indeed had a flood this year,

361
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,250
but that area is mostly inhabited by farmers.

362
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,110
Shen Nuo

363
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,070
doesn’t look like a laborer.

364
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,350
The calluses on his palms

365
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,810
are not from holding a hoe.

366
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,780
Instead, they seem to be from holding weapons.

367
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,990
He said he was poisoned by bandits

368
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,880
and that's why he fainted in the mountains.

369
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,680
Bandits usually use sedatives.

370
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,990
The poison remnants in his body

371
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,710
are clearly from the qianji poison

372
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,370
used commonly by constables.

373
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,460
Could it be

374
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,950
that he's the bandit?

375
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,250
Could it be

376
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,310
he's from a rich family

377
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,420
in their village?

378
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,180
Those rich boys just practice martial arts

379
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,980
and play with pet birds all day.

380
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,990
They don't have to work in the fields,

381
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,820
so that's why he doesn't have calluses.

382
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,340
Man'er,

383
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,890
we aren't clear about his background.

384
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,480
What if you keep him in your home

385
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,950
and he brings danger to you?

386
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,750
Man'er's grandpa

387
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,210
has agreed for you to stay.

388
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,220
He also

389
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,450
wants you to marry into our family.

390
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,820
I wonder

391
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,690
if you are willing to do so.

392
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,340
How about from now on,

393
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,650
I'll be your distant nephew

394
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,220
and no longer be someone who had a private affair

395
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
with Lian Man'er?

396
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,620
That farce just now

397
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,910
was just a desperate solution.

398
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,160
What do you think, Aunt Zhang?

399
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,180
I will explain it

400
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,930
to my family and grandparents.

401
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,050
But

402
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,980
if Grandma knows

403
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,460
that you are just my nephew,

404
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,140
I don't know if you'll be accepted anymore.

405
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,119
Man'er.

406
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,980
I know.

407
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,890
The less trouble, the better.

408
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,990
It's just that it's inappropriate

409
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,920
to drive him away

410
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,830
right after he helped me with my crisis.

411
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,600
Besides, Shen Nuo

412
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,510
made my grandma

413
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,620
so angry today.

414
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,860
He made my grandma

415
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,460
spend dozens of coins today.

416
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,680
Don't worry.

417
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,190
Even if I don't do anything,

418
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,590
my grandma will definitely drive him away.

419
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,740
Eat slowly.

420
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,750
You ground wild musk maple into powder

421
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,260
and used oranges as flavoring and hawthorn as the spice.

422
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,350
It's such an honor

423
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,240
to be able to eat

424
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,270
Grandma Lian's desserts today.

425
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,220
I believe even the food in the palace

426
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,190
is not as delicious

427
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,850
as your homemade delicacies.

428
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,250
The roasted pork belly I made for you

429
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,620
will be ready soon.

430
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,710
You can eat it.

431
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,390
Grandma Lian,

432
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,060
although I haven't been here for long,

433
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,440
I've already noticed some things.

434
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,910
The Lian family has many descendants,

435
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,050
but you are the only one

436
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,500
taking care of them all.

437
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,990
It must be hard on you.

438
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,010
Exactly.

439
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,030
They don't know how hard it is as the head of the family.

440
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,460
I have to scrimp and save

441
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,300
on myself

442
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,770
to afford the food and water

443
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,700
and everything else for this family.

444
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,300
They all think that I'm rude,

445
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,460
have a bad temper,

446
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,070
and am unreasonable.

447
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,690
If I were nice,

448
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,370
they wouldn't listen to me.

449
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,300
None of them

450
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,910
is easy to deal with.

451
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,540
You are so thoughtful and have foresight.

452
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,070
You must have suffered a lot

453
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,300
as a young daughter-in-law.

454
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,030
I've been married for 40 years now.

455
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,940
I've suffered more

456
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,090
than all of them.

457
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,450
Really.

458
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,400
You silly girl.

459
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,810
All you do is eat.

460
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,430
Go sweep the yard.

461
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,770
Sweep the yard!

462
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:07,990
Man'er,

463
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,770
hurry and go sweep.

464
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,640
You...

465
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,390
Here, eat this.

466
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Okay, I'll try it.

467
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,660
It's sweet.

468
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,130
Is it good?

469
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,130
He's outrageous.

470
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,140
It's delicious.

471
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,400
His tricks

472
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,790
can only deceive ignorant women

473
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,000
like my grandma.

474
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,170
Grandpa

475
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,480
would never be fooled by him.

476
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,830
Grandpa,

477
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,430
I heard that you came from a poor family,

478
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,160
but you became a boss in the end.

479
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,580
I really admire you.

480
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,620
Not at all.

481
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,210
The social rankings are scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants,

482
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,610
but it's near impossible

483
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,070
to find a farmer

484
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,330
within a thousand-mile radius

485
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,300
who can enter the restaurant business

486
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
and succeed.

487
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,630
It's just a small matter.

488
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,080
Forget it.

489
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,950
At that time,

490
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,190
the whole street

491
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,580
knew who

492
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,870
Master Lian was.

493
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,830
That's amazing.

494
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,740
It's all in the past.

495
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,200
I can't do that anymore.

496
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,890
[Zhang Chengcai, the eldest son of the Zhang family]

497
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,730
[Zhao Liang, the third son of the Zhao family]

498
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,170
What are these?

499
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,700
[Chen Ji, the second son of the Chen family]

500
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,540
What are you looking at?

501
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,550
Hua'er brought them for me.

502
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,970
These young masters from the city

503
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,460
all have great family backgrounds,

504
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,230
but their appearances

505
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
are not even as handsome as Shen Nuo.

506
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,700
You are my only daughter.

507
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,310
I will definitely find you a good husband.

508
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,130
But, Mother,

509
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
Hua'er is going to

510
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,160
marry into the Song family this year.

511
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,700
When can I get married?

512
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,170
You are one year younger than her.

513
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,830
We're not in a hurry.

514
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,310
How about

515
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,830
we go to the temple tomorrow

516
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,750
and ask them to calculate it again?

517
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,120
Fine, I'll do as you say.

518
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,050
Isn't this from Aunt Zhang's dowry?

519
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,990
She usually doesn't bear to take it out.

520
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,250
Why is it in your hands?

521
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,980
She begged me

522
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,880
to take in her nephew, Shen Nuo.

523
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,680
I wouldn't have agreed

524
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,150
if she didn't take out her dowry.

525
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,350
My mother is the best.

526
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,470
My daughter looks good in anything.

527
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,990
Sir,

528
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,350
why don't we send Lian Ye'er over?

529
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,780
Nonsense.

530
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,120
How could the Sun family

531
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,790
think highly

532
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,550
of Lian Ye'er?

533
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,030
Besides, they are not compatible.

534
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,870
If the old man finds out,

535
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,330
he might not agree either.

536
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,300
Then what should we do?

537
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,990
Father!

538
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,360
Father! Mother!

539
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,160
We were all fooled.

540
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,230
What?

541
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,660
That man.

542
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,540
He's not

543
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,110
Lian Man'er's lover at all.

544
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,990
He's Aunt Zhang's distant nephew.

545
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,120
She brought him here

546
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
to block Lian Man'er's engagement.

547
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,860
Really?

548
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,740
Aunt Zhang told Grandma herself.

549
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,710
Return the money?

550
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,490
The Sun family doesn't care about this money.

551
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,060
Doesn't Lian Shouren have a daughter

552
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,120
named Lian Hua'er?

553
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,190
If Lian Man'er can't get married,

554
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,860
just have Lian Hua'er take her place.

555
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,510
Lian Hua'er is Lian Shouren's

556
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,770
biological daughter.

557
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,640
Is he willing

558
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,460
to let his daughter die?

559
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,470
He's just a scholar.

560
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
It's not up to him.

561
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,460
Since he took the money,

562
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,500
he must hand someone over.

563
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,860
If he refuses,

564
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
we can kidnap Lian Hua'er if we must.

565
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,910
Housekeeper Sun, calm down.

566
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,720
The person who broke the contract is here.

567
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,880
Housekeeper Sun, there's something you don't know.

568
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,640
Lian Man'er

569
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,130
didn't have an affair with anyone

570
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,530
nor does she have a child.

571
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,840

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,280
I'll go with your sister.

763
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,910
You are too cautious.

764
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,020
We won't be that unlucky

765
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,150
to run into bandits.

766
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,710
We really are unlucky.

767
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,210
You've stopped the wrong people.

768
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,340
We don't have money.

769
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,630
We're right.

770
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,180
The one we're kidnapping

771
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,650
is you.

772
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,690
You're from the Sun family.

773
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,120
Miss Man'er, you're smart indeed.

774
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,540
No wonder you tricked Matchmaker Wang and the others.

775
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,320
I advise you to surrender

776
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,860
and avoid hurting you

777
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,010
and this young man

778
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,670
with our weapons.

779
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,540
Let's stop using violence

780
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,340
and talk it out instead.

781
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,270
At worst,

782
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,590
we won't fight back.

783
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,520
Man'er.

784
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,150
Don't resist.

785
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,880
Listen to me.

786
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,580
Miss Man'er is quite sensible.

787
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,150
As long as you come with us,

788
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,080
I promise

789
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,270
we won't hurt

790
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,500
this young man at all.

791
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,700
My wrist hurts.

792
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,320
Tie it gently.

793
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,690
Housekeeper Sun.

794
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,020
-My eyes.
-Are you okay?

795
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,780
Go after them!

796
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,780
Stop! Don't run!

797
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,340
Halt.

798
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,100
Halt.

799
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,360
Where are they?

800
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,510
Did you two

801
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,360
see them?

802
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,670
Is itchiness contagious?

803
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,610
Watching them scratch themselves,

804
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,730
I feel itchy too.

805
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,540
The vine patch we just passed by

806
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,800
was full of thorns.

807
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,230
If it touches you,

808
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,860
it will make you incredibly itchy.

809
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,190
In less than 15 minutes,

810
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,350
your body will be covered with rashes.

811
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,790
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

812
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,990
You did it on purpose.

813
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,470
I won't let anything happen to you.

814
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,230
What is this?

815
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:14,970
An antidote.

816
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,370
Okay.

817
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,790
When did you get this?

818
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,260
Everything in the world that repels each other can live in harmony too.

819
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,630
If you want to find an antidote,

820
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,710
you must go to the place where the poison grows.

821
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,890
I picked this offhandedly

822
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,320
when we passed by the vines.

823
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,490
I thought antidotes

824
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,970
grew on the side of cliffs.

825
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,860
Youeng, you're awesome.

826
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,470
I think something is wrong.

827
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,280
How about

828
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,640
we go back?

829
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,840
Let's go.

830
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,640
The Sun family

831
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,580
is working so hard to get a wife

832
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,680
for their dead son.

833
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,140
Why can't they send down a paper effigy?

834
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
It's cheaper too.

835
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,840
Why must you pick a living person?

836
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,440
Judging from the situation,

837
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,620
I don't think

838
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,950
they'll give up easily.

839
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,679
Has Shen Nuo left the Lian family?

840
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,679
Don't mention it.

841
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,320
I don't know

842
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,380
how that guy

843
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,260
managed to win over my grandma.

844
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,290
She smiles at him so happily.

845
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,489
Now, my status at home

846
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,760
is even lower than him.

847
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,530
I might have to leave before him.

848
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,989
He also promised my mother

849
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,070
that from now on,

850
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,820
he's no longer someone who had an affair with me.

851
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,270
He wants to live here

852
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,570
as my mother's nephew.

853
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,429
There must be a reason

854
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,469
why Shen Nuo is insisting on staying here.

855
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,870
It's good to let him stay.

856
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,060
Let's see what he wants.

857
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,890
Don't just stand there.

858
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,890
Keep practicing.

859
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,950
[Thirteen]

860
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,580
The sun is almost setting.

861
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,590
Why isn't Lian Man'er back yet?

862
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,500
Lian Ye'er was the one

863
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,980
who brought the ducks back today.

864
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,900
Who knows where that girl

865
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,300
is slacking off at again.

866
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,650
Maybe she's chatting in someone's house

867
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,780
like Aunt He.

868
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,840
The melon is ready.

869
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,500
Why were you so slow this time?

870
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,860
Go to my mother's room.

871
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,090
Get some mugwort, light it, bring it over.

872
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,610
Go.

873
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,710
Lian Man'er.

874
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,920
Hua'er, you're eating melons?

875
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,280
Why do you look

876
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,560
so surprised to see me?

877
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,210
Are you waiting for the Sun family

878
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,340
to come and tell you,

879
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,210
"Thank you for the clues you provided.

880
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,740
We have caught Lian Man'er.

881
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,750
You don't have to pay back

882
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,150
the 500 taels of silver."

883
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,740
I don't know what you're talking about.

884
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,000
Hua'er is pure and kind.

885
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,590
How could you say that about her?

886
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,590
Give me the melon.

887
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,640
She's pure and kind?

888
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:06,610
Yes.

889
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,300
What a beautiful,

890
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,390
pure white lotus.

891
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,790
I'm glad you know.

892
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,950
Our Hua'er indeed

893
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,900
has the character of a white lotus.

894
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,060
What are you laughing at?

895
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm laughing at you.

896
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,460
You don't even know that I'm making fun of you two.

897
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:20,990
Hua'er,

898
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,320
it's a pity that you can't be an actor.

899
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,270
How dare you say

900
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,570
Hua'er is like a clown?

901
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,290
I...

902
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,550
Man'er,

903
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,200
if there's anything

904
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,070
that I've done wrong,

905
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,320
just tell me.

906
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,600
There's no need to insult me like this.

907
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,850
Give me the melon.

908
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:45,990
You...

909
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:46,910
You...

910
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,590
Lian Man'er, don't eat it.

911
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,750
Mother, look at her.

912
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,740
Give it to me.

913
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,750
Give it to me.

914
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,450
Give it to me. Mom, come here!

915
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,760
-Take it back.
-I...

916
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,700
Lian Man'er!

917
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,230
I go to bed right after eating dinner.

918
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,970
There's no phone or internet.

919
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,000
There's not even an electric fan.

920
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,830
I really, really miss it.

921
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,710
I miss my phone so much.

922
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,180
I really want to watch dramas.

923
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,870
How can I

924
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,590
pass such a long night?

925
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,180
[Happiness]

926
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,490
I won't go!

927
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,850
Let go of me!

928
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,170
Murder is illegal.

929
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,300
Don't you know that?

930
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,350
Stop shouting.

931
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,180
[Sun Li's father, Sun Changsheng]

932
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,870
No one will find us here.

933
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,470
I planned to wait

934
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,800
until you went to accompany my son

935
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,150
and tell the Lian family

936
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,670
that you fell ill after getting married

937
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,230
and passed away.

938
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,030
Now, it seems

939
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,500
that I don't need to anymore.

940
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,510
Lord Sun, you truly worked hard

941
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,850
for your son.

942
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,230
But have you ever considered

943
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,680
that these are just superstitions?

944
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,810
They're all lies.

945
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,660
It won't do your son any good.

946
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,260
It will only add to your sins.

947
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,740
So,

948
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,050
we shouldn't do

949
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,130
these difficult and illegal things.

950
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:22,660
Lord Sun,

951
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,760
you can still change your mind.

952
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,620
Thank you for reminding me.

953
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,660
After you go,

954
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,010
I will become a vegetarian and pray to the Buddha

955
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,900
to bless my son.

956
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,940
That's not what I meant.

957
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,660
I...

958
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,340
No, you misunderstood.

959
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,000
That's not what I meant.

960
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,510
Lord, it's almost time.

961
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,670
Forget it.

962
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,190
Lord Sun,

963
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,560
Before I go down,

964
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,290
I have a wish.

965
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,990
Go ahead.

966
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,220
I want to take some money with me

967
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,070
so that I can

968
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,200
take good care of your son.

969
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,380
Give it to her.

970
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,700
Thank you.

971
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,760
They lit the fire! Hurry!

972
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,590

973
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,590

974
