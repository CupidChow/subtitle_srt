[Romance on the Farm]

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,950
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,440
I'm very imaginative,

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,470
very good at making up stories,

6
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,930
and even better at acting.

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,539
Now that I've earned enough capital,

8
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,270
I can make more garlic peanuts.

9
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,550
I want to sell them all over the town.

10
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,640
Boss Zhang is so generous.

11
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,630
He paid such a huge deposit.

12
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,100
Young Master, you're so concerned about Miss Lian.

13
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,990
It shows that Miss Lian

14
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,250
is no ordinary person.

15
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,730
You're thinking too much.

16
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,720
I've been to a few Carters' Inn,

17
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,260
but I didn't see you hang a single red cloth.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,370
It's your order.

19
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,500
I dare not slack off.

20
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,670
I've already gotten acquainted with Song Changsui.

21
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,510
But the Song family

22
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,660
has been very cautious with their speech

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,820
due to the recent robbery incident.

24
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,540
I haven't heard of

25
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,570
any useful information yet.

26
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,100
I will do my best.

27
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,470
What do you mean?

28
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,079
You have to succeed.

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,640
Don't forget your identity

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,230
just because you've been here for a long time.

31
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,360
What are you waiting for? Hurry and go.

32
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,130
Coming.

33
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,050
Remember I told you

34
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,550
I saw the registration book

35
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,810
at Yuelai Restaurant?

36
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,840
The list of goods distributed by Young Master Song?

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,510
Since we can't find other cash cows

38
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,840
by following the goods,

39
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,870
we might as well take another route

40
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,220
and get into the tiger's den,

41
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,140
the Song Mansion,

42
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,780
and take the registration book.

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,220
Okay.

44
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,990
I'll arrange for it now.

45
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,170
Why did your hometown friend

46
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,410
go back to the troupe?

47
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,990
He still hasn’t earned

48
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,120
200 taels of silver.

49
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,120
He comes and goes freely

50
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,740
yet he keeps his word.

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,860
He must be a reliable person.

52
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,930
You must be very close to him.

53
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,579
I guess.

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,760
He's just a lifelong friend who I can entrust my life to.

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,090
Let's go.

56
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,940
Gu.

57
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,380
Are you burning firewood

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,520
or burning me?

59
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,280
It's too suffocating.

60
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,760
Mother.

61
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,210
Hurry and take a look.

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,220
This house...

63
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,680
Mother.

64
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,850
The firewood is too damp.

65
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,240
It can't be burnt.

66
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,900
Mother

67
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,660
dried the firewood yesterday.

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,050
Gu, did you mean

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,860
that our mother doesn't know how to work?

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,490
That's not what I meant.

71
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,940
Go away.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Get lost.

73
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,160
Cut the vegetables.

74
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,150
Seriously.

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,990
Mother is the best.

76
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,020
You lit the fire right away.

77
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,670
Look.

78
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,760
It seems like Aunt Gu

79
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,140
has been having a hard time lately.

80
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,220
Evil people eventually get their karma.

81
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,560
Man'er! Man'er! Man'er!

82
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,560
Stop there!

83
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,000
You're not home all day.

84
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,850
Didn't you say you went up the mountain

85
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,170
to catch a pheasant

86
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,580
for your mother to nourish her body?

87
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,840
Where is the pheasant?

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,410
Aren't my hands empty?

89
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,470
I didn't catch one.

90
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,810
Really?

91
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,280
Yes.

92
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,100
Don't bother.

93
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,020
How can you think of us like that?

94
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,780
If we have money,

95
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,510
we'd definitely give it to you.

96
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,020
Grandma.

97
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,120
We have yet to gather enough money

98
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,780
for the medical fee,

99
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,220
so...

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,460
No need.

101
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,660
This is a follow-up visit

102
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,460
for Aunt Zhang

103
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
and I also brought her the medicine.

104
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,980
A farmer who works the fields every day

105
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,850
shouldn't be so precious.

106
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,090
Back then, when I had a miscarriage,

107
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,020
I went back to work the next day.

108
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,670
Look at me.

109
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,180
I'm alive and kicking,

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,710
right?

111
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,250
Yes.

112
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,659
All these medicine...

113
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,190
H-H-How much does it cost?

114
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,590
This...

115
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,120
Grandma.

116
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,900
These are all herbs collected from the mountain.

117
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,230
They're worthless. Not expensive at all.

118
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,900
We'll get going, Grandma.

119
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,360
Man'er.

120
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,380
I'm leaving.

121
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,660
[999 Ganfeng Spirit]

122
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,390
We almost got caught.

123
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,990
We didn't split from the family

124
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,690
and Grandma is always keeping a close watch.

125
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,750
It will be taken away sooner or later.

126
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,410
We can't go on like this.

127
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,300
Aunt Zhang is getting better.

128
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,900
I can't keep delivering medicine here either.

129
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,100
No.

130
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,070
You have to deliver the medicine.

131
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,950
Not only that,

132
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,030
you have to make more deliveries

133
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,290
and deliver every day.

134
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,800
I suddenly thought of a way

135
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,270
to help you split from this family.

136
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,550
Go.

137
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,780
Why is there one missing?

138
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,460
Mother.

139
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,510
Mother.

140
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,870
Mother.

141
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,300
What day is it today?

142
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,390
Why do we have chicken to eat?

143
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,080
Dream on.

144
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,320
Then why did Man'er bring out

145
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,020
a pot of chicken soup from the kitchen?

146
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,470
She...

147
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,890
She killed a chicken?

148
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,190
You didn't know?

149
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,890
Get out of my way.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,100
I'll kill you.

151
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,630
Is it good?

152
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,000
You're so evil.

153
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,770
I get up early

154
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,980
to serve my chickens.

155
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,330
This glutton

156
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,080
is always eating upon waking up.

157
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,980
If it weren't for

158
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,900
the older ones egging on the younger ones,

159
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,760
would she dare to kill my chicken?

160
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,230
Man'er.

161
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,830
Is this not the chicken that your grandparents gave you?

162
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,580
No.

163
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,060
Father, what are you doing?

164
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,670
Give this back to your grandma.

165
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,530
This is your grandma's lifeline.

166
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,820
Seven.

167
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,980
This kid.

168
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,460
Are you that capable now?

169
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,870
You want to eat, right?

170
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,500
Fine.

171
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,809
I'll kill all the chickens

172
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,990
and let you eat to your heart's content.

173
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,940
Stuff yourselves to death.

174
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,400
This...

175
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,340
Don't tell me

176
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,500
you can bring the chicken back to life

177
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,430
and give it back?

178
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,230
Father.

179
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:53,770
Is this chicken more important

180
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,720
than Mother?

181
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,940
Mother needs to drink the chicken soup

182
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,000
to recover faster.

183
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,410
Choke you to death.

184
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,890
Yes.

185
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going for the kill.

186
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm going for the kill.

187
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:07,990
You...

188
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,640
Mother.

189
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,780
Don't stop me.

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,390
Mother.

191
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,210
No one try to stop me!

192
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,180
Mother. Mother.

193
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,440
What are you doing?

194
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,190
I'm going for the kill.

195
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,910
Mother.

196
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,210
It's all my fault.

197
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,570
I killed the chicken.

198
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,100
You can scold me if you want.

199
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,500
You can hit me if you want.

200
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,400
How dare I hit you?

201
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,940
At my age,

202
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,220
I can only be bullied

203
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
by the young ones.

204
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,820
Luckily, right now, I can still move,

205
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,880
talk, work, eat, and drink.

206
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,690
If one day, I became paralyzed in bed,

207
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,520
there'd be no one to pour me a glass of water.

208
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,100
Pretend to be asleep.

209
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,580
Okay.

210
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,820
When you get stronger,

211
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,640
d-drag me

212
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,150
up the mountain

213
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,190
and bury me there.

214
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,720
I'm so mad.

215
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,060
Mother. Mother.

216
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,470
Oh no!

217
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,750
My mother passed out.

218
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,200
Youheng.

219
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,210
Tell me honestly.

220
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
How is my mother?

221
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,990
Aunt Zhang's

222
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,230
condition has worsened.

223
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,750
Her organs are damaged

224
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,530
and she's deficient in blood and energy.

225
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,730
If she can't recover,

226
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,860
I guess

227
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,560
she'll be sick for the rest of her life.

228
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,600
In this case,

229
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,580
she needs to take ten-herbs tonic soup for a long time.

230
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,050
Ten-herbs tonic soup?

231
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,700
This ten-herbs tonic soup

232
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,090
is made through boiling ten valuable herbs

233
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,820
including

234
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,080
ginseng, Lingzhi,

235
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,110
Polygonum multiflorum,

236
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,970
and ambergris.

237
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,150
Shen.

238
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,810
The ten-herbs tonic soup isn't...

239
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,740
After taking it,

240
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,310
it has to be taken for five to six years?

241
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,790
What?

242
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,090
She has to take it for the rest of her life?

243
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,140
How much will it cost?

244
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,570
But it's okay.

245
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,420
If we spend the money,

246
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,480
we can earn it back.

247
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,420
As long as there is a way to cure it.

248
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,220
There are so many elders at home.

249
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,790
They will work together

250
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,720
to help Aunt get through this.

251
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,340
I have my grandparents

252
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,220
and my uncles.

253
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,110
As long as the whole family work together,

254
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,430
even if she has to take this medicine for the rest of her life,

255
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,890
we'll be able to afford it.

256
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,520
Hurry and tell your family

257
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,780
to give this house deed to Mr. Jin

258
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,210
in exchange for some silver.

259
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,110
We also have thirty acres of land.

260
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,990
I'll mortgage them all.

261
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,440
Okay.

262
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,750
Shouren. Shouyi. Shouxin.

263
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,200
Mother is sick again.

264
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,760
Come and take a look now.

265
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,710
Get up.

266
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:40,970
Father.

267
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,330
Later,

268
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,510
repeat what I say verbatim.

269
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,060
I promise

270
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,590
Grandma will get well immediately.

271
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,520
What do you mean?

272
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,990
It hurts.

273
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,480
It hurts.

274
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,510
What's wrong with Mother?

275
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,530
She's having a relapse of a chronic illness.

276
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,460
Her heart hurts.

277
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,760
A few days ago,

278
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,620
it's all thanks to Man'er

279
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,360
for bringing Youheng here

280
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,820
that Man'er's mother

281
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,080
could escape death.

282
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,510
Youheng is a skilled doctor.

283
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,760
Why don't we invite him here

284
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,840
to examine Mother?

285
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,590
I still owe Youheng

286
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,980
for the previous medicine bill.

287
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,930
We didn't pay him the consultation fee either.

288
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,740
I'm afraid it's inappropriate to approach him

289
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,940
empty-handed this time.

290
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,270
We owe him for the favor.

291
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,110
We can't owe him any more money.

292
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,910
Pay him back whatever we owe him.

293
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,700
How much did you spend for the consultation last time?

294
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,960
Just the lifesaving ginseng

295
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,910
is 70 taels

296
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Youheng refused the consultation fee

297
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,510
but I can't not pay him for that too.

298
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,590
I was thinking of being brazen

299
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,310
and giving him 10 taels to show our gratitude.

300
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,200
80 taels?

301
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,880
Grandma.

302
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,770
You're quite strong.

303
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,040
You've recovered?

304
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,410
That kid Wang

305
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,700
said he doesn't want to accept the consultation fee

306
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,560
but you insist on giving it to him.

307
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,350
Do you think we're rich?

308
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,120
I've never asked for anything in terms of food and clothing.

309
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,790
But for this money,

310
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,350
no matter what,

311
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,690
we still have to get it and pay him.

312
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,250
How much money do we currently have?

313
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,440
Did your wife

314
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,660
tell you to say this

315
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,830
to us?

316
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,830
Why did you learn to be so bad?

317
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,530
How dare you try to scheme against your family?

318
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,340
If we really have no money,

319
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,930
let's handle it like what did with my brother's matter.

320
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,410
Youheng is Wang Laojin's son.

321
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,090
He is familiar with loans.

322
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,500
Let's borrow another 80 taels from him

323
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,940
and we can pay him back slowly once we get some money.

324
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,470
What are you talking about?

325
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,660
The Song family supports your brother

326
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,750
and he can become an official.

327
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,990
Who's supporting you?

328
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,960
Other than

329
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,590
that half-dead woman,

330
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,720
who else do you have?

331
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,550
I raised you for nothing.

332
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,230
What was the use of raising you?

333
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,990
Get lost!

334
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,000
Grandma.

335
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,210
Still,

336
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,000
we are family after all.

337
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,370
You can't separate us from the family

338
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,030
just because we have a debt.

339
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,190
No way.

340
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,630
Yes.

341
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,620
I won't support you anymore.

342
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,860
Neither can I afford to.

343
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,790
You can pay back

344
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,070
the 80 taels by yourselves.

345
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,990
It has nothing to do with me.

346
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,780
How dare you talk about splitting from the family?

347
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,600
Get out!

348
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,460
Pay back the 80 taels

349
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,340
by yourselves.

350
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,200
Father.

351
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,100
Grandma wants us to split from the family.

352
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,330
How can we repay the debt

353
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,320
we owe Youheng?

354
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,190
I don't want to split from the family.

355
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,100
You have to anyway.

356
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,560
Split from the family now.

357
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,900
How dare you keep talking about splitting from the family?

358
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,650
How dare you hit me?

359
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,350
How dare you keep talking about splitting from the family?

360
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,300
You hit me?

361
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,230
How dare you keep talking about splitting from the family?

362
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,080
Stop fighting!

363
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,060
Grandpa, stop!

364
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,430
I'll divorce you. Try me.

365
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,440
Stop fighting!

366
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,100
Stop fighting!

367
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,690
As the head of the family for so many years...

368
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,330
Mother.

369
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,220
You...

370
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,350
I'll divorce you!

371
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,900
Dad, why are you hitting me?

372
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,690
I'll divorce you. Try me.

373
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,340
Try me.

374
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,400
How dare you hit me?

375
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,340
Shen Nuo.

376
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
How was that move?

377
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,280
That's an amazing move.

378
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,660
Now,

379
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,500
only my grandpa hasn't yielded.

380
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,400
Mr. Lian seems fair,

381
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,340
but he’s actually biased to his first and second sons.

382
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
I don’t think he can hold on for long.

383
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,190
Do you have any other good ideas?

384
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,390
Feel free to order me.

385
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,990
Don't be anxious.

386
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,600
Someone from your Lian family

387
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,460
will naturally have an outburst.

388
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
Just wait and see.

389
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
What's wrong?

390
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,030
Judging from the sound,

391
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,630
it seems like there was a fight.

392
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,460
Mother mentioned splitting from the family

393
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,660
and Father yelled back and refuted her.

394
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,079
There's no way Mother would bear this disrespect.

395
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,970
Mother mentioned splitting from the family?

396
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,700
Nonsense.

397
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,329
When she usually hears about splitting from the family,

398
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,950
she always makes a scene.

399
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,250
How could she have mentioned it herself?

400
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,500
Shouxin's family

401
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,089
owes the kid Wang medical fee

402
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,230
a whopping 80 taels.

403
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,040
And Shouxin's wife now requires a lot of medicine.

404
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,760
I don't know

405
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,329
how much money the family has to spend in the future.

406
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,780
How could she not mention it?

407
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,480
I thought

408
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,900
Zhang's health

409
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,340
would be restored by eating two chickens.

410
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,370
No.

411
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,310
Mother is right.

412
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,210
They have to split from the family.

413
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,070
Think about it.

414
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,870
In the future, taking care of Zhang

415
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,360
will be

416
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
a bottomless pit that consumes money.

417
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,380
By then, our Jizu

418
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,640
wouldn't even be able to afford to study.

419
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,580
That makes sense.

420
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,290
I’m just afraid father won’t agree to it.

421
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,500
Shouren and his wife

422
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,860
are smarter than us.

423
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,150
They might be pondering this matter

424
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,340
in their room too.

425
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,120
As long as we, Shouren's family.

426
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,200
and Mother

427
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,230
make it obvious how we feel,

428
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,510
Father will definitely agree to it.

429
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,180
In my opinion,

430
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,050
from tomorrow onwards,

431
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,780
don't be so eager when you work.

432
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,080
We need to let Father understand

433
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,880
how we feel.

434
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,550
I'll pretend to be sick

435
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,030
and quit working first.

436
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,630
How?

437
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,020
I...

438
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,530
I...

439
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,850
Leave me alone. I know what to do.

440
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,650
What about me?

441
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,670
You...

442
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,190
You...

443
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,640
You'll act like a thug.

444
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,950
I won't work!

445
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,700
Whoever wants to work can do so!

446
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,160
I won't work! Whoever wants to work can do so!

447
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,660
After they split from the family,

448
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,720
I'll write a letter

449
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,500
to tell Jizu about it.

450
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,540
Jizu is studying in the capital.

451
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,460
He'll only be back in two to three years.

452
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,090
After he comes back, do you think

453
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,220
these shoes are enough for him to wear?

454
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,720
My children's mother.

455
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,830
Is Jizu a centipede?

456
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,720
Let's sleep.

457
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,900
The peanuts here

458
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,950
are all ripe.

459
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,440
If they're soaked in the rain,

460
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,770
they'll be ruined.

461
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,510
Before it rains,

462
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,950
we have to collect them and bring them back.

463
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,430
Where's Shouyi?

464
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,060
Shouyi...

465
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,020
What's wrong?

466
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,170
You ate too much and your stomach's filled with gas?

467
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,180
Father.

468
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,940
I'm pregnant.

469
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,870
You're pregnant?

470
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,150
This...

471
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,390
When did this happen?

472
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,280
It's been over a month.

473
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,960
I haven't even had time to tell my parents.

474
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,550
But this pregnancy

475
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,890
doesn't seem stable.

476
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,620
I feel nauseous whenever I lower my head.

477
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm afraid I can't work anymore.

478
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,420
Who spoiled you?

479
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,190
Are you pregnant with a golden egg?

480
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,980
I had been pregnant with three sons

481
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,310
and I could do everything.

482
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,510
I got up before dawn.

483
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,910
Besides, before Zhang

484
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,060
gave birth,

485
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,640
she worked a lot too.

486
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:24,980
You...

487
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,640
Seriously.

488
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,320
Mother.

489
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,430
Zhang fell down

490
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,840
and almost died.

491
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,580
It really scared me.

492
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,800
If

493
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,210
I get into an accident

494
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,890
and lose my child,

495
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,140
even if I could escape death,

496
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,210
it'll cost

497
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,400
our family a lot of money.

498
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,770
Right, Shouyi?

499
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,030
Yes.

500
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,380
You'd better not fall down.

501
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,890
We can give up the child

502
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,470
but we can't afford the money.

503
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,270
That's right.

504
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,460
He.

505
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,220
Don't go to the fields today.

506
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,260
Is the food ready?

507
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,940
Gu is cooking today.

508
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,210
I'll go take a look.

509
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,270
Father.

510
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,120
I ruined the porridge

511
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,000
while cooking it this morning.

512
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,900
These are the leftover steamed buns

513
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,070
from last night.

514
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,650
You can make do with it.

515
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,620
If it won't do,

516
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,850
I'll go cook the porridge again now.

517
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,470
You wretch.

518
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,460
The good rice was

519
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,630
ruined by you.

520
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
It's a simple task

521
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,990
but something went wrong just because I wasn't keeping watch.

522
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,990
Go and help her.

523
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,880
Mother, I...

524
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,100
Shouyi.

525
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,860
Mother.

526
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,030
My wife is pregnant. She has to be careful.

527
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,210
What if...

528
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,360
Let's just eat this.

529
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,710
It's too late.

530
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,950
She's pregnant?

531
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,660
Yes.

532
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,310
Hurry up and eat.

533
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,420
Go to the fields right after eating.

534
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,820
The rain waits for no one.

535
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,450
Call Shouren out too

536
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,420
to go to the fields together today.

537
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:48,990
Father.

538
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,500
Shouren wants to find another private school

539
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,090
to teach at

540
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,490
after he returns to town.

541
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,650
Now,

542
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,100
he has to focus on revising his material.

543
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,770
Shouren sure is funny.

544
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,900
He stopped working

545
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,000
after just one day.

546
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,440
As for Shouxin,

547
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,800
he has to go home early

548
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,760
to take care of his wife every day.

549
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm

550
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,550
the only one who has to work all day.

551
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,390
Why should I?

552
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,700
Father, I can't go today.

553
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,980
I won't do it. I'm tired.

554
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,440
Father.

555
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,710
Don't blame me for being talkative.

556
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,830
Zhang

557
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,580
is lying in bed every day.

558
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,610
Rice, white noodles, chicken, duck and fish.

559
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,980
She gets to eat whatever she wants.

560
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,640
Look at the rest of the family.

561
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,630
We have nothing to eat and drink,

562
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,230
and we're always exhausted.

563
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,700
That's really unfair.

564
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,750
He.

565
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,130
My wife

566
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,960
lies in bed all day

567
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,710
because she had a miscarriage.

568
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,840
She has no choice.

569
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,860
She doesn't want it either.

570
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,660
But aren't I pregnant now too?

571
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,450
I don't care.

572
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,810
Mother.

573
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,910
I want two eggs.

574
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,980
Go look for Zhang.

575
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,860
Go look for her yourself.

576
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,070
Don't think I don't know

577
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,960
what all of you are thinking.

578
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,290
You just want me to put on an act for me.

579
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,490
Aren't you just trying to make them split from the family?

580
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,670
As long as I'm still alive,

581
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,400
no one can split up this family.

582
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,670
All day long,

583
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,220
everyone's just nagging nonstop.

584
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,750
Is there nothing else to do?

585
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,220
Everyone's full and idle.

586
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,570
I don't care.

587
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
I want to eat eggs.

588
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,840
Mr. Lian.

589
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,450
Uncle.

590
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,790
I'm late because I had something to deal with.

591
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,720
Let's hurry up.

592
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,800
Stop working.

593
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,360
Quick.

594
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,290
Take a break.

595
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,520
I owe it to you for today.

596
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,140
Otherwise, my peanuts

597
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,300
would have been soaked in the rain

598
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,060
and it'd have been a huge loss.

599
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,970
Mr. Lian.

600
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,320
You're welcome.

601
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,060
Thank you.

602
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,990
Why don't I see Shouyi and He?

603
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,040
Are they here?

604
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,010
Mr. Lian.

605
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,970
I heard a story a few days ago.

606
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,500
Let me tell you the story to relieve your boredom.

607
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,490
Sure.

608
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,720
During the Spring and Autumn period,

609
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,730
a lady in Wu State

610
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,710
went to collect mulberry leaves at the border of Chu State

611
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,390
to earn some money for her family.

612
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,390
She accidentally

613
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,670
hurt a mulberry lady from Chu State.

614
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,460
This lady from Wu State

615
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,890
thought it was no big deal,

616
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:24,730
but somehow,

617
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,500
the lady from Chu State

618
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,760
suddenly passed away.

619
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,510
So the two families

620
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
started fighting

621
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,570
and notified a general

622
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,410
of Wu State.

623
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,190
This general of Wu State

624
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,380
thought his people

625
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,220
were bullied.

626
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,750
So, in a fit of anger,

627
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,920
he got an army to launch an attack on Chu State.

628
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,900
In the end, it became

629
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,960
the battle between the eight states.

630
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,950
This lady of Wu State

631
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,180
only considered about her family,

632
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,040
but didn't want to cause trouble.

633
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,310
An action seemingly out of good intentions

634
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,190
could also lead to

635
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,390
a series of troubles.

636
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,160
Even the Wu and Chu states were like this,

637
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,210
let alone an ordinary family.

638
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,760
I understand.

639
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,700
Are you blaming me

640
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,700
for bringing up the adoption,

641
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,360
which led to a lot of troubles in the Lian family?

642
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,460
And as a result, your aunt also...

643
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,380
Fine.

644
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,850
Zhang is your aunt.

645
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,850
It's natural that you want to speak up

646
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,070
for your family.

647
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,580
Thank you for your understanding.

648
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,740
I know that Uncle Shouyi and Aunt He

649
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,800
want my aunt to split from the family.

650
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,830
My aunt is not

651
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,220
someone who doesn't know how to be appreciative.

652
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,990
She has always been hoping for her family's happiness.

653
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,520
Mr. Lian.

654
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,640
Why don't you take this chance

655
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,290
to make a decision?

656
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,190
Cover this up.

657
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,190
Oh my goodness.

658
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,500
I'm old.

659
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,750
I'm really old.

660
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,470
You old man.

661
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,460
You deserve it.

662
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,260
All right.

663
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,170
I'll boil some water for you

664
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,650
so you can have a foot bath.

665
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,870
How much money do we currently have?

666
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,080
Do you really want to pay off Shouxin's debt?

667
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,220
When the Song family arranges for

668
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,730
the official position for Shouren,

669
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,660
we'll need some money.

670
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,900
By then, how will we

671
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,700
get money?

672
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,020
In my opinion,

673
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,140
Zhang is really a burden.

674
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,620
She always eggs Shouxin on

675
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,310
and even schemes against us.

676
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,330
It's better for them to get a divorce.

677
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,420
The work in the fields

678
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,890
is almost done.

679
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,110
Tomorrow,

680
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,550
I'm going to town

681
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,980
to see our old workers

682
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,450
at the original shop.

683
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,190
I haven't seen them for a long time.

684
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,910
Then...

685
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,130
Do whatever you think should be done.

686
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,270
Coward.

687
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,630
Just like he used to be.

688
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,500
Back then, whenever his mother made a scene,

689
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,490
h-h-he would go outside

690
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,650
for peace.

691
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,700
I have to clean up all the mess

692
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,470
in the family by myself.

693
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,230
Shouxin.

694
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,780
Shouxin.

695
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,470
Come out.

696
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,840
Come over here.

697
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,390
Mother.

698
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,620
What is it? Why can't you tell me at home?

699
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,080
Why did we have to come out?

700
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,830
Aunt He.

701
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,150
What are you doing here?

702
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,980
I-I just came out for a walk.

703
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,650
Well...

704
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,390
What are you doing here?

705
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,120
I'm taking a walk too.

706
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,150
Go on.

707
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,790
Shouxin.

708
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,590
It seems like Mother is going to say it.

709
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,120
We're finally going to split from the family.

710
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,860
We don't want your wife anymore.

711
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,590
Divorce her.

712
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,470
Did you hear that?

713
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,130
She doesn't want her daughter-in-law anymore.

714
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,490
What does your grandma mean?

715
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,070
Back then, you were just like your brother

716
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,900
and hoped to be a scholar.

717
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,480
If it weren't for saving your wife,

718
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,620
in which you suffered and became crippled

719
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,420
and can no longer be an official,

720
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,500
would you have become

721
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,900
the farmer you are today?

722
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,220
Mother.

723
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,990
Don't mention the past anymore.

724
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,700
Why not?

725
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,760
If you divorce her,

726
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,340
our family won't have to split up.

727
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,430
When Hua'er

728
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,220
marries into the Song family,

729
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,140
your brother will become an official instantly.

730
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,010
Then, he can get you a wife

731
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,720
who's kind and capable.

732
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,620
Isn't that simple?

733
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,620
Mother, that won't do.

734
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,630
You can talk to my father about it.

735
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,290
Stop there.

736
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,320
If your father didn't agree to it,

737
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,720
would I have been able to tell you?

738
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,460
My father agrees to it?

739
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,760
Don't you know your father?

740
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,990
He has just been waiting for me

741
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,980
to say it for him

742
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,540
and turn a blind eye to be a good person.

743
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,270
I always have to be the villain.

744
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,020
Your father thought of this divorce

745
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,610
earlier than me.

746
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,430
It's that old man's idea.

747
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,230
San'er.

748
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,740
Don't be soft-hearted.

749
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,630
Your wife is useless.

750
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,780
She'll just be a burden if you keep her.

751
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,980
You even have to manage her daily meals.

752
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,220
Listen to me.

753
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,400
Tell your father

754
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,770
and your brothers

755
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,750
that you're the one who wants to divorce your wife.

756
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,990
In this way, our family

757
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,630
can live a peaceful and stable life.

758
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,560
Isn't that good?

759
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,660
Okay, it's a deal.

760
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:53,940
Go.

761
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,520
Go on.

762
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,160
Whoever gets such a mother-in-law

763
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,600
will be unlucky for eight lifetimes.

764
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,060
Just now, Grandma's words were so harsh

765
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,590
but he didn't retort at all.

766
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,150
Father is someone

767
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,610
who only

768
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,630
obeys his mother.

769
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,590
Mother, don't wait

770
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,500
to be kicked out by him.

771
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,700
You should leave now.

772
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,770
Your father won't do that.

773
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,730
What do you mean?

774
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,920
That's what I saw.

775
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,980
Grandma kept talking about divorce

776
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,180
but Father didn't retort at all.

777
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,800
He was obviously convinced by it.

778
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,660
Think about it.

779
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,060
Usually, was there a time

780
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,170
when he didn't fulfill the two elders' wishes?

781
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:34,840
Has he ever

782
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,310
really fought against their wishes?

783
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,910
In the end,

784
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,860
doesn't he just do

785
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,330
whatever the two elders say?

786
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,790
My father is not a real man.

787
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Everyone, come to the main hall.

788
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,010
Shouren. Shouyi.

789
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,450
Shouxin has something to tell you.

790
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,530
Later, once Father mentions divorce,

791
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,860
I'll take you and Seven away immediately.

792
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,430
Man'er.

793
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,239
San'er, don't keep it in anymore.

794
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,429
Tell your father

795
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,690
and your brothers now.

796
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,429
San'er.

797
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,350
Just say whatever's on your mind.

798
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,060
I'll help you decide.

799
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,540
Yes.

800
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,300
Father.

801
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,460
Mother.

802
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,240
In recent years, our family has been unable to make ends meet.

803
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,140
Mother, you've been meticulous

804
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,310
and thought of countless ways to manage this family.

805
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,710
Father, you've also

806
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,580
devoted yourself

807
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,670
and worked hard to raise crops

808
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,530
to support the younger generations.

809
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,990
It has been really hard on you two elders.

810
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,500
Shouxin even knows how to flatter others now.

811
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,660
What?

812
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,600
Mother asked Shouxin to divorce his wife.

813
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Divorce his wife.

814
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,520
Divorce his wife?

815
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,950
My wife's

816
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,400
medical cost of 80 taels of silver

817
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,510
will empty our family's fortune.

818
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,970
Shouren and Jizu are going to take the exams

819
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,990
and He

820
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,780
is pregnant.

821
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,520
In the future,

822
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,080
there are too many matters

823
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,210
that require money.

824
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,740
Youheng said

825
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,870
that from now on,

826
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,100
my wife

827
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,900
will have to take an expensive medicinal soup every day.

828
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,910
This will cost

829
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,980
a lot of money.

830
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,990
So...

831
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,670
I...

832
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,020
Say it.

833
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,330
Hurry and say it.

834
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,780
Say it.

835
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,200
Father.

836
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,350
Please let me

837
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,500
split from the family.

838
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,830
You bastard!

839
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,000
Did that woman

840
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,380
ask you to say this?

841
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,080
You wouldn't listen to

842
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,990
your parents' nice words.

843
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,710
You only listen to that cunning woman.

844
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,920
Are you abandoning your parents?

845
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,710
Mother.

846
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,760
Are you choosing that woman?

847
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,720
Grandma, don't force him.

848
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,290
Don't force him.

849
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:27,960
I know

850
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,950
I'm not as successful as Shouren

851
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,110
who became a scholar

852
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,840
and earned glory for the Lian family.

853
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,480
But I still remember

854
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,500
what I learned in private school

855
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,960
about the sages' theories

856
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,110
in private school.

857
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,340
You don't give up on a poor friend,

858
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,750
let alone a poor wife.

859
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,470
In the future, no matter how hard it will be

860
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,270
or how sick she gets,

861
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,810
I will always protect her and respect her.

862
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,560
I'll never abandon her.

863
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:20,870
Father.

864
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,910
Mother.

865
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,790
Forgive me

866
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,640
for being unfilial.

867
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,850
I hope

868
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,760
you two will agree to it.

869
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,550
As for the 80 taels of silver,

870
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,920
you and Zhang will have to deal with it alone.

871
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,900
When your brother becomes an official,

872
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,830
I will ask him to pay it back for you.

873
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,990
As for the rest,

we can't shortchange you.

The day before yesterday, at the fields,

881
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,310
I advised your grandfather to make a decision.

882
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,440
I originally wanted

883
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,910
to let your grandpa agree to you splitting from the family.

884
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,350
I didn't expect Mr. Lian

885
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,640
to think of divorce.

886
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,090
I was complacent

887
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,580
and went too far.

888
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,240
I thought something happened.

889
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,360
You're quite thoughtful.

890
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,140
If it weren't for you,

891
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,330
my grandparents wouldn't have forced my father

It's all thanks to you.

What are you looking at?

897
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,680
To have an ancestral memorial tablet

898
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,150
in the ancestral hall means that

899
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,010
one must have made achievements.

900
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,640
Although I spoke uprightly and straightforwardly

901
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,040
in front of your grandpa,

902
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,320
I don't think

903
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,740
he was completely wrong.

is the only way out for farmers.

907
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,370
It's understandable that he's always

908
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,120
looking out for Uncle Shouren.

909
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,570
It's understandable?

910
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,820
Even if everyone acknowledges this logic,

911
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,480
it's still unreasonable.

912
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,070
In the future world,

913
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,990
people will not be discriminated based on their profession.

914
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,320

We have to always look forward.

how you're going to split from the family?

925
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,170
What else is there to think about?

926
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,680
Royalty and powerful officials

927
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,860
divide their property and family businesses.

928
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,520
Although your family is poor,

00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,580
you still have some family business
