00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,210
Who's that?

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,670
Come out!

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,110
Troupe Master Yu.

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,860
How have you been?

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,710
Why are you here?

7
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,240
Don't worry.

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,550
We're not here to horn in on your business.

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,300
Who the hell are you?

10
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,330
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,900
What matters is that

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,700
there're mechanisms in the wooden box behind you.

13
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,330
This is not the first time you've robbed

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,260
the Song family.

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,230
You don't want

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,530
them to find out this time as well, do you?

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,570
So Yu's troupe members

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,190
are the bandits?

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,289
You've been disguised as a troupe,

20
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,130
and came here

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,110
to spy on all sorts of information.

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,980
You even dare to steal goods from the Song family.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,910
With such courage and strategies,

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,810
I bet

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,360
you're no ordinary bandit, Troupe Master Yu.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,180
Troupe Master Yu.

27
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,390
This place belongs to the Song family.

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,650
If we make a scene here,

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,520
it'll be bad for all of us.

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,020
I don't care about if it's the Song family or the Tang family.

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,680
I planned to

32
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,630
do something big today

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,690
in the first place.

34
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,670
I didn't expect that

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,600
I'd meet you here, Shen.

36
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,840
Since we are destined to meet here,

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,410
how about

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,530
I, Yu Xiangjin, bend the knee and

39
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,250
invite you to join us?

40
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,340
When we get the money,

41
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,960
we'll split everything fifty-fifty.

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,540
Shen,

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,440
what do you think?

44
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,990
Watch out!

45
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,579
So this is what you want.

46
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,390
Bad news.

47
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,690
It seems some thieves broke into the backyard.

48
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,990
I've sent someone there to check.

49
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,310
What? This...

50
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,410
What happened?

51
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,870
What's with the arrangement of this banquet?

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,670
How could you let thieves get in?

53
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,190
Go get them!

54
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,340
You guys, follow me!

55
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,750
Oh no. What should I do?

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,320
Shen Nuo.

we won't be able to leave.

She's deliberately

102
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,080
buying time for us.

Thank you for today, Miss Man'er.

If you hadn't covered for us

118
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,390
and attracted their attention,

119
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,980
we wouldn't have been able to

120
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,040
get away so easily.

121
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,030
You're welcome.

But

123
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,390
what were you looking for

124
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,920
in the Song family exactly?

125
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,370
You even got into a fight.

126
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,640
I was so nervous

127
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,690
when I was on the lookout outside.

128
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,040
I thought you don't know how to be afraid.

129
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,550
Why didn't you leave

130
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,950
when I asked you to today?

131
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,230
I was worried about you.

132
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,020
If it weren't for the banquet at the Song Mansion,

133
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,310
if there weren't so many people at the banquet,

134
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,360
and if Thirteen and I hadn't

135
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,690
passed by and saved you,

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,950
can you

137
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,520
sit here safe and sound now?

138
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,590
I told you again and again about how dangerous it was.

139
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,180
Why didn't you

140
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,950
listen to me?

141
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,920
Why did you insist on staying?

Shen Nuo!

143
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,200
I saved you, and you're blaming me?

144
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,850
What are you doing?

145
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,669

Pride comes before a fall.

147
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,470
Since I was there, I could protect you.

148
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,880
But when I'm not around in the future,

149
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,080
-and if you're still like this...
-When you're not around? Where can you go?

150
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,160
I just wanted to remind you that

151
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,180
before you make any decision in the future,

152
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,980

Nothing.

160
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,700
I just find it strange.

161
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,290
Young Master, I've been wondering

162
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,090
why you'd be willing

163
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,440
to stay in such a shabby room

164
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,740

165
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,290
Are you still that Shen Nuo I used to know?

Young Master.

167
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,070
You like Miss Lian, don't you?

168
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,990
What are you talking about?

169
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,770
Then why

170
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,390
did you get so angry just now?

171
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,120
You wouldn't understand.

172
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,230
I don't, indeed.

173
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,230
Yu Xiangjin made such a big scene

174
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,690
at the Song Mansion today.

175
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I think the troupe

176
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,370
won't stay in the city.

177

We have to find a way to get it back.

179
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,700
I'll go to the Carters' Inn tomorrow

180
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,320
and see if I can find anything.

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,710
Okay, I'll go with you.

182
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,590

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,580
to worship Buddha today.

192
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,670
Therefore, Changsui

193
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,870
scheduled a banquet.

194
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,870
No one would have expected that

195
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,730
those performers

196
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,950
are bad people.

197
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,060
They...

198
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,110
They failed to steal money,

199
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,340
so they stole the registration book.

200
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,630
It's all because of Changsui.

201
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,820
It's because he didn't plan it carefully,

202
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,080
and he's incompetent.

203
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,100
I've tied him up and brought him here

204
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,230
to apologize to you.

205
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,800
[Wu Zhonglian, president of Jinyang Chamber of Commerce]

206
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,240
I'm reading the allusion of

207
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,920
"Having So Much Fun That One Forgets About Shu".

208
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,820
After Liu Shan was captured,

209
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,650
he was imprisoned

210
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,630
in the capital of Wei, Luoyang.

211
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,990
General Sima Zhao of the State of Wei

212
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,240
invited Liu Shan

213
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,740
to watch a dance performance of the State of Shu.

214
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,100
The officials from the State of Shu all cried after watching it.

215
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,620
Only Liu Shan was unaffected

216
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,140
and continued being merry.

217
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,880
Young Master Song.

218
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,170
What do you think about this?

219
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,180
Master Wu.

220
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,060
You're really knowledgeable and erudite.

221
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,830
Thank you for your enlightenment.

222
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,820
To be honest,

223
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,420
since the registration book was stolen,

224
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,740
I've been so worried

225
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,040
that I couldn't eat.

226
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,910
I've lost a lot of weight.

227
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,590
However,

228
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,880
when you told me the story of Liu Shan,

229
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,980
I had an epiphany.

230
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,170
You're absolutely right.

231
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,930
No matter

232
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,520
what circumstances we are under,

233
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,360
we should be optimistic and open-minded.

234
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,060
What a waste

235
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,080
of the name of Kun.

236
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,740
Please elaborate, Master Wu.

237
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,120
You're like Adou who couldn't get anything achieved even with great assistance.

238
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,400
Master Wu.

239
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,580
I know

240
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,450
the registration book that was stolen

241
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,510
will affect your cause significantly.

242
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,710
I deserve to die.

243
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,040
I... I...

244
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,210
It's okay.

245
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,840
You've worked for me for years.

246
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,730
I know how loyal you are.

247
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,870
Go back.

248
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,550
Thank you, Master Wu.

249
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,540
Young Master.

250
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,150
Young Master Song, hold on.

251
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,370
This...

252
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,100
You still don't understand?

253
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,830
Do it.

254
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,720
Eldest Young Master, please don't!

255
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,670
For the sake of

256
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,970
me working for you for more than 20 years!

257
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,240
Eldest Young Master!

258
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,820
Eldest...

259
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,030
Eldest...

260
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,110
Eldest Young...

[Shisanli Camp]

262
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,089
Mother.

263
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,750
Why did you make so many dishes

264
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,940
early in the morning?

265
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,660
It wasn't me.

266
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,089
Father?

267
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,530
Why aren't you eating?

268
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,560
You made these?

269
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,950
You swept the yard as well?

270
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,400
You also fed the pigs and cows?

271
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,160
You guys

272
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,710
are kind enough

273
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,770
to take Nuo and I in.

274
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,380
I thought I should do something

275
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,190
to repay you.

276
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,290
It's so nice of you.

277
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,740
You two are from the same hometown.

278
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,260
However, one is diligent and delightful,

279
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,320
while the other...

280
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,610
Forget it.

281
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,850
Miss Man'er.

282
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,320
In fact, Nuo didn't mean it

283
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,060
like that. He...

284
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:50,970
Put it down!

285
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,010
Auntie, it's cold in the morning.

286
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,680
From now on,

287
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,150
leave the chores like this to me.

288
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,180
No need, I can do it myself.

289
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,810
It's okay.

290
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,860
I'm good at doing laundries.

291
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,430
Trust me.

292
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,980
No need.

293
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,460
I can do it.

294
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,010
No.

295
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,990
Give it to me.

296
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,140
Mother, let's eat.

297
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,600
This...

298
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,310
Look at this kid.

299
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,470
Miss.

300
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,260
Our bodies, to every hair and every bit of skin, are given to us by our parents.

301
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,620
How can you give your life up so easily?

302
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm not...

303
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,010
I know what you want to do.

304
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,540
Miss, you must be optimistic.

305
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,340
There's no difficulty we can't overcome

306
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,490
in this world.

307
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,730
Even if there is,

308
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,520
we may as well

309
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,080
stay near that difficulty for a while.

310
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,610
It's also an option, right?

311
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,740
I wasn't going to...

312
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,540
Of course you were.

313
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,220
Why can't you listen to reason?

314
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,590
You're jumping into the river on such a freezing day.

315
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,870
If you fail to die,

316
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,410
you'll only be half alive.

317
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,470
Even if you manage to die,

318
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,980
you'll be soaked out of shape

319
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,150
in the river.

320
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,720
It's terrifying.

321
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,520
You know that?

322
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,490
I wasn't trying to commit suicide.

323
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,220
My clothes fell into the river.

324
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,020
Don't make unreasonable excuses like that.

325
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,550
I didn't see any clothes...

326
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sorry, Miss.

327
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
I misunderstood.

328
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,060
Wait for me here.

329
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,460
Miss.

330
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,700
Your clothes.

331
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,450
Thank you, Young Master.

332
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,940
Young Master.

333
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,700
Where do you live?

334
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,900
Why have I never

335
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,830
seen you before?

336
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,600
Do you know Shen Nuo?

337
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,390
We are from the same hometown.

338
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,190
We live in Shisanli Camp for now.

339
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,860
So,

340
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,660
what's your name?

341
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,140
My name is Chang Feng.

342
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,650
Everyone calls me Thirteen.

343
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,910
Just call me Thirteen.

344
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,820
Chang Feng.

345
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,500
Buddy.

346
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,540
Excuse me,

347
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,500
but wasn't there a troupe

348
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,930
performing here before?

349
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,840
Where are they?

350
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,130
Don't get me started.

351
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,840
Those performers

352
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,020
are bad people.

353
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,440
They robbed the Song family and ran away.

354
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,990
Really?

355
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,730
What a pity.

356
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,860
I loved

357
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,630
their opera.

358
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,900
Do you know

359
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,830
where they went?

360
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,460
How would I know?

361
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,600
If I knew,

362
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,380
I would have gone to the government's office to collect the reward.

363
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Look around here.

364
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,990
Government officials

365
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,020
came to raid here

366
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,460
again and again.

367
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,460
We're totally messed up.

368
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,070
Who would dare to

369
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,790
stay here at the Carters' Inn after this?

370
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,140
There's nothing we can do.

371
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,090
Let me help you.

372
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,040
Where should I put this?

373
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Just put it there.

374
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,000
This wine jar...

375
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,340
He.

376
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,230
Are there nails on your butt

377
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,870
that get you pinned to the bed or what?

378
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,150
It's already this hour.

379
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,010
Why haven't you started cooking?

380
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,860
Ye'er.

381
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,100
Ye'er.

382
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,720
Why isn't

383
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,780
she back yet?

384
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,990
Mother.

385
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,680
Why did it take you so long to do the laundry?

386
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,910
Your grandma is asking you to make lunch.

387
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,460
Go.

388
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:49,780
Mother.

389
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,820
I want to go back to my room and have a rest.

390
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,120
I feel freezing.

391
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,380
Freezing?

392
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,040
Why is there no water?

393
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,080
No one went to get water?

394
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,220
Ye'er, go get some water.

395
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,280
Hurry, go get your father some water.

396
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,280
What's wrong with you?

397
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,480
I froze from doing the laundry outside.

398
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,080
Come here.

399
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
She caught a cold.

400
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,820
No way.

401
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,460
She can't be that fragile.

402
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,300
If you feel cold,

403
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,430
go to your room and put on some more clothes.

404
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,560
Then start cooking.

405
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,360
Go.

406
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,890
I think she has a little fever.

407
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,320
Should we take her to see a doctor?

408
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,940
Stop it.

409
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,260
The money we have

410
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,280
isn't even enough for Jizu's gifting next month.

411
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,910
Besides,

412
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,140
there are so many chores to do at home.

413
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,790
What if the doctor

414
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,720
says she's sick?

415
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,410
Who will do the chores?

416
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,950
You're right.

417
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,900
She'll get through this.

418
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,450
Yes.

419
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,640
Young Master.

420
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,080
You're back so soon.

421
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,360
Did you find anything?

422
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,230
Here.

423
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,220
When the troupe ran away,

424
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,460
they left many costumes

425
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,470
behind.

426
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,630
They all smell like this.

427
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,920
Besides,

428
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,020
when I fought

429
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,220
Yu Xiangjin last time,

430
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,860
I accidentally got some

431
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,140
fragrance powder from her sachet.

432
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,470
It also smelt like this.

433
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,850
It smells like

434
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,650
it's made of some kind of herb.

435
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,780
If we investigate in this direction,

436
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,040
we may find something.

437
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,170
Ye... Ye'er.

438
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,720
Man'er.

439
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,060
You should probably sit down

440
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,990
and take a break.

441
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,380
I'm almost done.

442
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,990
Put it down, Man'er.

443
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,080
Why is your forehead so hot?

444
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,720
Let's go to the clinic.

445
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,670
No.

446
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,140
I still have a lot of chores to do.

447
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,200
But you have to be alive first, right?

448
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,990
I happen to have something to do at the clinic.

449
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,720
Come with me.

450
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:49,640
Man'er.

451
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,890
Thirteen, let's go.

452
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,260
Let's go see a doctor.

453
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,990
Thank you, Miss Man'er.

454
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,400
I'm okay now.

455
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,820
Don't.

456
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,700
The one Lian Man'er is taking you to see

457
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,430
is a doctor named Wang Youheng.

458
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,220
Wang Youheng collects herbs up the hill a lot.

459
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,570
Maybe he's quite familiar with

460
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,220
the herbs.

461
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,210
Go let him take a look at this.

462
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,610
Miss Man'er, wait for me.

463
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,590
Aren't you coming?

464
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,560
I'm not.

465
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,000
Man'er must still be mad at me.

466
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,580
Go.

467
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,390
Okay.

468
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,450
I'll go.

469
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,570
[Liu's Clinic]

470
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,570
It's a cold.

471
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,780
Let me get the prescription for you.

472
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,410
Youheng.

473
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,570
I don't need medicine.

474
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,680
It's common to have a cold,

475
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,360
but if you don't take it seriously,

476
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,110
the consequences can be serious.

477
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,640
Besides,

478
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,240
you have such a high fever.

479
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,030
It's very likely that

480
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,120
you'll get other diseases out of this.

481
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,320
You have to take it seriously.

482
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,900
I'm okay.

483
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,230
Youheng, please get the prescription for her.

484
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,420
By the way,

485
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,190
the one outside is my friend.

486
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,140
He's name is Thirteen.

487
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,060
He's injured.

488
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,780
Please take a look at him.

489
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,350
Okay.

490
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,650
What's wrong?

491
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,610
I'm injured.

492
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,790
Where?

493
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,360
Here.

494
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,710
Take off your clothes first.

495
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,240
I'll get you some medicine.

496
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,110
Ye'er.

497
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,030
What are you looking at?

498
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,550
Look at you.

499
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,900
You're the one

500
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,280
who does the most chores at home.

501
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,120
You are ordered around all the time

502
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,200
like a servant.

503
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,310
You can't suffer in silence like this anymore.

504
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,970
You have to rise against them.

505
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,310
Man'er.

506
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,050
I know you're saying this for my own good.

507
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,700
But look at me.

508
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,380
I have no ability

509
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,930
to rise against them at all.

510
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,670
Everyone has their own fate.

511
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,030
This must be my fate.

512
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,400
What fate?

513
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,940
If you want,

514
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,430
you can come make money with me.

515
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,720
When you are financially independent,

516
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,320
you'll be able to fight back.

517
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,380
No one will dare to bully you by then.

518
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,480
Financially "indeed"?

519
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,560
Anyway,

520
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,280
I'll always be on your side.

521
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,180
Thank you, Man'er.

522
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,750
Youheng.

523
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,690
Can you tell

524
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,770
what spice this fragrance is made of?

525
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,860
There's more than one kind of spice in it.

526
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,640
It's mainly made of common spices, like

527
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,210
fennel, mugwood,

528
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,340
calamus, and lemongrass.

529
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,620
So,

530
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,750
anyone can make

531
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,590
this fragrance, right?

532
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,990
So it's nothing special?

533
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,940
Not really.

534
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,000
There is a herb in it

535
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
called moonwort.

536
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,190
This kind of herb

537
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,190
is quite rare.

538
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,060
This kind of herb is mainly used

539
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,540
to expel a kind of insect called Qianjia earwig.

540
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,980
This kind of insect only appears in few areas.

541
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,240
It likes to suck blood.

542
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,500
Once bitten,

543
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,700
people will get rashes all over their bodies,

544
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,000
and they itch intensely.

545
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,920
In serious cases,

546
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,520
their lives may even be at risk.

547
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,050
So,

548
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,470
only those who're

549
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
troubled by this kind of insect

550
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,030
use moonwort to repel them.

551
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,900
Moonwort...

552
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,220
Youheng.

553
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,470
Do you know where

554
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,020
this kind of insect often appears?

555
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,350
If you want to find them,

556
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,880
go south down Hua Ridge

557
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
for 50 to 60 miles.

558
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,750
There are fields of moonwort there.

559
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,990
Ask those who collect herbs.

560
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,320
Maybe they can give you some information.

561
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,650
Okay.

562
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,730
Sorry for the trouble.

563
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,660
You're welcome.

564
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,470
You can go now.

565
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,650
Take this cold remedy twice a day

566
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,380
for three days, and you should be fine.

567
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,110
I brought you some extra doses.

568
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,150
This way,

569
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,220
you can take this medicine as soon as possible

570
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,350
if you catch a cold again.

571
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,150
It also has a preventive effect.

572
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:46,850
Man'er.

573
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,560
This wine is said to be from the Western Regions.

574
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,930
It's called grape fine wine or something.

575
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,190
Take it back and try it.

576
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,220
Grape wine?

577
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,710
There's wine sold here?

578
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,380
We don't have it here.

579
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,130
My father brought this back

580
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,220
from somewhere else

581
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,880
when he went to collect debts.

582
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,860
We'll have it

583
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,250
here as well very soon.

584
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,380
50 to 60 miles south down Hua Ridge?

585
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,860
Yes.

586
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,100
Great.

587
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,380
This way, we can locate where they might be.

588
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,880
Let's set out tomorrow

589
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,730
and get the registration book back from Yu Xiangjin.

590
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,060
After that, we can go back to our hometown.

591
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,570
Tomorrow?

592
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,770
What's wrong?

593
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,860
Young Master.

594
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,780
Is it because you're reluctant

595
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,180
to leave Miss Man'er?

596
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,630
I'm afraid

597
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,890
we won't come back here this time.

598
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,510
-Do you want to...
-One day.

599
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,030
Give me one day.

600
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,980
We'll set out the day after tomorrow.

601
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,670
♫Wind blows through the rice field♫

602
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,050
♫The smoke is blown away♫

603
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,430

♫With regrets left♫

614
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980

♫Wrapping my heart♫

616
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,220
Lian Man'er.

617
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,470
Where are you going?

618
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,500
Where I'm going

619
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,960
has nothing to do with you.

620
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,900
I was too anxious yesterday.

621
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,480
I was worried about your safety,

622
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,040
so I got a bit over my head.

623
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,590
A bit? Was that a bit?

624
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,130
You almost ate me alive.

625
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,400
Young Master Shen.

626
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,180
You had so much to say yesterday,

627
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,440
but you became all sweet and light today.

628
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,940
You're really moody.

629
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,130
I'm sorry.

630
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,140
Man'er.

631
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,440
I forgive you. Let's go.

632
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,429
I have something to tell you.

633
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,199
I just wanted to ask you

634
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,380
where you're going.

635
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,139
I'm going up the hill for grapes.

636
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:38,940
Grapes?

637
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,290
What idea did you come up with this time?

638
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,000
Yesterday, Youheng

639
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,480
gave me a jar of grape wine.

640
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,500
I was thinking,

641
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,530
it's something rare

642
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,540
here.

643
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,469
So I think I'd go up the hill

644
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,929
and pick some wild grapes.

645
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,239
When I get home,

646
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,880
I'll wash and dry them.

647
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,980
What do you think about

648
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,690
my idea of making grape wine?

649
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,490
Not very good.

650
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,150
If you want to make wine,

651
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,260
not to mention the complicated processes,

652
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,390
it'll be very hard

653
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
to sell it.

654
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,290
Think about it.

655
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,980
The poor can't afford it,

656
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,740
and you can't reach the rich.

657
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,630
How about distilled grape wine?

658
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,880
Distilled grape wine?

659
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,530
It is to reduce the difficulty of brewing wine

660
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,210
by distillation.

661
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,290
It preserves the fragrance of the fruit

662
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,440
while lowering the price

663
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,240
of the wine.

664
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,540
It sounds like

665
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,870
something worth a shot.

666
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,090
From the emperor and the officials,

667
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,230
scholars and literati,

668
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,300
to ordinary folks,

669
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,830
they all like wine.

670
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,430
Since it's cheap

671
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,820
and rare,

672
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,560
it will be able to sell.

673
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,260
But why do you

674
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,400
know so well

675
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,870
about the dignitaries?

676
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,210
That's what I've been told.

677
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,560
What you've been told. Again?

678
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,990
What other secrets do you have

679
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,990
that I don't know?

680
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,940
I didn't expect that there would be a hot spring cave

681
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,100
in the backwoods.

682
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,210
Cave, cave, cave, cave.

683
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,890
Listen. There's even an echo.

684
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,140
Jinyang County is located at the southeast.

685
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,710
It's surrounded by mountains.

686
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,740
I've heard

687
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,520
there are many

688
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,780
hidden hot springs nearby.

689
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,330
So it's true.

690
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,460
It's warm in the winter,

691
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,270
and there's sunlight in the day.

692
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,870
With hot springs on the side.

693
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,120
And it's always damp in every season.

694
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,080
Perfect timing, geographical and human conditions.

695
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,410
What do you mean by that?

696
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,580
It's perfect timing because

697
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,870
I came up the hill with you today.

698
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,770
The perfect geographical condition

699
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,380
is this hot spring cave.

700
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,500
The human condition

701
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,420
is that this hot spring cave

702
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,680
was discovered by

703
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,180
me, the smart Lian Man'er.

704
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,300
The echo is so loud.

705
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,590
Did you come up with

706
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,510
another idea?

707
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,270
It's a secret.

708
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,150
I'll give you a surprise some day.

709
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,520
Since we're here,

710
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,050
we should enjoy ourselves.

711
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,840
Otherwise,

712
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,910
this gift from God

713
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,830
will be a waste.

714
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,890
-You...
-Hurry up.

715
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,850
You are really different

716
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,850
from other girls.

717
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,010
Lian Man'er.

718
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,090
If I leave

719
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:48,960
some day,

720
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,250
will you make me stay?

721
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,190
If I make you stay, you will?

722
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,990
What I hate the most

723
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,650
is saying goodbye.

724
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,580
If I have to leave some day,

725
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,390
I won't

726
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,810
tell the people around me in advance.

727
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,030
It's useless.

728
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,080
It will only make them sad.

729
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,800
I might as well

730
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,660
say goodbye in my heart secretly.

731
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,130
Do you really think so?

732
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,140
How many times have you said that

733
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,170
you're leaving these days?

734
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,450
Are you really leaving?

735
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,580
Where are you going?

736
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,850
When?

737
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,160
What do you mean by that?

738
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,050
Are you throwing me out?

739
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,510
I just thought

740
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,480
I can't stay here in the Lian family forever.

741
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,340
I have to plan

742
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,140
for my future.

743
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,580
But no one in the Lian family

744
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,210
is trying to drive you away.

745
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,600
You're a perfect match

746
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,770
for our woodshed.

747
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,800
Besides,

748
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,030
now that the garlic peanuts business has hit a dead end,

749
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,940
we need to

750
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,740
find a new business to do as soon as possible.

751
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,060
We can't waste any more time.

752
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,030
Although

753
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,430
you don't work neatly

754
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,830
and you're not as smart as me,

755
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,890
it's still better to have a helper than not.

756
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,150
Just stay here at ease.

757
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,620
Okay.

758
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,960
As I said earlier,

759
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,910
I think the distilled wine business

760
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,980
is really good.

761
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,950
I'll ask my father

762
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,600
to see if he can

763
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,830
make some equipment for distillation.

764
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,690
My father is skillful.

765
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,870
He must be able to make it.

766
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,740
Let's come up the hill and pick more grapes

767
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,820
tomorrow morning.

768
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,310
Okay.

769
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,630
After the wine business starts,

770
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,470
we'll be able to save up a lot of money.

771
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,070
Then we can do real business.

772
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,980
I'll make good use of

773
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,150
this cave as well.

774
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,050
You have to help me.

775
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,080
Okay.

776
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,390
I didn't even say what I need your help with.

777
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,080
All you do is say "okay".

778
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,400
I'll do

779
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,250
whatever you want me to help you with.

780
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,950
Then,

781
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,800
can you give me all the money you make?

782
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,200
Really?

783
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,640
It's a deal.

784
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,390
Pinky swear, never change.

785
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,630
Whoever changes their mind is an idiot.

786
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,910
The location of the East Market is pretty good.

787
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,040
Let's go check it out when we have time.

788
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,030
Maybe

789
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,880
we can do business there in the future.

790
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,860
After I make money,

791
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,460
I'll buy land for my parents.

792
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,170
Shen Nuo.

793
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,420
Shen Nuo.

794
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,900
Shen Nuo.

795
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,700
Let's go pick grapes.

796
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,110
He's not in?

797
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:05,810
[Till we meet again. Don't look for me.]

798
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,920
If I have to leave one day,

799
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,640
I won't

800
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,970
tell the people around me in advance.

801
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,900
It's useless.

802
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,260
It will only make them sad.

803
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:16,950
I might as well

804
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,810
say goodbye in my heart secretly.

805
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,080
♫Pursuing and pursuing♫

806
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,660
♫Helplessly♫

807
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,430
Hold on. Where are you going?

808
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,310
Why are you in such a hurry?

809
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,000
Have you seen Shen Nuo?

810
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,690
♫My expectations are too high♫

811
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,480
Shen Nuo? I didn't see him.

812
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,300
♫They've faded away♫

813
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,390
Have you seen Shen Nuo?

814
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,230
No.

815

♫Walking and walking♫

816
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,330
Uncle.

817
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,700
♫So hard to bear♫

818
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,470
Have you seen Shen Nuo?

819
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,060
No.

820
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,610
♫I crossed the crowd♫

821
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,080
Thank you.

♫But you're no longer there♫

823
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,980
♫You and me♫

824
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,170
♫It's hard for us to be separated♫

825
