00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,240

104
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,010
Yes.

105
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,920
Is she bullying me for not having a big maiden family?

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,820
That's right.

107
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,540

114

We can't publicize our family issues.

115
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,480

Shouxin is an honest man,

121

123

How did he become like this?

124
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,710
He used to be honest and obedient.

125
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,030
If it weren't for you,

126
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,230

131
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,590

145
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,630

I'm the one

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,090
who should speak about my family.

151
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,700
Right?

152
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,320
You have no idea.

153
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,790
Ever since Shouxin wanted to split up,

154
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,450
our two elderly parents

155
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,980
have been crying every day,

156
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,230
begging for Shouxin to not move out.

157
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,740
But what about Shouxin?

158
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,300
He's made up his mind.

159
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,740
Besides,

160
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,500
who cuts ties with the family

161
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,660
when their parents are still alive?

162
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,430
That's right. What a sin.

163
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,270
This won't do.

164
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,900
Then again,

165
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,670
what does Shouxin know

166
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,570
about splitting from the family?

167
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,140
It was all taught by his wife.

168
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,520
That's right. How could a man disobey his parents

169
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,640
without getting taught by his wife?

170
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,420
The two elders are so pitiful.

171
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,640
Pitiful.

172
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,020
Yes,

173
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,410
my poor little sister.

174
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,270
When she was pregnant with Seven,

175
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,650
she still had to work in the fields every day.

176
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,160
On the coldest days,

177
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,430
she still had to do laundry and cook for her mother-in-law.

178
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,620
Now, she was pregnant with Eight and had a fall.

179
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,070
Not only is the baby gone,

180
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,240
but when she was

181
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,080
deathly sick,

182
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,150
her mother-in-law,

183
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,110
wouldn't even buy her some medicine

184
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,909
and left her to fend for herself.

185
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,679
Really?

186
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,799
The elderly Lian are so inhumane.

187
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,100
Even so,

188
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,510
you can't split from the family.

189
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,720
In my opinion,

190
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,530
they've planned this for a long time.

191
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
Their fourth child, Lian Man'er,

192
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
kept talking about this

193
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,290
every day.

194
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,180
She mentioned it

195
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,510
more than once or twice.

196
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,180
This time, they're just

197
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,340
taking advantage of Zhang's miscarriage

198
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,980
to force the elders to agree.

199
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,220
That's the thing.

200
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,510
Every family has its own problems.

201
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,160
We know it's difficult.

202
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,720
As you all know,

203
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,360
our family is not rich.

204
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,990
We need to support the eldest son for the imperial exam

205
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,590
and raise the entire family.

206
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,510
It's not that we won't pay

207
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,280
for our daughter-in-law's medicine.

208
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,130
We're unable to pay.

209
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,200
We know.

210
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,270
We understand.

211
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,180
Everyone,

212
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,210
should we care for one person

213
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,410
or the whole family?

214
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
It's so difficult

215
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,100
for the two elders.

216
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,280
That's right. It's not easy.

217
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,420
It's indeed difficult for them.

218
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,270
So difficult.

219
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,680
If you didn't mention it,

220
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,090
I would've forgotten.

221
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,540
Your older brother

222
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,260
spent so much money,

223
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,620
forcing the entire family

224
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,660
to scrimp and save.

225
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,320
Not only that,

226
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,000
he even plotted about Man'er.

227
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,870
Should I

228
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,970
tell everyone

229
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,160
about the engagement

230
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,860
that the shameless Lian Shouren

231
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
and Gu

232
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,680
set for Man'er?

233
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,750
Tell us.

234
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,100
Look at this!

235
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,590
What are you talking about?

236
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,450
What family

237
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,480
doesn't have conflicts?

238
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,740
Everyone has quarrels.

239
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,420
Everyone has grudges.

240
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,370
If everyone

241
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,170
were like your sister and your niece

242
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,710
and split up whenever they quarrel,

243
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,030
split up whenever they quarrel,

244
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,940
would we still be able to worship our ancestral memorial tablets?

245
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,620
Would we still be able to live?

246
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,570
Yes.

247
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,650
How did I drop this?

248
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,190
Oh, my.

249
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,920
My memory is horrible.

250
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,690
I completely forgot

251
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,370
that I'm cooking soup at home.

252
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,140
Wang,

253
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,750
let's talk another day.

254
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,970
Let's talk another day.

255
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,430
Hey,

256
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,100
I happen to be going to

257
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,320
the in-laws' house.

258
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,210
Let's go together.

259
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,170
Don't.

260
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,100
Take your time strolling.

261
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,510
I'm just worried about my soup.

262
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,390
No need.

263
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,560
Hurry up. Don't burn the soup.

264
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,050
You silly girl.

265
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,680
Why didn't you know

266
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,000
to tell your family

267
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,330
about such a big matter?

268
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,740
If it weren't for Man'er,

269
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,210
who sent me a letter,

270
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,840
I wouldn't have known.

271
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,670
You're breaking my heart.

272
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,990
I just

273
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,510
didn't want you to worry.

274
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,430
You didn't want me to worry?

275
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,710
Look at you.

276
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,980
You're stick-thin now.

277
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,100
My daughter

278
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,260
was mistreated this badly.

279
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,110
If this news gets out,

280
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,300
I'll be so ashamed.

281
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,590
It's all my fault.

282
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,710
I always taught you to be gentle, filial,

283
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,930
and think for the others.

284
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,880
I thought that the Lian family

285
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,270
should be reasonable.

286
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,220
I didn't expect

287
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,070
that you would suffer so much.

288
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,620
Mother.

289
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,020
Mother.

290
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,140
I'm fine.

291
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,320
For the sake of Shouxin,

292
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,310
please don't make a scene.

293
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,580
Granny.

294
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,770
Father was very tough this time.

295
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,580
No matter how my grandparents cried and made a scene,

296
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,180
Father insisted on splitting from the family.

297
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,530
He's just afraid

298
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,380
that Mother would be mistreated again.

299
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,310
Without Father,

300
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,030
it would be hard

301
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,450
to separate this time.

302
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,190
Silly girl.

303
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,750
I'm not here to make trouble.

304
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,660
I'm here to back you up.

305
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:57,700
Shouxin,

306
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,770
later when you split up,

307
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,230
just stand by my side and don't say anything.

308
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,010
Do as I say.

309
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,830
Are you willing to do that?

310
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
I'll do as you say.

311
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,420
Granny, Granny.

312
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,780
I want Power.

313
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,180
Who is Power?

314
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,580
That's our ox.

315
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,150
Granny,

316
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,420
I want Yellow.

317
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,460
And who is Yellow?

318
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,930
That's our dog.

319
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,410
Don't worry. Granny's here.

320
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,660
I'll get them all for you.

321
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,040
And the meat in Grandma's cabinet.

322
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,140
Just half is fine.

323
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,730
Half.

324
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,430
Don't worry.

325
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,560
Lian Fang,

326
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,060
you...

327
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,100
Don't blame me for being frank.

328
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,280
I won't.

329
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,140
Our families

330
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,580
don't live on opposite ends of the world.

331
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,700
You should have told me

332
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,300
about such a major incident.

333
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,350
If Man'er hadn't tell me,

334
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,870
would you have

335
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,460
kept it from me forever?

336
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:06,940
No.

337
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,770
It's my mistake.

338
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,930
It's the autumn harvest

339
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,820
and we had to get these things back.

340
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,600
Lian Fang,

341
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,140
do you remember

342
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,340
how we met?

343
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,270
I was a merchant when I was young.

344
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,470
I sold leather goods and silk.

345
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,300
I even

346
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,470
sold salt before.

347
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,360
Meanwhile, you were

348
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,820
the master of a shop in town.

349
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,360
I remember we met

350
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,680
in your shop.

351
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,020
Let bygones be bygones.

352
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,470
Lian Fang, you are an honest man.

353
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,750
You never deceived

354
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,840
us merchants.

355
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,100
I truly admire you,

356
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,060
so no matter what you lacked,

357
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,710
or what you wanted,

358
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,460
I always tried

359
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,620
to find it for you.

360
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
Yes.

361
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,330
Later, we both started families.

362
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
You got farmlands

363
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,160
and multiple children.

364
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,790
I married my daughter

365
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,590
into your family

366
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,680
because I

367
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,690
truly respected you.

368
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,990
I thought there'd be no problems,

369
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,860
but I never expected that you...

370
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,340
No, no.

371
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,340
I rarely care about

372
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,770
these family matters.

373
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,430
I didn't expect

374
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,820
that my wife would turn the family

375
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,240
into such a mess.

376
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,150
I won't let her

377
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,310
do anything stupid during the family splitting.

378
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:22,690
Great.

379
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,230
I'm relieved

380
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,740
to hear that from you.

381
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,470
Where are you going?

382
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,620
I'm going to visit Thirteen.

383
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,730
Why are you always visiting your friend?

384
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,770
We're splitting from the family today. Go tomorrow.

385
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,370
Why should I be here for that?

386
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,050
I'm not part of your family.

387
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,820
Nephew.

388
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,590
How are you?

389
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,590
How have you been?

390
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:51,940
Me?

391
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,810
You are...

392
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,900
You forgot your Uncle Qingnian?

393
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,950
I'm Uncle Qingnian.

394
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,880
Uncle Qingnian?

395
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,300
It's not just me.

396
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,310
This is Uncle Qingyou.

397
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,980
That's Uncle Qingyu.

398
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,710
Remember it.

399
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,080
I’m Uncle Qingyou.

400
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,660
-I’m Uncle Qingyu.
-Let me tell you,

401
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,430
your aunt

402
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,530
told us everything

403
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,590
about you just now.

404
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,710
Don't worry.

405
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,790
From now on...

406
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,310
No,

407
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,300
you're already a member of the Zhang family.

408
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,100
That's right.

409
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,980
Let's go.

410
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,350
Where are we going?

411
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,870
Help me with the clay.

412
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,140
You need to help build the wall.

413
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,480
I...

414
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,590
Let's go. Hurry up.

415
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,330
Wait.

416
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,500
Let's go.

417
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,400
Here we are.

418
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,640
Let's calculate it.

419
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,590
Shouyi,

420
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,300
listen.

421
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,280
You have to keep your eyes wide open

422
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,790
and calculate extremely carefully

423
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,950
later.

424
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,770
Show me your old skills

425
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,450
for falsifying records.

426
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,440
Mother,

427
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,040
I never made false records before.

428
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,770
You think I don't know

429
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,580
about how you falsified records

430
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,500
and stole silver

431
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,590
after losing money from gambling?

432
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,450
You... Mother.

433
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,460
Listen,

434
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,430
don't worry.

435
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,940
I promise to get all the silver

436
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,830
into your pockets.

437
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,020
Shouyi.

438
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,280
Father.

439
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,530
These are all the family's fields.

440
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,109
We'll have Shouyi do the calculations.

441
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,020
I won't forgive you if you miscalculate.

442
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,089
Don't worry, Father.

443
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,150
I've long heard that the second son of the Lian family

444
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,460
is good at accounting.

445
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,069
Coincidentally,

446
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,270
I was also in charge of accounts before.

447
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,089
Today, I'll help Shouyi

448
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,440
with the calculations.

449
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,640
It's just that

450
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,750
I'm old now

451
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,880
and a bit slow.

452
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,980
I hope Shouyi can be patient.

453
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,790
Shouyi is more than clear

454
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,810
about the family's situation.

455
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,450
You don't have to worry.

456
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:31,930
Right?

457
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,710
Yes.

458
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,030
In-law,

459
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,440
do you think

460
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,360
that I'm too old

461
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,270
and my brain isn't sharp enough?

462
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,670
Are you afraid that I'll make mistakes?

463
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,230
Of course not.

464
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,430
Then, there must be another reason.

465
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,370
Is Shouyi the only one who can do the calculations

466
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,630
and others can't do it?

467
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,630
No, no, no.

468
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,210
It's good to have the in-laws calculate too.

469
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
If anyone makes mistakes,

470
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,120
we can double-check the accounts.

471
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Let's split it up.

472
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,790
Our family

473
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,530
has 33 acres in total.

474
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,390
There are 19 acres of high-grade fields.

475
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,590
for doublecropping.

476
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,660
Every acre produces six stones of harvest.

477
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,110
The land tax is one stone of rice for every six.

478
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,570
There are six acres of middle-grade fields.

479
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,170
Each acre produces four stones.

480
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,380
We're taxed money in the summer and grains in the autumn.

481
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,270
The tax money is four coins and four cents,

482
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,950
or one dou of rice.

483
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,150
There are two acres of low-grade fields.

484
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,620
It produces three stones.

485
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,730
The tax money is three coins and three cents

486
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,870
or four he of rice.

487
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,910
There are also some vegetable fields,

488
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,820
peanut fields,

489
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,060
and some additional taxes.

490
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,470
That's all.

491
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,060
There are only two acres of low-grade fields,

492
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,140
not five.

493
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,470
Your craftsmanship is so poor.

494
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,560
No wonder

495
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,180
you lost the accountant job.

496
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,640
In-law,

497
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,740
you missed an entire season of crops.

498
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,800
That's four taels of silver missing.

499
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,120
Come here.

500
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:24,990
Really,

501
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,270
you're missing four taels.

502
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,870
Am I right?

503
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,280
Shouyi is more skilled.

504
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,870
I am impressed.

505
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,730
Shouyi, please help

506
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,910
check the rest.

507
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,010
Sure thing.

508
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,630
Let me see.

509
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,040
Look here.

510
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,100
You missed 200 coins.

511
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,330
Look here.

512
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,710
One season of taxes was exempted two years ago.

513
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,040
Why didn't you count it?

514
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,610
And here.

515
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,570
Granny, you're awesome.

516
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,700
If Mother were half as good as you...

517
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:55,980
Look.

518
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,470
Then she wouldn't have gotten bullied.

519
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,000
Awesome.

520
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,820
Don't learn from your mother.

521
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,270
Watch what I do.

522
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,300
Look, you made another mistake.

523
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,400
You missed six taels.

524
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Hey, Shen Nuo,

525
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,310
aren't you a farmer

526
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,570
from the Shen Village?

527
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,050
How could you make the wall crooked?

528
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,910
Uncle Qingnian, you have no idea.

529
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,540
I've never done this before.

530
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,710
I want to help,

531
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,440
but I don't have enough skills.

532
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,890
Fine.

533
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,740
Stop working on that.

534
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,200
Carry the soil over

535
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,710
and make some clay for me.

536
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,550
Uncle Qingnian,

537
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,770
I've been sickly since I was young.

538
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,300
I sprained my back just now.

539
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,800
Forget it. Stop working.

540
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,210
Go to the kitchen

541
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,470
and get us some water.

542
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,060
Okay.

543
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,930
Uncle Qingnian,

544
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,670
Uncle Qingyou, and Uncle Qingyu.

545
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,890
Youheng is here.

546
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,630
Uncles,

547
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,870
did you come to help Aunt Zhang split from the family?

548
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,820
That's right.

549
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,120
Youheng,

550
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,690
what brings you here today?

551
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,230
I took a leave from work

552
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,030
to come help too.

553
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,490
Great!

554
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,390
Yes, come.

555
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:31,800
Here.

556
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,490
Help me.

557
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,290
Uncle,

558
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,000
who was working here just now?

559
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,940
Shen Nuo.

560
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,100
He's useless

561
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,230
and sickly.

562
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,330
Qingnian

563
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,280
could only send him to fetch water.

564
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,760
I don't think he'll come back.

565
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,920
Let me do it.

566
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,080
Our Youheng

567
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,260
is much more reliable.

568
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,150
Look at how great his work is.

569
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,720
This is how you should work.

570
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,950
You're back?

571
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,430
Is your brain useless?

572
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,580
I told you to bring more money home,

573
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,780
but instead, you gave it away.

574
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,830
I'm so angry.

575
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,680
Mother, everyone makes mistakes.

576
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:31,980
No—

577
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,670
Don't worry.

578
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,400
I won't give them

579
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,990
a single coin more

580
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,020
for the furniture,

581
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,550
alright?

582
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,820
When I came back from the county,

583
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,290
I brought old elm wood tables,

584
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,090
three of them,

585
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,870
and five pairs of benches,

586
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,240
ten stools,

587
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,380
six three-legged tables and slender tables each.

588
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,850
The low tables and divider screens

589
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,030
are all placed here.

590
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,260
See if

591
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,820
there's anything I missed.

592
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,190
Done.

593
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,850
Done.

594
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,220
Three tables,

595
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,700
five pairs of benches,

596
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,100
and twelve small tables.

597
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,250
The silver balance...

598
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,230
The third family only has 300 coins?

599
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,750
Yeah.

600
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,440
Every month,

601
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,740
you must give Shouren three taels of silver,

602
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,180
right?

603
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,520
And 500 coins to Jizu.

604
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,790
Father decided this.

605
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,700
Your parents also acknowledge it.

606
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,470
We won't count

607
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,070
your mother's medical fees.

608
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,630
It's just that you spent too much

609
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,040
on food recently.

610
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,570
Yes.

611
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,500
After the various deductions,

612
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,580
there are only 300 coins left,

613
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,780
which can be exchanged for two benches.

614
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,790
Uncle Shouyi,

615
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,720
how could you calculate like this?

616
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,990
The accounts are not wrong.

617
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,680
But...

618
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,180
But

619
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,220
we still have Mother's dowry.

620
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,590
No.

621
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,410
Mother said

622
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,930
that her dowry

623
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,410
is worth at least 50 taels.

624
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,160
After giving birth to me,

625
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,420
my granny

626
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,220
even brought a dozen

627
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,420
wild ducks and chickens here.

628
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,150
Mother didn't eat a single one.

629
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,180
These must be worth five taels, right?

630
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,660
No,

631
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,300
how could you calculate like that?

632
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,180
You're digging out

633
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,310
all the old receipts.

634
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,140
I gave birth to him and raised him for so many years.

635
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,860
How are you going to count this?

636
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,420
Count it for me.

637
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,080
In-law,

638
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,840
if that's the case,

639
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,540
we also raised our daughter for more than ten years.

640
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,220
Now, she's completely bedridden.

641
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,680
How should we settle this?

642
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,280
Man'er is right.

643
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,420
Well,

644
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,100
Zhang married

645
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,470
into our family,

646
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,400
so the dowry from her maiden family

647
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,640
should be returned.

648
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,150
It should be returned.

649
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,060
We exchanged the dowry for silver

650
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,590
long ago to cover expenses.

651
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,100
Grandma, you got it wrong.

652
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,760
You kept the dowry

653
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,670
for my mother.

654
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,540
I brought over

655
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,320
Xiu'er's jewelry box.

656
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,290
I personally prepared

657
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,010
my daughter's dowry.

658
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,800
Turns out it's all here.

659
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,660
Thank you, In-law.

660
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,470
You don't have to count

661
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,200
the rest of the dowry in detail.

662
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,230
Exchange it for some furniture.

663
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,770
Man'er,

664
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,250
bring the jewelry to your mother

665
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,340
and ask your uncles to come here

666
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,900
and move the furniture to the west chamber.

667
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,700
Sure thing.

668
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,070
Man'er!

669
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,530
It's great to be young.

670
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,420
It's great to be young.

671
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,140
We only have the livestock left.

672
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,490
All the livestock are here.

673
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,570
Grandpa,

674
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,480
the livestock are not here.

675
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,690
No.

676
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,760
Didn't I tell you

677
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,380
not to let the animals out today?

678
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,630
Why are you yelling?

679
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,740
The ox didn't come back

680
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,700
since last night.

681
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,350
Then it...

682
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,030
What?

683
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,890
We'll split them up

684
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,110
when we find them.

685
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,140
What's the rush?

686
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,520
In-law, look,

687
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,260
this...

688
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,880
Seven

689
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,800
is so talented.

690
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,740
In-law,

691
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,140
since they're all back,

692
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,470
let's start splitting.

693
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,700
Split the chickens, ducks, and geese into four equal parts.

694
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,510
The ox...

695
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,210
Granny.

696
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,440
In-law,

697
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,690
the account earlier...

698
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,990
What's wrong with the account?

699
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,590
Didn't you say there's nothing wrong just now?

700
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,340
Previously,

701
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,890
I did want to tolerate it,

702
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,680
but now, I still feel

703
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,100
that I should bring it up.

704
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,900
Your eldest son, Shouren,

705
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,970
is a scholar,

706
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,800
but more than half of the family's silver

707
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,720
is used by him.

708
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,130
Your actions

709
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,600
are quite unfair.

710
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:41,980
No.

711
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,230
In-law,

712
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,630
my plan

713
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,780
was to help Shouren succeed

714
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,570
and help Shouyi and Shouxin out.

715
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,840
Shouren lives in town

716
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,300
and needs to spend more money

717
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,990
on building connections.

718
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,290
Right?

719
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,710
Since you brought it up,

720
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,780
then...

721
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,980
Then let's kill the ox

722
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,120
and split it.

723
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,870
[Eat me?]

724
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,350
Granny, we can't kill Power.

725
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,320
Sister-in-law,

726
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,250
you have quite a strong tone.

727
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,630
According to the current law,

728
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,190
those who kill oxen or horses

729
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,410
will be imprisoned for a year.

730
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,500
Aren't you afraid of going to jail?

731
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,020
Well,

732
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,030
if this ox

733
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,540
gets sick and dies in our home,

734
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,140
no one will know, right?

735
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,900
No, Power can't be killed.

736
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,950
Why not?

737
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,980
It's been with us for so many years!

738
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,160
So what?

739
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,080
How about this?

740
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,390
Seven will continue herding the ox.

741
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,570
If you need it

742
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,140
for plowing and cultivating the land,

743
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,260
let Seven know.

744
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,710
Okay?

745
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,710
Grandma,

746
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,990
we have compromised with the ox.

747
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,720
Can we take Yellow with us?

748
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,700
[My turn?]

749
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,400
This is my dog.

750
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,310
It's my baby,

751
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,670
my life.

752
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,040
Let it choose by itself.

753
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,720
Yellow.

754
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,060
Yellow.

755
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,510
Yellow, come here.

756
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,690
Yellow.

757
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,420
Youheng.

758
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,580
Don't push yourself too hard.

759
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,600
I often go to the mountains to collect herbs.

760
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,520
I'm very fit.

761
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,500
This is nothing.

762
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,190
We're finally done.

763
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,480
Shen Nuo,

764
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,370
this is just the beginning.

765
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,270
We still have a bunch to move.

766
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:32,990
Hurry up.

767
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,990
There's more?

768
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,720
Hurry and herd

769
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,500
the livestock over.

770
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,630
We still have to split up the kitchen.

771
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,390
I gotta go.

772
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,190
Hurry up.

773
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,440
Thank you for your help.

774
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,370
You're welcome.

775
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,260
It's my duty.

776
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,150
Let's go.

777
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:51,680
Let's go.

778
00:29:59,300 --> 00:29:59,830
Youheng.

779
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:00,820
Hurry!

780
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,380
Move.

781
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,850

♫Shy and silent, like someone who's complaining♫

785
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,520

♫If you want to do it, let's keep drinking alcohol♫

794
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,550
♫I act weak and cute whenever necessary♫

♫I don't know any of the sophisticated arts♫

808

Why not?

817
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,040
Look.

818
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,810
Father.

819
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,340
We're starting the oven!

820
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,500
Come here. Come to Grandpa.

821
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,460
You haven't seen this before, right?

822
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,030
The heavens bless us with prosperity.

823
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,460
Let's start the oven!

824
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,270
Let's go!

825
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,210
Start the oven.

826
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,790
Seven, watch me set off firecrackers.

827
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,989
Watch your behavior.

828
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,570
What if you hit the child? Stay away.

829
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,790
Be careful.

830
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,660
Here comes the sugar cake.

831
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,510
Great!

832
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,480
This is good.

833
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,950
Come on, cheers.

834
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,150
Drink up.

835
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:22,830
Good.

836
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,850
Youheng,

837
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,340
how's the clinic's business recently?

838
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,390
It's not bad.

839
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,110
What about Wang Laojin?

840
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,390
How is Wang Laojin?

841
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,940
My father said he'll definitely prepare food and wine

842
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,020
next time you come.

843
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,500
Okay.

844
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,090
I'll visit him some other day.

845
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,380
Come on, Uncle Qingyu.

846
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,190
Shouxin,

847
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,860
don't forget your promise to me.

848
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,700
You won't let

849
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,610
my daughter suffer anymore in this lifetime.

850
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,940
You better remember it.

851
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,140
I will remember

852
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,540
your teachings.

853
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,430
If you remember, then that's good.

854
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,490
Here, have a drink.

855
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,400
Cheers.

856
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,390
Here, here.

857
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,110
Thank you, Uncle Qingyou.

858
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,460
Eat.

859
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:01,660
Come.

860
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,450
Here, Uncle Qingyou.

861
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:02,810
Okay.

862
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:06,950
Man'er,

863
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,900
we've worked for a few days now.

864
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,230
The kitchen,

865
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,990
woodshed, and pigsty have all been built.

866
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,100
We'll take our leave

867
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,030
after this meal.

868
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,180
I don't want Aunt Wang and Granny to leave.

869
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,140
I feel much more relieved

870
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,550
with all of you here.

871
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,350
We can only stay until today.

872
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,820
Before winter comes,

873
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,790
we must go hunting in the mountains a few more times.

874
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,180
Otherwise, when the snow comes,

875
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,840
the mountains will be sealed.

876
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,990
Man'er.

877
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,060
Although you've split from the family,

878
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,990
you still have the same bloodline.

879
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,500
Families can't separate

880
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,030
so cleanly and completely.

881
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,990
Your parents

882
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,100
are both kind and soft-hearted.

883
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,460
It's hard to change

884
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,860
after all these years.

885
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,100
Granny, don't worry.

886
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,160
As long as I'm here,

887
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,220
I won't let Mother

888
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,620
suffer a single bit more.

889
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,180
Good.

890
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,470
I'm not worried with you here,

891
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,870
but...

892
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,270
If we can

893
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,470
have another reliable person in the family,

894
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,200
Man'er will have an easier life

895
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,820
in the future.

896
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,010
Granny, why are you

897
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,800
suddenly urging me to get married?

898
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
You're an open-minded old lady.

899
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,430
You can't be like

900
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,630
the other old ladies.

901
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,510
Besides,

902
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,070
what's so good about getting married?

903
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,070
Look at my mother.

904
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,660
She was always bullied by my grandma.

905
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,800
What's wrong with me

906
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,910
being carefree right now?

907
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,140
That's why we need to find a good man.

908
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,840
I think Shen Nuo

909
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,790
is a good choice.

910
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,460
His family was flooded.

911
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,990
Now, he's the only one left.

912
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,120
Why don’t we have him marry into the family?

913
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,740
I wonder if he's willing.

914
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,810
I think Youheng

915
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,430
isn't a bad kid either.

916
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,830
He's gentle.

917
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,740
After you get married,

918
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,540
he will surely

919
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,310
listen to Man'er for everything.

920
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,300
Aunt Wang.

921
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,140
Aunt Wang.

922
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,590
It's impossible with them.

923
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,900
I'm going to leave after making money.

924
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,820
Where do you want to go after making money?

925
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,270
I won't go anywhere.

926
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,070
What I mean is

927
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,360
I want to make a lot of money.

928
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,820
A lot, a lot, a lot of money.

929
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,400
This child...

930
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,460
Nuo, even though you've worked a lot

931
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,310
these past few days,

932
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,230
I found that

933
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,850
your eyes

934
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,140
never left Man'er.

935
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,190
What's up?

936
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,510
Do you

937
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,290
have feelings for Man'er?

938
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,990
Uncle Qingnian, don't say that.

939
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,190
You're a man.

940
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,580
What are you being shy for?

941
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,440
If you like her, then you like her.

942
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,420
You

943
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,030
are good-looking

944
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,070
and diligent.

945
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,670
There's potential.

946
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,910
I have faith in you.

947
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,340
I have faith in you.

948
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,100
Uncle Qingnian,

949
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,420
let me toast to you.

950
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,790
Eat.

951
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,280
I'll pour it for you.

952
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,860
Youheng.

953
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,780
You

954
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
are good-looking

955
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,260
and diligent.

956
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,120
There's potential!

957
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,520
I have faith in you.

958
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,420
Qingnian,

959
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,990
you have faith in everyone.

960
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,190
My father is right.

961
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:35,910
Come.

962
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,660
Come on.

963
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,530
Cheers.

964
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,360
Come on.

965
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,100
Cheers.

966
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,930
[Shisanli Camp]

967
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,640
That's why they say

968
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,480
Shouren has it the easiest.

969
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,920
The scholar doesn't need to work,

970
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,320
because the work

971
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,480
is done by the scholar's wife.

972
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,160
Lian Shouyi,

973
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,060
look at the hour.

974
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,990
Do we still have to waste time here?

975
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,070
Go talk to Mother.

976
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,260
I'm not going.

977
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,990
So many things were given away.

978
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,630
Mother must still be angry.

979
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,370
You go if you want to.

980
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,060
I'm angry just thinking about this.

981
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,830
Was I the one

982
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,860
who gave away all the land and furniture?

983
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,830
I don't even have anyone to complain to

984
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,560
about everything we gave away.

985
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,670
Look at her.

986
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,400
She can't compete with Shouxin's family,

987
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,000
so all she does is torment us.

988
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,870
Familiarity breeds contempt.

989
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,470
I'm pregnant.

990
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,030
I'm pregnant!

991
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,030
Even if I don't sleep,

992
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,340
the baby needs sleep.

993
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,270
I must stand up

994
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,590
for myself today.

995
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,330
I refuse to do this work.

996
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,030
Let's see what she can do to me.

997
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,900
What?

998
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,270
Why are you wandering around instead of working?

999
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,010
No one is allowed to sleep until the work is done.

1000
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,670
Move!
