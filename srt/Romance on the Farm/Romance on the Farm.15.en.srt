[Episode 15]

4
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,490
Tell me.

5
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,860
How can we

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
get so much money

7
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,690
in such a short time?

8
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,090
See what other valuable things

9
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,949
we have at home

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,600
and exchange them for money.

11
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,790
I'll continue to work in town.

12
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,490
It's our fault

13
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,460
for being failures

14
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,280
as parents.

15
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,500
If we were capable and rich,

16
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,500
we wouldn't need

17
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,230
our daughter to go out and work.

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,260
She must be worried

19
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,280
and upset too

20
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,630
because of this matter.

21
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,260
Shouxin,

22
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,550
switch to another job tomorrow.

23
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,950
Your leg is handicapped.

24
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,310
Don't do hard labor like being a mover.

25
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,060
What's wrong?

26
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,510
Nothing.

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,710
The salary is high for this job.

28
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,260
It's much easier than farming.

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,270
Any amount of money counts.

30
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,990
We can't

31
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,420
have our daughter support us

32
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,430
all by herself.

33
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,090
If we help her

34
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,690
pay the debt sooner,

35
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,260
I can feel more at ease too.

36
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,840
That's all we can do.

37
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,260
Hang in there.

38
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,180
My original plan

39
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,130
was to make a fortune by selling wine.

40
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,810
I didn't expect

41
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,760
that I caused Father to do hard labor for me.

42
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
I'm such a jinx.

43
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,710
There really are fireworks.

44
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,900
I wish

45
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,200
that when I wake up,

46
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,970
all the frustrations will be gone.

47
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,700
The wine will be back

48
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,360
and I'll have paid off my debt.

49
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,550
That's too much.

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
I'll just wish first.

51
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,170
I wish Father, Mother, and Seven

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
could all be healthy.

53
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,690
I wish...

54
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,270
I could meet him.

55
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,810
One more time.

56
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,330
How come you're back?

57
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,550
I came to see you.

58
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,940
What is that?

59
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,170
Your wine.

60
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,510
I brought it back to you.

61
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,150
My wishes came true?

62
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,050
How did you find it?

63
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,270
Could it be...

64
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,270
I stole it back.

65
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,740
To be precise,

66
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,950
originally,

67
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,670
I gave advice to the bandits

68
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,090
so that they could pretend to be government soldiers

69
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,050
to rob the Song family's valuable goods.

70
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,110
I didn't expect that what they robbed

71
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,580
was your wine.

72
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,860
Why did you come up with ideas for the bandits?

73
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,600
Why do you want to rob the Song family's goods?

74
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,790
I still can't get answers

75
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,730
no matter how I ask.

76
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,330
How many secrets do you have?

77
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,650
Which of your words are true

78
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,710
and which are lies?

79
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,220
I think Youheng was right.

80
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,860
You didn't give ideas

81
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,730
to the bandits.

82
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,620
You're a bandit yourself!

83
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,430
I'll tell you what's true.

84
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,270
I’m not Shen Nuo.

85
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,120
My real name is Shen Yi.

86
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,870
I'm not from the Shen Village

87
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,400
of Qingshan County either.

88
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,660
I'm the Wude Deputy Commissioner,

89
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,000
the younger brother of Empress Shen.

90
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,520
Then why is an official like you

91
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,450
here in Shisanli Camp?

92
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,590
The treasury is empty now,

93
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,860
while Qingzhou Prefecture

94
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,720
where Jinyang County is located,

95
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,740
which is

96
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,950
where Shisanli Camp

97
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,940
is also part of,

98
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,920
not only is unable to pay taxes every year

99
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,450
but also reported a drought

100
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,160
and asked for the relief money from the court.

101
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,290
Qingzhou Prefecture

102
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,720
is the fief

103
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,940
of Marquis Ningyuan.

104
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,410
His Majesty knows

105
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,270
that Marquis Ningyuan is greedy.

106
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,600
He's worried there's something amiss

107
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,000
in Qingzhou Prefecture,

108
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,350
so he sent me

109
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,260
to investigate here anonymously

110
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
and restrain Marquis Ningyuan.

111
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,590
As expected,

112
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,670
I didn't find any disasters

113
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,630
after arriving here.

114
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,020
Instead, the government and merchants collude

115
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,280
and oppress the people

116
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,930
to feather their own nest.

117
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,440
The situation is grave.

118
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,220
So,

119
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,150
when we first met,

120
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,800
you were—

121
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,020
When I passed by Jinyang County,

122
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,950
I found by chance

123
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,910
that the owner of Yuelai Restaurant

124
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,700
was smuggling official salt.

125
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,260
I wanted to keep investigating,

126
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,620
but I was discovered.

127
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,060
When we first met,

128
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,970
the government

129
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,380
was after me.

130
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,870
I see.

131
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,860
You...

132
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,690
You only helped me with the widow burning

133
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,680
to stay in the Lian family

134
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,040
and hide in Shisanli Camp.

135
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,750
When we

136
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,110
set up shop together

137
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,730
outside Yuelai Restaurant,

138
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,320
you didn't do it for money either.

139
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,840
Instead, it was to investigate the owner of the restaurant.

140
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,570
Everything you did

141
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,410
was just using me.

142
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,220
Since

143
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,770
you left without a care,

144
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,120
but now, you brought my wine back.

145
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,950
It's not only to see me, right?

146
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,520
When I was investigating,

147
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,730
I learned that the government and merchants colluded

148
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,060
to smuggle private salt

149
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,330
and it's related a merchant guild

150
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,790
called the Jinyang Guild.

151
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,600
I still need

152
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,880
the identity of a local

153
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,230
so I can approach

154
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,250
the Jinyang Guild

155
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,680
without alarming them.

156
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,840
Man'er,

157
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,350
-I really need your help.
-I'll help.

158
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,500
What?

159
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,110
You're back now

160
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,930
only to stay at my house

161
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,260
and pretend to do business with me.

162
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,540
I'll help you.

163
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Do you have anything else to say?

164
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,110
Lian Man'er,

165
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,730
I like you.

Duke,

182
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,970
I already agreed.

183
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,010

Okay.

188
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,880
That's about it.

189
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,610
We

190
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,060
got the news back then

191
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,240
that our old friend

192
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,350
who'd gone missing after a flood

193
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,700
suddenly appeared in Lin County.

194
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,430
Nuo and I

195
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,600
went to look for him.

196
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,640
We didn't have time to tell you.

197
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,850
Sorry to make you worry.

198
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,940
It's okay.

199
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,660
I'm glad you two are back.

200
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,590
Man'er told me just now

201
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,970
that you two need to stay here

202
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,070
for a while longer.

203
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,140
It's okay.

204
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,750
Just stay here.

205
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,700
Okay.

206
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm going back now.

207
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,590
Rest early.

208
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,310
Okay.

209
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,160
Did you confess to Miss Man'er

210
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,500
about your identity?

211
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,180
And then?

212
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,790
She's upset.

213
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,220
Yes.

214
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,130
After all,

215
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,040
you hid it from her for so long,

216
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,920
and you left without saying goodbye.

217
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,850
Now, you're back

218
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,290
just to ask for help.

219
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,230
Anybody

220
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,660
would feel a little...

221
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,880
Can you stop talking?

222
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,370
Since Song Haikun lost his registration book,

223
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,500
I'm sure he won't be able to

224
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,980
remain as the dispatcher.

225
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,370
To obtain the evidence of the registration book again,

226
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,100
we must enter the Jinyang Guild

227
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
and find the new dispatcher.

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,140
Get some rest.

229
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,970
♫Wind blows through the rice field♫

230
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,240
♫The smoke is blown away♫

231
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,640
♫A bird stands on a branch alone♫

232
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,810
♫Gazing at♫

233
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,100
♫The skyline♫

234
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,890
♫Reverse♫

235
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,430
♫Back to the start♫

236
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,690
♫On second thought♫

237
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,750
♫We meet on the clouds♫

238
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,240
♫Burn incense to redeem my wish♫

239
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,800
♫A wisp of smoke♫

240

♫Wrapping my heart♫

242
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,170
What else did they say?

243
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,859
They said to meet

244
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,580
at Jinyang Bridge outside the town tomorrow.

245
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,750
[If you want to get the  registration book back, see you at Jinyang Bridge outside the town tomorrow noon. Prepare 3,000 taels of silver for the exchange]

246
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,570
They want me to bring 3,000 taels.

247
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,300
I'll give them the money and they give me the item.

248
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,810
They dare to come here?

249
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,980
They probably understood

250
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,700
the content of the registration book.

251
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,540
Otherwise,

252
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,170
they wouldn't dare to negotiate with the Song family.

253
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,710
Do as they said

254
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,950
and prepare the money.

255
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,630
Go.

256
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:53,980
Yes.

257
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,570
Get the registration book back.

258
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,740
Yes.

259
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,300
Master Wu,

260
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,930
what about those people who stole the registration book?

261
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,260
Don't keep them around.

262
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,680
Yes.

263
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,080
Why does it rain without warning?

264
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,450
We're here.

265
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,390
This is it, guys.

266
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,620
Come, have a seat.

267
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,180
I can rest in peace

268
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,860
after eating Yufeng Restaurant's braised pork knuckles.

269
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,650
Four, what are you talking about?

270
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,220
We have something important to do later.

271
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,420
Don't jinx yourself.

272
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,630
Three, Four,

273
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,230
why did you guys come down the mountain?

274
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,960
Thirteen, what a coincidence.

275
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,360
We're getting ready to—

276
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,670
We haven't eaten

277
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,240
Yuefeng Restaurant's braised pork knuckles in a long time.

278
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,040
We're here to sate our cravings.

279
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,990
But honestly,

280
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,360
you and Shen are so disloyal.

281
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,890
You didn't say anything

282
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,820
before leaving.

283
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,860
We could've held

284
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,140
a farewell dinner for you two.

285
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,140
We left in a hurry,

286
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
but we'll definitely visit

287
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,540
when we get the chance.

288
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,310
So, why are you here today?

289
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,930
I

290
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,100
heard from Four that the pork knuckles here are delicious,

291
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,130
so I wanted to buy some

292
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,860
for Shen Nuo

293
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,170
to cheer him up.

294
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,950
What's wrong?

295
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,490
Could it be that Shen

296
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,680
is feeling depressed

297
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,620
because of that book?

298
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,510
He already has a girl.

299
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,600
Let me tell you.

300
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,210
Shen Nuo is exceptional.

301
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,980
He even gave up

302
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,540
such a valuable book

303
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,760
for that girl's wine.

304
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,240
Judging from your tone,

305
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,240
you seem to have figured out

306
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
how to make money with this book.

307
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,950
Brother, don't worry.

308
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,540
You two got your eyes on the book first.

309
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,930
You two will have a share

310
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,250
after we get the money.

311
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,030
Then,

312
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,200
let me thank you two.

313
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,650
May I ask

314
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,710
how do you plan on making a fortune?

315
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,900
Young Master.

316
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,320
I ran into Three and Four

317
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,050
from the Black Tiger Fortress.

318
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,240
Why did they come to Jinyang County?

319
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,460
They have an appointment with the Song family

320
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,800
to meet at Jinyang Bridge.

321
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,860
They want to exchange the registration book for money.

322
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,980
Three and Four made a mistake.

323
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,150
They want to extort money with the book?

324
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,350
Since the Song family agreed,

325
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,670
it's most likely a trap.

326
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,950
What should we do now?

327
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,630
Let's go and take a look.

328
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,840
Three!

329
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,740
Three, get up.

330
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,540
You knew that the Song family

331
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,710
is not an ordinary family.

332
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,500
Why did you still do such a stupid thing?

333
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,990
We just wanted to extort some money.

334
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,120
We thought it'd just be a fight at most.

335
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,060
I didn't expect

336
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,920
that they would come for the kill.

337
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,310
Where's the registration book?

338
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,910
The horse rider snatched it.

339
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,430
You...

340
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,360
Shen,

341
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,290
I will remember

342
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,580
how you saved my life today.

343
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,310
I have to take Three to the doctor.

344
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,440
He's badly injured.

345
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,990
No.

346
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,200
That man returned to give the report.

347
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,850
The Song family will definitely

348
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,380
search for you everywhere.

349
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,790
Go back to the fortress.

350
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,320
Let’s go.

351
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,190
Come on.

352
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,370
The arrow is poisonous.

353
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,570
Then they—

354
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,440
Youheng.

355
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,630
Where are you going?

356
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,750
Chunzhu's mother is sick.

357
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,710
I'm going to visit her.

358
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,320
Youheng,

359
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,630
I need your help.

360
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,400
Sorry, I'm unable to help.

361
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,850
Youheng,

362
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,580
why are you treating me like this?

363
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,110
If there are any misunderstandings,

364
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,510
please tell me directly.

365
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,530
You come and go

366
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,020
as you wish

367
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,950
without saying goodbye.

368
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,840
What do you make of Man'er?

369
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,910
Since you left,

370
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,940
you shouldn't have come back.

371
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,690
You shouldn't disturb Man'er's life anymore.

372
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,300
Youheng,

373
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,200
we are two very different

374
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,130
kinds of people,

375
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,350
but in one thing,

376
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,930
we are the same.

377
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,770
We both love Lian Man'er.

378
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,340
Just like you,

379
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,100
I also hope

380
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,010
to protect her.

381
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,400
Before, you were wary of me

382
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,820
because of her.

383
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,810
Now, you are cold to me

384
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,890
because of her.

385
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,200
I indeed have my reasons,

386
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,770
but I can't explain them to you.

387
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,140
So, I don't ask

388
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,340
that you can trust me.

389
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,700
I only ask...

390
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,980
I only ask that you

391
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,350
can be a benevolent doctor

392
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,750
and temporarily set aside your prejudice.

393
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,980
Help me save someone.

394
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,410
Keep playing.

395
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,010
I can't believe

396
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,540
there's such a big fortress in the mountains.

397
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,800
These people all had their land

398
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,830
stolen by the government

399
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,890
and wealthy lords.

400
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,300
The homeless people

401
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,540
who have no other choice

402
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,430
flee to this place

403
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,890
to have somewhere to live.

404
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,960
Turns out

405
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,330
that the recent bandits in Jinyang County

406
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,730
are not criminals at all.

407
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,340
They are just

408
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,020
poor folks who were forced to go into the mountain.

409
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,160
Those who hurt Three and Four

410
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,890
are so cruel.

411
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,110
What if they seize an opportunity

412
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,660
to attack us?

413
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,810
We can't go down the mountain.

414
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,650
What is more important

415
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,290
than Three's life?

416
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,200
If you won't save him,

417
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,760
I'll save him myself.

418
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,670
What if there's an ambush down the mountain?

419
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,250
Yeah.

420
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,230
You brought outsiders here

421
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,890
as soon as a problem happened.

422
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,300
What do you think of

423
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,760
the Black Tiger Fortress?

424
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,540
This is the one who robbed my wine.

425
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,570
Why is he here?

426
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,660
Five, Six.

427
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,550
Yes.

428
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:42,990
Wait.

429
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,770
Master,

430
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,900
Youheng is a friend of mine from down the mountain.

431
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,250
He's a skilled doctor.

432
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,790
Zhao Three's injuries haven't been treated yet.

433
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,450
Saving him is more important.

434
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,020
Yes.

435
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,690
Carry him over here first.

436
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,110
Master,

437
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,250
can we trust them?

438
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,690
Why are you hesitating now?

439
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,470
Saving Three is more important.

440
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,870
Besides, you don't even have a doctor here.

441
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,130
Why don't you trust us?

442
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,530
Come.

443
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:04,880
Slowly.

444
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,670
Okay, put him down.

445
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,740
Put him down.

446
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,110
Here. Okay.

447
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,270
It's qianji poison.

448
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,300
Qianji poison?

449
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,620
You're awake.

450
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,370
Three.

451
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,840
Three!

452
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,920
It's okay. I'm glad you're awake.

453
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,450
Three.

454
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,300
What?

455
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,670
Water.

456
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,660
Water.

457
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,690
Hurry, go get water.

458
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,900
Go get water.

459
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,380
He's awake.

460
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,040
I didn't have time

461
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,920
to say hello to this lady earlier.

462
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,940
You must be

463
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,350
that friend

464
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,980
of Shen?

465
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,420
We really didn't know

466
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,160
before robbing the goods

467
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
that it was your wine.

468
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,110
We just thought it belonged to the Song family.

469
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,850
I hope

470
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,090
it didn't affect you.

471
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,630
It's okay.

472
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,420
Shen Nuo already returned the wine to me.

473
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,200
After we go down the mountain,

474
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,670
I'll return the wine to the buyer.

475
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,270
It's okay.

476
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,750
Today,

477
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,890
you all saved Three.

478
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,860
I, Yu Xiangjin, really don't know

479
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,220
how to thank you.

480
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,100
Master,

481
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,910
you're lucky to be able to escape

482
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,650
from the Song family this time,

483
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,640
but if you keep doing this,

484
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,150
something bad will happen sooner or later.

485
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,100
It will also implicate

486
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,560
the kids and seniors here.

487
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,690
I think we should

488
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,940
stop the robbing now.

489
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,800
It's easy for you to say.

490
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,850
If we don't do it,

491
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,170
everyone here will starve to death.

492
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,530
If we go down the mountain,

493
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,880
we have neither home nor land.

494
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,370
We don't even have documents

495
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,650
to prove our identities.

496
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,970
How can they survive?

497
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,300
It's not that I want to continue,

498
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,590
but that we literally have

499
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,760
no other way out.

500
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,080
I have a suggestion

501
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,210
if you all are willing to listen.

502
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,460
Right now,

503
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,140
I'm selling distilled grape wine.

504
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,960
The wine is called

505
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,110
Champion Brandy.

506
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,920
The sales are quite good,

507
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,700
but we don't have many workers,

508
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,980
so our production scale is small.

509
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,010
Your fortress

510
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,910
is very big

511
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,600
and there are many people.

512
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,160
Why don't we work together?

513
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,180
How can we work together?

514
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,900
To put it bluntly,

515
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,940
you'll provide the space and manpower,

516
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,800
and I'll provide the technology.

517
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,430
After the wine is produced,

518
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll go down the mountain to find the buyers.

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,430
At that time, we can split profits 30-70.

520
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,960
It's mutually beneficial.

521
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,430
My wine

522
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,020
is delicious and also expensive.

523
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,240
Do you know how much money

524
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,790
I made

525
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,230
with the wine this month?

526
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,960
How much?

527
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,830
Fifty taels?

528
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,230
Five hundred taels.

529
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,110
That much?

530
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Five hundred?

531
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,340
Didn't you say

532
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,470
you owed a lot of money?

533
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,730
When did you suddenly make so much money?

534
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,830
I'll have it when the wine is made.

535
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,170
What if they don't pay you?

536
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,050
Shut up.

537
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,310
Master,

538
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,530
I know you don't trust me.

539
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,770
How about this?

540
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,310
I'll bring the wine distilling equipment

541
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,980
and ingredients

542
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,140
up the mountain.

543
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,340
Let's make wine together

544
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,400
and make money together.

545
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,360
After we finish,

546
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,740
we'll split the profits 50-50.

547
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,940
After this deal,

548
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,030
you all won't have to

549
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,790
live in fear

550
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,130
and danger anymore,

551
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:27,850
right?

552
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,710
Yes. That's great.

553
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,070
It would be nice to have a peaceful life.

554
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,760
Not bad.

555
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,400
Master,

556
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,930
this business sounds good.

557
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,230
Yes, Master.

558
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,710
Let me say something.

559
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,390
I know that it's been hard

560
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,080
for Master and everyone else.

561
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,590
From what I know about both sides,

562
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,130
I believe this deal

563
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,540
will be extremely beneficial

564
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,200
for the Black Tiger Fortress.

565
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,180
So, I think working with Miss Man'er

566
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,580
is a good opportunity.

567
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,970
What do you think, Master?

568
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,600
Miss Man'er,

569
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,030
our village is full of

570
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,140
honest farmers.

571
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,670
They're not cunning.

572
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,310
Today,

573
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,270
since Shen connected us,

574
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,120
then we'll work with you.

575
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,820
However,

576
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,100
we need to keep things clear.

577
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,710
You must keep your promise.

578
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,500
We'll split the profits 50-50.

579
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,950
You'll give us the money

580
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,620
and we'll give you the wine.

581
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,070
Deal.

582
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,500
Great!

583
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,830
Great, come.

584
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,510
Let's have a wonderful partnership.

585
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,300
This is great.

586
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,520
Thank you, Miss Man'er.

587
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,280
I look forward to working with you.

588
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,810
Come on.

589
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,670
This is great.

590
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,910
Come on. Happy cooperation.

591
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,660
Thank you, Miss Man'er.

592
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,250
Cheers.

593
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,130
Come on.

594
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:54,790
Have a seat.

595
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,140
Madam,

596
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,690
try to move it.

597
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,710
Doctor Wang, you're amazing.

598
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,300
You put in some needles

599
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,160
and my arm doesn't hurt anymore.

600
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,700
I can even lift it up.

601
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,180
I'll prescribe some more medicine for you

602
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,540
to stabilize the effect.

603
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,160
Okay, thank you so much.

604
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,440
Youheng.

605
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:26,650
Man'er.

606
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,550
On my way here,

607
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,530
I heard a lot of people want to

608
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,060
set up a tablet to thank you.

609
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,440
They flatter me.

610
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,200
I’m just taking a look for them.

611
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,360
The fortress often lacks medicine

612
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,660
and there's no way

613
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,520
to treat illnesses promptly.

614
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,790
They can only drag it out.

615
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,000
This way, a small cold

616
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,680
can turn into a major illness.

617
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,190
Luckily, I brought some common medicine

618
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,070
to help them.

619
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,470
You can focus on the treatment.

620
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,010
I need to deliver the wine.

621
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,180
If you're done packing,

622
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,639
you should hurry down too.

623
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,260
I won't return right now.

624
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,159
There are so many patients here.

625
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,360
I haven't finished checking them yet.

626
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,159
Also, it's not enough

627
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,320
to take medicine once or twice.

628
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,139
I'm worried.

629
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,139
I'd better stay for a few more days.

630
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:19,800
That works.

631
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,760
Tell me if you need anything.

632
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,980
I can bring them for you.

633
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,989
I'll bring you

634
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,739
the Three-Nine Cold Medicine.

635
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,400
Okay.

636
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,020
There's one more thing.

637
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,940
I haven't thanked you

638
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,320
for the fireworks yet.

639
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,110
You knew it was me?

640
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,110
Of course.

641
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,860
Only you asked me

642
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,489
what makes me the happiest,

643
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,320
so I naturally knew.

644
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,679
Actually...

645
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,510
Youheng,

646
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,260
I hope

647
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,460
that we'll always be best friends.

648
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,690
Of course.

649
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,990
I'm off now.

650
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,600
Okay.

651
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,850
Young Master,

652
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,750
the Song family

653
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,300
took the registration book back.

654
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,210
How exactly should we

655
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,050
approach the Jinyang Guild

656
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,380
to keep investigating?

657
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,520
You're still thinking about that?

658
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,680
What did you say?

659
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,690
-Young Master.
-Thirteen.

660
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,550
I need your help.

661
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,810
After I go down the mountain,

662
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,820
can you help me

663
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,310
return the wine to the Song family?

664
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,380
I want the Eldest Young Master

665
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,240
to pay the bill.

666
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,290
Sure.

667
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,460
Thank you.

668
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,990
You're welcome.

669
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,930
Wait.

670
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,160
You reminded me.

671
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,880
According to Yu Xiangjin,

672
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,470
the people in the registration book

673
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,200
are all from the Jinyang Guild.

674
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,080
Then, Song Haikun and the Song family

675
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,340
should also be part of the Jinyang Guild.

676
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,510
Maybe we can find out from him

677
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,240
how to enter the Jinyang Guild.

678
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,310
I'll go with you.

679
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,880
Eldest Young Master,

680
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,660
what did Master Wu say

681
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,060
after we brought it over?

682
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,070
Wu Zhonglian is a sly fox.

683
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,340
I've worked for him for so long

684
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,070
and only made this one mistake.

685
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,110
The registration book was taken

686
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,240
by those performers

687
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,590
and he immediately turned on me.

688
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,220
I got

689
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,160
the registration book back

690
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
and gave it to him.

691
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,770
I've given in to him already.

692
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,030
What else does he want?

693
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,020
Eldest Young Master, please don't say that.

694
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,860
Come, sit.

695
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,830
What now?

696
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,230
He won't give me

697
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,110
the dispatching business. Fine.

698
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,490
But now, I can't even participate

699
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,420
in the salt trafficking business.

700
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,140
I can't get

701
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
any benefits now.

702
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:47,840
Tell me,

703
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,250
why should I stay

704
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,530
in the merchant guild?

705
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,550
Fourth Young Master.

706
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,570
Man'er.

707
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,710
Brother-in-law.

708
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,840
Here's the money for the wine.

709
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,620
Thank you, Brother-in-law.

710
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,100
Sit.

711
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,750
The wine getting robbed

712
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,850
must have affected your family.

713
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,680
We were very sorry,

714
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,300
so we made another batch

715
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,990
for you.

716
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,570
Thank you, Man'er.

717
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,980
But...

718
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,100
Is your brother angry?

719
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,740
Why isn't he here?

720
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,050
His business

721
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,210
has some problems.

722
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,890
He can't meet visitors now,

723
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,280
so he sent me to see you.

724
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,260
It's okay. Since I got the money,

725
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,580
I'm satisfied.

726
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,570
Thank you.

727
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,900
Song,

728
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,630
I heard there's a local merchant guild.

729
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,020
Everyone shares information

730
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
helps each other,

731
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,670
and also does some business together.

732
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,450
As you know,

733
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,410
small businesses like us

734
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,840
make money too slowly.

735
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,820
I know you have wide connections.

736
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,070
Could you help introduce us?

737
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,850
Shen,

738
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,250
I'm afraid I can't.

739
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,980
The head of the merchant guild

740
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,580
is Wu Zhonglian, the wealthiest in the region.

741
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,310
Boss Wu.

742
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,070
People call him Master Wu.

743
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,280
Master Wu decides

744
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,790
who can enter the guild.

745
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,190
The bosses inside

746
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,040
are all famous and wealthy.

747
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,710
You have no business

748
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,180
nor a shop.

749
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,660
Although my family

750
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,410
has a close relationship with Boss Wu,

751
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,290
my brother can't interfere

752
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,150
with the guild matters recently.

753
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,740
Even if he pleads with Master Wu,

754
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,090
I'm afraid he won't agree.

755
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,910
What can I do

756
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,380
to meet Boss Wu?

757
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Boss Wu lives in seclusion.

758
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,230
If you don't have abilities that interest him,

759
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,030
I'm afraid...

760
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,580
Our business is truly too small.

761
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,390
I'm afraid we can't even reach the edge

762
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,650
of the merchant guild.

763
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,260
Right. In that case,

764
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,960
we'll listen to you.

765
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,330
We'd better

766
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,080
expand our own business first.

767
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,030
Honey,

768
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,110
you paid Man'er for the wine?

769
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,120
Not only that.

770
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,470
After the wedding,

771
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,440
many guests

772
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,390
asked me to order wine from Man'er.

773
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,030
You even helped her?

774
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,550
Why didn't you ask me?

775
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,480
Honey,

776
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,070
there's something you don't know.

777
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,000
My sister has always been naughty.

778
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,350
As you know,

779
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,820
my mother only has me

780
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,460
and no other children,

781
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,210
so she mocked my mother.

782
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,790
Her words were so vulgar

783
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,770
that I can't even repeat them.

784
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,760
Is that so?

785
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,700
But

786
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,320
she's my sister.

787
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,490
I'm being petty.

788
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:31,900
Honey,

789
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,040
you are so kind.

790
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,460
Why didn't you tell me

791
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,030
that people bullied you?

792
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,310
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

793
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,930
You won't be mistreated again

794
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,730
in the future.

795
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,270
Honey, you are so nice.

796
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,130
Hearing what you said,

797
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,990
it's quite hard to join the Jinyang Guild.

798
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,340
We need to start a business first.

799
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,100
Even with a business,

800
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,480
we still might not be able to enter.

801
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,940
We need to make some noise.

802
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,660
Don't think too much now.

803
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,800
Anyway,

804
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,650
let's decide what business we'll do first.

805
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,300
How about

806
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,480
we find a shop

807
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,990
and open a restaurant?

808
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,620
Sure.

809
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,180
But

810
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,800
I used the 500 taels

811
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,810
that Song Hailong gave me

812
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,870
to pay off the debt.

813
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,550
I only have 200 taels left.

814
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,340
The money to buy the shop

815
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,130
depends on your salaries.

816
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,340
I'm a farmer now.

817
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,710
If I produce a great sum

818
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,880
to start a business,

819
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,980
it'll attract the attention of the others.

820
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,300
If someone checks

821
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,180
our background

822
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,580
after we join the Jinyang Guild,

823
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,310
something is bound to go wrong.

824
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,790
It's best to be cautious

825
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,230
and make wine to save money for the shop.

826
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,760
So, I still have to build up from nothing.

827
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,620
What are you sewing?

828
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,550
You've been sewing for a long time.

829
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,130
We've been staying here

830
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:26,780
for a long time.

831
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,530
I'll feel bad

832
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,760
if I don't do any work.

833
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,330
I suddenly forgot

834
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,390
Ye'er is still working in the yard.

835
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,510
I'll bring her some snacks.

836
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,510
Have Thirteen go.

837
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,870
He feels bad if he doesn't work.

838
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:40,850
I feel bad.

839
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,970
Yes, I feel bad.

840
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,660
I'll go.

841
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,800
You two continue chatting.

842
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,000
I'll take a look.

843
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,530
[Mission: 1,000 taels of gold]

844
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,530
[Income: sold wine, 500 taels]

845
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,530
[Expenses: 0]
