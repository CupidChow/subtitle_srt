[Episode 4]

4
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,270
Aunt He.

5
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,830
Aunt He.

6
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,830
Aunt He. Aunt He.

7
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,140
Aunt He.

8
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,040
Have some chicken.

9
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,889
Where is it?

10
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,990
Where is it?

11
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,230
Aunt He.

12
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,470
Grandpa is borrowing money.

13
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,400
Don't you want to go and take a look?

14
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,260
What's there to see?

15
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,470
He is not borrowing money for me.

16
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,700
Aunt He, listen to me.

17
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,400
After Grandpa agreed

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,390
to borrow money from Mr. Jin yesterday,

19
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,990
I tossed and turned all night.

20
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,790
I was thinking

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,329
that if Lian Hua'er marries into the Song family,

22
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,100
will she become a member of the Song family?

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,060
Of course.

24
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,810
But it's Grandpa who's putting his fingerprint

25
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,310
on the IOU.

26
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,980
The Song family wants to borrow money.

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,560
The Lian family's fingerprint is on the IOU.

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,090
Aunt He, do you feel secure?

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,990
Yes.

30
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,360
Or no?

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,940
What do you mean?

32
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,950
I mean

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,090
on the IOU,

34
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,280
it'll be the Lian family's fingerprint.

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,200
If in the future,

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
Hua'er says she's from the Song family

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,590
and has no reason

38
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,250
to repay the money for the Lian family,

39
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,310
should we repay the money ourselves?

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,070
If Mr. Jin comes to collect the debts,

41
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,990
our house and land

42
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,930
are all here.

43
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,990
We can't run away.

44
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,270
Mr. Lian.

45
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,140
If there's nothing wrong,

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,750
you can sign and put your fingerprint here.

47
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,230
Then Scholar and I

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,570
will go and get the money.

49
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,900
There's nothing wrong.

50
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,840
My father knows

51
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,579
what kind of person you are.

52
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,660
Of course.

53
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,200
I'll warn Grandpa right away.

54
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,270
Will you help me?

55
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,220
I'll go now.

56
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,070
Wait.

57
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,820
Father.

58
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,780
The fingerprint on the IOU

59
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,500
must be given by Hua'er.

60
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,170
Hua'er

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,170
is still unmarried.

62
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,980
She can't do such a thing.

63
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,200
The fingerprint should be Father's.

64
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,070
Father is the head of the family.

65
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,800
That makes sense.

66
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,040
But

67
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,450
you can't say that.

68
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,180
Gu.

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,550
Better safe than sorry.

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,430
The words of Hua'er sound nice,

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,350
but if she can't repay the money in the future,

72
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,230
the land and house of the Lian family

73
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,350
will be used to pay off the debts.

74
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,339
How will we

75
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,100
live then?

76
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,070
How will we live?

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,810
Elders protect children.

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,570
It's natural.

79
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,020
But in the Lian family,

80
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,909
Hua'er is not the only daughter.

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,200
I have Ye'er and Jizu.

82
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,700
And Jizu.

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,030
Lian Hua'er

84
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,600
is just a girl.

85
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,409
Jizu is a boy.

86
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,909
In the future, he'll rely on the money of the family

87
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,310
to study and get married.

88
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,750
The fingerprint

89
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,430
must be given by Hua'er.

90
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,780
Aunt He.

91
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,360
The money is borrowed for me.

92
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,670
I'll definitely pay it back.

93
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,810
Fine. You'll pay it back.

94
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,900
Come here. Press your finger.

95
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,630
Lian Man'er.

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,100
Your elders are here.

97
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,790
How dare you interrupt?

98
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,630
Shouxin.

99
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,780
Why don't you discipline

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,580
Man'er?

101
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,840
She's getting more and more disrespectful.

102
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,270
Man'er.

103
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,250
Let your grandpa make a decision.

104
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,900
Hua'er

105
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,780
won't welsh.

106
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,970
Besides,

107
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,790
Father is still here.

108
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,340
How can his granddaughter be in charge

109
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,560
and borrow money?

110
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,760
If word gets out

111
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,840
and others know it,

112
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,260
what will they

113
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,040
think of our family in the future?

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,680
Mr. Jin is not a big mouth.

115
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,190
If the Lian family don't tell others,

116
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,100
who will know it?

117
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,980
Shut up!

118
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,340
The eldest young master of the Lian family is so powerful.

119
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,580
It seems that the head of the Lian family

120
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,720
is your eldest son.

121
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,230
I'm not dead yet.

122
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,260
Father.

123
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,400
That's not what I meant.

124
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,090
Father.

125
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,290
How about

126
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,160
we discuss it again?

127
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,660
Scholar.

128
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,790
We made an agreement before.

129
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,780
You asked me to prepare an IOU

130
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,660
and bring it here.

131
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,710
But now you...

132
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,540
Your family

133
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,940
want to discuss it again.

134
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,390
I'm not

135
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,270
bragging.

136
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,930
There are tons of people

137
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,620
who want to borrow money from our private bank.

138
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,750
500 taels of silver.

139
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
There is a lot of interest every day.

140
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,580
If you're not sincere,

141
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,170
don't get in the way of me making money.

142
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,590
Father. Grandpa.

143
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,990
I'll give my fingerprint.

144
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,150
The problem of the forced marriage was finally solved.

145
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,810
No one will harass me anymore.

146
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,460
Right?

147
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,290
I gotta think of a way to make money.

148
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,440
This place is good, but I can't stay here for long.

149
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:36,990
Yellow.

150
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,950
Do you think

151
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,640
I can make 1,000 taels of gold?

152
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,260
Yes.

153
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,800
Yes. Yes.

154
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm relieved to hear that.

155
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,360
Let's go.

156
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,240
I know

157
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,560
making money from firethorns

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,550
is too slow.

159
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,010
But this is just a stopgap measure.

160
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,390
I've done some research.

161
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,310
Lipstick, rouge, and pork offal

162
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,110
are being sold by other people.

163
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,460
And you're overqualified

164
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,590
for manual jobs.

165
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,860
So,

166
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,110
how about writing letters for people?

167
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,710
This job is suitable for you.

168
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,090
Besides, the market lacks you...

169
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,100
Don't bother.

170
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,180
Don't refuse immediately.

171
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
I've thought about it.

172
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,100
This business doesn't require capital

173
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,700
and technical proficiency.

174
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,340
You

175
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,980
just need to sit there.

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,800
With your handsome face,

177
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,900
girls

178
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,720
will rush to spend money for you.

179
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,260
I don't mean to say

180
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,460
that you're a toy boy.

181
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,400
I mean

182
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,940
God already put the food

183
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,820
in your mouth.

184
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,710
It's impolite to not eat it.

185
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,020
Besides,

186
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,400
you still owe me 100 taels of silver.

187
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,460
It's only right to pay off your debts.

188
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,050
Except writing letters for people,

189
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,510
I can consider other jobs.

190
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Fine. Tell me

191
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,870
what you can do.

192
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,890
You don't want to use your brain

193
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,270
and take advantage of your face.

194
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,580
It takes you too long to pick firethorns.

195
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
Even Seven is more capable than you.

196
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,920
The sun is setting.

197
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,470
If you can't fill the basket with firethorns,

198
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,270
don't go back.

199
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,780
Seven.

200
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,790
Amazing!

201
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,290
Shen Nuo is amazing.

202
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,730
It was filled up so soon. Let's go.

203
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,730
Let's go home.

204
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,810

Thirteen.

221
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,780
Come out quickly after you get the stuff.

222
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,120
Thirteen.

223
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,200
Young Master.

224
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,600
You...

225
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,470
Young Master.

226
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,210
Why are you dressed like this?

227
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,070
I'm going to perform on the stage.

228
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,030
Perform?

229
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,180
Aren't you being kidnapped

230
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,980
and in danger?

231
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,880
I'm being kidnapped.

232
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm being kidnapped.

233
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,340
The troupe

234
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,560
needs more people on the stage tonight.

235
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:37,990
Do you know the identities of the members

236
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,450
of the troupe downstairs?

237
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,350
On the surface,

238
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,990
they're just a group of people

239
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,440
who perform from village to village.

240
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,500
But they're skilled in martial arts.

241
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,350
After I made an appointment with you that day,

242
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,350
I came here first.

243
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,790
I happened to see them

244
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,880
occupy Carters' Inn

245
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,070
and make it a temporary place for entertainment.

246
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,300
When I was waiting for you,

247
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,290
the leader of the troupe

248
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,750
kept me here for no reason.

249
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,150
What took you so long?

250
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,720
I was shot by a poison arrow.

251
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,460
People from the government also saw my face.

252
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,430
At that time, they were sending more people

253
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,350
to look for me.

254
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,700
For the moment, I can only

255
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,090
live in a farmer's house.

256
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,160
Are you safe there?

257
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,350
All right.

258
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,350
Don't worry. There's no problem.

259
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,880
I've talked to that family.

260
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,190
Currently,

261
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,650
I'm their distant nephew.

262
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,340
I work for them every day.

263
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,390
Even if someone investigates me,

264
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,190
that family

265
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,470
will cover for me.

266
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,040
When I came to see you last time,

267
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,830
I saw people who guarded you

268
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,690
were all good at martial artists.

269
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,730
My injuries were not healed

270
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,460
at that time.

271
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,720
I had no choice but to leave first.

272
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,220
But with your martial art skills,

273
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,350
why didn't you find a chance to escape?

274
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,530
Because I found...

275
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,810
Are you acting a play

276
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,610
about good brothers who never abandon each other?

277
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,640
This young man is so handsome.

278
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,300
How about

279
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,670
you stay in our Shengde Troupe?

280
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,110
Champion, please take the whip.

281
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,110
It depends on whether you can keep me.

282
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,590
Go!

283
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,100
I don't need a consort.

284
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,040
Don't stop clapping.

286
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,250
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

287
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,070
It's him.

288
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,350
I saw him kill Young Master Sun

289
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,340
with my own eyes.

290
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,300
[A Friend of Sun Li, Fan Lin]

291
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,500
Bravo!

292
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,980
Bravo!

293
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,270
Don't run. You haven't paid yet.

294
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,450
Pay up.

295
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,100
Pay up.

296
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,130
If you want someone, just say it.

297
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,200
Why are you playing hard to get?

298
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,050
You're quite hard to deal with.

299
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,840
You have swords and knives.

300
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,360
It's impossible to escape from here.

301
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,070
You're speaking slang.

302
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,300
Are you from the martial arts world?

303
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,960
I just have the same interest.

304
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,700
Since we met,

305
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,950
why don't you tell me your name?

306
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,210
We came here to perform

307
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,340
and make some money.

308
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,000
My surname

309
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,910
is Yu.

310
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,720
[Yu Xiangjin]

311
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,710
Look at you.

312
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,650
I didn't expect you to have the same interest as us.

313
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,310
My friend

314
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,849
was kept here by you.

315
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,280
He must have offended you.

316
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,270
I apologize.

317
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,890
May I ask

318
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,490
why you kept him here?

319
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,190
You friend doesn't know rules.

320
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,810
He sat on my suitcase.

321
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,120
As a man,

322
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,290
he sat on the items I used for making money.

323
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,290
Bad luck.

324
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,390
That's true.

325
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
How about you name your price

326
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,260
and give me a chance to make friends with you?

327
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,140
We both know

328
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,710
that only you can decide

329
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,630
whether my friend can be released.

330
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,110
OK.

331
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,930
The loss of tonight's performance

332
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,260
and the fact that your friend offended me.

333
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,590
200 taels of silver.

334
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,890
You're asking too much.

335
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,650
You're breaking the rules of the martial arts world.

336
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,500
Shut up!

337
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,740
Rules?

338
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,350
I'm the rule.

339
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,670
200 taels of silver.

340
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,410
It’s really difficult.

341
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,070
It seems

342
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
that I can only leave my friend here.

343
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,140
Goodbye.

344
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,500
100 taels of silver.

345
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,280
50 taels of silver.

346
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,920
200 taels of silver is fine.

347
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,650
In a month,

348
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,210
I'll ransom him.

349
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,000
How dare you trick me?

350
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,990
Don't you like

351
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,530
playing tricks?

352
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,450
Please

353
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,620
take good care of

354
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,630
my friend.

355
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,090
Before I leave,

356
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,180
I have something

357
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,270
to tell him.

358
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,420
I wonder...

359
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,380
Thank you.

360
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,780
Are you okay?

361
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,600
I'm fine.

362
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,590
Let me ask you.

363
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,660
Why did the rich man

364
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,990
we had our eyes on before

365
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,390
suddenly appear

366
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,360
in Carters' Inn?

367
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,350
I didn't have time to elaborate.

368
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,660
I caught that man

369
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,730
drinking and enjoying opera here.

370
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,140
So I took this opportunity

371
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,540
to fish for information.

372
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,570
I heard from the troupe by chance

373
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,030
that he is the owner of Yuelai Restaurant.

374
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,490
Yuelai Restaurant?

375
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,650
Okay.

376
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,150
I'll go to this restaurant.

377
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,260
You stay here and keep investigating.

378
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,700
Okay.

379
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
See you next time.

380
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,480
Take care.

381
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,710

382
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,070

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
I'm really sorry.

384
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,480
The tables of our restaurant

385
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,150
are hard to be available.

386
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,390
We're fully booked today.

387
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,520
Come here next time.

388
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,060
I can write letters and petitions for you.

389
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,220
Every ten words cost one coin.

390

Make way.

391
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,630
Make way.

392
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,210
A basket of firethorns

393
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,270
can only be exchanged for a few coins.

394
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
If I want to earn 1,000 taels of gold,

395
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,450
it'll take eight lifetimes.

396
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,910
Okay. Thank you.

[Write Letters for People, Every Ten Words Cost One Tael of Silver]

398
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,780
Every ten words cost one tael of silver?

399
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,820
It'd be strange if someone came.

400
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,030
Sir.

401
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,710
I want you

402
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,210
to write a letter for me.

403
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,360
Miss, it's done.

404
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,150
Sir,

405
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,330
don't just write it.

406
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,110
Help me read it.

407

See if there's something wrong.

408
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,370
Yes.

410
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,470
Read it.

411
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,830
That costs extra.

412
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,190
Can you read it now?

413
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,130
Can you read it?

414
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,990
Can you read it?

415
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,860
It's not...

416
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,620
Is it enough?

417
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,500
Can you read it now?

418
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,910
Read it.

419
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,980
Yes, sir. Read it.

420
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,150
Read it.

421
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,420
Read it.

422
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,020
Yes, just read it.

423
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,770
Just read it.

424
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,120
Clouds change in the sky.

425
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,740
Shooting stars convey the sadness of lovesickness.

426
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,820
I passed through the vast Milky Way quietly tonight.

427
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,940
When we parted, I couldn't bear to look at the Magpie Bridge.

428
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,940
If love between us can last forever,

429
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,140
why do we need to stay together night and day?

He read it so well.

432
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,190
He's so talented.

433
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,830
He read it so well.

434
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,640
Yes.

435
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,300
It's my turn.

436
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,230
It's my turn.

437
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,170
It's our turn.

Who is carrying a basket here?

442
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,530
Just one sentence.

443
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,130
You refused to make money with your face, didn't you?

444
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,280
I just don't want to make money with you.

445
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,250
I didn't say I wouldn't do it myself.

446
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,720
But you're using my idea.

447
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,060
I should have half of the money

448
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,070
you make.

449
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,860

I know.

454

456

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,870
This paragraph is better.

460
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,210
This paragraph is much better than what I wrote.

461
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:42,740
Write it.

462
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,210

Move back a little, girls.

Wait.

484
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,150
Your grandma didn't let me pay for meals.

485
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:28,910
Fine.

486
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,800
You're good at flattering people.

Why did you set up a stand all of a sudden?

I met a person who's from my hometown two days ago.

He was kept.

496
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,860
He needs a ransom of 200 taels of silver.

497
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,910
I need to save money for him.

498
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,640

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,310

Where did you get this hairstick?

507
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,180
I used the money I made by selling firethorns

508
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,110
to buy it for you.

509
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,160
You're really capable.

510
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,360
But there are many insects and snakes on the mountain.

511
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,760
Don't go there next time.

512
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,690
You gave your own hairstick

513
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,530
to Grandma.

514
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,420
But it's okay.

515
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,650
In the future, I'll make money

516
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,850
and buy you hairsticks which are set with gold, silver,

517
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,620
and agate.

00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,740
Although this one

519
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,950
looks plain,

520
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,400
you'll look good in it.

521
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,270
Not now.

522
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,990
I'm afraid it'll cause trouble if your grandma sees it.

523
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,190
I'll keep it. I'll wear it in the future.

524
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,630
I like it.

525
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,290
I just washed the dates.

526
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,130
Try one.

527
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,450
Is it sweet?

528
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,150
It's delicious.

529
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,050
Mom, have one too.

530
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,270
Okay.

531
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,470
You eat.

532
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,560
What's wrong?

533
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,140
You look serious.

534
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,990
I saw Lian Man'er just now.

535
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,920
She had a money pouch in her hand.

536
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,070
The money pouch was full.

537
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,500
Mother.

538
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,790
Where did she get the money?

539
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,430
I saw her give Aunt Zhang

540
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,090
a new hairstick.

541
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,400
Judging by the style of the hairstick,

542
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,230
it costed at least one tael of silver.

543
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,200
Really?

544
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,760
Mother.

545
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,150
Every year, Grandma

546
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,750
can only save a little money.

547
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,540
If my uncles

548
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,230
take it,

549
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,690
it'll be a great loss to us.

550
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,070
I'll go

551
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,330
and ask your Aunt Zhang

552
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,950
what Lian Man'er

553
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,650
is doing.

554
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,090
By the way, Mother,

555
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,780
have you taken your medicine?

556
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,730
You'll definitely give me

557
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,730
a younger brother

558
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,840
and make Aunt He shut her mouth.

559
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,010
Good morning, Nuo.

560
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,700

561
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,160
Let's go and set up a stand.

562
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,440
You and I are so close.

563
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,420
We fly together.

564
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,400
We'll fly over the world

565
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,400
and be with each other forever.

566
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,270
The industry value chain was formed so quickly.

567
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,950
Who said the early bird

568
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,750
gets the worm?

569
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:55,990
I think

570
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,230
that the early bird

571
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,430

572
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,020
These girls' affection

573
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,470
changed too fast.

574
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,180
I understand.

575
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,980
But they chose these guys.

576
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,760
Look at their faces.

577
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,480
Good business is also a problem.

578
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,460
What do you mean?

579
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,050
You gave them two coins, but you gave me one.

Do you want to go to Yuelai Restaurant for a meal?

You have money?

584
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,080

I'll be right back.

593
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,570
You grew a conscience?

594
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,160
I'll order what I want then.

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,470
It's not easy for you to deliver goods.

615
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,500
You mean

616
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,140

00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,750
What are you talking about?

619
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,930
I dare not.

620
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,150
I'll ask someone

621
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,650
to get you a new pot of tea.

622
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,640
I came here in advance

623
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,780
and checked here.

624
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,630
They're just ordinary customers.

629
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,840

What a bad day.

637
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,950

These people

642
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,360
are hypocritical and greedy.

643
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,990
They know clearly

644
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,420
how much they can get.

645
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,140

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,230
make it clear.

655
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,930
If we are asked about it,

656
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,340
they can't deny it.

657
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,120
OK.

658
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,990
How are the arrangements

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,250

660
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,680
Young Master, don't worry.

Everything is arranged.

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,450
Let's order together.

663
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,870
Which Song family

664
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,470
Lian Hua'er is marring into?

665
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
That Song family.

666
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,580
Which one?

667
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,990
That one.

668
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,950
The one who has many restaurants and private banks

669
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,710
in the town?

670
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,420
Yes.

671
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,250
You know it clearly.

672
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,370
Is there another Song family

673
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,830
that is as rich as this one?

674
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,700
Which son of the Song family

675
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,940
she's marring?

676
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,570
I don't know. I don't care.

677
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,270
Why do you ask so many questions?

678
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,870
I'm just asking.

679
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,400
You're quite nosy.

680
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,180
Let's go.

681
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,670
I haven't eaten yet.

682
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,220
Do you have money?

683
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,870
Aren't you treating me?

684
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,510
When did I say

685
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,510
I would treat you?

686
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,860
I just want to show you

687
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,250
the most profitable restaurant

688
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,780
and broaden your horizons.

689
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,620
Let's go.

690
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,070
When the food is served,

691
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,100
you have to pay.

692
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,310
I was fooled.

693
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,270
Send this to that person.

694
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,070
Grandpa. Grandma.

695
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,370
Man'er, you came back just in time.

696
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,500
Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

697
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,110
Send some mooncakes

698
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,300
to Mr. Jin later

699
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,520
and tell him

700
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,220
not to worry about the money

701
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,380
we owe him.

702
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,650
The Lian family will repay it on time.

703
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,270
It's better

704
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,060
to ask Uncle Shouren to do this.

705
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,950
If your uncle goes there and gives the gifts,

706
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,430
he'll think

707
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,330
that we have something urgent to ask.

708
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,190
It's not good.

709
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,730
It's better to ask youngsters to go.

710
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,720
Go.

711
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,380
-Go.
-Fine.

712
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,310
They're all here.

713
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,820
Take whatever you want.

714
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,260
Help yourself.

715
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,130
Make yourself at home.

716
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,980
If I were at home,

717
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,510
I couldn't take

718
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,460
whatever I want.

719
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,920
Why don't I see

720
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,660
Youheng?

721
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,420
He went to collect the debts from Mr. Wu

722
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,120
in the west of the village.

723
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,250
He'll be back soon.

724
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,510
He

725
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,520
went to collect debts?

726
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:02,980
Yes.

727
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,900
I have to go and take a look.

728
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,460
Go.

729
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,340
Here, take more.

730
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,850
Man'er. Man'er.

731
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,340
Here.

732
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,530
Sweep here well.

733
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,000
Clear the firewood away.

734
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,670
Clean this table.

735
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,239
My life is so hard.

736
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,460
I can't

737
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,260
pay off my debts

738
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,190
for now.

739
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,650
How should I spend

740
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,980
the rest of my life?

741
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,300
Yes.

742
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,930
Your life is indeed hard.

743
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,900
Youheng.

744
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,520
Man'er.

745
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,060
Why are you here?

746
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,230
Wait a moment.

747
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,470
The water for washing the chickens is dirty.

748
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll go and change it first.

749
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,320
I helped you and took these.

750
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,730
That's not too much, right?

751
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,020
This...

752
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,660
Remember,

753
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,260
you're a debt collector,

754
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,020
not a debtor.

755
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,930
You're such a pushover.

756
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,240
Also,

757
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,350
if you meet people

758
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,760
who you can't deal with again in the future,

759
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,640
remember to take me with you.

760
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,770
I have plenty of ways

761
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,720
to deal with such people.

762
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,340
Man'er.

763
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,980
I don't know

764
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,190
if I should say it.

765
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,560
You're welcome.

766
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,500
No.

767
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,050
Well, I should thank you.

768
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,980
But

769
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,000
this family is in a tight spot.

770
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,240
The old lady of the family

771
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,190
is dying.

772
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,420
They're killing chickens

773
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,360
and geese,

774
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,140
because the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

775
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,260
They want the old lady to remember it.

776
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,250
The cattle and the sheep in the yard

777
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,780
were all borrowed.

778
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:39,900
They want

779
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,840
to make the old lady

780
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,300
be relieved when she dies.

781
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,200
I guess

782
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,430
the money you collected

783
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,190
was for the old lady's

784
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,950
coffin.

785
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,470
Enough.

786
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,160
When you were collecting debts,

787
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,590
you were not eloquent.

788
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,130
I failed to make money

789
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,770
and even lost ten coins.

790
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,620
Man'er, you're so kind.

791
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,440
Stay away from me

792
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,530
when you collect debts in the future.

793
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,910
I want to invite you to the group dance tomorrow.

794
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,780
Let's go together.

795
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,680
I'm not going.

796
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,420
I need to make more money.

797
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,500
Just one day.

798
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,270
Timely wind and rain.

799
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,060
A good harvest.

800
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Timely wind and rain.

801
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,460
A good harvest.

802
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,890
Youheng, sorry to keep you waiting.

803
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,620
I've only been here for a while.

804
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,880
I didn't expect

805
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,540
that you're also interested in this.

806
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,460
Folk dances.

807
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,110
They're ordinary.

808
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,270
Youheng.

809
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,140
Why are the people participating in the Mid-Autumn Festival group dance

810
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,900
all young people?

811
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,890
Many couples in the village

812
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,140
knew each other in the group dance.

813
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,310
I see.

814
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,750
Although it looks like square dancing,

815
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,150
it's quite interesting.

816
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,410
Square dancing?

817
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,960
It's a kind of dance performed on this kind of ground.

818
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,330
Come on. Are you ready?

819
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:32,880
Man'er.

820
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,780
I'll show you my talents.

821
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,340
Together?

822
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,140
I guess Shen is not good at dancing.

823
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,010
Don't make things difficult for him.

824
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,620
Let's go.

825
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,680
I thought you weren't coming.

826
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,790
It's better than doing nothing.

827
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,550
No matter what you want

828
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,280
from Man'er,

829
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,180
leave when you're done.

830
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,370
Youheng, you really care

831
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,430
about Lian Man'er.

832
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,730
Just remember what I said.

833
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,610
What if I don't leave?

834
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,640
[Mission: 1,000 taels of gold]

835
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,640
[Income: firethorns and letters, 23 taels of silver and 66 coins]

836
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,640
[Expenses: a hairstick for Mom and the money for the debtor, 1 tael of silver and 10 coins]
