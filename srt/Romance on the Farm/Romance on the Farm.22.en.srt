[Not for sale]

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,479
I heard

6
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,479
those in the Jinyang Guild always get their way.

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,479
People who wouldn't sell their land

8
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,759
were forced

9
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
into submission.

10
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,259
It's the Jinyang Guild that's buying the land?

11
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:51,820
Yes.

12
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,440
It's written clearly

13
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,670
on the announcement.

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm worried.

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,840
What should we do

16
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,520
when they come to us?

17
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,680
I'll deal with them.

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,669
And we still have Shouren.

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,140
The Jinyang Guild doesn't dare to trifle with an official.

20
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,930
Could it be

21
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,750
that…

22
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,290
Dad, how many notices have you written?

23
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,930
They should be enough.

24
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,130
Okay. Give them to me.

25
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,590
Plaster them everywhere.

26
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,070
Okay.

27
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,290
All over the village.

Man'er.

29
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you think Thirteen and Shen Nuo

30
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,900
are helping

31
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,450
the Jinyang Guild buy land?

32
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,380
I don't think so.

33
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,480
It's a serious matter.

34
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,320
They wouldn't keep it from us.

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,040
But once

36
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,090
they left,

37
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,800
the Jinyang Guild came to buy land.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,740
I have a feeling

39
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,570
that something else is going on.

40
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,660
Where do you think

41
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,860
they have gone?

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,240
I want to know that too.

43
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,980
Where

44
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,500
have they gone?

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,120
This inn is much more comfortable

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,220

Young Master.

48
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,500
To avoid suspicion,

49
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,350
we've been staying here for a few days.

52
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,710
to tell her about it?

53
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,160
I know her.

54
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,770
Anything against the interests

55
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,500
of her family and the villagers

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,580
will be opposed

57
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,270
by her.

58
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,790
Let's focus on the big picture

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,390
and solve the problem first.

60
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,630
Also,

61
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,830
don't mention this to Ye'er.

62
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,750
How are the land purchases

63
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,630
progressing?

64
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,880
I've asked

65
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,470
Black Tiger Fortress for help.

66
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,030
In the region Wu Zhonglian marked,

67
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,760
we've bought lots of villages.

68
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,760
However,

69
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,790
the notice was posted in Shisanli Camp

70
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,790
not long ago

71
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,820
and the progress is slow.

72
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,350
Even if we don't buy the land there,

73
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,470
Wu Zhonglian will find a way

74
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,270
to acquire it.

75
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,110
If Wu Zhonglian hurts the villagers

76
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,240
during the process,

77
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,130
things will be out of control.

78
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,159
Once the mission is completed,

79
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,560
the land will be returned

80
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
to the villagers.

81
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,870
So let's just move on with the acquisition.

82
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,840
Okay. I'll go back to my room.

83
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
Call me if you need anything.

84
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,630
Butler.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,760
Look at you,

86
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,140
so clumsy.

87
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,660
-I don't even know what to say.
-Butler.

88
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,440
It's only been a few days.

89
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,390
Are you here to deliver ingredients again?

90
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,050
Leafy vegetables go bad fast,

91
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,630
so I've brought fresh ones.

92
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,770
It's cold now.

93
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,140
I've also brought

94
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,720
signature dishes of One Fresh Move

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
for you to try.

96
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,830
Well,

97
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,000
it's

98
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,320
working hours.

99
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,720
It's inappropriate.

100
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,350
It's alright.

101
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,040
Come on.

102
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,770
Look.

103
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,880
They're all our signature dishes.

104
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,030
They look delicious.

105
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,580
Eat up.

106
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,010
Zhangzi.

107
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,290
Put the vegetables in the kitchen.

108
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:51,730
Okay.

109
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,710
Go, go.

110
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,990
You must be very busy.

111
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,520
You have to take care of

112
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,080
everything in the mansion.

113
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,180
I'll bring you several dishes

114
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,810
every time I come to deliver ingredients.

115
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,670
That would be great.

116
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,380
Thank you for being so generous, Master Lian.

117
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,590
You're welcome.

118
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,710
This is great.

119
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,350
Oh, no.

120
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,250
What's wrong?

121
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,100
I've wrapped it with felt

122
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,520
but it still got cold.

123
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
Did it?

124
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,050
Butler.

125
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,060
Can I use your kitchen?

126
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,840
Malatang only tastes good when it's hot.

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
No problem.

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,400
Master Lian, you're so considerate.

129
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,590
Knock yourself out.

130
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,390
It's that way.

131
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,560
This is the food the chef just made.

132
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,960
Send it to the new concubine.

133
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,030
She's still locked up?

134
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,830
Don't be nosy.

135
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,910
Lock the door when you leave.

136
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,440
Okay.

137
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:12,950
Go.

138
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,670
Xiu'er.

139
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,909
Lian Xiu'er!

140
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,680
Who's it?

141
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,630
It's me.

142
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,700
Man'er?

143
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,620
What are you doing here?

144
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,780
You don't want me to be here?

145
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,710
I'll leave then.

146
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,670
Wait.

147
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,990
Man'er, don't go.

148
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,690
You have no idea

149
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,990
what I've been put through.

150
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,190
Stop crying.

151
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,500
Keep your voice down.

152
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,690
I sneaked in.

153
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,950
If you keep crying,

154
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,280
someone will notice us.

155
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,780
I should've listened to you.

156
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,590
I shouldn't have believed what Shouren said.

157
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,650
Look at me now,

158
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,650
locked up here by Liu Fugui

159
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,990
like an animal.

160
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,350
Did he hurt you?

161
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,500
He hit me.

162
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,290
What a jerk.

163
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,230
Man'er.

164
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,140
Can you help me out?

165
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,960
I don't want to stay here anymore.

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,750
I don't want to be his concubine anymore.

167
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,950
I want to go home.

168
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,770
I know.

169
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,710
Don't worry.

170
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,800
There are too many maids and guards in the Liu Mansion.

171
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,200
I can't

172
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,490
get you out of here now.

173
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,510
Even if I can,

174
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,430
Liu Fugui won't be easy on us

175
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,890
when he finds out about it.

176
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,200
It's not easy to get you out.

177
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,990
But don't worry.

178
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,850
After I go back,

179
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,710
I'll find a way to get you out as soon as possible.

180
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,350
Okay.

181
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,770
Does my parents know

182
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,830
I'm locked up here?

183
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,180
I'm afraid if they know,

184
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,870
they'll come to kick up a fuss.

185
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,730
It'll make things harder for you.

186
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,030
So I didn't tell them.

187
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,470
Man'er.

188
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,350
When I was at home,

189
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
I was always mean to you.

190
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,870
I didn't expect you

191
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,060
to help me out at this time.

192
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,000
By the way,

193
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,510
Liu Fugui said we lost our house.

194
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,640
What does that mean?

195
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,080
Has something happened?

196
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,310
No.

197
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,050
Everything is fine.

198
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,910
He lied to you.

199
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,350
That's good.

200
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,320
I have to go.

201
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,620
Remember what I said.

202
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,510
Wait for me.

203
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,360
[Land Deeds]

204
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,230
It's been so long

205
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,030
yet these are all the deeds you got.

206
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,260
Some residents are stubborn.

207
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,430
They refused to sell their land.

208
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,240
I don't want to hear that.

209
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,640
Just tell me

210
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,220
when you can get that land.

211
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,400
Please give me a few more days.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,230
The Jinyang Guild

213
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,370
only needs capable people.

214
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,240
Back then, I left this matter to you

215
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,780
because I believed you were competent

216
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,290
and could do a great job.

217
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,860
Shen.

218
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
You'd better

219
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
be hands-on.

220
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,340
Master Wu.

221
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,980
Give me three more days.

222
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,530
Within three days,

223
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,110
I'll definitely get that land

224
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,870
for you.

225
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Keep an eye on him.

226
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,390
Yes.

227
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,500
He's failed his task.

228
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,750
Why do you keep wasting time on him?

229
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,830
How about I take several men

230
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,990
to get the land?

231
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,630
Since he wants to prove himself,

232
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,800
we don't need

233
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,110
to get our hands dirty.

234
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,140
You sent someone to keep an eye on him.

235
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,370
Is it because you don't trust him?

236
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,220
He's new here.

237
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,920
If we get something on him,

238
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,480
we can hold him in the palms of our hands.

239
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,470
You always think ahead, Master Wu.

240
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,230
Listen up.

241
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,800
Take out

242
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,760
your land deeds.

243
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,350
Don't force us to get rough with you.

244
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,160
Stop!

245
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,620
No!

246
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,640
Will you sell it or not?

247
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,790
Out of the question!

248
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,710
Out of the question!

249
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,120
No!

250
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,770
Will you sell it or not?

251
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,830
What are you doing?

252
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,860
Stay back!

253
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,920
You want to do this the hard way?

254
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,320
You…

255
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,860
Fine.

256
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,550
What are you going to do?

257
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,790
If you don't sign the contract…

258
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,710
No!

259
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,290
I'll burn your house down!

260
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,470
The price we offer

261
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,300
is high enough.

262
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,190
I can sell it to you,

263
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,440
but

264
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,830
the price...

265
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,430
Sign it now!

266
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,280
Okay.

267
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,350
Will you sign it or not?

268
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,360
Will you sign it or not?

269
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,620
Will you sign it or not?

270
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,390
Sign it now.

271
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,590
Sign it.

272
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,060
You robbers!

273
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,310
Come at me if you dare!

274
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,390
Come at me!

275
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,470
Did you have to break things?

276
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,830
Mom.

277
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
Mom.

278
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,710
Chunzhu.

279
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,990
Chunzhu!

280
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,800
Three.

281
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,120
There's a child.

282
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,990
We'll be easy

283
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,010
on you today.

284
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,840
If you don't sign it the next time we come,

285
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,300
I'll burn your house down.

286
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,360
I won't sell it.

287
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,350
No matter how much you pay me,

288
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,400
I will not sell it.

289
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,930
Get out. Get out.

290
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,350
-Get out! Get out!
-Old man.

291
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,310
We're now

292
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,350
paying you serious money

293
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,740
for your land.

294
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,080
We'll not ask so nicely next time.

295
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,120
What are you going to do?

296
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
Rob me of my land?

297
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,950
Listen.

298
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,980
This land was passed down

299
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,830
from my ancestors.

300
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,710
I won't sell it no matter how much you pay me.

301
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,110
I'd rather die than sell it to you!

302
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,370
You must sell it.

303
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,350
Get out.

304
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,240
Get out.

305
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,360
Get out!

306
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,420
Get out!

307
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,720
You old sod!

308
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:30,990
How dare you hurt my father!

309
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,230
Get out of here!

310
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,760
Go away!

311
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,590
Listen.

312
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,590
You have to

313
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,800
sell us your land.

314
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,960
I advise you…

315
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,590
Get lost!

316
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,150
Wait and see, old man.

317
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,610
Get lost!

318
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,800
Wait and see.

319
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,030
Are you hurt?

320
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,430
Dad.

321
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,350
It's okay. I just threw out my back.

322
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,340
I'm fine.

323
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,050
You're old.

324
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Why did you fight them?

325
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,450
I don't believe

326
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,050
they have the guts to kill me!

327
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,910
Are you okay?

328
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm fine.

329
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,960
Those thugs

330
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,830
will come back again.

331
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,410
They're serious about getting the land.

332
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,100
What should we do?

333
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,520
We won't sell our land.

334
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,440
Leave now.

335
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:13,950
Leave.

336
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,770
Leave, leave.

337
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,680
Leave now.

338
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,320
Leave.

339
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,510
Leave, leave.

340
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,580
Folks!

341
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,540
Brothers and sisters!

342
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,100
Let's talk it out,

343
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,780
shall we?

344
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,190
We have nothing to say to you.

345
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,070
Get away!

346
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,000
If you

347
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,590
are not satisfied with the price,

348
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,350
we can sit down

349
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,750
and talk about it calmly.

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,260
Don't be so emotional.

351
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,800
Shen.

352
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,780
You're almost

353
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,770
a villager here.

354
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,830
I told you we won't sell the land.

355
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,190
Yeah.

356
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,650
Why do you have to force us?

357
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,030
You even bullied us

358
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,280
with outsiders.

359
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,710
Yeah.

360
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,430
Get lost.

361
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,750
Get lost. Get lost.

362
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,310
Get lost!

363
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,100
Enough.

364
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,060
I advise you to take the money

365
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,590
and leave with your family immediately.

366
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,140
That's the only way you can be safe.

367
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,830
He's threatening us.

368
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,760
What do you mean?

369
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,350
If I don't sell the land,

370
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,400
are you going to kill me

371
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,040
or what?

372
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,410
We're not afraid of you.

373
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,830
You were wrong about you.

374
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,510
Yeah. Get away!

375
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,630
Get away!

376
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,790
Chunzhu's father.

377
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,070
Get away!

378
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,800
The land,

379
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,840
will you sell it or not?

380
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080
No.

381
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,600
No!

382
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,390
No!

383
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,190
We won't sell our land!

384
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,350
No! Get lost.

385
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,470
Get lost.

386
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,840
-Get lost!
-Calm down.

387
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,990
Get lost!

388
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,570
I don't want to hurt you.

389
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,910
Think about it carefully.

390
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,880
Shen Nuo.

391
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,930
I can't move.

392
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,790
Man'er.

393
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,130
Man'er, help us.

394
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,540
Man'er, help us.

395
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,910
Put down the machete.

396
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,920
Don't stop me.

397
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,670
I'll kill him!

398
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,510
Don't stop me!

399
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,230
Chunzhu's grandfather, no!

400
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,190
Chunzhu's grandfather.

401
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,910
Dad!

402
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,630
They killed someone!

403
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,829
They killed someone!

404
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,650
They killed someone!

405
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,060
Dad!

406
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,260
Dad!

407
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,230
They killed someone!

408
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,099
Dad!

409
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,770
Dad!

410
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,470
Dad.

411
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,260
Dad!

412
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,820
Go home.

413
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,070
Stop pulling me.

414
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,750
Dad! Dad!

415
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,790
Why did you pull me back?

416
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,820
It's chaos out there.

417
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,140
It's too dangerous.

418
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,470
You should stay at home.

419
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:45,930
No.

420
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,810
I need to ask him about it.

421
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,990
Didn't you see

422
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,360
the machete in his hand?

423
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,520
What is there to ask?

424
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,250
What's wrong?

425
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,480
What happened?

426
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
You know what?

427
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,860
Shen Nuo

428
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,200
is in cahoots

429
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,690
with those land grabbers.

430
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,300
What?

431
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,530
Shen Nuo?

432
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,310
How's that possible?

433
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,330
Just now,

434
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,060
he and Thirteen

435
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,450
came with men of the Jinyang Guild.

436
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,030
Right at the entrance of the village,

437
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,700
he held a machete

438
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,630
to the throat of Chunzhu's father.

439
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,750
He's forcing us to sell our land.

440
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,070
Man'er and I saw it with our own eyes.

441
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,120
Many villagers

442
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,240
saw it too.

443
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,700
Thirteen came as well?

444
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,710
He was holding a machete?

445
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,150
Whether there's a misunderstanding

446
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,410
or he's really a bully,

447
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,310
I have to go to him

448
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,840
and ask for an explanation.

449
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,870
Man'er. Man'er.

450
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,080
Thirteen.

451
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,780
Where have you been these days?

452
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,690
Have you been buying land?

453
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Where is Shen Nuo?

454
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,560
Say something.

455
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,200
Are you involved

456
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,770
in the land grab?

457
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,930
Thirteen, answer her!

458
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,790
It is what it looks like.

459
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,160
Then why did you come here?

460
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,200
Ye'er. Ye'er.

461
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,470
Let Thirteen finish.

462
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,580
Miss Man'er.

463
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,610
Shen Nuo has a message for you.

464
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
No one

465
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,760
can stop him from buying land.

466
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,790
No one?

467
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,890
Not even his family?

468
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,240
You…

469
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,900
Don't you know how important

470
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,100
the land is to the villagers?

471
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,440
Without our land,

472
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,510
we'll be homeless.

473
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,160
How are we going to survive?

474
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,180
Yeah.

475
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,640
Thirteen.

476
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,190
Why did you

477
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,870
suddenly throw your lot

478
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,050
with those people?

479
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,940
You must have a reason, right?

480
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,680
You can tell us about it

481
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,760
and we can figure something out together.

482
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,360
Don't do such a stupid thing.

483
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,580
What else did he say?

484
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,270
He said

485
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,060
since he's working for the Jinyang Guild,

486
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,320
he can't fail his task.

487
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,060
You know how the Jinyang Guild does things.

488
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,860
They

489
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,510
are merciless.

490
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,470
He advises you

491
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,320
to stay out of trouble.

492
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,740
Just sign the contract,

493
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,150
sell the land,

494
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,990
and leave here

495
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,540
to stay safe.

496
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,530
Thirteen.

497
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,510
All this time,

498
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,140
haven't we

499
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,550
treated you well enough?

500
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
How could you

501
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,000
help others against us?

502
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,810
Don't you have a heart?

503
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,390
Enough.

504
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,990
Leave.

505
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,100
Get lost!

506
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,790
If we had known this would happen,

507
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,590
we shouldn't have taken them in!

508
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,320
How could they do this?

509
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,920
The guy who pulled out a machete

510
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,630
was really Shen.

511
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,450
No.

512
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,980
It's been a tough day for Chunzhu's family.

513
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,920
I have to check on them.

514
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,170
Stop worrying about them.

515
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,600
When I think of

516
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,090
those thugs the other day,

517
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,690
I feel like my heart

518
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,790
is in my throat.

519
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,160
If you don't sell

520
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,370
the land to them,

521
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,230
they'll put their machetes

522
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,520
to your neck.

523
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,850
He's turned against us.

524
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,690
What an ingrate

525
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,520
Man'er has taken in.

526
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,270
Exactly.

527
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,010
Dad.

528
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,210
You have no idea.

529
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,250
Mom.

530
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,170
Shouyi.

531
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,960
The guy called Thirteen or something

532
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,000
was so arrogant.

533
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,620
He

534
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,090
stood there and said

535
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,140
that no one can stop them from buying the land.

536
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,280
He also said

537
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,550
the Jinyang Guild never fails

538
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,750
to get what they want.

539
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
When they pull their swords,

540
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,530
blood will be drawn.

541
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,260
When they fight, they're like…

542
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,170
He, is it true?

543
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,470
It's almost like that.

544
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,410
Shen used to be part of our family.

545
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,540
What will others think of us?

546
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,230
How are we going to

547
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,520
face the villagers in the future?

548
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,100
Right.

549
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,940
Dear.

550
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,700
You have to explain to the villagers.

551
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,690
Tell them

552
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,950
that we knew nothing about it.

553
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,910
We knew nothing about it.

554
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,200
We were fooled by them.

555
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,050
We were fooled.

556
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,010
The two of them

557
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,010
have nothing to do with us now.

558
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,070
They never had anything to do with us.

559
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,750
Enough.

560
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,650
At this time,

561
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,020
staying safe is the most important.

562
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,120
In my opinion,

563
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,270
as long as they offer us enough money,

564
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,480
we can sell the land

565
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,230
and go buy a big house in town.

566
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,190
A big house.

567
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,480
We don't have to work so hard anymore.

568
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,880
Isn't that great?

569
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,640
Yes.

570
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,840
Mom has a point.

571
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,490
By moving into town,

572
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,760
we can stay safe

573
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,070
and avoid gossip.

574
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,040
That would be great.

575
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,300
But what if they don't give us enough money?

576
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,050
Then…

577
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,640
Then we…

578
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
The guy you took in

579
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,770
turned out to be a scoundrel.

580
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,800
I brought Shen Nuo back.

581
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,050
So,

582
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,010
I owe you all.

583
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:35,940
Grandpa.

584
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,180
If you've decided to sell the land,

585
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,050
I'll try to find a place

586
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,270
for us to settle down.

587
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,220
Man'er.

588
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,900
Are you here

589
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,410
to persuade me to sell the land too?

590
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,000
Grandpa.

591
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,650
I thought about it.

592
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,580
Those people

593
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,990
will stop at nothing to get the land.

594
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,710
If we don't sell it to them,

595
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,510
in the future,

596
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,980
we'll have to live in fear.

597
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,250
Maybe

598
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,910
our lives will be in danger.

599
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,990
-What?
-My goodness.

600
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,280
Our lives will be in danger?

601
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,960
Dad.

602
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,440
That's so scary.

603
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,250
Let's sell the land.

604
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,610
Stop it!

605
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,070
Even if it costs me my life,

606
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,990
I won't sell it.

607
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,470
Dad.

608
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,720
I can't sell it.

609
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,630
Dad.

610
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,710
-Shouyi.
-Dad. Dad.

611
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,510
Uncle Shouyi.

612
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,230
Give Grandpa some space.

613
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,520
You fool!

614
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,260
Why did you quarrel with them?

615
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,200
Your father

616
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,830
saw you

617
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,280
fighting with Shen,

618
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,850
so he rushed over to protect you.

619
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,360
Or he wouldn't be in danger now.

620
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,710
If anything happens to him,

621
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,440
how are we gonna move on with our lives?

622
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,760
Why?

623
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,230
Why did you quarrel with them?

624
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,280
Why? Why?

625
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,370
-Why did you quarrel with them?
-Mom.

626
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,580
Mom.

627
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,860
Sorry.

628
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,070
Chunzhu's grandma.

629
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,990
I shouldn't have started it.

630
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,680
Enough.

631
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,480
It's enough.

632
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,440
Listen.

633
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,520
You can't blame it

634
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,750
on Chunzhu's father.

635
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,060
Those thugs

636
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,270
pushed you too hard.

637
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,720
I wasn't in the village then.

638
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,560
If I were,

639
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,470
I would've fought with them too.

640
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:40,960
Dad.

641
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,620
Dad.

642
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,710
Dear.

643
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,530
Dad.

644
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
-Dad.
-Dear.

645
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,160
You're finally awake.

646
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,530
Chunzhu's father.

647
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,460
Chunzhu's grandmother.

648
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,540
Now that he's awake,

649
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
he's in the clear.

650
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,330
Just make sure

651
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,570
he doesn't get too emotional again.

652
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,580
Okay.

653
00:25:59,150 --> 00:25:59,950
Thank you, Physician Wang.

654
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,680
Thank you.

655
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,310
Thank you.

656
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,200
He's fine.

657
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,500
We can be relieved now.

658
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,880
Youheng, let's go.

659
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,740
He needs rest.

660
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,510
Okay.

661
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,990
We're leaving then.

662
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,790
Thank you.

663
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,060
Dad.

664
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,030
You go on home.

665
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,860
It's late.

666
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,010
Where are you going?

667
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,750
I'm going to find Shen Nuo.

668
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,210
That guy colluded with others

669
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,100
and bullied us.

670
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,910
Why do you want to meet him?

671
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,450
I just don't understand.

672
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,590
Why did he

673
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,960
suddenly

674
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,080
join the Jinyang Guild?

675
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,890
It doesn't matter.

676
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,180
The Jinyang Guild

677
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,790
is rich and powerful.

678
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,560
No one can afford to mess with them.

679
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,200
If you

680
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,000
go to Shen

681
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,610
and argue with him,

682
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,220
you may get into trouble.

683
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,130
Don't look for trouble.

684
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,250
Let's go.

685
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,610
Dad.

686
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,760
Let's go home, okay?

687
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,960
Lian Fang.

688
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,870
Hey, Youheng.

689
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,440
Hey, Laojin.

690
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,720
Youheng

691
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,630
has treated Chunzhu's grandpa.

692
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,470
He's awake now.

693
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,430
That's great.

694
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,230
Since there's nothing else,

695
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,240
we'll leave now.

696
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,220
Okay.

697
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,870
Take care.

698
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,550
I'm old

699
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,340
and weak.

700
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,870
Don't say that.

701
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,230
Lian Fang.

702
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,730
You didn't see it.

703
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,990
The guy

704
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,140
called Shen who lived with you

705
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,520
pulled out a machete

706
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,880
and held it

707
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,370
to my son's throat.

708
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,200
We can't

709
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,490
stay in this village anymore.

710
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,480
Who knows what they will do

711
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,910
when they come again?

712
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,870
Dear.

713
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,410
Look at us.

714
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,650
We're both very old.

715
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,310
There should be nothing

716
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,860
that we can't get over

717
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,710
and let go.

718
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,040
For things we can't change,

719
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,220
we should just accept them.

720
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,560
If you're gone,

721
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,630
what's the point

722
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,570
of us

723
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,380
keeping the land?

724
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,590
Our grandson is still young.

725
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,920
Chunzhu's father

726
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,390
is as hot-tempered

727
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,270
as you.

728
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,200
If you two

729
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,440
lose your lives

730
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,990
in conflicts with those people,

731
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,670
leaving two widows

732
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,260
and a kid behind,

733
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,230
how are we supposed to live?

734
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,600
We

735
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,290
are just ordinary people.

736
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
All we want

737
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,650
is just a peaceful life

738
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,750
with our family.

739
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,890
Lian Fang.

740
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,380
Say something.

741
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,060
Say something.

742
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,640
She's right.

743
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,030
All we want is just a quiet life

744
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,660
with our family.

745
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,480
If you're gone,

746
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,670
what's the point

747
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,310
of keeping the land?

748
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,110
Is anyone following you?

749
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,010
Come in.

750
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Well, well, well.

751
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,440
You found yourself

752
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,750
a comfortable place to stay

753
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,880
without telling me.

754
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,390
If I were still living with your family,

755
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,160
I would've been beaten to death

756
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,930
by your family

757
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,990
and the villagers.

758
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,510
It's good that you know

759
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,840
everyone hates you now.

760
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,210
If Wu Zhonglian hadn't forced you to take action,

761
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,940
when would you tell me about it?

762
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,080
Sorry.

763
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,170
It was for the best

764
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,550
to keep you in the dark.

765
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,280
I had to

766
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,680
be convincing.

767
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,250
If it weren't for you,

768
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,010
the villagers wouldn't have believed

769
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,340
that I could be so cruel.

770
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,220
If Wu Zhonglian

771
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,630
notices anything wrong,

772
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,830
he'll get suspicious

773
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,680
and won't let me

774
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,060
transport the ore.

775
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,870
All our efforts

776
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,770
will be in vain.

777
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,460
Thirteen was good at acting too.

778
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:10,790
Ye'er

779
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,040
hates his guts now.

780
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,350
By the way,

781
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,760
why is Wu Zhonglian

782
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,960
so determined

783
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,790
to get the land of Shisanli Camp?

784
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,260
Wu Zhonglian

785
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,920
could only have gone to such lengths

786
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,640
for mining

787
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,930
and transporting ore.

788
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,180
So Thirteen and I

789
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,450
guess that maybe

790
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,490
the transportation route

791
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,260
will pass through that area.

792
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,200
That's why he wants to evict the villagers

793
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,710
to ensure nothing goes wrong

794
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,310
during the transportation.

795
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,490
For his personal gain,

796
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,070
he's making so many people

797
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,900
homeless.

798
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,880
Where is the mine?

799
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
I don't know yet.

800
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,180
Only by taking on the transporting work

801
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,710
can I find where the mine is.

802
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,590
That's the only way

803
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,600
to find the evidence of Marquis Ningyuan's treason.

804
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,490
I really wish

805
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,360
to put an end to this whole thing.

806
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,880
I really wish

807
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,550
you could complete your mission soon

808
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,050
and bring those villains

809
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,900
to justice.

810
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,430
It's late.

811
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,410
I'm going back.

812
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,160
By the way,

813
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,670
have you figured out

814
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,240
how to help Lian Xiu'er?

815
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,670
You've got enough

816
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,550
on your plate.

817
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,720
So stop worrying about

818
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,550
someone else.

819
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,400
In my situation,

820
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,730
I can't help her myself,

821
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,620
but I can tell you my plan.

822
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,250
Maybe now

823
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,180
is the perfect time to carry this plan out.

824
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,480
What plan?

825
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,220
It can not only save Xiu'er

826
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,070
but also get rid of Liu Fugui.

827
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,270
If it works,

828
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,000
I'll be able to take a big step

829
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,350
toward my goal as well.

830
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,550
Wu Zhonglian's dirty deeds

831
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
will be revealed.

832
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,050
He really did that?

833
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,550
He pulled out a machete

834
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,230
and put it to that man's neck.

835
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,970
The villagers were so terrified

836
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,270
that their faces turned pale.

837
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,940
Even that girl from the Lian family

838
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,620
was pulled away by her dad.

839
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,840
Now the villagers there

840
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,740
hate him as much as they fear him.

841
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,420
Shen Nuo

842
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,000
looks meek and mild

843
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,250
but is actually ruthless.

844
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,670
He stops at nothing to achieve his ends.

845
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,890
He's a capable man.

846
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,350
Youheng.

847
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,960
What are you doing here?

848
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,830
I'm waiting for you…

849
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,139
And Shen Nuo.

850
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,770
Just now,

851
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,960
I went to your house to look for you.

852
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,790
Your parents

853
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,150
seemed annoyed

854
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,000
when I mentioned him.

855
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,409
Yeah.

856
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,980
Shen Nuo

857
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,000
is helping the Jinyang Guild buy land.

858
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,420
My parents are furious.

859
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,420
They said

860
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,550
they don't want anything to do

861
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,550
with him anymore.

862
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,540
Are you here just to ask about that?

863
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,400
I still remember

864
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,790
the first time

865
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,989
you took me to see him.

866
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,480
At that time,

867
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,969
he was poisoned by constables.

868
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,020
I thought

869
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,210
he must be a dangerous person.

870
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,199
But later,

871
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,719
we fought against the Sun family together,

872
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,580
helped you split from the family,

873
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,980
started a business,

874
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,590
and went to Black Tiger Fortress

875
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,790
to help those refugees.

876
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,920
All this time,

877
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,180
we've been through

878
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,040
a lot together.

879
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,440
I know

880
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,870
what kind of person he is.

881
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,740
He would in no way

882
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,210
hurt those around him

883
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,150
for his own benefit.

884
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,910
Maybe

885
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,580
he has his reasons.

886
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,090
I'm surprised.

887
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,440
When Shen Nuo is hated by everyone,

888
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,120
you're the one who still believes in him.

889
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,120
Yeah.

890
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,410
I believe he's a good man.

891
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,310
Otherwise,

892
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,790
I wouldn't have given up so easily.

893
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,360
If you really think he's a good man,

894
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,620
keep believing in him.

895
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,130
Man'er, let me take your bag.

896
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,260
Go help Mom.

897
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,880
Go help your grandma.

898
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,470
Grandma.

899
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,950
Let me help you with these.

900
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,990
Be careful.

901
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,550
[Shisanli Camp]

902
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,630
This way.

903
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,930
Here we are.

904
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,470
Here.

905
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,270
The two rooms in the east are big.

906
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:03,990
Grandpa, Grandma.

907
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,150
Uncle Shouyi, Aunt He.

908
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,210
You'll live there.

909
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,390
The north room is smaller.

910
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,550
Dad, Mom.

911
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,700
Ye and I will live in the same room.

912
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,430
Man'er.

913
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,430
Go to your restaurant.

914
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,210
We'll take care of things here.

915
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:16,620
Yeah.

916
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,840
Your dad and I will take care of things here.

917
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,440
It's okay.

918
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,310
The restaurant will be closed for a few days.

919
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,710
Let's settle down first.

920
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,520
Okay.

921
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,180
You can use a few days

922
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,090
of rest.

923
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,990
You've never had a day off

924
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,470
since the restaurant opened.

925
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,600
It's all your fault.

926
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,600
You should've asked for more

927
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,860
when you sold the land.

928
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,760
This yard is not as big

929
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,430
as the one we had.

930
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,810
Stop complaining.

931
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,350
Be satisfied.

932
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,990
Some villagers

933
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,800
don't even have a roof over their heads.

934
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,140
Let's unpack and have a good rest.

935
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,560
Zhang.

936
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,940
Can we switch rooms?

937
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,870
I snore when I sleep.

938
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,800
I don't want to disturb Dad and Mom.

939
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,430
Okay.

940
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,690
Let's go, Seven.

941
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,720
Come in with me.

942
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:10,310
Shouyi.

943
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,100
-Take it.
-Shouyi, come here.

944
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,350
That room.

945
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:14,730
That room?

946
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,030
Why did you switch rooms?

947
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,480
Never mind. Come with me.

948
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,650
Let's go in.

949
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,530
Careful, Shouxin.

950
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,470
Ye'er.

951
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,970
Are you unpacking?

952
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,430
Let me help you.

953
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,470
Here.

954
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,910
Let me do this.

955
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,790
I switched rooms with your aunt.

956
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,110
The east room is big.

957
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,270
Your uncle and aunt will live there.

958
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,910
Our rooms are close this way.

959
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,830
I'll live right across from you.

960
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,430
Call me if you need anything.

961
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,870
Aunt He.

962
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,390
We've walked for so long.

963
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,170
Why don't you go have a rest?

964
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,650
Okay.

965
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,610
Then I'll leave you to unpack.

966
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,170
I'm leaving.

967
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,930
Your mother

968
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,750
has been looking for a chance

969
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,810
to make up with you.

970
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,830
What do you think?

971
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,750
Are you going to forgive her?

972
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,640
They sold me.

973
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,470
They're not my parents anymore.

974
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,350
Your mother is my mother.

975
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,260
What?

976
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,150
You regret buying me?

977
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,830
Are you going to send me back?

978
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,700
Why would I?

979
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,930
Is this for Thirteen?

980
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,640
Don't mention him.

981
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,430
Ye'er.

982
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:30,950
Sometimes,

983
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,180
it takes time to see things clearly.

984
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,470
What do you mean?

985
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,390
I mean

986
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,000
it takes time

987
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,190
to get to know a person.

988
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:47,510
Man'er.

989
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,360
Come out.

990
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,220
Coming.

991
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,210
Don't overthink it.

992
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,590
What's the matter, Grandma?

993
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,500
Lead the way.

994
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,930
Let's go to the Liu Mansion to visit Xiu'er.

995
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,150
What are you waiting for?

996
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,270
Hurry up!

997
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,230
