1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,867
Just say what you want to say.

2
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,667
Are you still mad?

3
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,367
I've explained it to Shao Jie already,

4
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,167
and I've also apologized to you.

5
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,400
Don't be mad, please.

6
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,067
Please, don't be mad.

7
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,433
Clearly, it's the same person,

8
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
how come the personalities are so different?

9
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,300
What?

10
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,033
Missing XiaoYu already?

11
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I am not as easy-going as him.

12
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:29,767
Aren't you and XiaoYu

13
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,700
the same person?

14
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:32,767
Hey,

15
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:34,667
are you coming home with me or not?

16
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,433
I just spoke to my grandpa on the phone,

17
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,300
you probably heard it all.

18
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:40,233
He asked me

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,067
if I am seeing someone.

20
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:43,700
I said, yes I am.

21
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,167
I'm not seeing you.

22
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,867
I promised I would go back next week.

23
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,133
Don't you try to get rid of me.

24
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,500
You and I,

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,833
we are pretty much like husband and wife now.

26
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:58,633
Ha!

27
00:01:58,733 --> 00:01:59,667
Gross.

28
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,000
It's XiaoYu who likes you,

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,467
it has nothing to do with me.

30
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,267
Please?

31
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:09,967
Go away and don't touch me.

32
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,767
Go and sleep in the kichen.

33
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,667
Hey!

34
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:26,767
Please!

35
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,400
Please!

36
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,200
Pretty please, come visit grandpa with me.

37
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,633
- Ok?
- Ah!

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,667
Ah!

39
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,400
If you are so awake,

40
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,100
go and book train tickets for two.

41
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,267
Ok!

42
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:06,533
Done!

43
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:07,467
Night, night.

44
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,600
Don't touch me!

45
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,133
It's frezzing! Good night.

(Innocent The Series)

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,600
(Episode 2: Untie the Knots)

48
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,167
Let's go!

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,567
You don't have to check, I know the way.

50
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,167
Hey, slow down!

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,400
Do you know which way to go?

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,633
I thoguht you didn't want to come?

53
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:16,833
Instead, woke me up early in the morning

54
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,767
and got all these gifts.

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,767
Just...

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,667
Wait for me!

57
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,033
I know what you are worried about.

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,667
My grandpa looks very serious

59
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:33,433
but he is a funny guy!

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,333
Don't be nervous!

61
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,900
Who is nervous?

62
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:40,800
Hey, Xiao Yu.

63
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,700
It's on the other side.

64
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:05,867
In the name of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord,

65
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,367
I command you!

66
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,167
Grandpa, I'm back!

67
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,267
Welcome back!

68
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,167
Yes.

69
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,767
Grandpa, what are you doing?

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,267
Exorcism.

71
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,700
Exorcism?

72
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
For the dog?

73
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:28,600
Hello.

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,367
Recalling his frightened soul.

75
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,233
Ready?

76
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,233
Ok, thank you.

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,567
No problem.

78
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:36,167
Thank you.

79
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,167
Take care.

80
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,667
Thanks.

81
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,333
This is...?

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,367
Grandpa, allow me to introduce you,

83
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,167
the person I was telling you
about on the phone.

84
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,333
He is the one I am seeing right now.

85
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:02,933
Hey, grandpa, what are you doing?

86
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:03,900
I don't need an exorcism.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't need it.

88
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,433
Do you need it as well?

89
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,567
- I don't need it, thanks.
- He doesn't need it, either.

90
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,067
Grandpa, here.

91
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,400
This is for you,

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,800
and clothes, too.

93
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,033
Come, come inside,

94
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,533
have some rest.

95
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,167
Grandpa.

96
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,067
You haven't been back for a while,

97
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,000
come and worship your grandma
with some incense stick first.

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,333
Ok.

99
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,500
Where is he?

100
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,600
He is inside, I'll go get him.

101
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,867
Wait, wait.

102
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,867
Let me ask you,

103
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,467
what's going on?

104
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,567
You left Mr. Yang's granddaughter
because of him?

105
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,033
So you are the reason
why Shao Jie was around?

106
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,267
I've already told you.

107
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,400
Whatever will happen,
will happen with this type of things.

108
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,267
Whatever will happen?

109
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,967
To the point you got me a son-in-law?

110
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,900
Grandpa, it's not like that.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,367
Love is something

112
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,467
that can't be forced.

113
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,667
If you have feelings for someone,

114
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,567
gender shouldn't be an issue.

115
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,700
You are such a player

116
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,800
since you were little,

117
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:45,900
very adventurous,

118
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,767
and casual dating girls all the time.

119
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,567
I've always worried

120
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,267
that you would knock someone up.

121
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:53,933
But now,

122
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,767
instead of girls,

123
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,533
you also mess with boys?

124
00:07:59,067 --> 00:07:59,800
Then,

125
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,933
you don't need to worry

126
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,133
about me knocking someone up anymore.

127
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,867
And, also

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,333
we are not just messing around,

129
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,267
he and I, we are in love.

130
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,067
Stop saying all this nonesense.

131
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,800
You think I don't know

132
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,600
what young people like to do nowadays?

133
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,133
You all like...

134
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,667
like...

135
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,467
like to be different.

136
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,200
However,

137
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
since your grandma

138
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,600
and your parents passed away,

139
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,067
life...

140
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:54,333
The way I raised you

141
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,733
was never about you being successful,

142
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:58,933
or repay me anything.

143
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,800
I just want you

144
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,067
to be happy.

145
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,000
This is the most important thing.

146
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,867
Yes, grandpa.

147
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,367
I know.

148
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,067
Thank you, grandpa.

149
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,733
You slept here

150
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,633
when you were little?

151
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,500
Yes.

152
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,067
When I was little,

153
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:40,767
I was afraid of the dark

154
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,433
and I couldn't sleep alone.

155
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,167
My grandpa, always came and sleep with me.

156
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,400
When I was in first grade,

157
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,733
my parents died in a car crash.

158
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,833
I was raised by my grandparents.

159
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,333
But when I entered first year of high school,

160
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,433
my grandma died.

161
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,633
So, grandpa

162
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,333
is like my father to me.

163
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,367
He is very nice to you.

164
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,167
Back in elementary,

165
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,733
I would get teased
for not having my parents around.

166
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,867
Grandpa would get mad and rush to school

167
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,367
to be there for me.

168
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:34,433
And this is probably why

169
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,067
I hate this kind of things happening.

170
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,533
My grandpa has always been very strict with me.

171
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,267
But,

172
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,767
after grandma passed away,

173
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
he'd always tells me

174
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:52,167
do whatever makes you happy in life.

175
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Am I making you happy?

176
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,867
What do you think?

177
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,467
Doesn't look like it.

178
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,167
Then let's do some happy things.

179
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,200
Grandpa is in the next room.

180
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,200
Shame on you!

181
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,433
Meaning, if grandpa is not around

182
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,600
then happy things are on?

183
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,800
Right now... grandpa should be...

184
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,433
playing mahjong at uncle Chen's place now.

185
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,100
Come on,

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
it's been awhile.

187
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,000
Do me this favor.

188
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,267
Ah!

189
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,533
Baby, be gentle.

190
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,967
You put it there and I'll do the washing.

191
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,667
Didn't think you were so skilled.

192
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,500
Of course, I...

193
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,133
have been on my own since I was 12.

194
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,467
So,

195
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,067
this is the first time
someone else is cooking for me.

196
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,033
You are, after my grandpa,

197
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,133
the second person that I cook for.

198
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,733
Don't ask me who was the first one.

199
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,467
I don't want to know about it.

200
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,267
Hey, don't get jealous.

201
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,667
Who doesn't have a first girlfriend, right?

202
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,200
Besides, she prefers I
to take her out

203
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,633
than me cooking for her.

204
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,133
So after a while I don't cook for her anymore.

205
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,267
Hey, hey.
Enough, enough.

206
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,033
You are wasting food.

207
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,833
Okay, okay.
You are the second person

208
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:54,700
that I cook for and also the last.

209
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,033
Who believes that?

210
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,933
A sin confessed is half forgiven.

211
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,200
But, honestly,

212
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,067
it feels good

213
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,667
to be cooking for someone you love.

214
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,767
Well, I don't know about
the person who eats it, though.

215
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,600
Come, come inside.

216
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,967
Have a seat.

217
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,100
Let's eat!

218
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:53,567
Grandpa.

219
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't be shy,

220
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,467
make yourself at home.

221
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,267
Grandpa, you first.

222
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:10,867
Eat!

223
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,067
Are you...

224
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
you guys gonna get married?

225
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,000
Where are you parents?

226
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,233
We are a simple family.

227
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:49,633
Let's set a date.

228
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,467
I'll go propose the marriage to your family.

229
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,267
Grandpa, we are both guys,

230
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,467
it's an equal marriage.

231
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Nobody is asking to anybody.

232
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:02,633
Is that how it is?

233
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:05,500
Hey...

234
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:08,000
Dowry... do we need to pay a dowry?

235
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,633
Yes! Of course!

236
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,100
Whatever he wants!

237
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:13,667
Hey.

238
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,567
Don't be shy.

239
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,267
Thank you, grandpa.

240
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,700
Grandpa, have some soup.

241
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,433
Good?

242
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,133
It's been awhile since the last time
I saw Xiao Yu.

243
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,867
What?
Annoyed that I'm not as cute as him?

244
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,867
Finally, I see you getting jealous.

245
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:11,733
So cute.

246
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,367
Why would I get jealous of myself?

247
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:14,967
I'm going home.

248
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,767
Hey.

249
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,067
Hey, Xiao Yu put on some clothes, it's cold!

250
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,967
Hey, Xiao Yu!

251
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,067
What?

252
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,667
Like it?
