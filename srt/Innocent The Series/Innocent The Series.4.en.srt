00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:33,833
Hello.

2
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,500
Jun Zhe, where are you?

3
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:36,567
Do you have time right now?

4
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,267
Come over and help me find Xiao Yu, please!

5
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:40,167
I don't know.

6
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,867
I turned around and he was gone.

7
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,533
Ok, I'm near your place.

8
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:45,733
Ok, bye.

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,000
(Episode 4: Where the Heart Belongs)

11
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,033
Hey,

12
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,600
Are you... Wu Zheng's friend?

13
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,500
Cheng Yu Shi?

14
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,133
Who are you?

15
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,267
Well, I'm Wu Zheng's friend.

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,867
He is looking for you

17
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:09,433
I will take you to see him.

18
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:10,533
No.

19
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:11,133
Ah?

20
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:12,167
I don't want to.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,267
What...

22
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want to.

23
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,400
I will take you to see him!

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,800
He is right over there.

25
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:20,167
Let go of me!

26
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,767
What the hell?

27
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:22,967
Let go of me.

28
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:23,933
What?

29
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,167
I said, let go of me!

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,133
Hey!

31
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:34,700
Xiao Yu.

32
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,333
What's going on?

33
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:38,333
Xiao Yu, Xiao Yu...

34
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,200
It's all good.

35
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:41,100
Xiao Yu.

36
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:43,200
Xiao Yu.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,267
Is this how you take care of Xiao Yu?

38
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,167
Huh?

39
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,000
You think I don't know

40
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,067
that you took him to see a doctor?

41
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,567
You even walked away from him just now.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,067
You feel ashamed of Xiao Yu, right?

43
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,067
Talk to me!

44
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,667
Huh?

45
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,067
No,

46
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:11,900
I...

47
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,800
If we embarass you so much,

48
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,900
then don't come to us.

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,233
You guys are all the same,

50
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,267
you all think we are an embarassment.

51
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:30,633
No.

52
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:32,600
Go away...

53
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,467
You didn't embarrass me.

54
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,767
I just haven't figured it out
what I really want

55
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,633
after spending these days with you.

56
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,867
I got really nervous
the moment I couldn't find you.

57
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:48,133
I was looking for you and thinking,

58
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,867
this is the first time in my life

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that I have this kind of feelings
for someone.

60
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,733
I then realized,

61
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,667
Whatever the future holds,

62
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,433
I'm willing to face it with you

63
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,100
as long as I don't lose you.

64
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,267
Please give me one more chance,

65
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:15,433
ok?

66
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,067
Well,

67
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,800
you will give upsooner or later,

68
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,733
and in the end, you will leave us behind.

69
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,267
When Yu Shi was 5,

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,767
one of his dad's friends
took him to a restroom,

71
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,233
then he lost all memories.

72
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,133
Then, Noah showed up to protect him.

73
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,033
What does this mean?

74
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,200
The medical terms is
dissociative identity disorder,

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
also known as multiple personality disorder.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Noah is the protector personality.

77
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,867
Noah is 28 years old, and Yu Shi is only 5.

78
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,967
Noah never really talked about himself.

79
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,567
He only revealed that,
he left home with Yu Shi

80
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,500
when he was 12 years old.

81
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,267
The two have been living together until now.

82
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,833
Then 3 months ago,
the first time they met you,

83
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,967
it was the first time they saw
someone in color.

84
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,467
In color?

85
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,800
Um.

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,000
That's the message I've got so far.

87
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,267
It seems like everything
was black and white

88
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,367
in Noah's memory.

89
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,233
But you are the only one in color.

90
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,533
Shawn,

91
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,000
thank you for everything.

92
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:25,433
Oh, and me and Ah Jun
started a pool table business.

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Ah Jun?

94
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,300
Yes.

95
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,033
Tang Jun Zhe?

96
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:33,600
Yes.

97
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,867
I remember

98
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,533
you were the class president.

99
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,100
He was the best of PE.

100
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,067
Come and visit us when you have time.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,333
Um...

102
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,167
Maybe...

103
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,133
Thank you for everything.

104
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,000
No worries.

105
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:33,333
Do you know?

106
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,700
The first time we met,

107
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,267
it was at that very park.

108
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,533
He was pulling me

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
into the public restroom at that time.

110
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:57,433
I screamed so loud, very loud.

111
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,067
I was terrified.

112
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:11,200
I've been on my own for all these years,

113
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,100
and I thought I would never be able to

114
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,667
have someone in my life

115
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,433
until I met you.

116
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:36,867
I didn't understand why
I went back to that park

117
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,967
that day.

118
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:46,100
I saw... I saw you helping a little boy out.

119
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,400
I was thinking,

120
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,700
if...

121
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:55,933
if...

122
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,167
back then...

123
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:03,933
if it was me who you helped out,

124
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:10,900
things would be so different now.

125
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,867
I... I give Yu Shi to you.

126
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,233
Why didn't you say anything you
were in Taipei?

127
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:20,967
Yu Shwan!

128
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:23,467
You never picked up

129
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:24,733
any of my calls in the past few year.

130
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
I thought you went abroad.

131
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:29,333
Sigh.

132
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:36,933
You... how have you been?

133
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,767
It's none of your business.

134
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,000
I've already told you
it was a misunderstanding.

135
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Why don't you let me explain?

136
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,867
Why should I?

137
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,767
Who was the one that left
without saying anything?

138
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,700
What?

139
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,667
(Three years later)
You are a little bit weird today.

140
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:19,467
You think?

141
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:20,100
Yes.

142
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,467
I am just the same!

143
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,600
Why didn't you finish your dinner

144
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,900
and decided to take me out for a walk?

145
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,867
Rememeber the game we used to play?

146
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,533
What game?

147
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,767
Close your eyes.

148
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,533
Hurry up and close your eyes!

149
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:37,500
Hurry!

150
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,133
No cheating!

151
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,600
Follow me.

152
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,133
What?

153
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,100
Follow me!

154
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,867
- What?
- Don't worry, just follow me.

155
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,400
Don't you trust me after all these years?

156
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,067
Dear,

157
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,267
today is our 1000th day anniversary.

158
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,767
I hope, I will be spending
every 1000 days with you

159
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,067
in the future.

160
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,167
Do you accept?

161
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,567
It seems like you are pretty ok this week.

162
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:19,767
Let's follow up soon.

163
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:20,767
Ok, thanks doc.

164
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,800
Did you go anywhere last weekend?

165
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,400
- Last weekend?
- Umm...

166
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,867
I went to Hualien.

167
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,767
Hey, Shawn, I'm here.

168
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,067
Let's call it a day, doc.

169
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:30,967
Oh, ok. Sorry about that.

170
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,500
Not at all, thanks.

171
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,367
- Bye.
- Bye.

172
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,167
Thanks.

173
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:45,433
I've told you many times,

174
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,033
don't call me that when I'm working.

175
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:47,900
Hey!

176
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:51,733
You think he comes here everyday
because he is sick?

177
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:55,600
I totally can see through him,
I know what he is up to.

178
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,900
Not everyone is as dirty-minded
as you are, ok?

179
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,200
What?

180
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,333
How am I dirty-minded?

181
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:04,267
You totally are!

182
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:05,633
Are you saying

183
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:08,700
something...

184
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,100
...like this?
- Hey, I'm working!

185
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:13,800
Come on, let me check.

186
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,867
- What kind of medical condition he has...
- Nothing to check, ok?

187
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:17,733
Come on.

188
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,167
Insomnia,

189
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,033
sleepless...

190
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:22,933
Don't!

191
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,967
I think he wants you so bad
that he can't sleep!

192
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,633
I see him everyday,

193
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,267
and it's very annoying!

194
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,067
Then why are you here? Are you sick?

195
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:35,900
Yes.

196
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,500
There is something wrong with my heart.

197
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,567
Do you mind doing a little check up for me?

198
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:42,767
There is nothing wrong with you ok!

199
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,233
Let me tell you, I have been...

200
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,467
How come you still have this?

201
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:41,267
You are more surprised of the bottle?

202
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,467
I'm putting a ring on your finger!

203
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,700
Because...

204
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,033
seeing these stones

205
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,133
remind me of the days

206
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
I used to follow you.

207
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,300
I counted every day,

208
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:59,200
hoping the 100th would come sooner.

209
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:06,733
Well, since your husband is so romantic,

210
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,167
does he get some reward?

211
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,600
Reward?

212
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:13,767
Yes!

213
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:24,033
Ah-Jun... gave me this yesterday!

214
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,867
Xiao Yu... is that...?

215
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:40,167
Where should I start to reward you?

216
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,167
My baby!

217
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
(Extra scene after the credits!)

218
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:04,667
Actually...

219
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,867
it was love at first sight for me.

220
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:09,733
Oh?

221
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,767
So... you are saying

222
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,067
I'm pretty attractive?

223
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,767
Seriously,

224
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
I want to thank you...

225
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,833
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to be myself.
