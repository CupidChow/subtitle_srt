Hey, you are way out of the line!

00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:05,933
Hey!

6
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:06,767
Let it go!

7
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,100
No!

8
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,267
Are you ok?

(Innocent The Series)

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
(Episode 3: A Needle in the Heart)

11
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:30,667
What?

12
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:32,100
You like it?

13
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:34,667
How do you know?

14
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,267
Shawn told me about your birthday.

15
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,933
Come over here!

16
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,200
Come,

17
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,167
have a seat.

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,333
Close your eyes.

19
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,433
Hurry.

20
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:52,633
Close your eyes.

21
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,233
Here.

22
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,667
How do you know?

23
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,667
I went to check the surveillance camera
nearby our place,

24
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,367
and found out your old jar was broken.

25
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,933
This is the 100th.

26
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:13,533
(A month ago)

27
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,767
I found out probably like a month ago,

28
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,733
he followed me home every night

29
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,367
In the beginning,
I thought it was very suspicious.

30
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,167
I wasn't sure if he was going to
rob me.

31
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:50,567
But he always disappeared
after getting into the alley close to my place.

32
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,233
Ah!

33
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,967
Ah?

34
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,233
Sir?

35
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,033
Sir? Are you ok?

36
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:40,800
Hey!

37
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,300
Hey, sir.

38
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,800
Wake up!

39
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:48,767
Hey!

40
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,033
Hello, Jun Zhe.

41
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:11,867
Rememeber I told you about a guy

42
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,200
that follows me home every night?

43
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,067
He is at my place right now.

44
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,133
And the lady from downstairs told me,

45
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,600
He lives on the first floor.

46
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,067
We were wrong about him.

47
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,367
So he wasn't following me,

48
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,633
he was just going home too.

49
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,233
Yes,

50
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,733
I did rang the door bell of his place,

51
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,967
but no one answered.

52
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,733
So, I carried him upstairs.

53
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,267
Hey, okay, okay.

54
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,367
I will talk to you later,

55
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,800
let me check what's going on with him first.

56
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,167
Bye.

57
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:41,567
Ah!

58
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,300
You are awake!

59
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:45,900
Is everything ok?

60
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,567
What happened to you?

61
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,067
I ran into a pervert.

62
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,333
What?

63
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:10,700
A pervert?

64
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,467
What kind of pervert?

65
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,033
Where at?

66
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,667
Talk to me.

67
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:24,333
Ah?

68
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:26,900
Ah!

69
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:30,233
Eh...

70
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:33,267
Ok.

71
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,567
Ok.

72
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,067
Ehh...

73
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,133
It's ok.

74
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,333
It's really ok.

75
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,200
Ehh.

76
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,833
Ok, don't cry.

77
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,567
Hey!

78
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,600
You...

79
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:29,800
Why are you naked?

80
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:33,233
Do you have extra clothes
that you can borrow me?

81
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,633
Of course.

82
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,367
You... wait a second.

83
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Why am I nervous? We both are guys!

84
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:52,133
This is it.

85
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,667
How did you sleep last night?

86
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,033
Yes.

87
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,167
What happened to you yesterday?

88
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,233
I don't know, I forgot.

89
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,167
Um... do you have to work today?

90
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,167
Noah works from home.

91
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,200
Who is Noah?

92
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,667
Do you have to work today?

93
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:43,933
Me?

94
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,633
Oh, me and my friend
have a pool table place

95
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,000
I go there every now and then.

96
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:50,467
I see.

97
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:54,867
Eat!

98
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:02,800
Um.

99
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,333
It's so good.

100
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:21,233
And....

101
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,433
I was wondering
if I could stay here for a while.

102
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:28,867
What?

103
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,833
Eh... I guess... okay.

104
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,867
Why did I just said yes like that?

105
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,767
Eat more if you like.

106
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,767
Nevermind.

107
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:42,667
What kind of sauce is this?

108
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,467
I kind of think... he is cute!

109
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,467
That's soy sauce.

110
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,600
Hello,

111
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,567
I'm busy at the moment,

112
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,867
I will come by in the evening.

113
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:58,767
Ok, bye.

114
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Come in.

115
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,433
Come,

116
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,833
it's ok.

117
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,933
It's ok, don't worry.

118
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,067
Have a seat.

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,433
Don't worry, I am here with you.

120
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:42,933
Long time no see! Wu Zheng.

121
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:43,967
It's been a long time!

122
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,667
Since high school?

123
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,200
I heard you went abroad?

124
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,933
Oh, yeah.

125
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,367
How can I help you guys today?

126
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,433
Um... that...

127
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,967
Oh.

128
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,133
Ok. I got it.

129
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,600
So... I'll leave it to you.

130
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,233
Ok, no problem.

131
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:10,967
Yu Shi,

132
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,400
what are you seeing right now?

133
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:20,433
I am at a park,

134
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,500
There is sand.

135
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,367
What's on the sand?

136
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,133
There is...

137
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,900
a little guy there.

138
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:07,867
I'm here.

139
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:10,700
Don't worry.

140
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,467
You are ok now.

141
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,667
It's ok.

142
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,267
I'm here.

143
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:26,967
Don't worry.

144
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,333
Ok, it's all good.

145
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,033
You are ok now.

146
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,000
This is so inappropriate.

147
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,867
Please?

148
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:13,567
Yes?

149
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:14,600
Please, please?

150
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,467
Xiao Yu?

151
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:44,967
Xiao Yu.

152
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:47,200
Xiao Yu!

153
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:02,533
Xiao Yu!

154
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:03,400
Xiao Yu!

155
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,867
Where are you, Xiao Yu?

156
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,333
Now I know how it feels.

157
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,200
When I was little,

158
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,467
I made a pact with myself

159
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,033
the moment I heard my parents
had passed away,

160
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,333
that I will cherish the person I love forever,

161
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,133
beacuse it's too painful
when they are gone.

162
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,867
I wasn't ready to face my inner fears.

163
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,067
But now I am.

164
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:39,167
I know what I really want.

165
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:41,967
Xiao Yu!

166
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,867
Please come back...

167
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:46,467
Xiao Yu!

168
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,367
Hello,

169
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,067
Jun Zhe, where are you?

170
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:02,367
Do you have time right now?

171
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,167
Come over and help me find Xiao Yu.

172
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,933
I don't know.

173
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,067
I turned around and he was gone.

174
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:10,000
Ok, I'm near your place.

175
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,500
Ok, bye bye.
