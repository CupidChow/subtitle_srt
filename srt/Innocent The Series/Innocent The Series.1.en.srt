1
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,567
Auntie, how much is this?

2
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:31,467
50 bucks.

3
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,167
50 bucks, I give you 100.

4
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,067
Come on, let's go home.

5
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:39,467
Come on.

6
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,200
(Innocent The Series)

7
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,900
(Episode 1: Pandora's Box)

8
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,967
The time he was staying with me,

9
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I realized he was like a kid.

10
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,633
Other than that,

11
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:36,933
I didn't notice anything strange.

12
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,767
He looks so weak anyway.

13
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,833
If anything happened between us,

14
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,933
he wouldn't be able to fight me.

15
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,867
After hanging out for a couple of days,

16
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I have this strange feeling towards him.

17
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,167
I can't explain it.

18
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,300
It wasn't until that day

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
I realized the feelings I have for him

20
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,133
weren't just of friendship.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Kids shouldn't be listening
to people's conversation.

22
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:12,633
Come,

23
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,333
I'm going out later.

24
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,633
Eat this first,

25
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:17,867
I'll cook for you when I'm back.

26
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,433
Hey,

27
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,467
what are you doing here?

28
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:13,867
I want to get into the shower with you.

29
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,433
Huh?

30
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,467
What?

31
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,667
What's wrong?

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Don't leave.

33
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,767
Don't leave.

34
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,767
Ok.

35
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:43,033
What's wrong?

36
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,867
Huh...

37
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:52,367
Ok.

38
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Ok, I know, I know.

39
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,233
Ok, ok.

40
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,833
Don't worry, don't worry.

41
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,667
It's ok.

42
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,367
Don't worry.

43
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:58,667
Shao Jie,

44
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:01,000
Shao Jie, don't leave.

45
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,067
- Please, don't... wait, let me explain.
- Let go!

46
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,833
We are not really together.

47
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,633
We met each other through
Mr. Yang. That's it.

48
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:36,033
Are you saying I'm not good enough for you?

49
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,600
You asked me out for a date,

50
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,700
then you slept with a woman in your place.

51
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,633
Excuse me,

52
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,367
the person he was sleeping with

53
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:44,933
was not a woman,

54
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,000
it's me.

55
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,000
Wu Zheng...

56
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,133
Xiao Yu... her and I...

57
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:12,500
Hey, Xiao Yu.

58
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,700
Xiao Yu, let me explain! Please, don't go.

59
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,033
Xiao Yu.

60
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,233
Don't touch me.

61
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,233
Xiao Yu.

62
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:20,567
Xiao Yu.

63
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:36,967
Xiao Yu.

64
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,033
Let's go home.

65
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,967
Xiao Yu, where are you going?

66
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,100
Let me go!

67
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,267
Where the hell are you going?

68
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,633
I have been following you
for almost two hours.

69
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:56,733
You won't even listen to me.

70
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,767
What's there to be said?

71
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,933
Please, give me a chance.

72
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,600
Let me explain it to you.

73
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,267
Come on.

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
My client introduced me to Shiao Jie.

75
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:15,967
There is nothing between me and her.

76
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,833
Why are you telling me this?

77
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,367
What did you do to Xiao Yu?

78
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,467
Aren't you Xiao Yu?

79
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:25,333
Don't you bullshit me.

80
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,067
Yu Shi belongs to me.

81
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,267
You... get as far away as you can.

82
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:30,533
I will protect him.

83
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,133
What do you mean with he belongs to you?

84
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:34,933
At least him and I...

85
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,133
I gotta make it up to him.

86
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,967
Hey, wait, who the hell are you?

87
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,267
Are you inhabiting
Yu Shi's body?

88
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,367
Get out!

89
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Go with your girl!

90
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,567
Aren't you supposed to answer
my question first?

91
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:52,633
Hey, be careful.

92
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:01,567
Xiao Yu.

93
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,167
Don't worry.

94
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,267
Don't cry, don't cry.

95
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:10,433
It's ok, it's ok.

96
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,633
It's ok now.

97
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,033
Xiao Yu,

98
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
there is nothing between me and Shao Jie.

99
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,067
My client introduced her to me.

100
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,367
I thought it was a little rude to
say no right away.

101
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,867
So, I thought we could be friends first,

102
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,467
it won't do any harm anyway.

103
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,700
But then, I met you.

104
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,267
I... I know.

105
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:52,133
I, I knew you before Shao Jie met you.

106
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:58,300
Also, I heard what you said to Noah.

107
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,400
What's wrong?

108
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,900
You go to bed first.

109
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,933
I will make delicious dumplings
for you tomorrow morning.

110
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,233
Ok?

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,667
Ok.

112
00:10:58,933 --> 00:10:59,867
Go to bed.

113
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,767
So, you... when did you...

114
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,500
How come you didn't say anything about it?

115
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,267
Shao Jie came to the store yesterday,

116
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,767
said something about you
messing with another man.

117
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,100
I didn't believe it at first,

118
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,900
I even argued with her.

119
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,867
Actually,

120
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,700
if it wasn't for Mr. Yang,

121
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,900
I wouldn't like her at all.

122
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,033
She thought because studied abroad

123
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,433
she is better than anyone else.

124
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,533
Sigh...

125
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,133
Feels like..

126
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,700
She thinks she is above us.

127
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:35,767
Hey,

128
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,167
are you listening or not?

129
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,967
Now, you know she is not lying.

130
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,167
What?

131
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:46,733
Scared?

132
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,900
We are not bros anymore?

133
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,567
I am not scared.

134
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,767
I am more scared that you will fall for me.

135
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,733
You don't have mirrors in your house?

136
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:57,667
Hey,

137
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,867
that was not nice.

138
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:01,300
At least,

139
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,667
I was the most popular guy back in school.

140
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:04,367
Sigh.

141
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,033
Your turn.

142
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,567
Eh

143
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,767
You...

144
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,167
Are you going to introduce me
to the wife?

145
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,267
Is he?

146
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,267
Or...

147
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,767
You are the one...

148
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,167
Stop being annoying.

149
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:26,733
Okay.

150
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,667
Seriously,

151
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Tell me.

152
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,500
What really happened?

153
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:48,100
And then, he woke up

154
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,033
and told me he ran into some bad guys

155
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,067
who were going to attack him.

156
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,800
I asked him what happened,

157
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,533
he forgot all about it.

158
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,833
He just remembered waking up at my house,

159
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,233
and kept telling me someone
is looking out for him.

160
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,967
I asked him who the person was,

161
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,567
he then pointed at himself.

162
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,533
I really wanted to call my grandpa
at that moment.

163
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,967
I felt like he was being possessed
or something.

164
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:16,467
He was saying things that
didn't make sense.

165
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:25,300
So, are you planning to be with him?

166
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,967
What about your grandpa?

167
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,267
What are you going to say to Shao Jie?

168
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:31,667
Bro,

169
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,500
you have your hands full!

170
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,900
(A few days later)

171
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:02,500
What's wrong?

172
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:05,467
It's your grandpa.

173
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:07,333
My grandpa?

174
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,067
It's my grandpa.

175
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,367
Hello, grandpa.

176
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,633
I've been busy lately,

177
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,033
with the pool business
that Jun Zhe and I have.

178
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,667
And him and I...

179
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,567
You are talking about Shao Jie...

180
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,133
Yes.

181
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
Eh... not really.

182
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,167
Grandpa,

183
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,533
She has a fiance who lives abroad,

184
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,767
they were just arguing over little things,
maybe breaking up.

185
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,467
Why should I intervene?

186
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Me?

187
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,367
Yes,

188
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,567
I am seeing someone now.

189
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,500
Sure,

190
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,567
no problem.

191
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,300
I will go visit you next week.

192
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,167
Grandpa, have you eaten yet?

193
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,933
Yes, yes, I'm cooking right now.

194
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,400
Ok, I know. You go ahead.

195
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
It's pretty late.

196
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,167
Ok, I will go visit you next week.

197
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:15,967
Ok.

198
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,367
That's about it, grandpa.

199
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,667
Ok, bye, grandpa.

200
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,733
Just say what you want to say.

201
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Are you still mad?

202
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,267
I've explained it to Shao Jie already,

203
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,767
and I also apologized to you, too.

204
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,467
Don't be mad, please.

205
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,367
Please don't be mad.

206
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:24,467
Clearly, it's the same person,

207
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,867
how come the personalities are so different?

208
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:39,967
What?

209
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:43,233
Missing Xiao Yu already?

210
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,400
I am not as easy-going as him.

211
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,600
Aren't you and Xiao Yu the same person?

212
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,933
Hey,

213
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,967
are you coming to my hometown with me or not?

214
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,767
I just spoke to my grandpa on the phone,

215
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,967
you probably heard it all.

216
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,033
He asked me if I am seeing someone.

217
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,767
I said I am.

218
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,833
I'm not seeing you.

219
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:07,733
I promised I would go back next week.

220
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Don't you try to get rid of me.

221
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,900
You and I, we are pretty much
like husband and wife now.

222
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,700
Ha!

223
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:16,933
Gross.

224
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:20,067
It's Xiao Yu who likes you,

225
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,700
it has nothing to do with me.

226
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,733
Please?

227
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,267
Go away and don't touch me.
Go and sleep in the kichen.

228
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,500
Hey!

229
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,433
Please...

230
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,633
Please...

231
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:48,067
Pretty please, come and visit
grandpa with me.

232
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,067
Ok?

233
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,033
Ah!

234
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
(Stay put and watch the official music video!)

235
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,200
It wasn't until that day

236
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,700
that I realized my feelings for him

237
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,400
are beyond sympathy.

238
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,100
("Innocent The Series" Theme Song)
(Julia Peng - Twins)

239
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
When the world wears makeup excessively

240
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,000
To me, even simplicity seems like hypocrisy

241
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,600
Should I wake, or should I let loose

242
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,900
You say you don't know how to choose

243
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,600
Am I an angel, or am I a devil?

244
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm both your friend and your rival

245
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,600
It's like there are always two paths to travel

246
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,600
When I go left, you do not follow

247
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,200
One moment we get along well

248
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,800
The next, we are like Heaven and Hell

249
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
You are me, sitting on the other side

250
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,500
You hate to lose, but without me, you cannot survive

251
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Let the mutual torturing begin

252
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,400
What's unbearable is harmony within

253
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,100
You are the ego who I hate to face

254
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,800
And yet, you are never to be erased

255
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,700
It's as if you were my alternative life

256
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,500
As a bystander, I watch you lose your mind

257
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,200
You are the chains that tie me down

258
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Yet, you have more freedom than I ever found

259
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,200
The shit you and I do

260
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
In order to know who's who

261
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,100
I try to cut you off, but you are like glue

262
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,700
Perhaps there was never any me or you

263
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,100
One moment we get along well

264
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,600
The next, we are like Heaven and Hell

265
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You are me, sitting on the other side

266
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,500
You hate to lose, but without me, you cannot survive

267
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,900
Let the mutual torturing begin

268
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,200
What's unbearable is harmony within

269
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,900
You are the ego who I hate to face

270
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,600
And yet, you are never to be erased

271
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,200
A used facial mask

272
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,200
Like lenses upside-down, white-and-black

273
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,900
You are my soul, me on the other side

274
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,700
You don't know me, but you are inside

275
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,000
Pause the torturing

276
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Serious words leave a trace

277
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,700
You are the ego, who I must face

278
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,700
Without you, I'd be a lonely case

279
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,600
You are my soul, me on the other side

280
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,700
Without you, without you,

281
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:09,300
I die a little inside
