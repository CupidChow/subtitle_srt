[Confide to Me]

4
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,710
You're awake. Want some water?

5
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,670
Have some water.

6
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,510
No, I'm good.

7
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,700
I told you not to drink so much.

8
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,290
Your stomach's already bad enough.

9
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,120
Look at you now—

10
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,180
feeling awful, right?

11
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,510
Nian,

12
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,320
tell me.

13
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,140
What kind of animal do you think humans are?

14
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,670
I plan the road I want to take,

15
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,020
but suddenly, there's a fork in the path.

16
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,700
Turning left feels wrong

17
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,750
and turning right feels just as bad.

18
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,270
What should I do?

19
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,450
Tu, is it about your father's illness?

20
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,230
If you need money, just tell me.

21
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,310
I don't need money.

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Stop worrying about me not having enough.

23
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,150
Then, did someone mess with you?

24
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,070
Tell me who.

25
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,170
I'll go find him right away.

26
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,310
Nian,

27
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,180
you're so good to me.

28
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,329
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,310
It's not like we just met yesterday.

30
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,460
Take a sip.

31
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,950
I just feel a bit lost right now.

32
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,860
You know, all I've ever wanted is to make money.

33
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,270
I started working at the karaoke place,

34
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,350
earning every penny on my own, bit by bit.

35
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,110
And what's wrong with wanting to marry someone rich?

36
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,470
I don't think anyone dreams of marrying someone poor.

37
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,510
That's the future I want,

38
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,510
and I don't think it's wrong.

39
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,910
I don't care if people call me a gold digger

40
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,150
or look down on me—

41
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,470
I don't care.

42
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,180
But sometimes...

43
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,529
Someone unexpected just

44
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,720
walks into your world,

45
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,590
gets so close to you,

46
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,810
and suddenly,

47
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,560
you start to waver.

48
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,610
Did someone confess to you?

49
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,240
No.

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,570
I just suddenly had this feeling of being smitten.

51
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,680
Someone made you feel that way?

52
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,500
Who is it?

53
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,470
He must be exceptional.

54
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,110
How can you be so sure

55
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,300
that he's exceptional?

56
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,050
Tu, you're amazing.

57
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,390
You've seen so much of the world.

58
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,310
Your judgment of people, things,

59
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,220
even games people play—

60
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
it's sharper than mine.

61
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,720
For someone to catch your eye,

62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,780
to make you feel this way,

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,180
he'd have to be extraordinary.

64
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,790
Then tell me:

65
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,230
what does it feel like to be smitten?

66
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,670
Is it like how you feel about Feng Huanan?

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,880
Feng Huanan?

68
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,810
Why's everyone fixated on him lately?

69
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,860
No, Tu,

70
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,710
let me be honest with you.

71
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,320
My feelings for him

72
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,910
are more about admiration and appreciation.

73
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,910
As for love?

74
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,270
I really don't know.

75
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
But if,

76
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,650
if he showed interest in me,

77
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,510
I wouldn't mind catching feelings.

78
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,930
So, you're waiting for him to make a move?

79
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,180
You know

80
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
how passive I am.

81
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,270
That's probably why I'm still single.

82
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,409
Of course, I'd be thrilled if he pursued me.

83
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,220
But he won't.

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,430
Why not?

85
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,800
Look at his ex.

86
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,960
I have to be that good to catch his attention.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,080
And after their breakup?

88
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,070
He's even more popular now.

89
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,270
The girls chasing him could

90
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,510
form a line all the way to Spain.

91
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,710
I can't even get in line.

92
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,440
With my personality,

93
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,430
I'm just dreaming of

94
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,660
riding my motorcycle after graduation,

95
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,110
traveling the world and exploring.

96
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,210
If he accidentally confesses to me and I fall for him,

97
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,710
that's it—I'm locked in.

98
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,630
How would I see the world then?

99
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,990
But you're so actively raising money for him.

100
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,110
I thought...

101
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,470
It's all that Su Yin's fault, crashing into this tree—me—out of nowhere.

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,970
And because the tree fell,

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,190
it scared the old lady.

104
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,630
How could I ignore that?

105
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,470
What kind of person would I be?

106
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,720
Besides,

107
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,440
everyone says the graduation season is the breakup season.

108
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,940
I don't want

109
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,260
my first relationship to last just a few months and then end.

110
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,490
So, it's better this way.

111
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,670
Let it be a beautiful memory,

112
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,360
and keep him as my idol.

113
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,350
What do you mean?

114
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,150
I worked so hard to find a job,

115
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,150
and I wanted to work hard with you.

116
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,790
But now you're breaking up with me?

117
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier about going to Shenzhen?

118
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,390
I know you just don't love me.

119
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,270
If you did, you'd discuss this with me—

120
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,910
not just decide on your own.

121
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,860
Come here, come here.

122
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,900
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,910
It's okay.

124
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,700
We're here for you.

125
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,910
It's okay, it's okay.

126
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,380
There'll be someone better.

127
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,260
There'll be someone better.

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,930
You are going to make me cry too.

130
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,320
President, what do you mean?

131
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,350
Don't tell me you're upset

132
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,350
because Liaoning won the championship

133
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,390
and you didn't buy lottery tickets.

134
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,950
Did you actually think I'd bet on that?

135
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,770
I might as well believe there will be rockets launched into space.

136
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,110
There's actually one coming up soon.

137
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,330
One rocket and five satellites.

138
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
I'll do two rockets and ten satellites.

139
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,110
Three rockets and fifteen satellites.

140
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,900
Alright, Su Yin.

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,250
I didn't come here to mess around.

142
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,700
I'm here to talk about serious matters.

143
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,030
You're not drunk, are you?

144
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,870
I'm not drunk.

145
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,380
I'm totally sober.

146
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,030
You're into Gu Nian,

147
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,820
aren't you?

148
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,380
That's why you keep giving me grief,

149
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,640
and a hard time.

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,960
I get it.

151
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,560
But do you have any idea

152
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,360
how much trouble you've caused for the club

153
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,620
with your romantic antics?

154
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,980
To pay off everyone's debts,

155
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,450
do you know how much I've suffered?

156
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,790
Don't believe me?

157
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,640
Last night at the karaoke place,

158
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,900
that guy opened his bag,

159
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,299
pulled out a stack of cash,

160
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,110
slammed it on the table,

161
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,110
grabbed a bottle—

162
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,270
some "18-something"—

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
and slammed that on the table too.

164
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,430
I didn't even blink.

165
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,420
I picked it up and chugged it all.

166
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,450
Straight down.

167
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,520
And then? The guy told me to recite a poem.

168
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,150
I'm an artist, after all.

169
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,310
I was inspired.

170
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,330
I went for it.

171
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,890
So I gave them The Song of the Lute.

172
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,390
You know my talent.

173
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,930
When I was done,

174
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,390
the whole room stood up and applauded.

175
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,040
I left them speechless.

176
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,990
Understand?

177
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,220
Do you get what I'm trying to say?

178
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,170
Even something as humiliating as that—

179
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,830
getting my face dragged through the mud—

180
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,430
I don't care.

181
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,710
As long as it's for everyone.

182
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,810
Can you understand that?

183
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,500
Reciting poems for money?

184
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,550
Why didn't you tell me about this great gig?

185
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,090
If you really want in,

186
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,420
I'll let Lyu Tu take you next time.

187
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,620
I'm not competing for it.

188
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,880
Lyu Tu took you there?

189
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,220
Then it's gotta be some grand, extravagant event.

190
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,670
Stop with the sarcasm.

191
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,490
You think I can't hear it?

192
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,490
Let me tell you,

193
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,350
I really don't like her.

194
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,650
She's the one interested in me, alright?

195
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,560
Not the other way around.

196
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,070
So what exactly do you mean?

197
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,070
You two kissed?

198
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,590
Did I actually successfully stop it?

199
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,290
Nope, same drama.

200
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
Just a different lead actress.

201
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,680
Look.

202
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,850
These.

203
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,950
Good family background,

204
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,910
good looks, and treat me even better.

205
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,860
Gu Nian and Lyu Tu

206
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,310
were never even in my choices.

207
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,300
And this one, look.

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,930
See?

209
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,970
Pretty, isn't she?

210
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,540
Doesn't she look like a celebrity?

211
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,000
So,

212
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,080
there's no reason for you to keep targeting me.

213
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,460
So,

214
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,390
you really don't like Gu Nian at all?

215
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,700
What's there to like?

216
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,900
Skinny as a twig, looks like a tomboy.

217
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,950
As a friend?

218
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,210
Sure.

219
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,590
As a girlfriend?

220
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,030
Forget it.

221
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,310
What about Lyu Tu then?

222
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,990
Lyu Tu

223
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,230
is good to me, yeah,

224
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,750
and honestly,

225
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,430
she's my type.

226
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,570
But she's an accident.

227
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,040
Forget it.

228
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,470
Let's not talk about her.

229
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,260
She's not someone to take seriously.

230
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,920
If I really wanted to choose,

231
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
it'd be from the ones

232
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,140
I just showed you.

233
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,290
No competition, see?

234
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,310
No need to be so wary of me.

235
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,750
We're not rivals.

236
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,580
Are you drunk?

237
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,020
Get out.

238
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,050
You really drank too much.

239
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,680
Get lost!

240
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,080
Watch your attitude.

241
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,900
I'm the President.

242
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,340
Mind your manners.

243
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,630
If you can't handle your liquor, you should've said so earlier.

244
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,610
You're wasting my beer.

245
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,790
Take your phone with you too.

246
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,050
Take your sisters with you.

247
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,220
I won't drink with you next time.

248
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,460
This scumbag.

249
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,210
He's already this awful in school.

250
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,630
I was blind enough

251
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,840
to marry this trash?

252
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,020
Thanks.

253
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,110
I might as well believe there will be rockets launched into space.

254
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,520
There's actually one coming up soon.

255
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,830
One rocket and five satellites.

256
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,160
The CBA Finals are coming.

257
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,630
Liaoning's taking it, a 4-0 sweep.

258
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,860
Really?

259
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,780
Just watch and see.

260
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,700
He really guessed it right.

261
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,230
How did he know?

262
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,350
Could he really predict the future?

263
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,810
Tu.

264
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,840
The deposit for the performance

265
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,710
came through, so we can

266
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,950
pay back everyone today.

267
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,410
Should we send them a message first?

268
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,610
Since we're heading to the theater anyway,

269
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,480
it'd be more surprising to tell them in person.

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,450
That makes sense.

271
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,350
This way, we'll really set the mood

272
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,850
and restore the President's dignity.

273
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,510
Absolutely.

274
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,610
Didn't you say you wouldn't come looking for me for two days?

275
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,430
It's only been a day, and you're already backtracking.

276
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,150
I came to see you.

277
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,750
I have something to tell you.

278
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,290
What do you want with her?

279
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,410
Come with me.

280
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,160
It's okay. If he tries to bully you,

281
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,070
just message me, alright?

282
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,240
I'll head to the theater first.

283
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,740
Let's go.

284
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm leaving then.

285
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,660
If you really have guts,

286
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,860
don't talk to me even after two days.

287
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,820
What's the matter?

288
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,740
President, you're here.

289
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,140
How's it going?

290
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,940
Have you paid back the money you owed everyone?

291
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,840
All done. They even said they're super grateful.

292
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,710
You kept your word.

293
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,650
That's good.

294
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,680
Not a single thank-you in person.

295
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,510
After getting the money, they left

296
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,710
the group chat without a word.

297
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,410
Say something, will you?

298
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,030
Su Yin.

299
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,790
Su Yin, stop!

300
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,520
What's really going on?

301
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,900
What happened between you and Nian?

302
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,950
Why are you so angry?

303
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,750
If you really like her,

304
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,470
just tell me.

305
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,590
Maybe I can help you.

306
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,140
Say something.

307
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,230
Tu.

308
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,800
Lyu Tu, I've been holding this in all day.

309
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,900
I really can't keep it in anymore.

310
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,710
Then spit it out already!

311
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,510
Gu Nian has been good to you, hasn't she?

312
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,140
Back in your first year,

313
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,970
when you got drunk and harassed,

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,480
she risked everything to pull you out of there.

315
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,180
Her arm got hurt so badly that she still can't lift it properly.

316
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,750
You're from out of town,

317
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,180
with no friends and no family here.

318
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,079
She introduced you to her friends,

319
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,369
took you home when you graduated,

320
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,869
and even wanted to help you get a stable job after graduation

321
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,619
so you could stay.

322
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,160
She even wanted to...

323
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,869
Wait, why are you telling me all this?

324
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,200
Do I need you to tell me how good Nian has been to me?

325
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,050
If you know all that,

326
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,490
how could you still kiss Feng Huanan?

327
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,640
How did you know?

328
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,790
Did Feng Huanan tell you?

329
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,619
Gu Nian, President.

330
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,780
President, look, Kele is here.

331
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,930
Tu will be here soon too.

332
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,080
No problem at all.

333
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,060
Wait, Kele, why are you dressed like this?

334
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,500
Where are you heading?

335
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,940
I've got an interview later.

336
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,060
Oh,

337
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,260
here are the photos and videos from the nursing home.

338
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,110
There aren't many stills, though.

339
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,510
It's okay.

340
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,820
That day was a bit chaotic,

341
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,400
wasn't it?

342
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,470
Don't worry about it.

343
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,710
Kele, you'll definitely come

344
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,630
on the day we take the photos, right?

345
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,290
I've got an interview,

346
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,270
so I can't promise.

347
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,600
Didn't you just find a job?

348
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,300
I want to try my luck in Shenzhen.

349
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,790
Why?

350
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,440
Everyone's here. Isn't that good?

351
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,260
Yeah.

352
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,040
If I don't go to Shenzhen,

353
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,060
my boyfriend will break up with me.

354
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,280
I'm sorry, President, Nian.

355
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,670
I'm in a hurry.

356
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,430
Thank you for taking care of me, President.

357
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Nian, I'm leaving now. Bye!

358
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
Take care.

359
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,830
I'm sorry, Gu Nian.

360
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,930
You worked so hard to secure this performance opportunity,

361
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,580
and now look around—

362
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,360
everyone's left.

363
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,370
President, this is not your fault.

364
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,740
If the team isn't united,

365
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,030
then it's definitely on me as the president.

366
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,010
If it comes to that, I'll go ask each of them one by one.

367
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,850
I'll plead with them if I have to,

368
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,990
just to put on this final performance.

369
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,800
Don't worry, Gu Nian.

370
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,820
Your money won't go to waste,

371
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
and I won't leave you stuck in the middle.

372
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,220
I'll make sure you get closure.

373
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,560
President, I trust you.

374
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Have you thought about

375
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,700
how much this could hurt Gu Nian?

376
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,990
Just because we kissed doesn't mean

377
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,250
we're bound to be together.

378
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,650
I really don't get you.

379
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,450
Don't you like Gu Nian?

380
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,430
If Feng Huanan doesn't end up with her,

381
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,740
isn't that one less rival for you?

382
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,520
It's because I like Gu Nian so much

383
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,640
that it doesn't matter if we're together or not.

384
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,650
What matters most is that

385
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,530
she gets what she truly wants.

386
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,030
Nian told me herself—

387
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,610
she only admires Feng Huanan,

388
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,720
but she doesn't love him.

389
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,660
What about you?

390
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,510
Do you really like Feng Huanan?

391
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,570
Didn't you always say you'd marry a rich guy?

392
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,710
Do you think this broke college student

393
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,190
can give you the life you want?

394
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,540
And on top of that, he has a ton of options.

395
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,010
He doesn't even take you seriously.

396
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,170
Lyu Tu, you're a smart and perceptive girl.

397
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Why are you throwing yourself

398
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,080
into a mess with that scumbag?

399
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,540
I get it now.

400
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,750
You're jealous of Feng Huanan, aren't you?

401
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,820
That's why you're here badmouthing him.

402
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,830
You really don't need to do this.

403
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,110
It's very unmanly of you.

404
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,340
I'm jealous of him?

405
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,160
What's there to be jealous of?

406
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,130
Girl, you need to calm down.

407
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,760
What you see might not be the truth.

408
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,090
It could be just an illusion.

409
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,960
Man, you need to calm down too.

410
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,990
You really don't understand me at all.

411
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,150
I'm far more clear-headed than you think.

412
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,540
Sure, Feng Huanan is aloof and self-centered—

413
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,640
I get that.

414
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,440
But I'm not someone who'll go against money.

415
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,190
If I wait for him to succeed,

416
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,820
who knows how many years I'll be waiting?

417
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,260
I'm not going to give up my bright future

418
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,450
for some so-called love.

419
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,360
So don't worry about me.

420
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,550
Then I have one more question.

421
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,590
If Gu Nian and Feng Huanan really end up together,

422
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,830
will you still be involved with Feng Huanan?

423
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,790
Absolutely not.

424
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,400
Really?

425
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,860
I would never do something as disgraceful

426
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,250
as knowingly becoming the third wheel.

427
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,070
Especially not if that person is Nian.

428
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,550
Men? There are plenty out there.

429
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,940
But Nian

430
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,860
is irreplaceable to me.

431
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,630
Dad, just listen to the doctor.

432
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,110
You need treatment.

433
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,510
Don't worry about money;

434
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,910
I can earn it.

435
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,340
Just follow the doctor's advice, okay?

436
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,030
Don't worry about anything.

437
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,170
I'll handle it.

438
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,420
You focus on resting. Bye.

439
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,200
Tu,

440
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,110
send this to your dad quickly.

441
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,610
What happened to your arm?

442
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,790
Did you go racing again?

443
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,850
I told you not to race anymore!

444
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,790
Those mountain roads are dangerous,

445
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,870
and everyone else is a professional racer.

446
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,190
Do you not care about your life?

447
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,180
I've always loved racing.

448
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,760
And besides, I won first place.

449
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,640
The prize money is a lot.

450
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,750
Here, take it.

451
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,800
Send it to your dad right away.

452
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,110
Alright.

453
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,550
I found a job selling alcohol at a araoke bar.

454
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,870
Once I earn money,

455
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,770
I'll pay you back right away.

456
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,980
Tu, don't go to places like that.

457
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,560
It's too chaotic.

458
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,240
You're not from here, so it's not safe.

459
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,460
What if something happens?

460
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,580
I have to earn money for my dad's treatment.

461
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,340
Don't you still have me?

462
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,200
Nian.

463
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,230
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,700
Alright.

465
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,910
Alright, alright, alright.

466
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,090
Would you gentlemen like to buy some wine?

467
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,870
These are our newest arrivals

468
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,710
with a

469
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,780
special discount.

470
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,590
A pretty girl selling drinks—how could we say no?

471
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,710
Thank you, sir.

472
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,510
New here, aren't you?

473
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,320
Have a drink with us,

474
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,470
and I'll buy it.

475
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,200
I'm sorry, I only sell drinks.

476
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,510
If you don't drink, why should I buy it?

477
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,000
It's against the rules for us to drink.

478
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,290
Come on, have a drink with me.

479
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,000
Sir, I really can't.

480
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,870
It's a store policy.

481
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,050
What are you afraid of?

482
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,070
If you don't drink, I won't buy it.

483
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,650
I...

484
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,050
I, I really can't drink, sir.

485
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,590
Come on.

486
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:54,890
I...

487
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,520
Just one drink.

488
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,060
Don't run away.

489
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,870
You think you can run?

490
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,640
Don't come any closer.

491
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,710
Quite feisty.

492
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,300
I like that.

493
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,730
If you come any closer, I'll really fight back.

494
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,160
Don't be afraid, girl.

495
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,350
Don't come closer.

496
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,370
Don't be scared, little girl.

497
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,310
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

498
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,110
Sir, sir,

499
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,540
she's a college student.

500
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,730
She's new here. Please don't give her a hard time.

501
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,640
Who are you?

502
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,110
Get lost.

503
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,020
I said get lost. Did you hear me? Go.

504
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,750
If you don't leave, I'll wreck your store.

505
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,690
If you come any closer, I'll really fight back.

506
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,000
Help! Someone!

507
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,100
Sir,

508
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,550
don't be angry.

509
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,110
Who are you?

510
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:33,910
She's my friend.

511
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,750
I'll drink with you instead.

512
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,490
You'll drink?

513
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,430
Good, I like that.

514
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,030

556
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,590
But my Nian must be safe and sound,

557
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,960
healthy,

558
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,160
♫Circles and circles♫

559
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,050
and happy.

560
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,470
Your sweet talk

561
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,190
is like honey.

562
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,370
Nian is the only one who sees me as worthwhile.

563
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,360
So I would never do

564
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,880
anything to hurt her.

565
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,820
But you—

566
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,260
if you really like her,

567
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,240
you have to promise me that you'll treat her well.

568
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,390
Otherwise, I have a thousand ways to make you regret it.

569
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,610
Big words for such a little mouth.

570
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,870
I know you're capable,

571
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,020
an internet pro.

572
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,420
But your family is from out of town too, right?

573
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,750
Have you thought about what's next?

574
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,760
Will you stay or leave?

575
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,140
Gu Nian has never dated anyone

576
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,370
in her four years of college.

577
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,400
She's been waiting for someone she truly loves.

578
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,600
I won't let her get hurt

579
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,640
right before graduation.

580
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,300
If you're just looking to

581
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,640
fool around before leaving,

582
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,610
I suggest you

583
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,610
drop the idea now.

584
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,180
And if you're thinking of some long-distance relationship nonsense,

585
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,350
then just get lost.

586
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,060
Don't bother her.

587
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,010
You're really looking out for her, aren't you?

588
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,330
Nian lost her dad when she was little.

589
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't be fooled by how tough

590
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,970
she looks on the outside.

591
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,830
What kind of girl

592
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,100
grows up acting like a tomboy?

593
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,580
So, are you hand-picking her future partner?

594
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,250
Yes.

595
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,340
Gu Nian's man has to meet my standards.

596
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,440
I just want her to be happy.

597
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,620
So let me say it one last time.

598
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,320
If you really like her,

599
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,110
you need to promise me you'll treat her well.

600
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,120
Rest assured,

601
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,920
there's no one in this world

602
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,400
who loves her more than I do.

603
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,870
Prove it. Swear it.

604
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,510
Swear it.

605
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,870
Good.

606
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,670
Tu.

607
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,950
Nian.

608
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,930
Hurry back to rehearsal.

609
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,830
Let's go.

610
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,130
Aren't you going?

611
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,660
Didn't you tell me to vanish for two days?

612
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,210
What's the deal now?

613
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,810
Getting all worked up, huh?

614
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,910
Why are you kicking me again?

615
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,380
Gu Nian, I'm warning you.

616
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,150
Don't mistake a silent tiger

617
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,030
for a sick cat!

618
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,250
Su Yin, you...

619
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,310
You really surprised me.

620
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,700
What's wrong?

621
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,000
Today, I...

622
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,430
Yeah, I kicked you. So what?

623
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,270
So what?

624
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,120
So what?

625
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,150
She just taught me a few moves.

626
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,070
Let me tell you.

627
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,880
Don't hit me!

628
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,900
Stop fighting!

629
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,690
President, let's not dwell on what happened earlier.

630
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,430
I really don't want to waste any more time.

631
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,580
Waste time on what?

632
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,040
Apologies for

633
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,480
calling everyone here today.

634
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,830
Gao Ren.

635
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,990
About what happened the other day—I was in the wrong.

636
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,300
I got too emotional.

637
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,350
My bad.

638
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,420
Just try not to do things you need to apologize for.

639
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,800
Boss, can you help me out here?

640
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,420
President.

641
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,690
President!

642
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,650
Without the stage manager,

643
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,240
we're just a bunch of scattered sand.

644
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,190
I've got an idea—how about this…

645
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,490
I'm sorry, President.

646
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,440
You guys talk.

647
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,110
Stop messing around and come over here.

648
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,220
How about this?

649
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,180
From now on, Gao Ren gets a daily wage of 150 yuan.

650
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,140
The performance

651
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,130
at the health and wellness center is coming up soon.

652
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,430
Paying him extra is fair.

653
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,820
If he's working a job,

654
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,950
he'll need to buy a few sets of formal clothes.

655
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,830
If we're really stuck, I can cover the 150 myself.

656
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,300
I'll pay for it.

657
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,230
Boss,

658
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,120
you still haven't paid me back for last time.

659
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,920
Every student participating in the rehearsals

660
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,560
gets 150 a day. Deal?

661
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,700
President, what do you think?

662
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,090
Are you doing this for the success of the performance?

663
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,850
This is a charity project.

664
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,030
Where would we get the money?

665
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,960
If you'd announced this in the group chat earlier,

666
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,390
don't you think everyone would have shown up?

667
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,200
I think you have a point.

668
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Money is a huge incentive.

669
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,510
So, President,

670
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,800
this time...

671
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,950
For this event, there's money.

672
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,790
But everyone,

673
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,950
the payment will only be made

674
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,090
after the performance, once we receive the final balance.

675
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,490
Then we'll pay everyone in full.

676
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,950
That's not right.

677
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,640
The initial payment from the wellness center

678
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,630
should've already come through.

679
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,670
And didn't Lyu Tu secure funding for you too?

680
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,110
By now, the President's pocket

681
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,350
should be pretty full.

682
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,800
To be honest, everyone,

683
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,520
right now,

684
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,900
my pocket is totally empty.

685
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,900
Our drama club, apart from

686
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,430
the donations we collect during regular charity performances,

687
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,180
also sends money to the mountainous regions

688
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,410
of Guizhou at the end of every winter semester.

689
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,430
This money

690
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,640
is for left-behind children

691
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,960
and elderly folks.

692
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,160
You all know winter is

693
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,050
their hardest time of the year.

694
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,830
The winters in the mountains are freezing,

695
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,030
and they desperately need funds to buy clothes.

696
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,890
So, as soon as I received the deposit,

697
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,510
after paying back what we owed everyone,

698
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,780
I sent the rest of the money over.

699
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,580
I swear, I'm not lying to you.

700
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
The remittance slip is right here with me.

701
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,410
Yes.

702
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,940
Let me see.

703
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,750
The Communist Youth League does receive this remittance slip every year.

704
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,600
And it's always the President who personally hands it in.

705
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,310
This address looks familiar.

706
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,220
You've been there?

707
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,410
President, you're truly generous.

708
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,230
Even when struggling yourself,

709
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,350
you're still thinking about others.

710
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,370
He's not as petty as you.

711
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,990
Gu Nian,

712
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,140
could you help me submit this to the Communist Youth League later?

713
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,340
No problem.

714
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,740
Why are you agreeing so quickly?

715
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,810
Alright, that's all for today, everyone.

716
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:18,700
I'll send the rehearsal schedule

717
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,930
to the group chat later.

718
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Please spread the word to

719
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,870
those who didn't make it today.

720
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,460
See you all next week, alright?

721
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,290
Got it.

722
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,670
Alright, let's call it a day.

723
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,470
Bye-bye!

724
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,150
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

725
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,960
Gu Nian.

726
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,360
Are you free today?

727
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,820
If I don't treat you to a meal now,

728
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,400
I'll feel terrible.

729
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,460
What meal?

730
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,070
Is it necessary?

731
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,080
No, he...

732
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,440
Let's go.

733
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,200
I'm free anytime.

734
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,420
You decide.

735
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,740
Well,

736
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,630
same time,

737
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,000
same place, okay?

738
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,990
See you there.

739
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,070
Can't, can't go with him.

740
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,130
Can't go.

741
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,070
Are you crazy?

742
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,490
No,

743
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:00,950
no.

744
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,100
Is Feng Huanan crazy or what?

745
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,110
He's broke, yet he keeps

746
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,190
trying to treat Gu Nian to meals.

747
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,310
Eat, eat—that's all he knows!

748
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,190
Calm down. Have a seat first.

749
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,340
You need to be more careful with your attitude.

750
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,230
You were being sarcastic toward Feng Huanan.

751
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,290
What's wrong with Feng Huanan anyway?

752
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,310
Is there nothing wrong with him?

753
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,090
It takes a lot of love

754
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,590
to want to help others when you've

755
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,180
just managed to take care of your own basic needs.

756
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,410
In other words,

757
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,800
if Feng Huanan really is that kind of person,

758
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,030
could he have cheated?

759
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,180
These are two different matters.

760
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,390
Many people can handle big things,

761
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,270
but can't fix the small issues in their own lives.

762
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,150
And besides,

763
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,620
Feng Huanan has been supporting

764
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,040
the school's student council's project

765
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,960
of helping children and the elderly in the mountainous areas.

766
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,400
Don't be so paranoid.

767
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,300
Then why didn't he reimburse me

768
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,580
for the materials I bought before?

769
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,260
When I was with him back then,

770
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,560
he was the first to reimburse me.

771
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,930
As you said, you were together back then.

772
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,860
You were his girlfriend at that time.

773
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,070
Reimburse you?

774
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,150
He would even pay for your expenses

775
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,280
out of his own pocket.

776
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,890
You really don't understand men.

777
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,190
I...

778
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,100
That note does look familiar to me.

779
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,210
I'm sure I've seen it before.

780
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,240
But I just can't recall where.

781
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,740
If you can't remember, don't dwell on it.

782
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,910
I've got something important to tell you.

783
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,840
Our supervisor has been asking about your plans lately.

784
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,950
You should pop into the lab from time to time.

785
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,930
But I don't know what to show.

786
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,150
What should I say to the supervisor?

787
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,830
If I try to act mysterious, what if I slip up?

788
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,950
Jiang.

789
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,490
Jiang, you're the best.

790
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,830
Can you figure out a way

791
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,180
to do mine along with yours?

792
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,750
Jiang.

793
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,300
Alright.

794
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,030
But you'll have to figure out your graduation thesis on your own.

795
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,310
I'm not as talented as God Su.

796
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,930
I'll go back and look through

797
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,710
Su Yin's computer.

798
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,960
Hopefully, he's already done it.

799
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,940
Jiang, I have to go now.

800
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,830
Where are you going?

801
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,120
To host the distinguished guest,

802
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,590
of course, I need to pull out all the stops.

803
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,470
President.

804
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,650
I didn't expect you to have such a skill.
