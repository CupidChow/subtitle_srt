[Episode 13]

3
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,750
You don't want to play basketball,

4
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,710
and you don't want to eat either.

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,600
[Workplace, here we come]

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,509
You're driving yourself to death.

7
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,910
I've noticed that people

8
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,350
have to push themselves to the edge

9
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,130
before they know what they really want.

10
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,400
So, do you know what you want now?

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,670
Let me tell you,

12
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,950
the CCYL Committee's Graduate Employment Survey

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,750
is almost due.

14
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,270
You're the only one who hasn't submitted it.

15
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,310
Look at the state I'm in.

16
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,800
Do I even deserve to fill out that survey?

17
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,670
Do I?

18
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,740
I just don't understand what's going on with you.

19
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,510
Your academic performance is excellent, after all.

20
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,670
It's not like you have no options.

21
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,510
You have to accept it!

22
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,579
Right now, the only card I have left

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,240
is just one chance to sign a tripartite agreement.

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,310
But it's not ideal.

25
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,310
You get it?

26
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,940
It's completely impossible for me

27
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,910
to turn my life around.

28
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,950
Jiang, let's have dinner together tonight.

29
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,270
I passed my interview.

30
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,790
The Shiyi Technology.

31
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,640
Congratulations! I told you you'd be fine!

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,270
Tonight, you choose the place, and I'll pay!

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
Gu Nian passed the interview.

34
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,980
Is this the Shiyi Technology

35
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,500
you were talking about?

36
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,950
Yes, this one.

37
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,960
How many Shiyi Technologies could there be?

38
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,010
Let's play basketball. Let's play.

39
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,910
One versus one.

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,190
Hello, I'm here to complete the onboarding process.

41
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,780
You got it wrong.

42
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,829
You need two one-inch photos.

43
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,070
But I was told over the phone

44
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,790
that I needed to bring one two-inch photo.

45
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,190
I even had it specially printed.

46
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,710
All new employees are required to submit two one-inch photos.

47
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,270
One for your onboarding registration form

48
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,910
and the other one for making your work ID.

49
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,820
I've been handling this process for six years.

50
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,190
How could I possibly say it wrong?

51
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,870
You must have misheard it.

52
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,190
Could you please process my onboarding today,

53
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,830
and I'll bring the photos tomorrow?

54
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,390
How amusing.

55
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,110
As if the company follows your rules.

56
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,110
We follow procedures, understand?

57
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,230
Our company

58
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,510
has built its reputation in the industry through a rigorous attitude.

59
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,240
You think we can just cut corners as you please?

60
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,090
Will you take responsibility if the boss blames us?

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,019
When you have the photos,

62
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,420
that's when we'll process your paperwork.

63
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,950
Do you know where

64
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,740
I can get photos printed nearby?

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,540
This is the Human Resources Department,

66
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,910
not the reception desk.

67
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,750
Here.

68
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,190
These are her photos.

69
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,670
Listen, lady,

70
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,710
as someone working in HR,

71
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,909
can't you show some humanity?

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,080
You wrote this job posting, didn't you?

73
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,030
If you don't know the technical terms

74
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,350
used by the Technical Department, ask around.

75
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,310
Don't keep making mistakes.

76
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,210
Six years in, and you still haven't even made it to supervisor.

77
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,270
If it were me, I'd have quit long ago.

78
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,300
What's the point of bullying interns

79
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,230
to feel better about yourself?

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,390
Who are you? Which department are you in?

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,650
That's none of your business!

82
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,110
Su?

83
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,670
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

84
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,250
I received the call last night

85
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,300
and knew you'd be coming today.

86
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,670
Your office is ready.

87
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,190
Okay.

88
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,670
You're Gu Nian, right?

89
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,190
Yes.

90
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,870
Nice to meet you.

91
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,350
Nice to meet you.

92
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,950
I've seen your resume. It's quite interesting.

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,510
Let me introduce you.

94
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,870
This is our Director Su, the leader of

95
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,710
the expert technical team hired externally by our company.

96
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,030
Here's what we'll do: I'll handle your paperwork.

97
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,140
Hello, Director Su.

98
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,170
Director Su, I'm really sorry.

99
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,190
Then just don't do things you need to apologize for.

100
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,870
This way, please, both of you.

101
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,680
Follow me.

102
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,710
You want me to beat you

103
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,270
so that you can help Gu Nian get an internal referral to Shiyi Technology?

104
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,310
Do you think that's reasonable?

105
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,790
If you don't even have this much determination,

106
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,800
how are you supposed to play the big shot and work your magic at the company?

107
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,430
Pass me the ball!

108
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,310
Why do I need to come to the company?

109
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,590
I can just coach from the sidelines.

110
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,170
You don't know God Su at all.

111
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,770
Have you heard of the Revisit Project?

112
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,390
I have.

113
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,550
I interned there.

114
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,830
I think the slogan was something like...

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
"Revisit memories, simulate the future."

116
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,630
Right.

117
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,420
Do you know who developed the Revisit Project?

118
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,020
Don't tell me it's me.

119
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,110
It was you!

120
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,280
This time, you can't coach from the sidelines.

121
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,240
You have to coach on the field.

122
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,380
But don't worry.

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
You've got me as your top-notch assistant.

124
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,990
It's a win-win.

125
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,070
Jiang?

126
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,990
Do you know why I don't have any feelings for you?

127
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,060
Why?

128
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,710
You're too much of an emotionally dense guy.

129
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,670
Pass me the ball!

130
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,790
I'm a big shot now.

131
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,470
This is like using supercharged cheat codes.

132
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,870
I don't need you anymore.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,030
No matter what kind of codes you're using,

134
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,700
do you understand when they ask you technical questions?

135
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,910
You'll still have to ask me when the time comes.

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,190
This is where you don't understand.

137
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,170
The first rule of being a big shot is...

138
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,490
to maintain an air of mystery.

139
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,510
However,

140
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,470
to be honest,

141
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,590
I really like this hidden boss identity

142
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,150
of yours.

143
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,670
Here, try this.

144
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,920
Coffee brewed by a hidden big shot

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,110
is really good.

146
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,230
Let me tell you,

147
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,820
I'm even more excited than you are now.

148
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,180
You have no idea

149
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,000
how much I was bullied by those people back then.

150
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,350
They insisted that they couldn't record my fingerprints even after the photo was done,

151
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,790
so it took two or three days before I could start the job.

152
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,470
And also,

153
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,659
when I was an intern,

154
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,600
I made over a hundred cups of coffee.

155
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,830
You need to be mentally prepared for that.

156
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,710
Have a seat. Wait a moment.

157
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,870
Let me tell you,

158
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,659
my mindset is different now.

159
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,830
These are all my main quests.

160
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,170
Piece of cake, of course.

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,250
I've already mastered it.

162
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,580
Here you go, boss.

163
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,990
This coffee brewed by Gu Nian is good.

164
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,790
I've got it all figured out for you.

165
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,710
If you follow the main storyline to level up and defeat monsters,

166
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,470
as a mere intern like you,

167
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,750
becoming a rising star in the workplace

168
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,110
will take forever.

169
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,190
This hidden big shot identity

170
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,110
shouldn't stay hidden—

171
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,110
we need to make use of it.

172
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,430
I have to carry you

173
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,100
to raid dungeons and take shortcuts,

174
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
marry a rich and handsome guy,

175
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,460
become the CEO,

176
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,300
and reach the pinnacle of life.

177
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,780
Do you have any plans?

178
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,230
The Revisit Project.

179
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,980
What's this Revisit Project?

180
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,130
The Revisit Project is a...

181
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,799
You must be the new colleagues, right?

182
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,390
I'm Bai Guo from the Planning Department.

183
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,570
If you need anything in the future,

184
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,870
just let me know.

185
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,250
Nice to meet you. I'm Gu Nian.

186
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,220
Nice to meet you.

187
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,710
Nice to meet you.

188
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,990
Nice to meet you.

189
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,100
Oh my God, someone's jumped off the building!

190
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,190
Call an ambulance!

191
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,150
Don't look. Let's go quickly!

192
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,160
Su Yin, what are you doing?

193
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,590
You scared her.

194
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,950
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,720
Director Su,

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,670
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,150
I just received a notice to

198
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,490
make coffee for you.

199
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,320
I'll make sure it's on your desk first thing tomorrow.

200
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,150
I'll take my leave now.

201
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,150
You two continue talking.

202
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,030
Bye-bye.

203
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,790
What's your relationship with Bai Guo?

204
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,590
You mentioned rescuing someone from dire straits.

205
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,750
It's her, isn't it?

206
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,910
Here's what we'll do next.

207
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,360
You go get some office supplies first

208
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,310
and familiarize yourself with the environment.

209
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,550
Let me get settled in, and then I'll show you the ropes.

210
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,990
Okay.

211
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,430
Thanks, boss.

212
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,290
Good luck.

213
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,820
Gu Nian!

214
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,820
It's really you.

215
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,860
Why are you here?

216
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,940
I received

217
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,060
an offer from the Finance Department here,

218
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,180
so I came to report.

219
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,660
Are you interning here too?

220
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,850
If I had known you were here,

221
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,940
I wouldn't have come.

222
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,180
I know you have a misunderstanding about me.

223
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I won't explain.

224
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,220
I absolutely won't explain anything to you.

225
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,380
I just want to tell you...

226
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,540
that before I graduated,

227
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,420
I voluntarily admitted my mistake to the school

228
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,830
and returned the Student Union's

229
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,540
funding for Guo Yongcheng over the years.

230
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,210
That's how I barely

231
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,770
managed to hold onto this internship.

232
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,980
My family really needs me to earn money

233
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,590
right now.

234
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,460
If you really don't want to see me,

235
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,990
I can leave.

236
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,540
Feng Huanan.

237
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,210
Su Yin, why are you here too?

238
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,940
Can't get rid of you, huh?

239
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,390
You two are really together now?

240
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,860
It's only been a few days,

241
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,900
and you've already swooped in?

242
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,820
Well, yeah.

243
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,230
She's with me now, both professionally and personally.

244
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,870
There's no place for you anymore. Please leave.

245
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,830
Gu Nian.

246
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,660
Have you really chosen him?

247
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,860
What's the point of asking this now?

248
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,790
Since you said you're leaving,

249
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,620
hurry up and go.

250
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,190
We all got in here through our own abilities.

251
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,630
Why should I listen to you?

252
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,020
Because I'm four levels above you.

253
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,820
It's office hours now.

254
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,910
Please stay away from my planning assistant.

255
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,000
Planning assistant?

256
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,870
I've just got special approval from the CEO's office.

257
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,500
The Revisit Project has officially launched.

258
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,950
The Technical Department will take the lead,

259
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,020
with the Marketing and Planning Departments coordinating.

260
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,980
Let's go. We have a meeting.

261
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,500
Director?

262
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,710
Su Yin.

263
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,030
What you've taken away step by step,

264
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,900
I will definitely take back step by step.

265
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,300
Bai Guo?

266
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,580
This is Gu Nian. You've met before.

267
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,670
This is Bai Guo.

268
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,260
The talented girl from the Planning Department.

269
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,460
All the previous proposals for the Revisit Project

270
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,190
were all written by her.

271
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,140
I went to great lengths

272
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,340
to bring her here as your mentor.

273
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,100
Hello, Mentor.

274
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,740
I'm Gu Nian.

275
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,740
Bai Guo.

276
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,820
Director Su, you're too kind.

277
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,110
I only got officially hired after more than a year of probation,

278
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,370
and for the Revisit Project,

279
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,950
I've just been assisting Mr. Ye.

280
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,860
I really don't deserve to be her mentor.

281
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,260
Achievements are always more important than titles.

282
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,620
Mr. Ye is the vice president.

283
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,110
How could he have time to write proposals?

284
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,340
Don't be so modest.

285
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,020
I could hear you talking about me from a mile away.

286
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,030
Director Su,

287
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,940
I'm Ye Weijian.

288
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,260
Come in.

289
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,420
Mr. Ye,

290
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,620
here's your coffee.

291
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,280
And here is the file you requested.

292
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,500
Why is the file a mess?

293
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,060
What's this nonsense?

294
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,460
Come here.

295
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,630
No, Mr. Ye...

296
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,420
Come here.

297
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,830
I... I just...

298
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,700
Listen, Gu Nian,

299
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,020
as a girl,

300
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,500
you just need to focus on looking pretty.

301
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,580
Find the right person,

302
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,650
stick with that right person,

303
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,140
and serve him well.

304
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,670
Mr. Ye.

305
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,900
I think you're right.

306
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,780
Let me tell you,

307
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,300
I know how to defend myself.

308
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,790
You dare to mess with me?

309
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,830
Gu Nian.

310
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,540
Don't forget

311
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,340
you're still on probation.

312
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,540
What?

313
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,260
Well, listen up,

314
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,160
I quit.

315
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,780
If you've got the guts, don't come back begging for your job back!

316
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,940
Hello, Mr. Y-Ye.

317
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,220
Sorry, I was just joking.

318
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,080
It's alright.

319
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,460
I guess seeing really is believing.

320
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,380
Director Su, it's only your first day at work,

321
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,500
and you've already taken swift action to establish

322
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,670
the preparatory team for the Revisit Project.

323
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,700
The CEO personally called each department,

324
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,380
asking us to fully cooperate with you.

325
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,340
So I rushed over to see

326
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,190
if there was anything I could help with.

327
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,380
You're too kind, Mr. Ye.

328
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,590
I'm truly sorry

329
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,230
that I've borrowed two people from your department.

330
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,790
I hadn't gotten the chance to tell you

331
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,820
before you came in person.

332
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,060
It's fine. It's fine.

333
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,580
My people are your people, aren't they?

334
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,420
However, I've been with

335
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,900
the company longer than you, after all.

336
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,820
If you had told me earlier,

337
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,300
I could have assigned you a planning manager.

338
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,500
Bai Guo is still a bit too young.

339
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,470
And who is this?

340
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,420
Um, Mr. Ye,

341
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,820
I'm the new intern.

342
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,700
My name is Gu Nian.

343
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,220
This won't do.

344
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,960
Both of them don't have much experience.

345
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
If the CEO finds out about this,

346
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,900
it'll seem like I'm not taking this seriously.

347
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,500
The CEO already knows.

348
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,540
I specifically requested these two from the CEO.

349
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,410
The Revisit Project is still in its initial stages.

350
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,030
If we make too big a fuss about it,

351
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,980
and the results don't meet expectations,

352
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,620
wouldn't that be a waste of company resources?

353
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,780
Bai Guo is well-acquainted with the project and very capable.

354
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,580
Let's go with her.

355
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,420
As for Gu Nian, although she's new,

356
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,710
she's very quick-witted.

357
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,500
What we need right now are creativity and ideas.

358
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,660
How about this:

359
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
if it really doesn't work out,

360
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,500
I'll come to you for someone new after a month.

361
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,430
Does that sound okay to you?

362
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,420
Alright, we'll do as you say.

363
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,580
If you need anything, let's keep in touch.

364
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,590
I'll take my leave now.

365
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,830
Gu?

366
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,580
Tell me.

367
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,460
You, Bai Guo, and that Mr. Ye,

368
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,100
what's going on between you three?

369
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,060
It's really strange.

370
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,590
What's so strange about it?

371
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,470
We're just newcomers.

372
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,260
Don't we need to show some respect when asking for favors?

373
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,020
You're still trying to fool me, aren't you?

374
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,500
Look at Bai Guo—

375
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,950
she's terrified of Mr. Ye.

376
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,620
And you put on a fake smile for Mr. Ye,

377
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,780
full of disdain.

378
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:16,970
And also,

379
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,460
last time when we were making coffee,

380
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
you almost cried when you saw Bai Guo.

381
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,220
Now you transferred her to our team.

382
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,340
And you still say there's nothing strange?

383
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,020
Didn't you tell me before we came here?

384
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,030
The personnel in this company are complex,

385
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,180
and the workplace here is treacherous.

386
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,460
I need to know who's a friend or foe

387
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,670
so that I can survive, right?

388
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,620
I'll tell you, okay?

389
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,859
Guo,

390
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,470
don't send money to us anymore.

391
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,330
It's not easy for you to make a living alone in a big city.

392
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,220
We've almost paid off our debts here at home.

393
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,420
If your father and I save a bit,

394
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,050
we should be able to pay everything off by the end of this year.

395
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,810
You looked thinner during our last video call.

396
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,420
Don't be so hard on yourself.

397
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,980
The coffee is good.

398
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,590
In less than two weeks,

399
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,050
Bai Guo will jump from the company's rooftop.

400
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,660
You guessed it right.

401
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,900
I came back to save her.

402
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,830
Does that have something to do with that Mr. Ye?

403
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,230
Bai Guo was caught by Ye Weijian's wife.

404
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,140
Everyone in the company received an anonymous email,

405
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,500
saying she seduced Mr. Ye to climb the corporate ladder.

406
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,900
Even though she was being falsely accused,

407
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,750
no one believed what she said.

408
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,700
Did you just stand by and watch then?

409
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,900
I did step up.

410
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,780
But I ended up being smeared instead.

411
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,500
They said I was the same kind of person as Bai Guo.

412
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,860
Inadvertently, I also offended Ye Weijian.

413
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,060
Soon enough, I was sidelined.

414
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
He made things difficult for me at every turn at work.

415
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,460
In the end, I just resigned and went home

416
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
to become a full-time wife.

417
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,460
Well, you did the right thing.

418
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,420
Saving a life is the top priority.

419
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,590
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on my mentor.

420
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,180
I still haven't figured out

421
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,460
how to handle this matter.

422
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,430
Coming back to the company wasn't part of my plan either.

423
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,540
You and Feng Huanan becoming colleagues

424
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,100
is something that wasn't in my memories at all.

425
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,860
One Feng Huanan is enough to throw you off?

426
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,820
Let's just do what we need to do.

427
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,700
I'm just worried that I might be able to change the process

428
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,970
but not the outcome.

429
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,180
If something goes wrong,

430
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,300
this cheat code of mine

431
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,620
will be useless.

432
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,770
If I were to drag you down with me, wouldn't that be a total disaster?

433
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,660
Why are you so pessimistic?

434
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,020
Didn't you say

435
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,140
that when we team up,

436
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,460
we're unstoppable?

437
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,140
You need to be braver than me.

438
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,180
Is the work in the preparatory team tiring?

439
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,560
You don't even reply to my messages.

440
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,650
Come to my office for a moment.

441
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,010
There's some internal work for our department

442
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,660
that I need to brief you on.

443
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,140
Why did you move everything

444
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,620
into your office?

445
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,260
Given the identity I'm assuming,

446
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,420
won't I have a tough battle to fight?

447
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
I'll be living here from now on.

448
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,050
Impressive.

449
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,730
Boss, look.

450
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,340
I found the initial version

451
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,820
of the Revisit Project on your computer.

452
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,130
This thing...

453
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,660
I think I've seen it before.

454
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,180
Jiang,

455
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,370
see if it's this one.

456
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,820
This is, at most, a model.

457
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,260
It needs to be plugged in somewhere.

458
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,460
It's like an eye massager.

459
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,910
But the icon is 3D glasses.

460
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,790
Logically, it must be related to the eyes.

461
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,060
This thing obviously requires fingerprint unlocking,

462
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,620
but why can't even I unlock it?

463
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,380
Is there a possibility

464
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,140
that you still have one more finger to try?

465
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,540
A shot in the dark that happened to hit.

466
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,850
She actually guessed it right.

467
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,860
It wasn't about guessing.

468
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,380
It's about

469
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,580
intelligence.

470
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,740
Why is this different

471
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,760
from what I saw before?

472
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,540
Let me see.

473
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,220
Boss,

474
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,580
in the backend of this computer,

475
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,340
there's a plugin with Gu Nian's name on it.

476
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,740
Should we run it?

477
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,100
Wait, why would it be related to me?

478
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,380
I've only had one encounter with him before.

479
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,420
Let's run it and see.

480
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,620
What if it transports you to the future?

481
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,980
Wouldn't that mess everything up here?

482
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,220
Wouldn't that be great?

483
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,580
Why should only you be able to come to my timeline

484
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,980
while I can't go to yours?

485
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,460
I've never played

486
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,380
such an exciting game before.

487
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,100
Run it.

488
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,990
It's not that mysterious. Not that mysterious.

489
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,430
We can first look at it on the screen.

490
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,630
Put down the glasses first.

491
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,930
♫Running through my life♫

492
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,760
♫Searching for a diamond in the dark♫

493
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,940
♫Leaving all behind♫

494
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,870
♫Running is only we should do♫

495
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,260
♫Let's just pray♫

496
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,170
♫Pray♫

497
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,680
♫Let's just pray♫

498
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,540
♫The dream will come alive♫

499
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,400
♫Let's just pray♫

500
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,250
♫Pray♫

501
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,620
♫Let's just pray♫

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,850
♫Just keep running my life♫

503
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,960
So the source of all this

504
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,070
is actually a closed loop I connected myself?

505
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,750
Now it's my turn to push this project forward?

506
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,710
So back then, how involved were you

507
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,780
with the Revisit Project?

508
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
There wasn't a preparatory team back then.

509
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,190
I don't know how many technical staff

510
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,950
there were either.

511
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,830
I just helped Bai Guo collect some materials.

512
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,610
Where's Bai Guo?

513
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
She was just here a moment ago.

514
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,020
It's okay. I'll go look for her.

515
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,900
Alright, go ahead.

516
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,910
Do you remember any of the videos in here?

517
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,960
I didn't film them.

518
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,980
How would I know?

519
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,630
Mentor?

520
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,620
What's going on?

521
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,130
It's nothing. I just came to wash my hands.

522
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,350
I accidentally got something dirty on me earlier.

523
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,710
Did that Mr. Ye give you a hard time?

524
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,270
No, what are you talking about?

525
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,380
How could he possibly give me a hard time?

526
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,850
Isn't he going on a business trip?

527
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,380
He asked me to book a ticket for him.

528
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,180
Mentor, you have me as your apprentice now.

529
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,040
From now on, you can leave

530
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,950
these small tasks to me.

531
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,860
Gu Nian, you're luckier than I am.

532
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,260
You got involved in a big project as soon as you joined the company.

533
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,580
You must seize this opportunity well.

534
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,780
I know you're enthusiastic and kind-hearted,

535
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,620
but you don't need to help me.

536
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,260
If you make a mistake,

537
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,820
you'll have to take the blame.

538
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,020
There might not be anyone to help you.

539
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,200
If you were to accidentally lose your job, that would be terrible.

540
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,420
Losing a job isn't the worst thing.

541
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,910
What's most valuable

542
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,580
is life.

543
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,890
Mentor,

544
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,210
let's make the most of this project

545
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,460
and ride the waves to success.

546
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,500
And

547
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,940
if you run into any other difficulties,

548
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,910
you can always turn to me.

549
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,430
Don't you have me, your little apprentice?

550
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,520
Right?

551
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,300
Come in.

552
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,970
Mr. Su.

553
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,110
Mr. Ye, you're still working so late?

554
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,230
You're truly dedicated.

555
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm here to request some funds.

556
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,620
You could have just followed the regular process.

557
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,630
You didn't need to come to me yourself.

558
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,230
Have a seat.

559
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,900
Finance says this concerns the project,

560
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,220
and it's a considerable amount.

561
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
So, it needs your personal approval.

562
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,060
Alright.

563
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,460
I'll take a close look at it in a moment.

564
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,870
By the way, Mr. Su,

565
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,510
I've been thinking.

566
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,220
I still think Bai Guo is still too young.

567
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,890
I'm afraid she might hinder your important work.

568
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,300
I'd better assign someone else to you.

569
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,270
Mr. Ye,

570
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,300
please don't trouble yourself with this small matter.

571
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,020
I think Bai Guo is great. Let's stick with her.

572
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,420
Mr. Su, you've just joined the company,

573
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,510
and you already think so highly of her.

574
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,730
You really have an eye for talent.

575
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,020
Thank you for your generosity, Mr. Ye.

576
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,310
It's not a big deal.

577
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,430
She's just a junior clerk.

578
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,310
The Revisit Project.

579
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,270
[Project Expense Approval Form]

580
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,380
The CEO told me about it.

581
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,100
I think it's excellent

582
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,700
and very compelling.

583
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,200
Although it's not yet technically perfect,

584
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,800
and the future returns are quite uncertain,

585
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,230
it's still worth a shot.

586
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,210
But you should know, Mr. Su,

587
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,780
that technological innovation

588
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,390
will require a lot of time,

589
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,390
and costs will increase day by day.

590
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,970
To put it bluntly,

591
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,850
this is not a small amount.

592
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,100
With our company's current resources alone,

593
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,660
we won't be able to support

594
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,510
the development of this technology.

595
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,270
Mr. Ye,

596
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,840
please speak your mind.

597
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,470
Good.

598
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,300
I just like how straightforward and decisive

599
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,870
you young people are.

600
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,740
The Revisit Project needs financial backing.

601
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,300
I know a big shot in the industry

602
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,670
who's very interested in virtual reality.

603
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,820
You share the same alma mater.

604
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,350
If you can impress him,

605
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,670
it might be a way out.

606
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,140
Perhaps we could even

607
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
collaborate with their project team on research and development.

608
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,860
Would you like to give it a try?

609
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,590
This sly old fox

610
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,470
is already impatiently

611
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,420
trying to put me in my place.

612
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,250
Mr. Ye,

613
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,390
I was specifically brought in by the CEO to handle the technical aspects only.

614
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,400
Am I also responsible for fundraising?

615
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,540
Those who are capable shoulder more responsibility.

616
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,380
The CEO runs a large business,

617
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,890
and the pressure is high. It's not easy for anyone.

618
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,790
Look, as soon as you joined the company,

619
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,270
the CEO specially set up a preparatory team for you,

620
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,020
ready to recruit more people at any time.

621
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,820
All of these require substantial funds

622
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,820
to support.

623
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,240
You're young.

624
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,270
What you carry on your shoulders isn't just dreams,

625
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,510
but also responsibility.

626
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,070
Alright.

627
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,330
I'll give it a try then.

628
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,970
No wonder the CEO thinks so highly of you.

629
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,300
You indeed have courage.

630
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,050
I'll wait for your good news then.

631
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,510
Please carry on with your work.

632
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,020
Okay.

633
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,520
Hello.

634
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,060
I'd like to book a flight ticket for Mr. Ye.

635
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,820
Then just go ahead and book it.

636
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,850
After booking, just submit the ticket for reimbursement.

637
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,830
The reimbursement

638
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,060
will be paid with next month's salary.

639
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
So, I have to book the ticket first

640
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,740
to get the expense receipt?

641
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,780
Yeah, is there a problem?

642
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,900
I've only been working here for a few days.

643
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,070
I haven't even received my first paycheck yet.

644
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,420
How am I supposed to pay for it upfront?

645
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,970
That's not something I can help with.

646
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,360
This is just how the company's financial management system works.

647
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,460
Everyone has to pay upfront and then get reimbursed.

648
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,460
Aren't you targeting interns with this policy?

649
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,520
The company policy applies to everyone equally.

650
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,830
It's the same for anyone.

651
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,970
Wait, what kind of policy is this?

652
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,160
Sis, sis,

653
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,820
could you please give me a loan form?

654
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,190
I've seen it.

655
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,770
I've seen the loan process

656
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,710
in our company manual.

657
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,060
Well, I'll take her to get her leader's signature first.

658
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,180
After it's signed,

659
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,580
I'll have her come back to you for the loan process,

660
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,260
okay?

661
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,680
See how he handles things?

662
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,580
Thank you.

663
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,060
Bring it back to me after it's signed.

664
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,590
Thank you.

665
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,220
What did I say yesterday?

666
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,490
You show your sense of responsibility,

667
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,230
and the CEO will think more highly of you.

668
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,760
I'll give the fundraising a try.

669
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,220
Could you give me the contact information?

670
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,790
Contact information?

671
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,470
Double Jokers.

672
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,570
Gu Nian, Gu Nian.

673
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,610
Well, here.

674
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,260
It's fine

675
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,210
you throw your tantrum with us usually,

676
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,300
but you're still just a young girl.

677
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,500
Don't be so hard-line,

678
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,730
always charging headfirst.

679
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,540
Got it?

680
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,260
Did someone say something to you?

681
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,900
Do I need to hear this from others?

682
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,830
Isn't that just your style?

683
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,440
Thank you for your kindness.

684
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,190
I'll solve my own problems myself.

685
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,990
Take it.

686
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,820
It's no trouble at all.

687
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,020
Don't feel burdened by it.

688
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,300
I lost.

689
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,170
Mr. Li

690
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:22,980
from Lipu Technology.

691
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,370
Take a photo of it.

692
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,180
I thought you were friends with Mr. Li.

693
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,180
You only have the reception's number?

694
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,510
Don't put it that way.

695
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,980
Although the companies are similar,

696
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,460
our product positioning is different.

697
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,530
That's true.

698
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,530
Mr. Ye,

699
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,630
I just happened to help my mentor

700
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,940
book a flight ticket for you.

701
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,840
Could you sign this loan form for me?

702
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,540
You spent the whole morning on such a simple task,

703
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,820
and it still ended up with me, huh?

704
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,010
Mr. Ye,

705
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,950
your requirements for interns

706
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,430
are much stricter than those of our Technical Department.

707
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,890
They need to be polished in every way,

708
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,840
well-versed in social etiquette,

709
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,190
and have money in their pockets

710
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,790
to cover expenses for the leaders at any time.

711
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,060
I know

712
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,980
this amount of money is nothing to you,

713
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,070
but a flight ticket

714
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,830
is an intern's food budget for a month.

715
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,260
Don't you think this is a bit inappropriate?

716
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Mr. Su, you really look out for your own people.

717
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,940
No wonder the new team is so united.

718
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,950
I should learn from you.

719
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,540
Alright, don't worry about the flight ticket.

720
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,180
I'll have another intern handle it.

721
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,310
Why are you getting involved in Bai Guo's affairs?

722
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,270
Well, I can't

723
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,960
let my Mentor jump into a fire.

724
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,670
I haven't even started on you yet.

725
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,490
What were you doing with him so early in the morning?

726
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,460
Don't mention it.

727
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,340
Our department is going to be busy in the coming days.

728
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,060
This Ye Weijian is really a bastard.

729
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,060
Bastard.

730
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,870
Sleazy bastard.

731
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,810
Boss,

732
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,310
I think the current color palette

733
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,620
is a bit too dark.

734
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,000
It doesn't give a vibe of hope.

735
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,750
We could change it to that grass green color.

736
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,160
I'm just making a suggestion—

737
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,740
thinking out loud.

738
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,620
Boss, Boss, good news!

739
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,060
I've made contact.

740
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,860
I have a senior  schoolmate working at Lipu Technology.

741
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,830
He knows a lot about Mr. Li's affairs.

742
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,700
Let's hear it.

743
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,100
You're sharp.

744
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,940
Tell us!

745
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,580
I know one of Mr. Li's secrets.
