4
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,030
Xi.

5
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,310
During this trip,

6
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,830
I prayed for your marriage.

7
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,260
It's said to be quite efficacious.

8
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,800
Aren't you off shift tomorrow morning?

9
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,870
You can take this time to meet him.

10
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,070
Don't worry. He's the one I carefully selected for you.

11
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,850
I've sent you the location.

12
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,290
You've always been capable since childhood.

13
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,670
Although you're a bit introverted,

14
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,230
you're quite mature.

15
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm just worried you think too much

16
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,340
and don't dare to try,

17
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,980
and your youth will slip away.

18
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,110
Xi, don't stay single

19
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,390
like me.

20
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,829
The reason why I want you to go on blind dates

21
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,910
is not for the sake of face or others' opinions.

22
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,910
I just don't want you to

23
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,790
avoid romantic relationships because of my failed marriage.

24
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,030
Do you understand?

25
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,020
Nian.

26
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,329
My mom is back.

27
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,130
I finally had a peaceful month,

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,670
and now she's starting to act up again.

29
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,260
Each time it gets more frightening.

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,470
Especially this blind date.

31
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,510
It's particularly scary.

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,910
I'll send you the location in a bit.

33
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,510
Come quickly.

34
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,630
I'm requesting first-level assistance.

35
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,100
Love you, love you.

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,080
Come as soon as you can.

37
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,710
Guess who I am.

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,150
What took you so long, Your Highness?

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,270
I'll beat you up.

40
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,810
I know it's you, Tu.

41
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,520
Why did you ask me to meet you here?

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,670
What's so urgent?

43
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,800
I've made an appointment with a real estate agent.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,990
Let's go view some houses later.

45
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,320
I've been thinking,

46
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,230
we should be able to rent

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,450
a small studio apartment together.

48
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,150
How about this?

49
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,470
If we're satisfied with the house,

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,540
we'll pack up our things after the New Year,

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,370
and move in right after.

52
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,150
What do you think?

53
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,590
Sounds good to me.

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,550
No problem.

55
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,860
But I think

56
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,890
you shouldn't rush into this.

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,470
Because in a couple of days,

58
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,190
I might have a surprise for you.

59
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,310
You have a surprise for me too?

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,580
Did you buy a lottery ticket?

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,790
No.

62
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,830
I've been preparing for

63
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,390
the written test of an investment group, right?

64
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,030
All my previous jobs were as a contractor.

65
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,710
As a contractor, you definitely

66
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,140
have to work for others

67
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,710
and cater to the clients' whims, right?

68
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,089
But if this works out,

69
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,190
I'll have a say

70
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,730
in future projects.

71
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,760
And I'll make more money than before.

72
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,390
That sounds really great.

73
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,710
The salary must be very high too, right?

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,780
It'll definitely be higher than my current salary.

75
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,870
But

76
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,630
since I have to start at entry-level,

77
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,990
you know,

78
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,630
I need to accumulate projects.

79
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,020
I'll definitely make more and more money in the future.

80
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,750
Don't worry about the money.

81
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,260
I've got your back.

82
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,790
I went to the karaoke bar this morning

83
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,909
and collected all my wages for this month.

84
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,550
Don't worry, it's clean money.

85
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,390
After we live together,

86
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,510
you'll control the purse strings.

87
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,700
It's your area of expertise.

88
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,070
You quit?

89
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,430
I know

90
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,350
you don't like me working in that kind of place.

91
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,310
So I quit.

92
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,710
But don't worry.

93
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,190
I've been looking for a job.

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,410
Actually, recently,

95
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,710
I've been thinking about

96
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,910
working as a forewoman on an international cruise.

97
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,340
The salary is good,

98
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,820
the tips are high,

99
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,340
and the guests are of high quality.

100
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,550
The only downside is

101
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,590
they work one month on, one month off.

102
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,640
So I wanted to ask for your opinion

103
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,070
if I should go for the interview.

104
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,909
Thank you, Tu.

105
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,440
Thank you

106
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,490
for thinking of me in every way.

107
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,670
Close your eyes.

108
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,310
Be good.

109
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,100
Don't open them.

110
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,670
What are you doing?

111
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,909
What are you up to?

112
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,510
Three,

113
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,230
two,

114
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,390
one.

115
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,010
You can open them now.

116
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,710
How does it look?

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,660
Very pretty.

118
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,440
It looks even better than I imagined.

119
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,990
This is very expensive.

120
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,950
If you like it,

121
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,470
wear it

122
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,350
to your next interview.

123
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,650
It's guaranteed to help you pass.

124
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,550
You treat me so well.

125
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,400
You know,

126
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,680
this feeling of the two of us

127
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,510
working together towards our future

128
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,110
is really wonderful.

129
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,270
Tu.

130
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,920
I might need your help with something.

131
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,790
What is it?

132
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,159
Well, actually,

133
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,909
the company I want to take the written test for

134
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,630
is Gu Nian's mother's company.

135
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,390
I took her out for dinner before, remember?

136
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,830
But it didn't go very well.

137
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,110
So I was thinking,

138
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,510
maybe I could give her a gift

139
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,070
and get her to put in a good word for me.

140
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,350
But I don't know what she likes.

141
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,060
Can you give me some advice?

142
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,690
Let's eat.

143
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,430
Darling.

144
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,150
Got it?

145
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,470
You still don't get it?

146
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,750
If it weren't for her family,

147
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,100
you wouldn't even get the chance to have this blind date with her, okay?

148
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,909
Right, darling?

149
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,230
This bad idea you came up with.

150
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,610
How could we compare to a real couple?

151
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,280
I could barely keep up the act just now.

152
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,920
I was just trying to help you out of a tight spot.

153
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,960
Let's just ignore the process.

154
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,120
That's true.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,930
I was so scared just now.

156
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,550
I thought that guy

157
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,950
almost called the matchmaker.

158
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,990
If he did, my mom would

159
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,990
probably put on her little high heels

160
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,030
and block me at the hospital entrance.

161
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,809
That would be even more frightening than standing him up.

162
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,730
Look.

163
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,470
Our moms

164
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,610
are of completely different personalities,

165
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,470
but they have the same mission.

166
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,270
Your mom doesn't interfere with your love life and marriage.

167
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,980
But she plans my career.

168
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,500
Let me ask you,

169
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,410
marrying the wrong person or choosing the wrong career,

170
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,420
which is worse?

171
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,170
Well, as for work,

172
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,510
it's definitely more important

173
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,870
to choose a career you like.

174
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,350
But you have Su Yin.

175
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,110
He surely knows what path you'll take.

176
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,810
Maybe he can even convince your mom.

177
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,710
Forget about him.

178
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,760
He hasn't even figured out his own plans yet.

179
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,450
Otherwise, why would he come back to complicate things for me?

180
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:08,950
That's true.

181
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,020
Why don't you consider doing as your mother says?

182
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,470
Just thinking about those two gives me a headache.

183
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,140
It's like having two moms.

184
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,550
You should be grateful.

185
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,180
At least you're not fighting alone.

186
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,910
Unlike me,

187
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,660
fighting a lone battle.

188
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,670
I'm so worried.

189
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,910
Don't worry.

190
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,590
Every hurdle is tough, but you'll get through them all!

191
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,070
You still have me, don't you?

192
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,410
Thank goodness I have you.

193
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,870
Mr. Meng.

194
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,710
Aren't you that...

195
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,430
Feng.

196
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,880
Right, Feng.

197
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,110
What are you here for?

198
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,640
About the venue,

199
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,460
Wang is liaising with you, right?

200
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,810
Mr. Meng, I'm not here

201
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,590
for the venue.

202
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,710
I came here this time

203
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,730
hoping Mr. Wang would give me an opportunity.

204
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,310
Opportunity? What opportunity?

205
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,300
I came here and visited your company last time, right?

206
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,470
And I felt

207
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,910
the management and operations here are very professional.

208
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,140
There's great potential for development and growth.

209
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,830
As someone who's about to graduate,

210
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,930
I hope I can have

211
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,310
a good opportunity like this

212
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,550
and get involved in depth.

213
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,330
This place is full of old folks.

214
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,750
The work is all about serving people.

215
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520
For a talented graduate like you,

216
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,950
wouldn't it be a waste of your talents?

217
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,440
It's not a waste, Mr. Meng.

218
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,150
And I really don't think it's just serving people.

219
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,500
If

220
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,570
I carry respect

221
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
and care for the elderly in my heart,

222
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,320
then it's not just about serving people anymore.

223
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,350
It becomes care and nurturing.

224
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,110
What a great virtue this is.

225
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,180
This is public service.

226
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,030
You...

227
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,070
You came here asking for a job.

228
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,830
What are your strengths?

229
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,650
You even lost two games of Go to me.

230
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,900
To be honest, Mr. Meng,

231
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,870
although your business is large,

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,070
I've done some background research.

233
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,200
The costs are really high.

234
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,550
From what I understand,

235
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,310
although your Health and Wellness Center

236
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,430
has been operating well since its establishment,

237
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,010
if you want to recover the costs,

238
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,340
it might take about three to five years longer

239
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,550
than the time needed under normal circumstances.

240
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,230
Here's

241
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,950
some research I've done

242
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,030
and some market research reports.

243
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,940
I was planning to give these to Mr. Wang.

244
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,270
But since I've run into you.

245
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,910
Come with me.

246
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,070
Jiang.

247
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,390
Why did you call me here?

248
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,110
I just got off the train.

249
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,390
I was planning to go straight to the Health and Wellness Center.

250
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,010
You haven't submitted your graduation thesis, right?

251
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,710
Yes, that's right.

252
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,350
Listen,

253
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,830
the department is looking for you everywhere.

254
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,110
They've circulated a notice of criticism of you,

255
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,430
and they said if you didn't show up soon,

256
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,150
they'd contact Su Yin's grandfather.

257
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,130
Jiang.

258
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,150
Help me stall them, okay?

259
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,790
Just for half a day.

260
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,390
I need to resolve Feng Huanan's matter first.

261
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,690
Gu Nian.

262
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,010
Which matter is more important?

263
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,360
If you still want to use our boss's identity

264
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,200
to get by,

265
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,180
come with me.

266
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,410
Let's go!

267
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,760
President.

268
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,260
You're here.

269
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,390
You're really amazing.

270
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,060
I can't believe you won over Grandpa Meng.

271
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,870
You know what, Gu Nian, it was really a lucky coincidence.

272
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,760
I couldn't believe that was really him.

273
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,830
And little did I expect that

274
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,950
he would be so interested in my model.

275
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,190
Well, I guess

276
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,030
everything happens for a reason.

277
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,350
Uncle Wang.

278
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,540
Have a seat.

279
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,410
Feng.

280
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,940
Mr. Meng has given his instructions.

281
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,270
He told me to ask for your resume,

282
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,890
saying with your business acumen,

283
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,390
it's a waste for you to just intern on projects.

284
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,980
He wants to know if you're interested

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,250
in working at the company headquarters.

286
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,760
But of course,

287
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
you'll need to pass the written test and interview as per the procedure.

288
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,930
Don't worry, Uncle Wang.

289
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,440
With President's abilities,

290
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,760
the written test won't be a problem for him at all.

291
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,520
Uncle Wang.

292
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,590
Please rest assured.

293
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,070
I will prepare well.

294
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
I'll do my best.

295
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,870
Good.

296
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,790
Nian, Feng has already pronounced himself.

297
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,230
But I heard from Master that

298
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,550
you haven't even filled out the form yet.

299
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,100
Well, Uncle Wang.

300
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,740
Please cover for me.

301
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,990
You know very well

302
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,390
how impulsive I can be.

303
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,640
If I accidentally pass the exam and get in,

304
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
and end up upsetting some uncle or auntie,

305
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,600
wouldn't that be a big problem?

306
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,310
You want me to cover for you?

307
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,510
You're well aware of

308
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,550
Master's temper.

309
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,690
But I've brought you

310
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,760
a capable man, right?

311
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,550
My mom is so smart

312
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,370
and so good at business.

313
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,480
She won't lose out.

314
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,270
Alright.

315
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,950
You two, mother and daughter,

316
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,310
are equally stubborn.

317
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,190
I guess for the next few months,

318
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,570
I'll have to keep Master in a good mood.

319
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,670
Thank you, my dear Uncle Wang.

320
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,830
You're always the best to me.

321
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,610
Well then, Uncle Wang,

322
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,190
we'll leave you to your work.

323
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,110
See you at the performance.

324
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,800
Alright.

325
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,680
Bye-bye.

326
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,470
Bye-bye.

327
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,580
Let's go.

328
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,540
Wait a moment.

329
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,430
Uncle Wang, this is some local specialty handmade by my mom.

330
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,820
It's pickled chili. Please try it.

331
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,110
Oh, you shouldn't have.

332
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,150
I can't accept this, I really can't.

333
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,510
Please take it, please.

334
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,380
Uncle Wang.

335
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,760
Just take it and give it a try.

336
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,570
Yes, my mom specially made it.

337
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,150
It's all-natural, organic, and pollution-free.

338
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,930
Please try it.

339
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,110
Alright. Thank you then.

340
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,220
Let's go.

341
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,970
See you later, Uncle Wang.

342
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,870
Okay, good luck.

343
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,950
Goodbye, Uncle Wang.

344
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,680
Bye-bye.

345
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,370
You need to whip it in circles.

346
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:24,920
Okay.

347
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,930
Last time when I treated you to dinner,

348
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,990
you didn't enjoy it, right?

349
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,660
So I've been thinking how I could make it up to you.

350
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,950
I asked Lyu Tu and found out

351
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,830
that you like handmade chocolates very much.

352
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,550
That's why I found this place.

353
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,550
But please don't laugh at me.

354
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,370
This is also my first time making them.

355
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,920
It's okay, I know how.

356
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,160
Now you know why Tu is my best friend.

357
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,820
She knows all my hobbies.

358
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,850
How's the consistency

359
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,930
of my whipped cream?

360
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,660
Whip it a little longer,

361
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,450
and whip it in circles.

362
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,280
Okay.

363
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,650
You're so versatile.

364
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,770
In the future,

365
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,840
I'll definitely learn more from you.

366
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,560
Why don't you tell me about Gu?

367
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,610
Although I'm far from his level,

368
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,810
you can help me know more about him,

369
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,050
and I'll try to measure up to him.

370
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,170
Actually, my dad didn't leave me many stories.

371
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,450
But making handmade chocolates

372
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,120
is something my dad brought me to do when I was little.

373
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,950
He said,

374
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,850
"As a girl, you should find some sweetness for yourself.

375
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,130
Even in times of misfortune,

376
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,450
you should find happiness for yourself."

377
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,330
Gu had a point.

378
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,410
Look.

379
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,220
How's the consistency now?

380
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,450
Is it okay?

381
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,250
Let me taste it.

382
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,730
This doesn't taste like it's your first time making this.

383
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,850
Are you kidding? Don't you know who my master is?

384
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,290
Put it directly into the pastry bag.

385
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,170
Just put it in?

386
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,570
Yes.

387
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,100
Okay.

388
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,530
Let me help you.

389
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,260
Don't waste it.

390
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,770
This spoonful is a bit too much, isn't it?

391
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,370
It's okay.

392
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,810
One spoonful.

393
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,010
Put it a bit more inside.

394
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,200
Right. This way,

395
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,050
it'll be easier to squeeze.

396
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:08,780
Alright.

397
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,300
Is this okay, Master?

398
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,970
It's good.

399
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,730
Alright.

400
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:16,089
And then...

401
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:16,450
Next.

402
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,650
Look, next,

403
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,609
you must push it down to the bottom,

404
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,930
then cut an opening first.

405
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,970
♫Nobody knows♫

406
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,130
♫This feeling I behold♫

407
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,340
♫I feel younger but I'm wrong♫

408
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,790
♫I've seen highs♫

409
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,240
♫I've seen lows♫

410
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,810
♫These days come and go♫

411
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,210
♫Some beautiful, some cold♫

412
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,340
♫I've been walking on my own♫

413
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,550
♫It's like I can't move on♫

414
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,430
♫Oh♫

415
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,450
Should I mix these two powders together?

416
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,610
Yes, yes, just mix the two powders together.

417
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,200
♫I can't move on♫

418
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,800
This smells quite nice.

419
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,390
♫Even if I want to♫

420
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,980
♫These days come and go♫

421
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,460
What are you doing, President?

422
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,620
♫It's like I can't move on♫

423
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,090
Oh my god.

424
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,610
You got

425
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,200
it all over yourself.

426
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,600
♫Oh, to let go♫

427
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,720
♫This future so unknown♫

428
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,850
♫All these wounds that I've sewn♫

429
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,350
♫Scars remind me of home♫

430
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,880
♫So, when you fall♫

431
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,650
♫It doesn't matter anymore♫

432
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,340
♫I don't feel much at all♫

433
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,290
♫It's like I can't move on♫

434
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:14,670
♫Oh♫

435
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,090
♫Woo♫

436
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,880
♫I can't move on♫

437
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,100
♫Even if I want to♫

♫These days come and go♫

♫It's like I can't move on♫

♫Oh♫

441
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,910
♫These days come and go♫

442
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:50,130
♫It's like I can't move on♫

443
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:08,850
Jiang.

444
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,570
Jiang.

445
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,170
How's it going inside?

446
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,930
You know what?

447
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,970
I'm shocked.

448
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,760
When do you think he got it straight?

449
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,090
Got what straight? Keep talking.

450
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,010
As soon as he went in,

451
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,020
without saying a single word about professional issues,

452
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,250
he started writing an 8,000-word self-criticism

453
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,290
while talking.

454
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,210
He's the professor's star pupil to begin with.

455
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,330
And since he behaved like that,

456
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,770
the professor couldn't say anything harsh to him anymore.

457
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,700
Then why hasn't he come out yet?

458
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,460
He won't be out anytime soon.

459
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,290
There's still a third of that self-criticism left to write.

460
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,740
Right.

461
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,090
Let's hurry up and go.

462
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,130
If we're late for the performance later,

463
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,850
President will have my head.

464
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,700
Let's go, let's go.

465
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,250
Well, you go ahead.

466
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,210
I'll wait for Boss.

467
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:42,850
You go first.

468
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,340
Why should you wait for him?

469
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,370
It's not something you should worry about.

470
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,370
Come on, let's go.

471
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,650
Tu.

472
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,890
I'm here.

473
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,700
This is for you.

474
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,930
Handmade chocolates again?

475
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,490
Did you make them?

476
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,540
I'll pass.

477
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,810
No, it's different this time.

478
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,610
Open it and have a look.

479
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,330
Come on.

480
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,290
What's different?

481
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,290
Well,

482
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,700
the ones I usually make

483
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,530
are indeed a bit mediocre,

484
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,660
but this time it's different.

485
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,930
I bought these specially for you.

486
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,650
To thank you, the great matchmaker.

487
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,210
What matchmaker?

488
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,020
Wasn't it you who told Huanan

489
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,250
to take me to make chocolates

490
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,370
and then confess his love to me?

491
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,700
I said yes.

492
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,370
You know what?

493
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:20,890
The first kiss

494
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,450
wasn't quite what I imagined.

495
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,500
Kissing my prince charming

496
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,330
didn't feel as amazing as I thought it would,

497
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,450
but it was still kind of surreal.

498
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,180
Now that I started dating during graduation season,

499
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,440
do you think it's a slap in the face?

500
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,650
Yeah, it's indeed a bit of a slap in the face.

501
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,130
Even I feel a bit sore from that slap.

502
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,450
Hurry up and do your makeup.

503
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,360
Lead actress, break a leg.

504
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,610
I'm going to the bathroom.

505
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,190
Wait, try one first.

506
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,290
I'll try it when I come back.

507
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,000
Alright then.

508
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,370
So pretty.

509
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,320
♫Rain boots in my hand♫

510
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,020
♫The scene totally soaked♫

511
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:13,680
♫Without you by my side, I can't go back to the past♫

512
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,720
♫No sweetness of coffee, only a bitter smile♫

513
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,060
♫Who will pick up the lost memories♫

514
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,770
But I want to be responsible for you.

515
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,000
♫I had too much to drink last night, looking all miserable♫

516
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,900
♫Waiting alone for you to show up again♫

517
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,300
It was too wonderful.

518
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,250
I can't bear to part with you.

519
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:49,210
♫Turns out those things deep in my memory still surface from time to time♫

520
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,190
♫But actually, you've gone so far♫

521
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,430
♫I just saw a face similar to yours♫

522
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,060
♫About the next time we meet♫

523
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,890
President, we've finished with the costumes.

524
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,010
We'll go take care of other things then.

525
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,010
Alright, you go ahead.

526
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,060
I'll run through the lines again.

527
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,370
Okay, see you later, President.

528
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,760
Tu.

529
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,610
You're here.

530
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
Why are you here, Tu?

531
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,930
What's wrong?

532
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,970
The show is about to start, why aren't you getting ready...

533
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,450
The show has started long ago.

534
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,050
Well played.

535
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,490
W-What do you mean?

536
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,490
What do I mean?

537
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,400
You should know very well what I mean.

538
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,420
I'm pretty clear about it now, too.

539
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,450
What should I be clear about?

540
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,570
That slap just now was for Gu Nian.

541
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,750
This slap is for myself.

542
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,770
Didn't I tell you before that

543
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,370
I didn't need you to be responsible for me.

544
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,810
But why did you have to mess with Gu Nian?

545
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,250
Gu Nian is my best friend.

546
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,370
Now, you're toying with two girls at once.

547
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,780
You're quite something, aren't you?

548
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,490
Why are you being so tough on me?

549
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,920
Who was it?

550
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,210
Who told me to take her to make chocolates?

551
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,780
Wasn't it you?

552
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,370
Besides, didn't you know she likes me?

553
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,890
If it weren't for

554
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,650
the job opportunity in the investment group,

555
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,970
would I have stooped so low?

556
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,540
Don't you know what your best friend is like?

557
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:43,860
Tu.

558
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,250
Why are you getting worked up?

559
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,870
Of course I know what kind of person my best friend is.

560
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,200
I don't believe a single word you said.

561
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,780
If you really mean this,

562
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,020
it really hurts me.

563
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,250
The one who wants to plan for the future

564
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,330
with you now is me,

565
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,580
not Gu Nian.

566
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,450
Don't you know who you should side with?

567
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,970
Everything I've done...

568
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,410
Everything I've done

569
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,370
is for you.

570
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,970
You're doing it for yourself.

571
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,690
You think I don't know what you're up to?

572
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,050
You didn't wangle any benefit

573
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,560
from Senior before,

574
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,170
and now you've set your sights on Gu Nian.

575
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,490
Let me tell you, as long as I'm by Gu Nian's side,

576
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,290
you won't take the slightest advantage of her.

577
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,130
You'd better give up on this idea right now.

578
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,440
Attention, all departments. Attention, all departments.

579
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,820
Everyone, please don't be nervous.

580
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,930
The performance is about to begin.

581
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,810
Please, everyone, do

582
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,890
a final check before the performance.

583
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,290
I wish you all a successful performance.

584
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,340
After the performance,

585
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,570
everything will be over.

586
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,860
All personnel, please stand by.

587
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,440
Please stand by.

588
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,860
Teacher, let's go check out the new campus together.

589
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,680
Right.

590
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,790
The new campus looks really nice.

591
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,730
Kids,

592
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,050
you go ahead.

593
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,890
We'll be there shortly.

594
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,810
Alright, Teacher.

595
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,850
We'll go on ahead then.

596
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,410
Goodbye, Teacher.

597
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,490
Teacher, we're off.

598
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,600
Seeing these kids,

599
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,450
it reminds me of when we were young.

600
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,940
You know, when you first came here,

601
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,320
the mountains were green and the water was clear.

602
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,240
How beautiful the scenery was.

603
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,300
But in the blink of an eye,

604
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,770
our hair has turned gray.

605
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,290
My dear.

606
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,360
Having spent a lifetime in these mountains,

607
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,980
do you regret it?

608
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,410
With you here,

609
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,850
I have no regrets.

610
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,330
Look,

611
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,970
in the distance,

612
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,970
beyond the mountains,

613
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,530
there's light.

614
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,570
Because

615
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,130
you are the light for the kids.

616
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,170
And you are my light.

617
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,240
Play the music.

618
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,420
Slowly. Slowly.

619
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,540
Bravo! Bravo!

620
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,590
The performance was a great success.

621
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,780
The performance was a great success.

622
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,760
Congratulations. Congratulations.

623
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,820
Tu.

624
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,610
Can you give me another chance to explain?

625
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,770
You were the one who said that

626
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,370
you didn't have the courage to bear the weight of our love, right?

627
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,770
But look at you now.

628
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,370
Doesn't it show that deep down,

629
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,610
you still can't let go of me?

630
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,890
If that's the case, why

631
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,090
did you hastily push me away in the first place?

632
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,850
You can say it's over.

633
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,100
You can,

634
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,610
but I can't.

635
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,530
Let me tell you.

636
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,770
What are you doing?

637
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,770
Let go of me.

638
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,370
What are you doing?

639
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,930
What's this all about?

640
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,370
Are you crazy?

641
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,570
Tu.

642
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,420
Tu, listen to me.

643
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,290
You're the only woman I've ever loved,

644
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,170
you know?

645
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,810
You're the woman I want to be responsible for for the rest of my life.

646
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,420
Between Gu Nian and me,

647
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,450
it was all her initiative.

648
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,650
You know this, don't you?

649
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,250
She threw herself at me.

650
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,130
She offered herself to me.

651
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,110
What could I do?

652
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
Could I have said,

653
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,150
"Don't come near me?"

654
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,660
Could I have done that?

655
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,040
Or should I have come

656
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,210
to tell you

657
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,050
what Gu Nian did to me?

658
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,930
Like, all kinds of things.

659
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,890
Wouldn't that make it seem like I was trying to drive a wedge between you two?

660
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,250
Tu.

661
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,870
If I hadn't grown up without resources

662
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,170
and connections,

663
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,650
would I be in this situation?

664
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,570
Why would I put myself through all this?

665
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,090
The reason I'm telling you all this

666
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,370
is because I feel you're the only one who knows me

667
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
and understand me.

668
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,660
So I've always been very clear

669
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,970
about what I want,

670
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,850
including in matters of the heart.

671
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,450
Get lost!

672
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,010
Let go!

673
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,010
Let go of me!

674
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,810
How was it?

675
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,970
Leading actress, you're back.

676
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,330
That was fantastic, absolutely fantastic.

677
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,330
How was it?

678
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,930
I'm telling you, you're the best person under 20

679
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,530
to play a role over 60.

680
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,390
I mean it. Really.

681
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,970
Well, it's mainly because this old lady I played...

682
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,090
You were like a white cloud.

683
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,210
Seriously. As for him, he was just black soil,

684
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,770
you know?

685
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,180
It's just I felt

686
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,170
really moved on stage just now.

687
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,050
Not to mention you.

688
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,370
Did you cry?

689
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,570
I just wiped my tears.

690
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,660
You even moved yourself.

691
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,860
How could you not have moved me?

692
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,570
Exactly. I was bawling my eyes out.

693
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,110
Tu, where did you just go?

694
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,720
I went to get changed.

695
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,090
It was too hot.

696
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,850
You're so fast.

697
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,210
Thank you all.

698
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:30,680
Thank you all.

699
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,180
Happy times always come to an end,

700
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,350
but our performance

701
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,970
will not stop.

702
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,200
Now, let's welcome the president of our drama club to the stage

703
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,810
to say a few words.

704
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,270
First, I'd like to thank all the aunts and uncles

705
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,930
and leaders for their support.

706
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,450
Also, I want to express my gratitude to

707
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,130
every member of our drama club.

708
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,530
It's because of their brilliant performances and dedication

709
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,530
that this

710
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,080
somewhat immature play of mine could be realized

711
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,410
and performed.

712
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,810
Actually, this play was created

713
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,650
based on my hometown.

714
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,210
There are still many impoverished households there,

715
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,340
as well as left-behind children.

716
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,330
Our drama club also

717
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,970
puts on many charity performances every year,

718
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,930
and we regularly donate

719
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,530
the funds and sponsorships we raise

720
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,450
to them.

721
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,290
What's going on?

722
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,210
The great talent Feng, you cry wine and sell vinegar,

723
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,420
yet you sound so sanctimonious.

724
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,450
It's truly admirable.
