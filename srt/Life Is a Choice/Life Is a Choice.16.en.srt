00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,430
[Listen to Mom or Not?]

4
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,180
Let me tell you,

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
the person you couldn't find has now contacted me.

6
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,700
Don't make a sound or speak.

7
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,670
If we both get blocked,

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,910
we'll have no intel source.

9
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,509
Did you hear me?

10
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,680
Lin Xi,

11
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,910
it's been a while since we last met.

12
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,320
Where are you?

13
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,350
This doesn't matter now.

14
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,390
What matters is that I need to tell you something.

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,510
Go ahead.

16
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,560
Huanan proposed to me.

17
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,120
But I haven't said yes.

18
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,690
What do you think I should do?

19
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,030
Should you find someone

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,840
who knows you better than you do,

21
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,840
and talk to him about this?

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,190
Gu Nian, I'm warning you. You absolutely...

23
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,790
Just seeing this person brings bad luck.

24
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,840
I'll think about it myself.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,190
I told you to watch what you say.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,590
Now we got hung up.

27
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,290
I already told you.

28
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,320
I don't like

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,350
meddling in other people's lives.

30
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,910
I don't meddle in other people's choices,

31
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,220
and I don't want anyone meddling in mine.

32
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,630
You and Nian now have such a big issue.

33
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,000
But I can't help you make decisions.

34
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,070
This stubborn girl

35
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,880
is now completely out of control.

36
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,790
She actually made a decision

37
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,470
about her life without even realizing it.

38
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,590
Drink.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,030
But she hasn't made a decision yet, right?

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,990
Whether in terms of medicine or theory,

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,870
she can still be saved.

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,240
You think I don't know her?

43
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,880
When she told you about this, she wasn't showing off—

44
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,640
she was reinforcing her resolve.

45
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,110
The fact that she called you

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,390
means she's 80% decided already.

47
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,120
With me, the cheat code,

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,950
what's there left to think about?

49
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,579
She doesn't want to walk the road I've paved for her

50
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,110
and insists on jumping into the fire pit.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,190
But isn't there

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,950
still a 20% chance?

53
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,630
Don't rush.

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,430
That's what I'm most worried about.

55
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,070
Do you believe she'll soon

56
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,270
be seeking that remaining 20%?

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,670
She can't escape it in the end.

58
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,670
What do you mean?

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,510
I originally thought that if Feng Huanan changed his direction,

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,630
Gu Nian would be safe.

61
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,670
I didn't expect he would still propose to her,

62
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,590
even at the same location.

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,190
Xi, do you know what this means?

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
It means Gu Nian

65
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,390
will fall back into the same life path she was on before.

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,470
It means her next plan is

67
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,710
to go home and deal with my mom.

68
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,030
You're saying Aunt Dai is that 20%?

69
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,030
I even had a big fight with my mom

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,320
because she didn't agree with me

71
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,080
getting married so quickly.

72
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,670
Out of spite, I stole the household registration book

73
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,160
and directly married Feng Huanan.

74
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,800
And then...

75
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,880
Then what happened?

76
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,430
Then, on my wedding day,

77
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,839
my mom had a car accident

78
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,950
and passed away.

79
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,630
What?

80
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,230
Bai Guo's death has already

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,640
made me realize

82
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,510
that death is irreversible.

83
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,510
Since then, I've been thinking about my mom.

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,590
That's why I've been trying to pave a new path for Gu Nian.

85
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,310
But I didn't expect them to still end up together.

86
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,870
I didn't expect them to even take it to the point of marriage.

87
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,550
I really regret coming back.

88
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,990
I really don't want to go through

89
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,950
the pain I've experienced again.

90
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,909
About Aunt Dai,

91
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,230
does Nian know?

92
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,790
She doesn't know.

93
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,040
No matter what I say now, she...

94
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,240
Such a huge issue—

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,270
even if you push her down,

96
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,270
you have to tell her!

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,670
She won't listen to anything I say now.

98
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,030
She thinks everything I say is just alarmist nonsense.

99
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,630
And Feng Huanan is constantly changing tactics,

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,830
appearing in front of her every day.

101
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,850
She's already formed her own logic.

102
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,640
Now, only what Feng Huanan says to her

103
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
is considered the truth.

104
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,840
She won't think about whether she's missed anything,

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,590
or if there's any regret.

106
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,510
You still have the nerve to complain about everything?

107
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,390
You should be thinking about

108
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,150
what you can do for Aunt Dai.

109
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,670
Don't forget.

110
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,230
You are also Gu Nian.

111
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,700
Aunt Dai is your mother too.

112
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,750
You can do what Gu Nian

113
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,840
didn't do.

114
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,040
That's the reason you came back.

115
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,440
Drink up.

116
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,430
I...

117
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,670
You what?

118
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,040
You...

119
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,230
I what?

120
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,140
Stuttering now?

121
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,950
Fine.

122
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,440
You said

123
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,550
you're afraid that your current identity

124
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,870
might frighten Aunt Dai.

125
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,990
Why don't you try thinking from a different perspective?

126
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,150
Since you have this new body,

127
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,510
why not take on a new identity

128
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,350
and appear in front of Aunt Dai as a new person?

129
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,909
Why must you show up as Nian?

130
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,280
This is just like

131
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,190
how our hospital

132
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,480
provides terminal care for many patients.

133
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,630
We don't have any family ties to them,

134
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,510
but we can still help to ease their regrets.

135
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,270
It's not about identity.

136
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,400
I see through you.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,030
Your obstacle isn't about a new identity.

138
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,020
It's your guilt toward Aunt Dai.

139
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,630
You're ashamed to face her.

140
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,430
You're avoiding it.

141
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,680
But Nian,

142
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,830
the past version of you

143
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,130
has already missed the opportunity.

144
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,280
Now, do you still want to repeat the same mistake?

145
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,070
Since there's a chance for you to meet again,

146
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,270
and Aunt Dai is still alive,

147
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,070
you should grasp this opportunity

148
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,860
and accompany her on this journey.

149
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,870
Bad news.

150
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,750
What happened?

151
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,240
Something big has happened.

152
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,170
What big thing?

153
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,270
Feng Huanan proposed

154
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,190
to Gu Nian.

155
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,840
Jiang, sit down, sit down.

156
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,340
No,

157
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,070
such a big thing has happened,

158
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,510
and why are you so calm?

159
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,330
I knew about it already.

160
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,150
I'm thinking about what to do.

161
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,430
Jiang, can you not

162
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,840
make such a fuss?

163
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,680
I thought my identity had been compromised.

164
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,390
Don't worry,

165
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,350
your identity won't be compromised anytime soon.

166
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,440
I'm keeping an eye on it.

167
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,960
But Gu Nian…

168
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,960
Gu Nian she's in serious trouble now.

169
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,190
She's in a precarious situation.

170
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,630
What do you mean?

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,390
Early this morning,

172
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,120
Feng Huanan brought up

173
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,990
the whole startup thing again.

174
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,270
He said he's secured

175
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,470
the funding.

176
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,040
He proposed last night,

177
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,550
and this morning,

178
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,870
he's got the money lined up.

179
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,870
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

180
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,470
Is he after Gu Nian's money?

181
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,990
He's not just after Gu Nian's money.

182
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,080
He's after my mother's too.

183
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,180
You're always getting worked up with me.

184
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,350
I'm not Feng Huanan.

185
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,310
Wait, you knew all this.

186
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,670
Why didn't you stop Gu Nian?

187
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,680
You should have stopped her!

188
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,630
I can't be with her

189
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,390
24/7.

190
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,430
So what do we do now?

191
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,000
Should I

192
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,270
reject Feng Huanan's proposal?

193
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,390
You can't reject him.

194
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,600
You have to agree.

195
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,310
You need to keep a close eye on him.

196
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,990
I need to know his entire plan.

197
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,190
I'll keep an eye on Gu Nian.

198
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,150
Alright,

199
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,040
that's how we'll divide the work.

200
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,030
I'll watch him.

201
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,990
Now, you need to focus on the Revisit Project.

202
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,919
This is something you need

203
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,710
to follow through with—

204
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,880
no room for mistakes.

205
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,350
You can't let them know you're not him.

206
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,150
You.

207
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,309
You can talk louder.

208
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm off to work then.

209
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,040
Be careful.

210
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,530
Come to my office.

211
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,270
[Director's Office]

212
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,590
What is it?

213
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,670
Didn't anyone tell you that

214
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,750
as an assistant,

215
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,710
you should knock

216
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,750
before entering the director's office?

217
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,420
Director Su, do you have any instructions?

218
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,230
Close the door.

219
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,070
Sit down.

220
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,210
I heard

221
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,390
Feng Huanan proposed to you yesterday.

222
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,320
Stop right there.

223
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,350
Let's not talk about this.

224
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,230
Besides, this is my personal matter.

225
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,630
You have no right to interfere, do you?

226
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,600
Fine.

227
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,710
Then let's talk about work.

228
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,560
Do you know why a lot of companies

229
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,230
ask about a candidate's

230
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,150
marital status during interviews?

231
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,180
It's to make sure employees

232
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,510
fully focus their time

233
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,510
and energy on work.

234
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,360
Well, boss, you can rest assured.

235
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,950
I keep my work and personal life

236
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,440
completely separate.

237
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,320
When I'm working, I don't bring up personal stuff.

238
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,750
And after work, I don't talk about business.

239
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,470
Is that okay?

240
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,310
Gu Nian,

241
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,220
you are not ambitious enough.

242
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,680
Do you know how many people out there

243
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,830
are working their butts off,

244
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,440
staying late just

245
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,760
to get a project like this?

246
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,150
And do you know how many people

247
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,280
work late but slack off

248
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,800
just to pocket overtime pay?

249
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,680
So, let me ask you—

250
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,920
what's more important?

251
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,240
Efficiency or superficial effort?

252
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,320
Of course efficiency is more important.

253
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,270
Then that's settled.

254
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,790
So today, you have to stay and work overtime.

255
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,470
No way. I have things to do. I'm going home.

256
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,750
Are you planning to go home

257
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,040
and tell your mom about Feng Huanan?

258
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,780
Director Su, you should separate work from personal matters.

259
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,230
Don't waste my work hours, okay?

260
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,850
Gu Nian, why are you so stubborn?

261
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,510
What do I need to say to make you listen?

262
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,030
I've never been through what you did.

263
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,390
Why would I listen?

264
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,310
And back then, did you listen?

265
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,470
I never thought the day would come

266
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,830
when I couldn't even argue with myself.

267
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,070
Alright, I'm rejecting this.

268
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,640
Why?

269
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,700
I know.

270
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,970
It's because you think the donation thing

271
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,070
was a bit off.

272
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,340
But he did it out of gratitude.

273
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,000
You can't just deny him

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,640
because of that.

275
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm not denying him.

276
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,250
I know he has helped you,

277
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,750
and I'm grateful for that.

278
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,360
But he shouldn't use marriage

279
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,820
as some sort of moral leverage.

280
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,440
He didn't.

281
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,960
We're truly in love.

282
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,500
If you two are really in love,

283
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,750
then why did he

284
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,160
push this project onto me?

285
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,850
Isn't it all about the benefits for him?

286
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,380
I gave the project to you

287
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,880
because I think he's too talented.

288
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,950
Ad I don't want him to be wasted.

289
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,990
Nian,

290
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,430
you're too naive.

291
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,620
You make everything sound so simple.

292
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,470
I'm an adult.

293
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,440
I know how to separate feelings from business.

294
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,780
Moreover,

295
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,410
starting a business is always from scratch.

296
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,430
When you and Dad first got married,

297
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,710
you lived in that tiny, rundown apartment.

298
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,790
Now look at you. You have everything.

299
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,240
So if you two can make it,

300
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,470
why can't I?

301
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,440
Am I really that bad in your eyes?

302
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,110
I've told you so many times—

303
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,230
you two are still young.

304
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,830
Don't rush into things.

305
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,420
This roundabout way you're going—

306
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,680
it's like you think his background

307
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,140
and financial situation are bad,

308
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,540
and you're biased against him.

309
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,230
I don't want you to be

310
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,780
trapped in marriage too early.

311
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,430
You should take your time to make your choice.

312
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,110
Enough.

313
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,920
If I want to, I'll do it.

314
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,910
I want to.

315
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,030
I don't agree.

316
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,970
[Director Li]

317
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,500
Mom, I'm home.

318
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,290
Mom.

319
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,150
My side needs you.

320
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,550
What are you doing at my house?

321
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,480
Your house?

322
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,510
This is my home too, okay?

323
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,340
I'm here to see our mom.

324
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,240
Mom's not home.

325
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,760
I'm in a really bad mood today.

326
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,560
You need to leave now.

327
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,320
Did you have a fight with Mom?

328
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,610
She shut you down, didn't she?

329
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,730
Look at you, all flushed and worked up.

330
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,380
Your tonsils must be inflamed by now.

331
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,470
It does hurt a bit.

332
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
I've been in pain like this all along.

333
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,370
I've been angry because of you.

334
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,020
Just leave.

335
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,830
Open the door for me.

336
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,870
How dare you grab my hair!

337
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,850
What's wrong with grabbing your hair?

338
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,920
You know I don't have much hair.

339
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,790
Let go of me right now!

340
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,760
What does that have to do with me?

341
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,530
Anyway, Su Yin has more hair than you, see?

342
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,930
I'll come out and hit you.

343
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,920
You... You open the door.

344
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,390
Come out and hit me.

345
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,240
Open the door.

346
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,920
Nian.

347
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,260
Who is it?

348
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,630
Mom, it's nothing.

349
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,400
You go in first.

350
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,080
I'll open the door.

351
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,610
Mom.

352
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,870
Yes.

353
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,270
This is my mother.

354
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,920
Mom, let me introduce you.

355
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,900
This is Director Su from the company

356
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,640
who's handling the Revisit Project.

357
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,580
Hello, Mrs. Dai.

358
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,910
My name is Su Yin.

359
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,230
You can just call me Su.

360
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,220
Hello, Director Su.

361
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,170
I'm sorry.

362
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,360
I've heard a lot about you from Gu Nian,

363
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,190
so I feel like

364
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,350
I already know you.

365
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,470
I know, right? It's a bit strange.

366
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,990
I feel like I've seen you before.

367
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,850
Mom, you two can stop with the familiarity talk.

368
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,960
He has a common face,

369
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,550
so you feel like you've seen him before.

370
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,230
Right?

371
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,230
Please, have a seat.

372
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,080
Don't just stand there.

373
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,130
Mom, is breakfast ready?

374
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,710
I've left it on the table for you. Go eat.

375
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,790
So sweet.

376
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,950
As sweet as you.

377
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,840
Nian,

378
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,800
time for breakfast, sweetie.

379
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,870
Coming, coming!

380
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,440
Go call your dad for breakfast.

381
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,590
Dad, it's time for breakfast.

382
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,440
Stop reading now.

383
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,550
Time to eat breakfast?

384
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,670
Give me a kiss then.

385
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,090
Good girl.

386
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,510
Let's go. Time for breakfast.

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
There are strawberries, your favorite.

388
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,550
Eat up now.

389
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,200
Okay.

390
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,460
Go ahead, eat more.

391
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,460
There's also the sandwich you like.

392
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,550
Tasty, isn't it?

393
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,800
Eat more.

394
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,430
Which lesson are you on in Chinese class recently?

395
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,270
We're on lesson eight.

396
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,510
Yogurt.

397
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,990
Su, come over here and have a seat.

398
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,800
Don't run.

399
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,869
Be good.

400
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,200
Come on, sit down.

401
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,590
Mom's calling you to come sit.

402
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,320
Okay.

403
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,430
Close the door.

404
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,600
There, there.

405
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,440
Why are you crying?

406
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,640
I got some sand in my eye.

407
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,870
It's nothing.

408
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,750
Su,

409
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,220
what brings you here today?

410
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,900
Mrs. Dai,

411
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,700
I know it's a bit abrupt for me

412
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,740
to show up at your house today.

413
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,430
I have two reasons for coming.

414
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,330
First, Gu Nian mentioned

415
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,200
you wanted to meet me,

416
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,870
but I've been so busy since then

417
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,030
that I haven't had the chance to come by.

418
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,740
So today, I made a special trip to visit

419
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,150
and sincerely apologize for not following up sooner.

420
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,960
Second, I'm quite an impatient person.

421
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,750
The project that Gu Nian and I are responsible for

422
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
is on a very tight schedule.

423
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,380
Whenever I have a new idea,

424
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,750
I can't help but rush to her

425
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,790
and discuss it immediately.

426
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,870
Time waits for no one,

427
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,070
and I don't want any delays from other matters.

428
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,630
Nian, you should learn from him.

429
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,630
What should I learn from him?

430
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,950
We don't see eye to eye on anything.

431
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,970
We're like oil and water.

432
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,170
Right, Yogurt?

433
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,330
It's true.

434
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,160
We do have some differences

435
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,110
in our views.

436
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,150
For example,

437
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,320
I believe that when you're young,

438
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,880
you should focus on building your career first.

439
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,870
Establish yourself

440
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,910
before starting a family.

441
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,670
Without a career, where would your family be?

442
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,240
If there's no career, where will you hide when you face setbacks in life?

443
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,120
I see life as

444
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,440
a S-level project

445
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,110
where you can't afford to make mistakes.

446
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,030
You can't think that

447
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,840
you can juggle many things at once,

448
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,850
because human energy is limited.

449
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,210
It's really hard to do one thing well

450
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,430
and master it.

451
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,200
Su,

452
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,110
aren't you worried that focusing so much on your career

453
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,040
might affect your own marriage prospects?

454
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,560
No, I'm not worried.

455
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,120
I think the biggest mistake is trying to discuss marriage

456
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,060
when you have nothing.

457
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,850
That not only wastes your own time but also someone else's.

458
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,390
Those who encourage young people

459
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,300
to marry with nothing are the biggest obstacles.

460
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,350
They either have ulterior motives

461
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,190
or want to drag others down with them.

462
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,920
It's incredibly selfish.

463
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,830
You really have a clear head on this.

464
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,830
Also, I believe

465
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,830
that the more successful your career is,

466
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,550
the more likely you are to meet someone who's even better.

467
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,350
Love and marriage should

468
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,870
be the finishing touch to life,

469
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,830
not the thing that saves it.

470
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,590
So there's no need to rush.

471
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,580
Don't you agree, Mrs. Dai?

472
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,800
You've hit the nail on the head.

473
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,670
The more I hear you talk,
the more I feel like we're becoming more alike.

474
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,790
What do you mean, "alike"?

475
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,270
I'm flesh of your flesh.

476
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,820
We're clearly cut

477
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,870
from the same mold.

478
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,390
You are our guest. Be like one.

479
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,190
Director Su.

480
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,530
I'm not an outsider to begin with.

481
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,910
Well, you're in my house now, so you're technically an outsider.

482
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,640
Besides, it's after work hours now.

483
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,110
This is my personal time.

484
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,990
If I don't want to see someone, I don't have to.

485
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,800
And Mom,

486
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,390
you're the one involved in these types of projects,

487
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,750
so you should be extra careful.

488
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,220
If we start talking business secrets,

489
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,420
we could get into legal trouble.

490
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,240
Alright, let's stop talking business.

491
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,200
I'll make a few dishes for us,

492
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,090
and we can have a drink together

493
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,080
Mom, there's no need.

494
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,920
He's leaving soon.

495
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,230
Sounds good, Mrs. Dai.

496
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,770
Actually, I was hoping to show off a little in the kitchen.

497
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,830
So sumptuous.

498
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,030
This "showing off" of yours is just

499
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,550
washing some vegetables

500
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,280
and chopping potatoes?

501
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,290
I made this hot pot base.

502
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,390
It's a bit different from what you'd find outside.

503
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,750
I also made a yin-yang pot—

504
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,440
one spicy

505
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,320
and one with your favorite...

506
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,030
What would you like to eat?

507
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,670
I'll boil it for you.

508
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,720
It's quite a feast. Very nice.

509
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,250
Nian, you need to reflect on yourself.

510
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,480
You're all grown up,

511
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,430
and I've never tasted anything you've cooked.

512
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,110
If you like it, just eat more, Mrs. Dai.

513
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,510
We've been quite close,

514
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,800
so don't call me Mrs. Dai anymore.

515
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,170
Just call me Aunt Dai.

516
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,560
Yeah, you'll know your Aunt Dai better in the future.

517
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,590
She's like a whip—

518
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,840
always cracking down on you.

519
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,600
Stop it.

520
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,350
Is it okay if I call you godmother?

521
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,770
Godmother?

522
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,670
I...

523
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,740
I lost my parents at a young age.

524
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,550
And I don't have any siblings.

525
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,180
Sometimes I feel

526
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,510
quite lonely.

527
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,590
Whenever something happens,

528
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,880
I don't have anyone to talk to.

529
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,080
So, I've always treated Gu Nian like a younger sister.

530
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,270
I hope I'm not being too forward with this.

531
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,270
I really shouldn't have said that.

532
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,150
Now you have another child to worry about.

533
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,200
It's too much trouble.

534
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,660
So, you know you're being too forward.

535
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,110
Anyway, I don't agree.

536
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,110
Su Yin, your pace is way too fast.

537
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,790
You've only been here a few minutes
and you're already trying to steal my mom.

538
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,870
Want to take over my territory too?

539
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,310
Who's stealing your territory?

540
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,880
I'm just trying to get a spot at your home, that's all.

541
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,710
Not even that is allowed.

542
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,520
Su,

543
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,300
hearing that

544
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,790
makes me feel at ease.

545
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,860
I'm officially taking you as my godson.

546
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,000
In the future, please help me take good care of her.

547
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,100
But Mom,

548
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,230
didn't you just say

549
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,690
you wouldn't easily hand me over to someone else?

550
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,430
But now you're directly asking him to take care of me.

551
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,630
Did he enchant you?

552
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,350
My silly child,

553
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,420
who's the one here really being enchanted?

554
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,510
Mom, this toast is to you.

555
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,670
She's your godmother, not mom.

556
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,990
A godmother is still a mother.

557
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,560
Here, godmother, I'd like to toast you.

558
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,320
Come on, let's drink together.

559
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,890
Su,

560
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,030
come on, eat some more.

561
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,080
Why are your eyes red?

562
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,070
I might have been staring at the computer screen too much lately.

563
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,020
It's nothing.

564
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,240
Let's eat.

565
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,550
Godmother,

566
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,590
can I take a photo with you?

567
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Sure.

568
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,080
Come on,

569
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,230
let's take a photo together.

570
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,110
Nian, come here.

571
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,870
Let's take a photo together.

572
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,580
Come on, Gu Nian.

573
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,590
Move closer to godmother.

574
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,590
Come on.

575
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,880
Ready? One, two, three.

576
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,620
Smile!

577
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,290
One, two, three.

578
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,770
That's it.

579
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,150
Su, eat some more, okay?

580
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,840
Okay, okay.

581
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,420
You know, this hot pot base

582
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,510
is indeed quite delicious.

583
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,840
Finally got rid of that big trouble.

584
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,600
Here.

585
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,430
Thank you, Mom.

586
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,940
Nian,

587
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,640
Su seems young,

588
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,230
but he's

589
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,160
really thoughtful

590
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,800
when it comes to things.

591
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,400
He's a good kid.

592
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,390
No, Mom,

593
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,910
you've taken a liking to Su Yin after just a few words.

594
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,790
But you won't even give an opportunity

595
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,400
for Huanan to meet with you.

596
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,040
A bit of double standards, don't you think?

597
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,110
Alright then,

598
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,830
I'll meet

599
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,000
with Feng Huanan.

600
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,280
Really?

601
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,040
You can arrange it.

602
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,250
Yes!

603
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,440
Come on, Mom,

604
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,350
I love you so much.

605
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,620
Go ahead and eat.

606
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,670
Then I'll arrange it.

607
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:51,920
Mr. Li,

608
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,510
the 3D simulation data

609
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,390
is almost ready.

610
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,950
Next, we'll be conducting olfactory

611
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,910
and visual simulations.

612
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,450
This may happen in several stages.

613
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,110
The detailed schedule will be sent to your inbox.

614
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,360
Don't worry.

615
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,830
I'll double-check everything.

616
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,890
There won't be any mistakes.

617
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,150
Alright.

618
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:10,970
Come in.

619
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,520
How is it? Finished?

620
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,070
Take a look.

621
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,720
Almost there.

622
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,560
We need to speed it up.

623
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,630
This is our first project in the company.

624
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,630
It can't afford to go wrong.

625
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,560
Also, we need to get Gu Nian busy,

626
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,670
so she can taste the sweetness of success in her career.

627
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,870
Only then will she realize that

628
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,990
she can't just throw herself completely into Feng Huanan.

629
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,230
Close the door.

630
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,520
I heard you went home last night.

631
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,790
I saw my mom.

632
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,510
Gu Nian must have scolded me a lot, right?

633
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,470
Not much.

634
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,870
Well,

635
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,350
somewhere between an earful and a total barrage of criticism.

636
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,680
She said you got your mom to pick a side,

637
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,070
dragging her into all of this.

638
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,910
Let her say whatever she wants.

639
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,100
As long as you can pull her

640
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,230
back from the edge,

641
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,600
she can scold me all she wants.

642
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,550
How's it going with Feng Huanan?

643
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,200
Did you find out who he's been connecting with?

644
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,190
Guess who he's connected with?

645
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,030
Jiang, don't keep me in suspense. Just tell me.

646
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,670
Lyu Tu.

647
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,030
Lyu Tu found him a partner.

648
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,510
Lyu Tu is back?

649
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,360
Lyu Tu is not the same person anymore.

650
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,750
She's upgraded big time.

651
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,570
Now she's working with all kinds of resources.

652
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,580
Feng Huanan. Feng Huanan.

653
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,910
I actually kind of admire him.

654
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,590
He's always known what he wants.

655
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,250
What I admire most is

656
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,480
how he always manages to get people

657
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,070
he's lost back into his life

658
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,740
and make them follow his every word.

659
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,290
If it weren't for his impatience

660
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,530
and obsession with shortcuts,

661
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,200
I honestly think he'd be

662
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,960
a very successful person.

663
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,960
So bitter.

664
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,310
Why are you boosting his morale

665
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,630
while taking away from your own?

666
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,340
I'm just telling the truth.

667
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,080
He really does work hard in certain areas.

668
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,510
They're not as impressive as you make them sound.

669
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,430
From what I know,

670
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,430
their partner is also having second thoughts,

671
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,750
so they did a background check

672
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,860
on Feng Huanan

673
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,190
and found out he doesn't have family connections

674
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,880
or any backing.

675
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,670
So, they're planning to have

676
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,030
Feng Huanan put up some initial funding.

677
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,670
They want to test his sincerity and ability,

678
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,750
because, after all, no one wants to throw money down the drain.

679
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,460
Well, in that case,

680
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,080
Feng Huanan's motive for proposing to Gu Nian

681
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,400
forms a perfect closed loop.

682
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,600
He wants my mom to be the fall guy.

683
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,140
Oh no.

684
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,200
I heard your mom agreed to meet Feng Huanan.

685
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,700
Your mom won't fall for it, will she?

686
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,030
How is that possible?

687
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,110
My mom agreeing to meet Feng Huanan is actually her being clever.

688
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,240
She definitely took the things

689
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,880
I said last night to heart.

690
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,970
She knows that words alone won't work,

691
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,350
and she can't go head-to-head with Gu Nian directly.

692
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,280
So, she wants to personally help Gu Nian avoid the pitfalls.

693
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,820
My mom and I have the same goal.

694
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,810
That makes things much easier.

695
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,560
Your mom is really wise.

696
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,830
So, with you and your mom

697
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,980
handling things for Gu Nian,

698
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,040
and with me taking care of the project,

699
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,920
we've got everything covered.

700
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,270
You can just focus on what you need to do.

701
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,460
We're like three strands of rope twisted together,

702
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,380
unbeatable.

703
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:11,880
I'm off.

704
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,430
Jiang,

705
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,720
thank you for your hard work.

706
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,430
Well, you're both my male and female idol,

707
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,870
both Gu Nian and my boss.

708
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,600
It's no big deal.

709
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,240
Next,

710
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,850
I might have to play the bad guy.

711
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,350
I'm going to have to be tough on Gu Nian.

712
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,420
Please don't feel sorry for us.

713
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,850
If you show any weakness,

714
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,750
I'll soften up too.

715
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,070
To be honest,

716
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,030
I really don't want to see you two fight.

717
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,430
But then again,

718
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,840
I'm actually curious

719
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,230
which one of you would win in a fight.

720
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,150
Jiang, Jiang, you...

721
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:04,810
Godmother,

722
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,910
alright.

723
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,490
Just send me the address.

724
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,270
Okay, bye-bye.

725
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,750
[Lyu Tu's back]
[If you really want to have Feng Huanan meet with Mom]
[You should first give Lyu Tu an explanation]

726
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,090
Why don't you take it back?

727
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,970
First come, first served. It's yours now.

728
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,110
I don't want this dirty thing

729
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,790
he gave me.

730
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,220
But I bought it after all.

731
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,070
It's not exactly dirty.

732
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,630
He touched it.

733
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,830
Doesn't that make it dirty?

734
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,710
I don't want it.

735
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,360
Fine, we both won't take it.

736
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,470
No,

737
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,070
I just don't get it.

738
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,710
I've never been in a relationship,

739
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,030
and I guess I was just misled,

740
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,400
but you?

741
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,870
If some random guy

742
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,950
told me

743
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,120
he'd take responsibility for me,

744
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,910
I'd laugh

745
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,470
and ignore him.

746
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,430
But why did I take him seriously

747
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,380
when he said it to me?

748
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,590
I really… I'm such a fool.

749
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,840
My brain must have been

750
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,580
kicked by a donkey.

751
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,890
I can't believe I fell for it.

752
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,280
Nian.

753
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,020
You're here.

754
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,990
Please, have a seat.

755
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,640
I don't know if your taste has changed.

756
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,000
I ordered your old favorite drink.

757
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,320
I don't drink that anymore.

758
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,570
It's not good for the body if you have too much.

759
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,400
You should drink less too.

760
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,060
Hello, I'd like fruit and vegetable juice, please.

761
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,610
Thank you.

762
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,370
Okay.

763
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,900
How did you know I was back?

764
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,130
You left without a word. That was bad enough.

765
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,630
But now you're back

766
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,680
and still avoiding me?

767
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm not avoiding you.

768
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,840
I've just been busy making money.

769
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,850
It seems like you're going to be the first to achieve

770
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,980
the dreams we all talked about back then.

771
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,320
How so?

772
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,940
You still haven't found your prince charming?

773
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,170
Aren't you with Su Yin?

774
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,320
No.

775
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,030
He and I are colleagues.

776
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,870
And there's also Jiang Ze.

777
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,270
We're in the same company.

778
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,630
We're working on a project together now.

779
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,870
It's still the same old faces, huh?

780
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,570
That's nice.

781
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,550
Here's your juice.

782
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,340
Great, thank you.

783
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,860
Tu,

784
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,230
are you still in touch with Feng Huanan?

785
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,600
No, I'm not.

786
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,930
Didn't we agree before?

787
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,970
We just treated him like an old rag

788
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,360
and threw him away.

789
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,320
Do you still love him now?

790
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,750
Love?

791
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,190
Love is so complicated.

792
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,950
There's too much to decode.

793
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,260
You know

794
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,640
what I'm like.

795
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,330
When have I ever loved anyone?

796
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,620
I only love myself.

797
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,740
Tu, I'm sorry.

798
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,330
I broke our promise.

799
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,240
I'm back with Huanan.

800
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,550
He proposed to me.
