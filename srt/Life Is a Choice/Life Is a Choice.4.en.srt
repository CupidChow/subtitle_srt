00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,560
What if I told you

190
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,880
I'm not interested in any of those companies?

191
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,010
Would you think I'm aiming too high?

192
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,160
Not at all. If I were as outstanding as you,

193
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,240
my ambitions would be even higher.

194
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,130
Most people intern to earn money.

195
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,410
But for me,

196
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,270
it's about changing my fate.

197
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,410
I want to make the most of the time I have left,

198
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,330
at least to make myself

199
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,160
seem less like a kid

200
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,450
who grew up in the mountains.

201
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Can you understand?

202
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,650
I completely understand.

203
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,880
That's also why I want to join the drama club—

204
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
because of you, President Feng.

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,690
Do you think I still have time

206
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,690
to learn acting now?

207
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,110
Of course, it's not too late.

208
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,240
With your ability to handle

209
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,730
multiple part-time jobs so skillfully,

210
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,290
you're bound to excel at acting.

211
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,390
People like us,

212
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
we're born with more than one face.

213
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,240
Not sure if that's a blessing or a curse.

214
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,090
Exactly.

215
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,170
For people like us,

216
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,080
we not only have to work harder,

217
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,010
but we also have to take an unconventional path.

218
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,250
Of course.

219
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,940
Do you know how many people

220
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,410
want to "fly first" in today's world?

221
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,810
I refuse to do anything that doesn't bring me value.

222
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,440
President Feng,

223
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm sure the competition for

224
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,640
the lead actress role must be intense.

225
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,890
Any chance I could take a shortcut?

226
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,280
You don't need a shortcut.

227
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,290
I'm telling you—

228
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,360
prepare well,

229
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,550
and you'll definitely make it.

230
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,880
Really?

231
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,000
Jiang.

232
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,570
Jiang, wait for me! Jiang!

233
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,850
Jiang, why are you riding so fast?

234
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,220
I'm waiting for you, aren't I?

235
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,200
I don't get it—

236
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
what's with all your lousy ideas lately?

237
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,080
Now look what's happened.

238
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,400
I've been permanently friend-zoned!

239
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,480
What's there to be upset about?

240
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,730
Nothing's changed.

241
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,110
There's a huge difference.

242
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,380
Before, I was at peace with it.

243
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,130
It's like if I went to Feng Huanan right now and said,

244
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,330
"Gu Nian likes you."

245
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,840
How would you feel?

246
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,700
That's impossible.

247
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
I just see Feng Huanan

248
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,920
as an idol right now.

249
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,750
Jiang.

250
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,720
Are you heading back to the drama club to adjust the lights?

251
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,280
What else are you planning to do?

252
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
You, you—you're the one

253
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,170
who used those overly romantic stage lights

254
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,000
to push me straight into Feng Huanan's arms.

255
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,870
This is on you,

256
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,450
so you owe me.

257
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,260
You have to help me.

258
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,890
I refuse!

259
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,050
Fine. Keep your anger then.

260
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,540
But if you don't mess things up for me later,

261
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,820
you're not much of a man.

262
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,320
Feng Huanan, from now on,

263
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,560
every time I see you, I'm going to hit you.

264
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,250
President, President, President!

265
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,360
Everyone's watching—

266
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,240
have some dignity.

267
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,640
You're such a schemer!

268
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,940
What are you doing?

269
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,400
Why do you have nothing better to do

270
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
than hang around me all day?

271
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,130
Exactly. This!

272
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,530
This is the feeling.

273
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,530
This anger—

274
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,070
do you feel the blood

275
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,990
rushing to your head?

276
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,400
The fury welling up in your throat?

277
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,080
This is what we call real listening, real watching, and real feeling.

278
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,940
It has so much more tension than the monotone reading you did last time.

279
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,780
I've heard about you.

280
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,360
I know you.

281
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,740
Su Yin, right?

282
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,720
I don't get it.

283
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,480
We're from completely different worlds—

284
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,340
I'm an undergrad, and you're in your third year of grad school.

285
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,790
What did I ever do to offend you?

286
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,090
You didn't offend me.

287
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,720
That impromptu performance last time?

288
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,740
Just a little meeting gift.

289
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,720
A meeting gift? Impromptu performance?

290
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,240
You almost landed me

291
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,950
in the hospital, you know that?

292
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,970
In the world of drama, there's no rank or size;

293
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,110
true talent is judged offstage.

294
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,100
If you think my acting was good, President,

295
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,920
can I join the drama club

296
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,970
during recruitment?

297
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,100
Are you serious?

298
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,390
God Su from the Computer Science Department,

299
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,770
now about to graduate,

300
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,530
wants to join our drama club?

301
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,410
Am I hearing this right?

302
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,840
I am socially awkward.

303
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,770
Graduation's around the corner,

304
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,520
and I don't know what to do,

305
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,040
so I'm forcing myself to break out of my shell.

306
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,090
It's my first attempt, though—

307
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,800
might've gone a little overboard.

308
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,850
Sorry about that. Hope you don't mind.

309
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,740
Cut the nonsense! Where were you earlier?

310
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,120
I called to apologize.

311
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,910
You didn't answer,

312
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,040
so I had to handle it my way.

313
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,010
Did it ever cross your mind

314
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,280
that maybe I don't accept your way?

315
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,450
Not accepting it?

316
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,850
So the mighty president of

317
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,690
the drama club

318
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,400
gets punched for nothing

319
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,230
and doesn't even fight back.

320
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,450
If word gets out,

321
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,960
that doesn't sound great, does it?

322
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,440
I don't even

323
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,750
want to deal with you.

324
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,820
You're just shameless.

325
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,850
I know what you're after.

326
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,130
You like Gu Nian, right?

327
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,250
Rest assured—

328
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,440
completely assured.

329
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,960
I don't have feelings for her.

330
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,520
You've misunderstood.

331
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,770
I'm a friend of Jiang Ze,

332
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,200
and I just want to join the drama club.

333
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,600
We don't need any more male actors right now.

334
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,190
Then you need a good assistant.

335
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,840
It's tiring for you to carry everything alone.

336
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,540
Get lost.

337
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,120
President,

338
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
I prepared another gift for you.

339
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,730
This one is really practical—

340
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,070
you've got to check it out.

341
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,810
Come on, take a look.

342
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,320
Just take a look.

343
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,150
This is really...

344
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,930
It's great.

345
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,680
This, this...

346
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
I've used it for a long time.

347
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,290
Really.

348
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,070
President, so do you agree to let me join?

349
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,250
We'll see what you can do later.

350
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,040
Attention, all departments.

351
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,920
Follow yesterday's rehearsal plan.

352
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,000
It's over, it's over, Jiang.

353
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,640
Jiang. Big disaster!

354
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,570
What now?

355
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,750
Guess who I just saw?

356
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,620
Who?

357
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,210
Lyu Tu!

358
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,120
What about Lyu Tu?

359
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,480
She's just sitting over there.

360
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,120
Feng Huanan cheated with her!

361
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,050
They even had a kid together!

362
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
And she had the nerve to call me the home wrecker.

363
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,720
They've been together for ages!

364
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,840
So melodramatic?

365
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,150
It's exactly that melodramatic.

366
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,260
I've been holding in this anger forever.

367
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,290
But look at her,

368
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,440
with those clueless,

369
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,170
innocent little eyes—

370
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,520
how am I supposed to confront her?

371
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,940
So angry...

372
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,210
Take a deep breath. Calm down first.

373
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,000
Attention, all departments.

374
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,240
We're about to begin.

375
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,340
Turn off the stage lights.

376
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
What are you doing?

377
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,930
Come on, push the lights.

378
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,840
Focus on your job.

379
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,910
Get to work.

380
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,960
Uncle, what do you usually do at home?

381
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,250
At home,

382
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,460
I eat.

383
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,330
What else?

384
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,320
I call my family.

385
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,160
Anything else?

386
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,650
I wait for their calls.

387
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,540
Nan told me

388
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,720
on New Year's Eve

389
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,980
I'll come to pick you up,

390
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,130
and we'll video call him together.

391
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,250
That way,

392
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,120
you can see them on the screen,

393
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,850
alright?

394
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,040
No, no.

395
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,200
They're busy.

396
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,140
Calling them will just disturb them.

397
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,420
Okay.

398
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,850
Next audition!

399
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,120
Gu Nian.

400
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,190
Alright, here I go.

401
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
Just go with the flow!

402
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,050
He's going up the stage?

403
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,320
Go with the flow?

404
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,690
How come it's you?

405
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,960
Say your lines.

406
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,650
Uncle, what do you usually do at home?

407
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,290
Eat.

408
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,990
What else?

409
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,440
Make phone calls.

410
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,580
And then?

411
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,280
Wait for calls.

412
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,600
You young ones walking out of the mountains

413
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,400
are too restless.

414
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,560
Especially my grandson.

415
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,280
Grandson.

416
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,880
Once you see more

417
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,530
of the outside world...

418
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,480
That's not in the script.

419
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,590
Your heart

420
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,740
becomes unsettled.

421
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Especially you girls,

422
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,280
you need to be careful when choosing a man.

423
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,840
Otherwise,

424
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,600
the rest of your life

425
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,160
will be full of regrets.

426
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,760
Uncle...

427
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
What is he saying?

428
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,250
Say lines in the script.

429
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,200
Some words

430
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,000
you might not like,

431
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,280
but I have to say them.

432
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,840
Whatever you do, don't marry

433
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,330
into a place like ours.

434
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,310
You might think love can spare you from hardship,

435
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,620
but your parents would be so hurt inside.

436
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,650
Over time,

437
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,300
you'll lose the mountains,

438
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,160
lose the people,

439
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,510
and end up like me,

440
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,320
holding onto nothing but a crescent moon.

441
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,580
Holding onto what?

442
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
Thank you, everyone.

443
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
Su Yin, stop right there!

444
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,170
I'm not stupid.

445
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,420
If I stop, you'll beat me to death, won't you?

446
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,990
If it weren't for you,

447
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,490
would I have to play a tree?

448
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,530
Stop!

449
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,960
Playing a tree isn't so bad.

450
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,160
No lines to memorize, and you get a close-up view of your idol.

451
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,730
Can you grow up for once?

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,330
Can you?

453
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,860
Why are you so hung up on Feng Huanan?

454
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,520
Don't you have anything else to focus on?

455
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,990
This isn't your business.

456
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,830
Gu Nian!

457
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,560
I regret marrying Feng Huanan,

458
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,990
not just because he cheated,

459
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,620
but because I didn't see

460
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,130
his selfishness and deceit earlier.

461
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,620
When he abandoned

462
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,080
my daughter and me back then,

463
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,200
the coldness and cruelty of it all—

464
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,170
even when Doudou was in critical condition, he didn't care to show up.

465
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,700
It made me realize

466
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,620
how foolish I was to fall for him blindly.

467
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,280
That's why I'm so desperate to stop you.

468
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,800
I really don't need this.

469
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,380
I know I'm not perfect,

470
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,770
but my life was simple and happy before.

471
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,450
Having someone help you quickly find your direction—

472
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,090
isn't that a good thing?

473
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,790
You call this helping me?

474
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,830
You're just making me feel dumber,

475
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,260
like no choice I make will ever work.

476
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,260
Gu Nian.

477
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,550
I've been through the storms you're navigating now.

478
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,870
Since I've made the choice to return,

479
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,280
I won't let those things

480
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
happen again.

481
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,560
I know you don't believe me.

482
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,360
I can give you time,

483
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,090
and I can give you space.

484
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,430
Trust me.

485
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,640
Don't be so preachy.

486
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,810
Without proof, I won't believe a word you say.

487
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,810
Gu Nian!

488
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,730
Was I this stubborn back then?

489
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,380
Jiang.

490
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,730
President.

491
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,580
Look at us, eating so frugally.

492
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,080
The cafeteria was crowded—I didn't feel like waiting in line.

493
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,280
I'll head back to the dorm.

494
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,650
Wait a second.

495
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,120
About that business idea we talked about—

496
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
have you given it any thought?

497
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,410
I haven't had time to think about it.

498
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,130
My research group's been overwhelming me.

499
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,600
I've got to get back to that.

500
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,420
Don't leave yet!

501
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,120
I've only gotten

502
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,280
those two

503
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,990
into the drama club for your sake.

504
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,870
Who?

505
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,360
Su Yin and Gu Nian.

506
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,620
That guy said he's your friend,

507
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,570
and that girl—I saw you two come in together.

508
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes, yes.

509
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,220
Small favor.

510
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,420
But starting a business together—that's a big deal.

511
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,450
President, nine out of ten startups fail.

512
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,530
We need to think it through carefully.

513
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,880
We can't rush into this.

514
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,040
No, what's there to think through?

515
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,410
Look at us—same family backgrounds,

516
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,350
grew up poor.

517
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,900
Aren't you tired of staying this way forever?

518
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,910
Think it over.

519
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,230
If you're really not interested,

520
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,120
just say no outright.

521
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,850
It's okay.

522
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,520
Alright, I'll think about it.

523
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,160
Alright, give it some more thought, Jiang.

524
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,060
Okay then.

525
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,750
Proof? Where am I supposed to find proof?

526
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,320
With a taste like this,

527
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,500
no wonder Gu Nian doesn't believe it.

528
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,470
I don't even believe it myself.

529
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,410
Hello.

530
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,520
I've got a bank card,

531
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,880
but I forgot the PIN.

532
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,380
I just need my ID to reset it, right?

533
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,350
Alright, thank you.

534
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,440
ID card.

535
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,430
Then I'll have money soon.

536
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,900
What time?

537
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,790
Okay.

538
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,200
Damn it. So masculine.

539
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
What are you zoning out for?

540
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,530
The ball almost hit you right in the face.

541
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,210
President,

542
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,370
you asked me here.

543
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
Is it because you

544
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,120
had feedback on my acting?

545
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,590
Cut the formalities.

546
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,690
You really think I'd buy

547
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,600
that excuse of yours?

548
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,180
I swear I'm not lying.

549
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,170
I only pulled that stunt during rehearsal

550
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,430
to get your attention.

551
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,920
If you feel bad about it,

552
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,150
come on, just hit me back.

553
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,880
You said it.

554
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,910
But you won't do it.

555
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,450
You're the president—

556
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,650
you've got a big heart.

557
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,880
If I wanted to hit you,

558
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,450
that ball earlier wouldn't have missed your face.

559
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,120
God Su, at this crucial moment,

560
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,560
you want to join our drama club

561
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,100
just to grab Gu Nian's attention, right?

562
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,140
What do you think of Gu Nian?

563
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,420
I don't really know her.

564
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,660
You don't want to get to know her?

565
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,300
I haven't even thought about these things.

566
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,030
God Su,

567
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,720
I can't stop you from trying

568
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,570
to get her attention,

569
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,190
but today—

570
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,660
during the actor selection process—you caused chaos.

571
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,000
As the president,

572
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,280
I need to have a serious talk with you about this.

573
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,900
You really misunderstood me.

574
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,680
I was just improvising, purely off the cuff.

575
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,030
Improvising, huh?

576
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,370
If you like improvisation so much,

577
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,520
I'll give you

578
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,640
the chance to show it.

579
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,840
What?

580
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,050
Gu Nian will play the tree

581
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,890
and you'll play the old man under the tree.

582
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,490
You two will be a perfect pair.

583
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,480
Bound together and locked in.

584
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,010
You'll both be in the same group for rehearsals,

585
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,390
makeup, and performances.

586
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,530
But remember this:

587
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,610
both in front of people and behind the scenes

588
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,910
you have to respect me unconditionally.

589
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:37,980
Alright.

590
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,940
You give me what I want.

591
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
And I'll do the same.

592
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,540
Let's cooperate happily.

593
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,750
Let's play one-on-one. Come on, let's shoot some hoops.

594
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,760
Bring it on.

595
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,440
You take offense. Come on, I'll defend.

596
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,670
Let's go.

597
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,780
I'm sorry.

598
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,190
I really don't know how to play this.

599
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,380
This is interesting.

600
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,040
Tu.

601
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,780
You scared me.

602
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,470
You made all these dishes?

603
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,410
Did you think I'd forget your birthday?

604
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,230
That's impossible.

605
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,440
If I have to work nights,

606
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,170
I'll let it keep you company, okay?

607
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,990
It's so cute.

608
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,130
I even sent messages to Kele

609
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,530
and to everyone

610
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,700
from our old dorm.

611
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,030
We'll have a good time tonight—

612
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,880
celebrate your birthday together.

613
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,440
Well, Kele told me

614
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,390
she was called away by her boyfriend.

615
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,410
And those three said

616
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,240
they couldn't make it tonight.

617
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,430
It's all for the best.

618
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,200
Let's just enjoy this.

619
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,790
We'll eat everything.

620
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,790
By the way, to celebrate you being cast as the female lead,

621
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,300
I'll wash all the dishes

622
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,720
tonight.

623
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,200
No, you're the kitchen disaster.

624
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,820
I forbid you from entering my kitchen.

625
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,870
Besides,

626
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,910
who makes the birthday girl do the dishes?

627
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,180
How would I manage without you, Tu?

628
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,410
I'm hopeless at living on my own.

629
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,500
Don't worry.

630
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,690
I'm never leaving you.

631
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,800
Happy Birthday, little idiot!

632
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,900
Thank you, my female lead.

633
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,570
Let me taste this.

634
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,920
It's incredibly delicious.

635
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,950
Nian,

636
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,120
do you look down on me too?

637
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,570
What are you talking about?

638
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,810
Do you believe I'll use this rabbit

639
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,440
to beat you to death?

640
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,680
Hit me, go ahead, hit me.

641
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,390
You can't bring yourself to do it.

642
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,010
You can't even open your mouth to scold me.

643
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,980
Actually, I know very well

644
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,040
that those people in our dorm

645
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,890
all look down on me.

646
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,850
None of them consider me a friend.

647
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,970
That's their problem,

648
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,290
not yours.

649
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,640
You're so amazing.

650
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,900
Everyone loves you wherever you go.

651
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,420
You don't know,

652
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,520
when you were on stage today,

653
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,360
That wasn't me glowing.

654
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,910
It was your idol shining.

655
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,650
I just borrowed a little of his light.

656
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,520
Isn't he impressive?

657
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,410
He really is.

658
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,720
Then why don't you take the chance

659
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,550
to get a little closer to him?

660
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
How am I supposed to get closer when I'm playing a tree?

661
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,160
Should I drop an apple

662
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,660
while he sits in the shade?

663
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,600
But seriously,

664
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,330
if you want something,

665
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,770
you should go after it bravely.

666
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,360
Don't get caught up in the past

667
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,320
or what people

668
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,440
who don't matter say.

669
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,750
Just go for what you want

670
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,650
with all your heart.

671
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,890
Look,

672
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,820
when my idol started this club,

673
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,050
he was doing charity work all over,

674
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,140
and no one believed in him.

675
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,310
But now?

676
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,820
Time proves everything.

677
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,430
You're right.

678
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,450
Sometimes

679
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,470
I do think he's really warm-hearted.

680
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,080
Exactly.

681
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,040
You should be around positive people,

682
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,890
people who are like the sun.

683
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,250
Like me and Nan.

684
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,680
We still have half a year until graduation,

685
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,350
so let's enjoy this time,

686
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,330
and make the most of it.

687
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,440
I'm really happy about that.

688
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,130
Come on,

689
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,780
cheers.

690
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,370
Cheers.

691
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,840
Nian.

692
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,380
I really want to thank you,

693
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,580
for taking care of me and Kele,

694
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,490
and for renting this place for us.

695
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,760
I've never paid you rent

696
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,900
in this year and a half,

697
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,070
and I feel so guilty about it.

698
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,360
What are you talking about?

699
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,010
I rented this place for the freedom.

700
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,930
And besides,

701
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,960
it's been so fun living with you two.

702
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,440
You know I can't do anything without you.

703
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,100
How would I survive without you?

704
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,960
So we're square.

705
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,030
Okay, we're even.

706
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,080
Let's make a pact.

707
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,470
No matter where we are,

708
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,000
we'll always be each other's best friends,

709
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,480
forever besties.

710
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,530
Forever besties.

711
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,070
Cheers!

712
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:17,880
Happy birthday!

713
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,060
Come on, make a wish.

714
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,590
Alright, I'm making a wish.

715
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,480
What did you wish for?

716
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,030
I'm not telling you.

717
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,090
Why not?

718
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,900
My wish is

719
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,750
for Tu o become filthy rich!

720
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,770
I'm going to be a rich lady!
