Gao Ren, tell her who I am.

5
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,710
You asked me to call you

6
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,710
just for this?

7
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,590
Jiang. Jiang!

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,840
So what do you want me to say?

9
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,450
Which major is this Su Yin from, and what does he do?

10
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,920
Gu Nian, Gu Nian, it's me, Jiang.

11
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,970
Are you with our boss?

12
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,510
Hey, Jiang.

13
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,040
What are you talking about, your boss?

14
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,250
The hidden big shot majoring in computer science, God Su.

15
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,580
My supervisor's favorite disciple.

16
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,850
His pride and joy.

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,460
My senior in the third year of graduate school.

18
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,870
You should have met before.

19
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,710
You know that facial recognition system our college is using, right?

20
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,890
It was developed by our boss. It's really impressive.

21
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,030
R-Really?

22
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,770
Why would I lie to you?

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,530
I can vouch for that.

24

we call him Boss

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,220
That's right, that's right.

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,430
So he's just an academic genius?

31
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,690
Sure, what else does he have to...

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,270
Gu Nian, let me tell you,

33
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,950
our boss is not just an academic genius.

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,420
Besides his high IQ,

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,340
he also has high EQ.

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,220
And he's never been in a relationship.

37
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,820
You could say he has the heart of an innocent child,

You're not taking a fancy to our boss, are you?

41
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,570
Thanks, buddy.

42
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,570
This doesn't make any sense.

43
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,750
It doesn't make sense indeed.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,170
Someone so outstanding couldn't possibly have a secret crush on me.

45
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,470
No, precisely, a secret crush on you.

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,670
Hey, what do you mean?

47
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,750
Nothing.

48
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,470
Alright, you can go now.

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,220
Goodbye. I actually wish it was a secret crush.

50
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,300
Such an outstanding man.

51
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,550
How could I have missed him back then?

52
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,510
Hold on.

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,220
Okay, okay. I'll be right there.

Where are you going?

57
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,510

58

68

Right. I lost my student ID that day.

69

Isn't this my student ID?

70
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,650
Could it be that he really has a crush on me?

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,870
I've calculated it.

Sure, no problem.

77
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,420
Well, take off your helmet.

I saw you leave in such a hurry,

and I was quite worried about you.

137
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,430
I didn't know when you'd be back,

Thank you.

147
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,780
This is from the first time I went to the welfare home

148
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,220
for volunteer work.

149
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,909
I made it with the kids there.

150
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,309
In their eyes,

151
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,130
I saw a longing for company.

152
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,850
Actually, I can relate to that,

153
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,230
because I didn't have that before, either.

154
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,790
Even in college,

155
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,150
I only got to where I am today

with the help of many families.

157
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,460
So from that time on, I was determined that

when I grew up,

159
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,510
I'd do my utmost

161
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,910
When I told you

162
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,750
I didn't want the poverty scholarship anymore today,

163
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,150
it wasn't just to look good.

164
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,750
It was because I felt I'm capable now,

165
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,710
and I thought I shouldn't take up this quota anymore.

166
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,820
You're not taking up the quota.

167
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,430
Besides, all your conditions

168
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,260
meet the application requirements.

169
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,100
It's not like you're lying.

170
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,800
Also, aren't we graduating this summer?

171
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,590
Don't you want to stay in this city and work here?

172
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,640
Won't you need money for

173
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,400
rent and food too?

174
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,860
I can borrow

175
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,490
and earn money,

176
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,880
but I can't take advantage of this.

177
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,960
This is what I learned from those kids.

178
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,470
I think only in this way

179
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,940
can I receive more lasting rewards.

180
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,200
How is it? Do you like it?

181
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,220
I do.

182
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,640
Happy birthday.

183
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,190
Thank you.

184
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,830
I'm leaving then.

188
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,510
Beer tastes really good.

189
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,690
I haven't had it for years.

190
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,550
You just said

191
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,390
I've become a very skilled doctor.

192
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,470
How skilled?

193
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,630
A renowned expert?

194
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,870
A renowned expert.

195
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,520
The nationally renowned kind.

196
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,710
Is that true?

197
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,490
Am I very busy then?

198
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,750
Am I married?

199
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,930
Xi, are you not confident enough in yourself?

200
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,220
But there are many young men pursuing you.

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,470
You're lying.

202
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,870
There are definitely not as many people

203
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,490
pursuing me as there are pursuing you, Gu Nian, okay?

204
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,830
However,

205
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,910
since after seeing you enter into marriage,

206
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,910
I still manage to stay single,

207
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,820
I think I must have achieved that.

208
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,710
Sorry.

209
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,710
I shouldn't have brought that up.

210
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,380
Here, take all this money.

211
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,780
Thank you, Xi.

212
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,860
It's getting late.

213
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,980
You should head back.

214
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,490
Xi.

215
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,130
I have one more special request.

216
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,230
No way!

217
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,710
I don't have a place to stay.

218
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,870
Could you please take pity on me

219
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,950
and let me stay for a few days?

220
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,660
No way!

221
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay then.

222
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,410
Wait, what are you doing? Why are you taking off your clothes?

223
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,620
I'm telling you,

224
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,900
I'm not going to do your laundry.

225
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,820
Why are you still undressing?

226
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,040
None of my clothes will fit you.

227
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,780
Xi.

228
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,860
Let's keep the goodies within the family.

229
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,390
I haven't even touched

230
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,910
a guy with an eight-pack before.

231
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,020
You're lucky today.

232
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,640
I'll do whatever you say today, Xi.

233
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,870
I give up.

234
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,820
Go to that room.

235
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,530
Xi, you're the best!

236
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,920
Have you forgotten

237
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,350
that you're a man now?

238
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,550
I'm sorry, I... I'm just too excited.

239
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm going to bed then.

240
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,890
Good night.

241
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,720
Xi. Love you.

242
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,170
You still like him?

243
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,660
How come I run into you everywhere?

244
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,070
I know my own habits

245
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,150
very well, of course.

246
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,040
Here's the gas and travel fees.

247
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,540
This bracelet... Feng Huanan gave it to you, right?

248
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,910
Hey, does it have anything to do with you?

249
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,110
Don't think that just because you paid me back,

250
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,410
you can get chummy with me.

251
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,310
Did he tell you

252
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,990
that he made this with the kids

253
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,030
during his first time volunteering?

254
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,320
Actually, he bought it just last night.

255
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,390
If you don't believe me,

256
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,990
you can go check the third alley of Nanmen Food Street.

257
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,030
The old vendor there has a bunch of them.

258
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,020
Are you addicted to eavesdropping on people's conversations

259
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,750
and slandering others?

260
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,660
Give me your hand.

261
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,410
I have a gift for you.

262
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,010
What?

263
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,750
Give it to me.

264
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,310
Happy birthday.

265
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,730
You're really annoying.

266
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,480
Gu Nian!

267
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,050
Gu Nian.

268
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,190
It's eight yuan for one,

269
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,340
and 15 yuan for two.

270
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,910
If you like such cheap birthday wishes,

271
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,860
I can satisfy you too.

272
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,190
Angry already? You're angry just like that?

273
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,950
Are you angry because I told you the truth,

274
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,270
or because the truth is so disappointing?

275
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,260
Do you think you're so cool acting like this?

276
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,300
Let me tell you,

277
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,760
you're nothing in my eyes.

278
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,700
I don't care what you think of me.

279
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,070
I only care about your happiness.

280
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,030
Hey, do you think I can be happy

281
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,260
with you like this?

282
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,510
It's your birthday today.

283
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,990
Lin Xi will definitely treat you to dinner.

284
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,110
As long as you show up on time,

285
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,260
I guarantee there will be a surprise.

286
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,410
Why should I believe you?

287
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,490
As you can see,

288
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,500
if you don't listen to your elders,

289
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
you'll suffer for years.

290
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,320
You're crazy.

291
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,390
You don't want it anymore?

292
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,970
Are you sure you don't want it anymore?

293
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,340
Oh, youth.

294
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,170
I'm back!

295
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,490
When did he learn how to cook?

296
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,690
He even knows how to make sandwiches now.

297
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,910
I hope I'm not being tricked.

298
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,580
Thank you, Lin Xi.

299
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,700
When the whole world abandoned me,

300
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,100
you still warmed my heart.

301
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,940
I'll be back again.

302
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,180
Your loving breakfast is getting better and better.

303
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,619
Love you, darling.

304
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,380
Eat up.

305
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,270
Well, since my darling doesn't know how to make breakfast,

306
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,760
I'll take care of all these household chores from now on.

307
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,050
What are you watching?

308
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,580
Spit out the pit.

309
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,930
Look at this.

310
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,680
Here it comes.

311
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,020
When I'm watching this,

312
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,890
I have a feeling that the female lead and I,

313
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,930
in terms of fate,

314
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,120
have a tiny bit in common.

315
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,610
Look, we both come from poor families,

316
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,180
and we both work at the karaoke bar.

317
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,570
So how can I be more perceptive to others' moods

318
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,550
and make more money?

319
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,420
So I was thinking,

320
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,060
if I had the chance,

321
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,930
I must study acting seriously.

322
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,970
Which building do I live in again?

323
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,220
Boss.

324
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,740
There's 50,000 yuan left on this card.

325
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,540
Take it and use the money.

326
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,610
As for the rest, we'll figure something out together.

327
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,540
Take it. I have nowhere to spend it by myself anyway.

328
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,620
No matter what,

329
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,850
you still have us old friends by your side.

330
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,680
Whatever happens,

331
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,890
we can face it together.

332
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,970
How's your recovery?

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,160
I was just about to go see you.

334
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,910
Jiang. Jiang!

335
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,810
Jiang, I'm so happy to see you!

336
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,610
Jiang!

337
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,530
What's wrong with you?

338
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,970
Jiang, which building do I live in again?

339
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,370
Unit 4.

340
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,740
What's wrong?

341
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,720
Nothing. Can you take me there?

342
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,770
Boss, I heard from Gao Ren

343
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,020
that you couldn't even recognize him,

344
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,380
and you forgot that you're a man?

345
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm wondering,

346
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,700
since when did you start to hate Feng Huanan so much

347
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,720
and have such a big grudge against him?

348
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,030
Say something.

349
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,980
When did you fall for Gu Nian?

350
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,490
Alright, you won't talk, huh?

351
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,420
Fine. I'll go ask Gu Nian.

352
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,550
I have her contact information.

353
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,630
J-Jiang. You care so much about Gu Nian?

354
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,890
Even though you're a year older than her,

355
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,980
you accompany her on motorcycle rides and act like a fanboy.

356
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,560
Do you like her?

357
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,820
Who told you that?

358
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,600
If I say you told me yourself,

359
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,480
would you believe it?

360
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,470
Back on the campus,

361
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,010
you, riding ahead of everyone, looking dashing and elegant,

362
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,500
captivated so many students in college, Gu Nian.

363
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,360
You were the one who introduced me to motorcycle riding.

364
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,810
Back then, I was your fanboy.

365
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,220
Are you not fully recovered?

366
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,430
Not now, but in the future.

367
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,220
In the future, you'll tell Gu Nian yourself.

368
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,770
There's no wound.

369
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,260
Is it internal injury?

370
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,410
Did Feng Huanan invite you

371
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,540
to start a business together with him after graduation?

372
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,480
He'll find investors, and you'll be in charge of technologies?

373
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,690
Yes, that's true.

374
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,940
But he asked me not to tell anyone.

375
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,770
How did you know?

376
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,770
You're so smart.

377
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,820
Follow your guess,

378
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,340
and don't treat me as Su Yin now.

379
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,720
I know

380
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,740
your graduate research topic is virtual reality.

381
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,130
You should know what I'm talking about.

382
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,300
No, I don't understand.

383
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,420
This is a bit too much information.

384
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,870
Jiang, seeing you again,

385
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm really happy.

386
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,780
Jiang?

387
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,240
Jiang.

388
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,130
What am I thinking about?

389
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,290
Why are you just standing here? Go in.

390
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,220
How?

391
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,100
I don't have a key.

392
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,080
He really did bring back that helmet.

393
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,720
I strongly suspect now

394
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,560
it's no coincidence that I came back in his body.

395
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,440
Jiang.

396
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,210
Do you know what spatial computing is?

397
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,410
I've never heard of it.

398
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,610
Gao Ren doesn't know,

399
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,410
and you don't know either.

400
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,930
Isn't this within your professional field?

401
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,330
We haven't delved into that area yet.

402
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,300
Where did you hear about it?

403
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,840
It's nothing. Maybe I'm overthinking it.

404
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,590
You just told me downstairs

405
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,900
that you are Gu Nian?

406
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,580
So now, your inner self is Gu Nian,

407
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,110
and your outer shell is Su Yin?

408
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:32,740
That's right.

409
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,980
Then where has our boss gone?

410
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I don't know either.

411
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,190
I've just returned as well.

412
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,900
How can you make me believe

413
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,930
that you are Gu Nian?

414
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,020
...Then I arrived at the auditorium.

415
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,730
And you already know what happened after that.

416
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,610
So you just picked, picked, and picked.

417
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,110
And then, in the blink of an eye, you were at the auditorium?

418
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,260
Feng Huanan!

419
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,500
You scumbag!

420
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,560
What are you doing? What do you want?

421
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,280
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,340
Feng Huanan, you bastard!

423
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,930
You lied to me for seven whole years.

424
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,780
You had another child,

425
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,100
and you abandoned me and Doudou!

426
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,460
You took what my parents left me away

427
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,340
and made it your own!

428
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,710
You ruined my life!

429
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,930
What gifts have I given to Gu Nian?

430
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:34,770
Oh, right.

431
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,100
You also gave me a motorcycle model.

432
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,130
The wheel fell off at that time,

433
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,930
and you said you'd fix it,

434
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,870
but you never returned it to me.

435
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,400
What restaurant have I been to with Gu Nian?

436
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,930
What's her favorite dish to order?

437
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,230
And who paid for that meal?

438
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,810
What dish did she hate the most?

439
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,330
Do you believe me now?

440
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,260
This is unscientific.

441
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,570
But it's real.

442
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,140
Boss.

443
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,600
Gu Nian.

444
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,810
I know you can't accept it at once,

445
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,170
but this is the truth.

446
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,410
I've already accepted it.

447
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,130
So you're saying

448
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,010
the topics we're researching now

449
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,410
will all be realized in the future?

450
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,580
I'm not sure either.

451
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,690
Tell me more.

452
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,780
Later, Gu Nian and I...

453
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,850
What happened to us?

454
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,990
Later, I married Feng Huanan.

455
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,740
You kept waiting for me,

456
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,100
and you never married.

457
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,070
And then?

458
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,770
That's all.

459
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,970
But when I was in my darkest hour,

460
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,930
you were there to help me all along.

461
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,810
You're a good guy.

462
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,010
No, not that.

463
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,420
So... So you never

464
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,020
had any feelings for me at all?

465
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,630
See, you admitted it.

466
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,780
You like me.

467
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,170
The one I like is Gu Nian!

468
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,010
Isn't that the same?

469
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:21,920
I am also Gu Nian.

470
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,740
Come on, you're not believing his nonsense, are you?

471
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,730
Lin Xi, let me tell you.

472
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,610
You've just dealt with too few men.

473
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,980
Many men nowadays

474
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,630
are like peacocks.

475
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,940
They'll do anything to get your attention.

476
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,700
Then how do you explain

477
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,580
that he knows so much about our childhood details?

478
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,470
He's a computer genius.

479
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,290
I don't think there's anything he can't find out.

480
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,050
Besides,

481
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,490
we're not living in

482
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,890
a completely private environment.

483
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,610
Didn't you say yourself that

484
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,320
the doctors at your hospital also said

485
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,580
there's nothing wrong with his brain or body?

486
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,810
Then there must be something wrong with him here.

487
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,820
He's psychologically disturbed.

488
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,940
But he doesn't mean any harm, right?

489
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,460
And who would pursue a girl

490
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,030
in such a disgusting way?

491
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,200
You're wrong again.

492
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,050
Even disgust is a kind of emotion.

493
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,830
First, he'd let you get to know him.

494
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,100
The next thing you know, he's everywhere in your life.

495
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,300
This kind of person is even more frightening.

496
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,010
Persistently invading your life,

497
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,020
and you can't do anything about it.

498
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,480
Alright, alright.

499
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,660
Even if he's your obsessive pursuer,

500
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,130
treating your crush as an imaginary enemy,

501
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,620
causing trouble and exposing things,

502
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,620
but between someone you like

503
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,710
and someone who likes you,

504
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,740
which one would you choose?

505
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,300
This is even more frustrating to think about.

506
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,280
Your boss isn't really having a crush on me too, is he?

507
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,300
He just loves to paint.

508
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,570
Come here first.

509
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,060
Tell me more.

510
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,090
Are there any other stories?

511
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,770
I want to find a new man for Gu Nian.

512
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,800
Think about it.

513
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,220
You want me to think about it?

514
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,520
Are you talking about finding a new man for this Gu Nian here,

515
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,090
or for that Gu Nian?

516
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,700
Of course, it's for that Gu Nian.

517
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,340
Well, you see...

518
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,260
You want to change the past,

519
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,810
and I want to change the future.

520
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,400
Do you think I'm up to it?

521
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,290
Yes. That's exactly what I was thinking.

522
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,910
But what if Gu Nian doesn't agree?

523
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,690
I am her.

524
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,690
I know her well.

525
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,850
How about this? We'll go tell her

526
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,780
that we both have a crush on her,

527
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,730
and let her choose.

528
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,810
We both have a crush on her?

529
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,130
Fifty percent chance?

530
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,620
No.

531
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,120
You are Gu Nian.

532
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,820
Right.

533
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,310
So you'll both be mine.

534
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,130
This... Must be fate.

535
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,490
If you had asked me this question this morning,

536
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,480
I would have chosen my prince charming without hesitation.

537
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,060
But I went to that street stall Su Yin talked about,

538
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,740
and the vendor

539
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,990
thought I was a returning customer.

540
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,870
It was so embarrassing, really.

541
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,070
Let me see.

542
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,010
You're smiling so sweetly.

543
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,020
But you still put it on.

544
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,670
Because I like him.

545
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,770
All these years,

546
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,330
so many guys have liked me,

547
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,160
but I haven't fallen for any of them.

548
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,290
You know,

549
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,250
since my dad passed away,

550
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,460
I've actually been quite depressed.

551
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,980
Only he gives off a father-like vibe.

552
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,700
He's like the sun,

553
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
so warm,

554
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,820
and he gives me energy.

555
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,010
But he still lied about this gift.

556
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,330
This isn't something Su Yin could control, right?

557
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,290
This must be because he doesn't have money,

558
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,900
but he wants to make me happy, right?

559
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,820
Doesn't this actually prove that he really likes me?

560
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,920
Look how happy you are.

561
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,570
I don't know how much he likes you,

562
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,460
but you certainly like him a lot.

563
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,370
Even without Su Yin,

564
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,220
in the future, if you discover on your own

565
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,660
that he lied about this gift,

566
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,570
you would come up with the same reason to justify it,

567
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,380
wouldn't you?

568
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,620
So annoying.

569
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,810
It's all because of this Su Yin.

570
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,570
Lin Xi.

571
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,010
Don't you think this Su Yin

572
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,690
is really like a ghost?

573
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,570
He just keeps

574
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,210
suddenly appearing behind you,

575
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,060
floating around.

576
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,140
Here, have some sweets.

577
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,150
Gu Nian!
