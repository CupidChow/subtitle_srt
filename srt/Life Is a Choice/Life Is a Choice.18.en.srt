You kindly saved him.

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,310
Why did he hit you?

4
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,620
Well, in the service industry,

5
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,110
the customer is always right.

6
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,009
Besides, he was drunk.

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,940
It was understandable.

8
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,830
Huanan, can you quit this job?

9
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,080
How could I?

10
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,420
With just the salary from my day job,

11
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,539
it'll take ages before I can marry you.

12
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,509
It's fine.

13
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm already exhausted from work during the day.

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,470
When I get home, I just want to lie down.

15
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,180
And yet you still have to do designated driving.

16
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,389
No, that's too tiring.

17
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,030
It's not tiring. I'm a man, after all.

18
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,540
Isn't it normal for me to work hard?

19
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,430
Besides, a lot of men nowadays

20
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,430
work a full-time job during the day

21
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,250

I'll make money with you.

28
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,340
I'll do designated driving too.

29
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,850
No, that won't do.

30
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,540
If your mom finds out

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,310
her precious daughter is going through such a hardship,

32
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,020
she'll definitely look down on me even more.

33
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,550
Isn't she just looking down on you

34
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,030
because of your job and low income?

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,150
I'll be just like you.

36

Let's see what she'll say then.

37
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,770
Don't go against your mom.

38
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,280
This was my fault.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,579
I was too impulsive.

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,390
I shouldn't have let my love for you

41
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,470
and my desire to protect you

42
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,570

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,090
right?

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,990
You're always speaking up for her.

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,950
She's never said a single nice word about you.

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,910
Well, it was the first time your mom met me.

47
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,790
It's normal that she doesn't know me well.

48
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,380

Let me tell you, Nian,

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,990
there are so many people who hold the belief

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
that poor couples are miserable.

56
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,990

The hardship now is only temporary.

I will definitely find a suitable job.

But you, don't overwork yourself.

78

We're not in the same company anymore,

so I can't always take care of you.

80

You'll probably have to take care of yourself.

She's never let me ride with her.

I'll take responsibility for all the consequences.

125
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,170
You'll take responsibility?

00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,530
You were late for nearly an hour.

Today is the first test of the Revisit Project.

133
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,890
Such an important matter,

134
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,290
and you were actually late?

135
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,010
I trusted you so much before.

136
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,450
I even entrusted the whole project team to you.

137
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,530
And what did you do?

138
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,170
You were late at a critical moment.

139
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,610
You've really disappointed me.

Jiang,

142
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,450
why didn't you give the speech on my behalf first?

143
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,570
You could've at least bought me some time.

144
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,810
I did.

145
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,970
I've been slowing the speech down.

146
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,730
The problem is I couldn't hold on anymore.

147
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,220
Mr. Li was watching his watch,

148
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,409
sighing,

149
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,610

150
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,250
He wanted to hear it from you,

151
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,620
not from me.

152
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,409
Come on, where did you go?

153
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,250

is my dad's death anniversary.

155
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,800

Mom, where is the household registration book?

157

It's in the drawer.

158
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,820
I've been looking for it in there, but I couldn't find it.

159
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,810
Where else could it be?

160
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,650
It's always been there.

161
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,190
You didn't hide it, did you?

162
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,590
Why would I hide it?

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,980
Well, only you and I know

164
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,450
where the household registration book is.

165
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,210
If it's not you,

166
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,170
could it be me?

167
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,850
What do you need the household registration book for?

168
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,220
I need it for something.

169
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,850
Are you looking for the household registration book

170
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,860
to register your marriage with Feng?

171
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,640
Yes.

do you know what today is?

174
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,440
Today is your dad's death anniversary.

175
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,050
And you're actually thinking of getting married?

176
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,780
What? Didn't I set a reminder

177
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,860
on my phone of my dad's death anniversary?

178
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,050
Why didn't it remind me?

179
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,330
Do you need a phone reminder of your dad's death anniversary?

180
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,970
Your head is full of Feng Huanan.

181
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,420
Do you even have room for your father in your heart anymore?

182
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,770
Mom, don't say that.

183
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,650
I know it's my fault about Dad.

184
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,210
I'll go apologize to him tomorrow.

185
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,250
But, can you please give me the household registration book first?

186
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,100
I'm telling you, the household registration book isn't with me.

187
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,210
Even if it were,

188
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,690
I wouldn't give it to you.

189
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,210
Why wouldn't you give it to me?

190
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,150
Even the law states marriage is a free choice.

191
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,450
Why wouldn't I give it to you?

192
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,410
Because I'm your mother.

193
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,970
I don't want to stand by and watch you make a mistake!

194
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,420
Yes.

195
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,690
You are my mother.

196
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,190
But I'm not your puppet.

197
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,750
Since I was a child,

198
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,490
whenever I skateboarded or rode motorcycles,

199
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,770
you said I was irresponsible.

200
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,410
When I grew up and started looking for a job,

201
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,450
you wanted to arrange one for me.

202
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,970
When I have someone I like,

203
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,890
you want to stop me from being with him.

204
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,210
Only when I live the way you want me to,

205
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,180
am I considered the good

206
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,940
and obedient child.

207
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,530
I know it.

208
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,250
I know these years have been tough for you.

209
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,450
I've been compromising myself to please you,

210
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,010
just so you wouldn't be upset.

211
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,890
But you can't just think about yourself

212
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,380
and not care about my life, right?

213
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,010
What did you say?

214
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,980
All these years, you've been pretending to be happy

215
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,850
just to please me?

216
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,710
Yes.

217
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,410
I've been pretending to be happy.

218
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,370
But now, I don't want to pretend anymore.

219
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,820
And I can't keep pretending any longer.

220
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,300
Nian, do you know what you just said?

221
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,050
I know exactly what I said.

222
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,410
Because you've never understood the real me.

223
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,690
Why do I like Feng Huanan?

224
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,120
Because in front of him, I don't have to pretend,

225
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,050
and I don't have to be so perfect.

226
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,650
The love he gives me is equal.

227
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,490
Mom,

228
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,450
I've never felt unconditional love

229
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,650
from you,

230
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,010
nor have I ever been my true self!

231
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,980
No matter what you say,

232
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,650
even if you don't give me the household registration book,

233
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,200
I will still get married.

234
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,770
I want you to know

235
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,600
that we won't be defeated by reality,

236
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,120
and that my life

237
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,810
will no longer be controlled by anyone.

238
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,800
Gu Nian!

239
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,980
Gu Nian.

240
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,910
Mom? Mom!

241
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,620
Mom, hang in there.

242
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,290
I'll call Gu Nian and ask her to come back.

243
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,070
Don't call her.

244
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,550
I don't want to see her.

245
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,880
Okay.

246
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,490
Get up first.

247
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,980
Come on.

248
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,820
Let's go to the hospital first.

249
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,010
Ambulance!

250
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,920
Lin Xi.

251
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,820
It's okay.

252
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,600
Don't worry.

253
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,570
I've already asked the attending doctor.

254
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,960
It's a mild cerebrovascular blockage.

255
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,610
They've already done thrombolysis treatment.

256
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,070
She's temporarily out of danger now.

257
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,820
Aunt Dai has woken up.

258
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,700
The treatment was timely,

259
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,610
so there shouldn't be any serious long-term effects.

260
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,010
But the MRI shows that

261
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,570
there are still several areas in her blood vessels that are narrowed.

262
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,050
Lin Xi, you must help me

263
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,820
find the most authoritative doctor in this field.

264
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,170
Money is no object.

265
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,320
We must cure my mother.

266
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,810
You don't need to tell me that.

267
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,090
She's not only your mother;

268
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,250
she's also my Aunt Dai.

269
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,680
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

270
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,540
Come on, let's sit down and talk.

271
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,610
Try to relax a bit.

272
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,680
What about that Gu Nian?

273
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,100
Why didn't I see her?

274
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,860
My mom said she didn't want to see her

275
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,210
and told me not to contact her.

276
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,010
Wait, what exactly did she do

277
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,210
to make Aunt Dai so angry?

278
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,170
When I see her, I'll slap her.

279
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,890
Back then, I made my mom this angry too.

280
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,720
Xi,

281
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,490
why don't you slap me as well?

282
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,090
Consider it waking up my past self.

283
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,210
I'm really going to do it.

284
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,490
I'm gonna slap your face.

285
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,890
Mom.

286
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,610
Godmother.

287
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,620
How are you feeling?

288
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,810
Much better.

289
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,570
Su,

290
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,370
thank you.

291
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,090
You saved my life.

292
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,120
No need to thank me.

293
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,850
You're my godmother.

294
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,210
A godmother is just like a mother.

295
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
The doctor said

296
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,450
it's a mild cerebrovascular blockage.

297
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,880
As long as you stay in a good mood

298
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,110
and cooperate with the treatment,

299
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,610
you'll recover soon.

300
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,570
You're more worried about me than Nian.

301
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,410
You didn't tell her, did you?

302
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,490
No.

303
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,490
You said you didn't want to see her,

304
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,970
so I didn't contact her.

305
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,970
I'm afraid she'll upset you again.

306
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,210
You

307
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,210
are a good child.

308
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,170
If only Nian

309
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,600
were half as sensible

310
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,610
as you.

311
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,090
I used to make mistakes too

312
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,950
and often argued with my mom.

313
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,490
I'm not a good child.

314
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,370
Su,

315
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,490
was it you who helped me with the admission?

316
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,250
Nian wasn't here,

317
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,690
and you didn't have my personal information.

318
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,720
How did you handle the admission procedures?

319
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,540
It was... it was Lin Xi.

320
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,170
Gu Nian introduced me to Lin Xi before.

321
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,770
Lin Xi has been helping you

322
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,730
schedule your physical exams.

323
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,410
She has your personal information.

324
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,210
Su,

325
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,970
you didn't tell me the truth.

326
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,090
Nian even forgot her dad's death anniversary.

327
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,450
She wouldn't have asked you to pick me up.

328
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,090
Tell me the truth.

329
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,010
How did you know about

330
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,010
Nian's dad's death anniversary?

331
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,570
And how did you know

332
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,650
the exact location of the cemetery?

333
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,730
Gu Nian, you're really disappointing.

334
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,760
Su,

335
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,050
help me sit up a bit.

336
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:14,609
Sure.

337
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,970
Su,

338
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,300
why do I feel like

339
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,210
you're so familiar?

340
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Nian said...

341
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,800
you came from somewhere else.

342
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,250
What exactly does that mean?

343
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,410
Godmother, how should I explain this to you?

344
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,340
Do you believe there might be

345
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,570
multiple dimensions in this world?

346
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,610
That people who have disappeared

347
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,250
might return through some sort of medium,

348
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,560
from another space?

349
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,090
They could come back as a tree,

350
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,040
a cat,

351
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,300
a speck of dust...

352
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,820
or even a person—

353
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,410
someone you wouldn't expect.

354
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,170
Gu, is that you?

355
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,650
I'm not him. I'm not Gu.

356
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,680
I am...

357
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,630
I am...

358
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,480
I must be out of my mind from being upset with Nian.

359
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,380
How could you possibly be Gu?

360
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,700
You can't be Gu.

361
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,980
Gu couldn't possibly be as young as you.

362
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,650
I'm not Gu.

363
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,270
It could be someone else.

364
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,770
Someone...

365
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,490
who's also very close to you.

366
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,610
The person closest to me,

367
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,170
besides Gu, is Nian.

368
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,380
It couldn't be Nian.

369
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,650
There's no way there could be two Nians to make me mad.

370
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,490
You can't be Gu.

371
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,090
Gu would never come back

372
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,700
and disappear again.

373
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,390
He wouldn't bear to make me suffer again.

374
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,610
No matter who you are,

375
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,890
you're like my child.

376
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,070
Oh, right.

377
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,370
Godmother,

378
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,330
the doctor told me to take off this bracelet

379
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,730
during the emergency treatment earlier.

380
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,970
I'm returning it to you.

381
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,700
It was a gift from Nian

382
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,810
on my birthday.

383
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,880
At that time,

384
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,970
it was her first competition,

385
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,620
and she won first place.

386
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,570
With the prize money,

387
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,760
she bought this for me.

388
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,820
I've been wearing it for two years,

389
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,180
and never had the heart to take it off.

390
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,050
You call me godmother,

391
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,450
but I've never bought you a gift.

392
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,230
Here.

393
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,290
I'm giving it to you.

394
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,760
Consider this my welcoming gift to you,

395
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,220
and also a token of the bond between us

396
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,320
as mother and son.

397
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,330
Godmother, I'm going to the restroom.

398
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,690
Su Yin!

399
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,610
Come here.

400
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,770
You came at just the right time.

401
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,800
I was about to catch you.

402
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,780
I was about to catch you.

403
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,010
Give me the household registration book.

404
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,450
What are you talking about?

405
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,170
You're still playing dumb with me, huh?

406
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,480
Only my mom and I know where it is.

407
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,410
If it's not you, who else could it be?

408
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,010
But I still won't give it to you.

409
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,970
I can't stand by and watch you make a mistake.

410
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,230
Su Yin, don't you think you're being ridiculous?

411
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,710
You think that if you take the household registration book,

412
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,810
you can stop me?

413
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,050
Let me tell you,

414
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,770
no matter how many times you come back,

415
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,770
as long as Feng Huanan is still Feng Huanan,

416
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,010
I'll still like him.

417
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,850
You can't change that,

418
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,970
and you can't stop it.

419
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,210
Because you're not the current me.

420
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,690
You can't change how I feel.

421
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,000
Seeing you now,

422
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,920
I realize how awful I must have been back then.

423
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,120
I really want to slap you.

424
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,540
Come on, go ahead. Slap me.

425
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,280
There's something I didn't tell you.

426
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,140
Mom's in the hospital.

427
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,090
It was all because of you.

428
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,460
What are you talking about?

429
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,430
Mom is in good health.

430
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,830
Take a look for yourself.

431
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,930
Nian,

432
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,610
you finally want to see me.

433
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,970
Godmother, you're so weak.

434
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,840
Why don't we just not record?

435
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,420
Let's record it.

436
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,290
I don't want to see her right now,

437
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,570
but I don't want her to worry either.

438
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,210
What if, when she comes to her senses,

439
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,290
she wants to see me

440
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,890
and finds out I'm still in the hospital?

441
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,940
She'll just worry.

442
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,610
Let's just record this video.

443
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,810
When she remembers to video call me,

444
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,890
just tell her I'm busy

445
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,370
and send her this video.

446
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,810
Aren't I quite clever?

447
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,290
Yes, quite clever.

448
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,010
Well,

449
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,550
are you ready?

450
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,450
Godmother, let's do it. Come on.

451
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,010
Wait a moment.

452
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,010
Alright, let's do it.

453
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,090
Let's start recording.

454
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,290
Nian,

455
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,050
you finally want to see Mom.

456
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,770
I'm quite busy right now

457
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,450
and don't have time to take your video call.

458
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,410
You

459
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,270
can just do whatever you want.

460
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,970
I can't always keep an eye on you.

461
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,840
As long as you

462
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,930
don't do anything out of line, that's fine.

463
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,010
That's it.

464
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,450
I'm going to get back to work.

465
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,490
Alright.

466
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,210
How was it?

467
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,370
Why are you crying?

468
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,810
I already told you

469
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,850
that I'm making this up for Nian.

470
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,080
Maybe by the time she comes looking for me,

471
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,490
I'll have been discharged,

472
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,170
and this video

473
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,490
will be useless then.

474
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,690
It's just a backup.

475
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,650
When you have time,

476
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,370
help me edit it.

477
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,210
And add a little

478
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,690
beauty filter for me.

479
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,770
Don't let her see how haggard I look.

480
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,610
When did this happen?

481
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,970
Just last night.

482
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,090
Then why didn't you call me right away?

483
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,050
You blocked me.

484
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,570
How was I supposed to call you?

485
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,690
Let's go and find Mom now.

486
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:16,940
Hurry up.

487
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,730
The room on the left.

488
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,170
Mom.

489
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:30,970
Godmother.

490
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,290
Why are you here?

491
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,690
Have a seat first.

492
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,570
Su,

493
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,170
didn't I tell you

494
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,610
not to tell Nian?

495
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,650
I'm sorry, Godmother.

496
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,490
I didn't keep my promise to you.

497
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,370
Sit down.

498
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,140
Mom.

499
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,010
I'm sorry.

500
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,370
I didn't know you were sick.

501
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,180
And I made you angry like that.

502
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,480
It's alright, it's alright.

503
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,460
Why are you crying?

504
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,170
I'm fine, aren't I?

505
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,210
You should scold me.

506
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,570
Or you can hit me.

507
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,770
Why should I scold you?

508
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,610
You didn't make any big mistakes.

509
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,410
Isn't it all because

510
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,700
I made you so angry last night that you got sick?

511
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,870
That's not a big mistake.

512
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,820
Alright, alright.

513
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,620
Life's long.

514
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,560
There will be plenty of days for you to make me angry in the future.

515
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,020
Stop crying.

516
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,210
Godmother, I went back and taught her a good lesson for you.

517
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,340
I got back at her for you.

518
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,370
You

519
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,110
are becoming more and more like an older brother now.

520
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,020
And you're starting to be

521
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,900
more like one of our Gu family's children.

522
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,420
Mom, I really didn't mean to upset you.

523
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,500
I just lost my temper for a moment.

524
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,220
Alright, alright.

525
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,410
I know.

526
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,810
I know what my own kid

527
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,010
is like.

528
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,490
Mom,

529
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,970
about me marrying Huanan,

530
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,250
let's put that aside for now.

531
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,900
Let's focus on your health first

532
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,640
and get you better, okay?

533
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,080
Why should we put it aside?

534
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,980
Just because I'm sick?

535
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,210
Doesn't that feel like emotional blackmail?

536
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,610
I'm not that kind of person.

537
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,210
Nian, tell me the truth.

538
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,040
Whether I'm sick or not,

539
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,120
even if I become a vegetable,

540
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,490
would you still like him

541
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,770
and want to be with him?

542
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,340
You must be honest with me.

543
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,610
Don't lie to me.

544
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,760
Mom,

545
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,320
I really like Huanan,

546
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,420
but I'm afraid of making you angry.

547
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,770
Then do what you want.

548
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,250
I won't stop you.

549
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,050
Mom.

550
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,970
I'm not saying this out of anger.

551
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,010
I'm being honest.

552
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,010
Since you like him no matter what,

553
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,010
what's the point of me stopping you?

554
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,480
I almost

555
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,890
didn't make it.

556
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,420
Some things,

557
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,770
I've come to terms with.

558
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,690
If at that time,

559
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,810
I hadn't made it,

560
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,900
maybe you two would still end up together anyway.

561
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,370
So, since that's the case,

562
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,210
you should do what you want.

563
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,410
I won't be the bad guy here.

564
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,090
Godmother.

565
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,460
Mom, why did you say things like that?

566
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,890
However, let me be clear upfront.

567
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,290
No matter what kind of ceremony

568
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,550
you two have in the future,

569
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,880
don't ask me to take charge of it.

570
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,640
I'm already too busy with my own affairs.

571
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,410
As for your own affairs,

572
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,210
you'll have to figure them out yourselves.

573
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,010
Once everything is ready, just let me know.

574
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,810
Su,

575
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,170
you've always

576
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,650
been so good to me and Nian.

577
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,180
I really appreciate it.

578
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,950
As for Nian's matters,

579
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,420
I won't trouble you with them anymore.

580
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,460
Let her decide for herself.

581
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,870
Mom,

582
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,640
are you saying this

583
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,600
because you still haven't truly accepted us being together?

584
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,360
Nian,

585
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,240
I've already made the biggest concession I can.

586
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,370
You can't ask me to try harder, can you?

587
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,360
Got it.

588
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,250
Alright, I've said everything

589
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,250
I needed to say.

590
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,160
You should be going now, shouldn't you?

591
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,450
Don't let this interfere with your work.

592
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,680
Mom, I'm not leaving.

593
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,850
I want to stay here with you.

594
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,740
Director Su,

595
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,210
I'd like to take a few days off.

596
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,310
Okay.

597
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,650
What are you talking about?

598
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,490
Aren't you afraid of getting fired?

599
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,420
Hurry up and leave. Otherwise, I'll chase you out.

600
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,130
I'm not leaving, Mom.

601
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,410
I'll see you two off to the door.

602
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,650
No, no, no.

603
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,010
Godmother.

604
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:48,970
Be careful, Mom.

605
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,210
I'm fine.

606
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,170
Be careful.

607
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,050
I'm fine.

608
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,020
I'll let you see.

609
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,820
Get in the car.

610
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,600
I'll take care of Aunt Dai.

611
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,450
Just go.

612
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,100
Mom, I'm leaving then.

613
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,780
Just go.

614
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,580
I'm really leaving.

615
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:16,650
Go.

616
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,310
Just go.

617
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,330
Go now.

618
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,650
Godmother, I'm leaving.

619
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,570
Mom, I'm really leaving.

620
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,410
Get in the car.

621
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,500
Go.

622
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,690
Mom, remember to call me.

623
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,510
Su.

624
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,030
Aunt Dai, let's go back.

625
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,950
Su,

626
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,720
give the household registration book to Nian.

627
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,650
Thank you for everything you've done for us.

628
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,510
Here.

629
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,560
Mom asked me to give it to you.

630
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,010
I'm following Mom's instructions.

631
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,300
This is the biggest concession I can make.

632
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,370
Gu Nian,

633
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,860
from now on, we won't interfere with you and Feng Huanan anymore.

634
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,490
But there are some things you must keep in mind.

635
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,020
What things?

636
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,850
The Revisit Project.

637
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,210
We made a mistake, so we should fix it as soon as possible.

638
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,740
What should we do?

639
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,210
I heard that Mr. Li is very angry.

640
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,490
Being upfront and honest

641
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,170
is the best way to show sincerity.

642
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,080
Mr. Li is someone who values relationships.

643
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,610
He will understand.

644
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,120
But I'm warning you,

645
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,960
before you see Feng Huanan,

646
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,330
make sure to handle this matter first.

647
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,160
I see.

648
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,050
Feng Huanan!

649
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,400
Come on, Nian.

650
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,969
Why are you here?

651
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:53,650
Was it fun?

652
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:54,610
Invisible?

653
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,889
Are you a ninja?

654
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,530
Quick, pull me out.

655
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,410
Alright, I'll get you out.

656
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,290
Come on.

657
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,050
Let me take a look.

658
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,690
Let me give it a try.

659
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,250
How is it?

660
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,690
You haven't even gotten in.

661
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,610
I feel like my chest

662
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,050
still hasn't gotten in.

663
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,760
That's right.

664
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,050
I... I can't move now.

665
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,220
I can't move at all.

666
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,570
You're just too cute.

667
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,450
Nian.

668
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Why did you call me over

669
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,610
so urgently?

670
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,970
I'm still running orders.

671
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,010
I placed your next order.

672
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,040
Stop kidding.

673
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,340
You don't even have a car. Why did you place an order?

674
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,690
It's our order.

675
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,750
Huanan,

676
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,370
my mom agreed.

677
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,170
Let's get married!

678
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,530
Really?

679
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,770
Really?

680
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:42,970
I...

681
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,330
Is it true, Nian?

682
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,050
It's true.

683
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,000
You must reschedule the wedding date.

684
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,740
Mom has already agreed.

685
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,840
Do you have a problem with that?
