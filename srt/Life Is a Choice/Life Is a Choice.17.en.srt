00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,870
Tu, I'm sorry.

3
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,550
I broke our promise.

4
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,310
Huanan and I are back together.

He proposed to me.

[If you're going to deceive her, then do so for a lifetime]

8
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,750
This is a good thing, right?

9
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,259
I should congratulate you.

10
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,910
When I, I came here, I saw your motorcycle

11
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,190
over there.

12
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,660
I knew it.

13
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,470
You're still the same Gu Nian.

14
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,190
You haven't changed one bit.

15
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,500
The motorcycle had been stolen before.

16
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,310
Huanan got it back for me.

17
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,079
That's good.

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,640
You should ride the motorcycle less in the future.

19
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,620
It's so dangerous.

20

Wait,

22
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,960
are you in love with me or something?

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,790
Why do you follow me wherever I go?

24
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,310
I should be the one to say that.

25
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,110
Let me guess

26
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,470
why you came here.

27
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,940
Is it to pick up girls now that you've made some money,

28
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,240
or hunt for a sugar mama?

29
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,920
That's vulgar and disgusting.

30
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,470
Let me tell you,

31
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,270
you don't even deserve to be called "God Su."

32
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,160
I'm warning you in advance.

33
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,430
I'm here for something important.

34
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,790
Please stop following me for now, okay?

35
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,829
Go find somewhere else to stay for now, alright?

Someone has also arranged to meet me here!

37
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,470
Looks like we're meeting the same person.

These

39
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,430
are the experiences that brought us

40
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,310
back together.

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,000
Lyu Tu,

42
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,790
I really didn't mean to break

43
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,880
our promise.

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,470
I just...

45
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,920

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,020
I will respect whatever it is.

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
So, you don't need to tell me

You say that—are you still angry?

You're Gu Nian.

Why are you so cautious in your words

58
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,790

Okay, I know it.

You're welcome.

Auntie.

78
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,240
I ordered these pastries for you,

79
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,030
thinking you might be hungry.

80
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,570
Thank you.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,590
It's my pleasure.

82
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,670
Since Nian hasn't called me,

83
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,800
it shows that you're a man of your word

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,000
and didn't tell her

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,590
about our meeting.

86
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,590
Because, after all,

87
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,270
you repeatedly asked me to keep it a secret.

88
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,659
I've always been a person who keeps my word.

89
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,970
You don't mind if I also invite Su to join us, do you?

90
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,790
I think our conversation

91
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,110
should have a witness.

92
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
This arrangement is good

93
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,550
for both you and me.

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
I don't mind, Auntie.

95
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,750
Nian told me

96
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,120
that you lost your job to help her,

97
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,270
and that you've saved her several times, even risking your own life.

98
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,640
That's nothing, Auntie.

99
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,380
I did it all willingly.

100
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,510
Thank you,

102
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,270
Nian has told me a lot about you.

103
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
You've really been through a lot.

104

that you're a very hardworking young man.

106
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,070
I also know

107
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,950
that you really want to stay in this city,

108
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,590
to have a decent job,

109
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,250
and to achieve a good social status,

110
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,310
right?

111
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,630
To be honest, I think this is

112
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,290
what every man wants to have.

113
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,150
It's not just me.

114

116
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:57,920

Okay.

120
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
Auntie, what do you mean?

121
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,390
I don't mean anything else by this.

122
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,560
I simply feel that you've helped Nian so much,

123
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,080
and I want to repay you.

124
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,470
These are some listed companies and leading enterprises.

125
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,870
They're all my friends.

Take a look at these materials

127

and see if you like any of them.

128

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,830
are you trying to buy me off?

130
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,970
Do you disapprove of me being with Nian?

131
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,910
Haven't you already proposed to Nian?

132
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,390

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,590
help Feng take a look

137
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
at which of these companies offer better conditions.

138

These are all

139
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,440
very prestigious companies that are hard to get into.

140
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,990
It has to be big companies like these

141
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,310
to match the status of our talented Feng.

142
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,830
Godmother,

143
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,670
previously, although the talented Feng

144
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,320
was just

145
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,630
a small intern at our company,

146
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,710
I, as the director,

147
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,430
back in the university drama club,

148
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,310
followed his directions.

149
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,030
Alright, let's not

150
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,110
bring up the past.

151
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,150
Godmother, things have passed,

152

but...

153

Su,

154
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,800
it was you who exposed Feng back then, wasn't it?

155
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,450
You weren't very magnanimous about that.

156
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,470
A man should be broad-minded.

157
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,660
No wonder Nian is so resistant to you.

158
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,030
In her eyes,

159
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,720
you've already lost.

160
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,670
Sorry,

161
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,400
I need to take this call.

162
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,030
Auntie,

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,630
so does that mean...

164
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,990
you approve of me and Nian's marriage?

165
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,510
First, tell me

166
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,440
your choice.

167
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,230
[Lyu Tu]

168
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,550
Was that a call from Nian?

169
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,710
No, it was just a spam call.

170
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,650
As expected of our Mrs. Dai,

171
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,300
so today I also have to pass her test, huh?

172
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,070
What should I do?

173
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,910
Now that you've reviewed all these materials,

174
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,980
which company would you like to choose?

175
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,400
Can I interpret it this way, Auntie?

176
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,870
You mean

177
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,470
I can only choose between Nian and work?

178
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,060
As for the job opportunity, it is indeed something

179
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,110
I want to make up for and repay you for.

180
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,870
You can either choose

181
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,270
or not choose.

182
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,310
I will definitely compensate for

183
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,240
your kindness to Nian.

184
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,640
However, this is not the main purpose

185
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,430
of why I invited you here today.

186
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,240
Then let's get straight to the point.

187
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,830
I'm all ears.

188
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,780
Feng,

189
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,940
first, I need to criticize you.

190
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,750
You shouldn't have proposed to Nian

191
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,480
without meeting me first.

192
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,630
This is too frivolous

193
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,870
and hasty of you.

194
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,320
You're also being too disrespectful

195
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,710
to me as her mother, aren't you?

196
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,960
If Nian and I end up having a conflict

197
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,910
because of this,

198
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,990
then the responsibility lies entirely with you.

199
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,910
Auntie,

200
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,120
I sincerely apologize for this first.

201
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,960
Maybe too many things have happened recently,

202
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
making me want to protect Nian even more.

203
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,810
I can't let her be in any danger anymore.

204
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,710
The proposal was, indeed, hasty of me.

205
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,090
But Auntie, this was definitely not

206
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,340
something I did on impulse.

207
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,110
Feng, let me be frank.

208
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,640
I don't agree with this.

209
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,680
It's not that I disagree with you two dating.

210
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,640
I disagree with you two

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,080
taking such a serious step

212
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,630
at this stage of your lives.

213
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,310
I understand, Auntie.

214
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,190
Otherwise, you wouldn't have bypassed Nian

215
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,120
to talk to me alone.

216
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,020
Auntie, I've told Nian before.

217
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,230
My family background isn't very good.

218
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,480
Right now, I don't have a job either.

219
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
That has also led people to look down on me

220
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,590
as I try to start my own business.

221
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,460
Indeed, I'm someone without a background,

222
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,770
power, or influence.

223
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,800
Compared to your family,

224
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,480
Nian is indeed too good for me.

225
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,610
I admit, she is out of my league.

226
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,770
So, I totally understand that you don't approve.

227
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,830
Feng, don't try to change the subject

228
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,800
and shift the focus onto me.

229
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,390
I, too, have experienced hardships in life.

230
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,720
I won't look down on your background.

231
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,040
But as a mother,

232
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,880
beyond encouragement and indulgence,

233
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,830
I hope even more that my daughter

234
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,670
will live a good life in the future,

235
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,340
a meaningful life.

236
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,560
I don't want her to make such an important decision

237
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,830
when she's still inexperienced in life.

238
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
Let me be frank:

239
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,460
I hope

240
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,910
she can explore more,

241
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,230
have more options,

242
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,930
and experience more in life.

243
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,920
Even if it's a few years later,

244
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,170
and you two get together then,

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,440
I won't have any problem with that.

246
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,830
But not now.

247
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,310
From your perspective,

248
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,670
there's indeed nothing wrong with that.

249
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,430
But, Auntie,

250
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,590
if I agree with you now,

251
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,080
how would you view

252
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,840
my feelings and promises to Nian?

253
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,950
As a man,

254
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,720
if the promises I made

255
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,580
can't be fulfilled just because of a little resistance,

256
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,080
then even I would despise myself.

257
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,200
Auntie,

258
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,350
I also hope

259
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,070
you can think from Nian's perspective.

260
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,190
Yes,

261
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,710
Nian doesn't necessarily have to accept my proposal,

262
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,270
but she hasn't rejected or refused it either.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,760
This shows

264
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,230
that this matter and her life plan

265
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,880
are neither contradictory nor conflicting.

266
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
But instead, it's you

267
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,590
who keeps her

268
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,470
trapped in the world you've planned out for her.

269
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,390
As long as it's contrary to your expectations,

270
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,320
it's all wrong.

271
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,030
I think this is the biggest problem.

272
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,110
Nian is not

273
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,710
an ignorant and simple girl.

274
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,030
Feng.

275
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,840
You understand Nian very well.

276
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,070
You know exactly what kind of support she needs and what to say to her.

277
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,240
No wonder Nian protects you so much.

278
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,530
Godmother.

279
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,470
I just overheard your conversation.

280
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,680
I think if I were Gu Nian,

281
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,230
I would be very upset now.

282
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,080
It seems like you two

283
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,870
are a multiple-choice question in my life.

284
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,210
I can only choose between a man and my mother.

285
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,950
Isn't that absurd?

286
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,120
Su Yin, Su Yin!

287
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,870
This is a major life decision in my life.

288
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,030
This is not something for you to joke about...

289
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,990
I'm not joking!

290
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,830
You're both tugging her in different directions.

291
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,000
Have you ever thought

292
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,640
that the force you're exerting on her

293
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,550
might cause a counterforce?

294
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,310
Gu Nian lives a simple life.

295
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,670
Although she claims to be an adult,

296
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,070
she may not have really thought through

297
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,270
her life plan at all.

298
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,210
What kind of plan could she make anyway?

299
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Riding a motorcycle,

300
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,430
wandering the world,

301
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,430
and dreaming of a fairy-tale world

302
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,040
where she lives happily ever after with one person.

303
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,430
She's got all those little dreams

304
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,480
of a young girl.

305
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,560
In the end, under your tug-of-war,

306
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,530
she makes a hasty decision.

307
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,940
It'll either be... what you want...

308
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,530
or what you want.

309
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,040
Just give her some time, okay?

310
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,350
I agree

311
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,040
to give her some time.

312
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,360
Feng,

313
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,830
what about you?

314
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,440
From the start, I've always respected Nian's choices.

315
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,990
These materials...

316
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,240
If someone else had given me these materials,

317
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,110
I'd have accepted them without hesitation,

318
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,590
Auntie.

319
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,230
But you're the one giving them to me.

320
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,110
I can't accept them.

321
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,950
Because I can't let you look down on me

322
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,590
from the very start.

323
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,730
I'll take my leave.

324
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,490
Godmother, I'll see him out.

325
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,690
You're quite something, Su Yin.

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,320
You even managed to make her your godmother.

327
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,760
Let me tell you,

328
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,850
you're nothing but a clown today.

329
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,270
Just a few steps out,

330
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,200
and you can't hide it anymore, can you?

331
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,819
Let me tell you,

332
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,109
since Gu Nian has chosen me,

333
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,720
I won't let go of her easily.

334
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,440
The more you try to obstruct me,

335
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,790
the more determined I'll be not to give up.

336
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,990
Neither will I.

337
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,600
Godmother.

338
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,230
Su,

339
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,310
I thought you wouldn't come back.

340
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,390
I must take you back today.

341
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,950
I'm worried that the bomb at home

342
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,830
might explode and hurt you.

343
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,390
I've realized that you

344
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,550
really understand Nian very well.

345
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,230
When faced with Nian's rejection,

346
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,870
did you just have nothing to do?

347
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,980
I must have disappointed you.

348
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,910
Actually, before today,

349
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,110
I hadn't thought that much about it.

350
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,830
I just wanted to make Gu Nian happy

351
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,860
and joyful

352
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,900
and get along well with you.

353
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,480
That's all.

354
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,750
I can see that.

355
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,010
I can tell that from the moment you left until you came back,

356
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,820
you didn't keep up the act anymore.

357
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,230
Putting on an act for you here,

358
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,280
I was being arrogant.

359
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,750
As sharp as ever, Mrs. Dai.

360
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,390
Don't blame me.

361
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,440
Nian is my precious daughter.

362
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,110
In front of her,

363
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,660
I've never said this before.

364
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,910
I really admire you,

365
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,070
but

366
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,030
I still can't fully trust you.

367
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,110
I don't know if you can understand

368
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,110
a mother's heart.

369
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,230
Of course.

370
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,630
Between us,

371
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,730
there's no need to say these things.

372
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,670
However, Godmother,

373
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,430
I've always had a question that I wanted to ask you.

374
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,680
Go ahead.

375
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,910
Did you get Gu Nian

376
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,760
a high-end, customized insurance policy?

377
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,480
I've bought her many insurance policies.

378
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,560
I don't quite remember them all.

379
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,950
But now that you've reminded me,

380
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,520
I do think it's necessary...

381
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,160
to get some more insurance for her.

382
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,000
Wang,

383
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,100
please help me schedule a meeting tomorrow

384
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,870
with an insurance company broker.

385
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,790
Ask him to come to my office.

386
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,170
I'll have a chat with him.

387
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,650
Mom, that's not what I meant.

388
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,590
But fortunately, you bought it.

389
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,370
Hello, Nian.

390
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,630
Hello, Huanan.

391
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,820
Go there early today.

392
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,590
My mom doesn't like tardiness.

393
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,030
I know. I've already met with your mother.

394
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,840
We've just finished talking.

395
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,850
What?

396
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,790
What's going on?

397
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,430
Why didn't she tell me anything?

398
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,310
What did you talk about?

399
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,230
I think your mother is right.

400
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,220
Our marriage needs a solid foundation.

401
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,890
Yes, I love you. I love you very much.

402
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,440
But right now, I have nothing.

403
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,150
I can't even give you a good life,

404
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,390
much less spare you from

405
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,270
suffering alongside me.

406
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,840
As for the wedding...

407
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,080
we should put that on hold for now,

408
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,800
okay?

409
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,960
Let's not see each other for a while.

410
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,390
After I've built up my career,

411
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,400
I'll have the confidence to face your mother.

412
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,960
Also,

413
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,750
tell Su Yin to stop playing games with me.

414
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,190
I'm busy making money now.

415
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,980
I'm focusing on my career.

416
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,590
I really don't have the energy to play along with him anymore.

417
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,690
Let's leave it at that for now.

418
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,020
I need to go work and make money.

419
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,400
Wait, Huanan...

420
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,820
Why are you in such a hurry to find me?

421
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,780
How's it going? Did you find new funding?

422
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,120
Feng Huanan,

423
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,950
am I just someone in your eyes

424
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,480
who makes connections for you?

425
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
How could that be? Of course not.

426
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,660
You're my soulmate.

427
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,450
Soulmate?

428
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,350
If Gu Nian hadn't told me today

429
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,710
that you had already proposed to her,

430
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,450
how long were you planning to keep it from me?

431
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,870
I wasn't planning to hide it from you.

432
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,110
Did you give me a chance?

433
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,720
Did you give me a chance to explain?

434
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,690
So darn filthy.

435
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,310
Rotten to the core.

436
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,030
Filthy.

437
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,290
Really filthy.

438
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,990
I'm a single, unmarried man

439
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,310
marrying a single, unmarried woman.

440
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,070
It's perfectly natural!

441
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,990
How am I filthy?

442
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,240
Do you love her?

443
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,390
Did you propose to her because you love her?

444
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,830
I love you! Will you marry me?

445
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,340
No, what are you playing at today?

446
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,020
What do you want?

447
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,230
You want to get married, right?

448
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,130
Alright, fine! Let's do it!

449
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,840
Let's go right now!

450
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,180
Whoever doesn't want to marry is a coward!

451
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,440
Are you crazy?

452
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,910
You love me, Lyu Tu.

453
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,470
I don't love anyone,

454
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,160
especially not you.

455
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,710
I only love myself.

456
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,120
If you only loved yourself,

457
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,680
you wouldn't care who I'm with,

458
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,510
including Gu Nian!

459
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Just admit it.

460
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,400
You love me. Since college,

461
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,990
you've loved me.

462
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,920
Even now, you still can't move on!

463
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,270
Your eyes don't lie.

464
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,230
I don't love you.

465
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,190
I'm just afraid Gu Nian will get hurt.

466
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,090
Yes.

467
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,070
I didn't tell you right away

468
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,190
about my relationship with Gu Nian,

469
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,040
and it made you uncomfortable.

470
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,670
But even so,

471
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,230
what difference would it make if I had told you?

472
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
If I hadn't proposed to Gu Nian,

473
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,160
would you marry me?

474
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,270
Could you give up your ambitions,

475
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,310
abandon all the resources

476
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,680
and interests floating around,

477
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,590
and marry me?

478
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,630
We're the same kind of people.

479
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,560
We both have no family background,

480
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,910
no resources,

481
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,880
and no connections.

482
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,030
We have to start from scratch,

483
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:03,920
suffering together

484
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,750
and struggling together.

485
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,390
No matter what the future holds,

486
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,630
let's weather the storms together,

487
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,010
sharing both honor and disgrace.

488
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,750
Are you willing?

489
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,640
I'll go get you a glass of water.

490
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,770
Then why did you suddenly propose to her?

491
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,680
Do you remember that investor

492
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,030
you introduced me to before?

493
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,030
We got along really well,

494
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,280
and he also recognized my talents and abilities.

495
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,260
But in the end,

496
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,990
he still had to consider

497
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,070
whether I had financial power and connections.

498
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,220
He said he would invest in me,

499
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,040
but there was a condition.

500
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,740
The condition is that I need to come up with these two million yuan first!

501
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,000
If I couldn't come up with the two million yuan,

502
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,470
then I'd have to work for him.

503
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,590
What is this, if not humiliation?

504
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,410
This society,

505
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,790
this society won't give people like us

506
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,240
a chance to start from scratch!

507
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,540
Tu.

508
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,340
We are the same kind of people.

509
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,190
For us, love

510
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,150
is an unaffordable luxury.

511
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,350
We use all our strength—

512
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,280
isn't it all just to

513
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,070
avoid being trampled on by others?

514
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,440
If you're going to deceive Gu Nian,

515
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,530
then do so for a lifetime.

516
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,720
It's boiling.

517
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,510
You two have teamed up, haven't you?

518
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,640
You're back.

519
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,980
You must be hungry. I'll go make you something to eat.

520
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,430
Stop pretending!

521
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,480
I'm not buying that act!

522
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,120
Nian, how can you talk to Su like that?

523
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,440
At least I don't

524
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,910
act one way in front of others and another way behind their backs.

525
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,110
How can you talk to our mom like that?

526
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,230
"Our"?

527
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,420
What do you mean by "our"?

528
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,480
That's my mom!

529
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,070
Why are you butting in when I'm talking to my mom?

530
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,460
Why are you so snappy as soon as you get back?

531
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,600
Did Feng say something to you?

532
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,500
Yes.

533
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,060
He said you're a really good person,

534
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,570
and what you said is really right.

535
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,180
He said that he'd listen to your teachings.

536
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,250
He also said we shouldn't see each other anymore,

537
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,970
and he'd come crawling back after making enough money

538
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,720
and grovel at your feet

539
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,670
to ask for your approval!

540
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,830
That's not what I meant at all.

541
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,270
I told him

542
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,700
that at his age,

543
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,680
he should focus on his career

544
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,670
instead of marriage!

545
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,850
Am I wrong?

546
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,620
Isn't it for your own good?

547
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,390
If it's for my own good, why couldn't you be upfront about it?

548
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,910
Why do you have to go behind my back to put him down?

549
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,560
What do you mean I went behind your back?

550
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,630
Could I have said more to him while you were around?

551
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,900
Could I have gotten to know him better?

552
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,430
Now you understand everything crystal clear.

553
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,630
Isn't it just that you dislike his humble background

554
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,510
and poor financial situation?

555
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,490
If that's the case,

556
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,530
why bother with that insincere meeting?

557
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,030
It doesn't matter whether you meet or not.

558
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,430
You've already made up your mind about him.

559
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,630
Gu Nian, it's one thing if you don't believe me,

560
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,590
but do you not even believe Godmother?

561
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,680
Is she that kind of person?

562
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,830
Why should I trust you?

563
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,220
Just because you come from somewhere else,

564
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,450
you think your experiences give you the right

565
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,160
to tell me what's right and wrong?

566
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,150
I don't agree.

567
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,310
I'm not a robot.

568
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,630
I want to experience things for myself!

569
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,680
I have the ability to judge!

570
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,600
Do you have any judgment left at all?

571
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,740
A few words from Feng Huanan

572
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,770
and you jump to conclusions.

573
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,630
But when your own mother talks to you,

574
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,840
you won't even listen to a single word.

575
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,990
She's the person who loves you the most in this world.

576
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,620
Anyone could hurt you, but she never would.

577
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,400
She's trying to protect you from making mistakes; don't you understand?

578
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,570
Protect me from making mistakes?

579
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,500
I'm more like that mistake, right?

580
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,870
Fine.

581
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,730
What's the point of me living then?

582
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,540
Why don't you just freeze me

583
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,100
and take me out in fifty years to live out the golden years?

584
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,270
Live out the golden years.

585
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,450
Gu Nian. Gu Nian!

586
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,960
She actually accused me of being insincere.

587
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,370
Godmother, don't take it to heart.

588
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,830
This girl just speaks without thinking.

589
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,740
Calm down.

590
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,950
Here.

591
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,640
Have some tea.

592
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,080
Su,

593
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,250
do you think I'm being too controlling?

594
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,570
Of course not.

595
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,560
Even if you hadn't intervened,

596
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,460
I would have.

597
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,100
What's really going on

598
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,750
between you and Nian?

599
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,470
She said you came from somewhere else.

600
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,650
What does that mean?

601
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,200
She probably means my hometown.

602
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,630
I'm not a local.

603
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,550
Gu.

604
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,790
Maybe in a few days,

605
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,110
I'll come to see you.

606
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,040
I can't handle

607
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,830
Nian anymore.

608
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,940
In a few days, it will be the anniversary of Dad's death.

609
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,590
Boss,

610
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,910
for this afternoon's test,

611
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,670
just stick to what we practiced.

612
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,230
You'll do fine, okay?

613
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,530
I have confidence in you.

614
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,270
Alright, I'll review it again in a bit.

615
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,680
Don't wait to review it later.

616
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Go through it quickly one more time now, okay?

617
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,560
Strike while the iron is hot.

618
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,310
We don't have much time left.

619
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,380
It starts at 2 PM.

620
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,600
Look at what time it is now.

621
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,700
Oh, right,

622
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,310
how's Gu Nian's mood today?

623
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,010
She took the day off.

624
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,080
Didn't she tell you?

625
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,040
She took the day off? Who did she ask for leave from?

626
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,900
Why didn't I know about this?

627
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,150
Don't worry about her now.

628
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,600
All your attention

629
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,150
should be focused on this matter, okay?

630
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,350
Today is the first formal test

631
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,320
of our Revisit Project.

632
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,710
All our efforts lately

633
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,080
depend on your performance now.

634
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,750
This afternoon, when Mr. Liu, Mr. Li, or anyone else

635
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,170
asks you questions, just look at them,

636
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,690
smile, keep your head up, and your chest out,

637
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,250
full of confidence, okay?

638
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,380
Okay, okay, I got it.

639
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,940
Could it be that she remembers

640
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,170
today is Dad's death anniversary, and that's why she took leave?

641
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,540
You stay with Mom today.

642
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,760
Leave the testing to Jiang and me.

643
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,100
Hello, Godmother,

644
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,330
is Gu Nian home?

645
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,590
I need to talk to her.

646
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,320
She's not at home.

647
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,030
Didn't she go to work?

648
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,390
Oh, look at me.

649
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,070
I've been so busy that I forgot.

650
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,950
I forgot that I'd asked her

651
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,400
to go to the client to review some materials.

652
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,880
Alright, that's it for now. I'll hang up.

653
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,600
Gu Nian, where on earth have you gone?

654
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,830
How could you forget such an important thing?

655
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,830
Boss, is everything okay with Gu Nian?

656
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,970
Jiang,

657
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,530
give me your motorcycle keys.

658
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,630
Where are you going?

659
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,440
Give it to me.

660
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:00,990
Wait...

661
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,670
I need to go out for a bit.

662
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,080
I'll be back soon.

663
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,490
Well, then... review the materials along the way!

664
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,890
I really want to slap you.

665
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,770
Come on, do it.

666
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,350
Slap me.
