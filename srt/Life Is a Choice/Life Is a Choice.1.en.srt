[Spring, 2025]

5
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,160
Mommy, where did I come from?

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,630
Up in the sky, sweetie,

7
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,930
there's a huge chocolate factory,

8
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,080
and every baby inside

9
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,190
is made of chocolate.

10
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,130
Mommy looked at all the chocolate babies

11
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,350
and saw you.

12
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,670
I thought, "How could this one be so adorable!"

13
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,790
So, I chose you to be my baby.

14
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,330
Doudou.

15
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,580
You must grow up safe and sound.

16
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,050
Mommy will always be with you, okay?

17
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,670
Eat up.

18
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,550
Doudou!

19
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,710
Please sign this critical condition notification form first.

20
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,750
Among all pediatric tumors,

21
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,190
neuroblastoma is the type

22
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,870
with the poorest treatment outcomes.

23
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,720
Her condition could deteriorate at any moment.

24
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,790
And Doudou has a highly allergic constitution,

25
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,350
so many medications can't be used.

26
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,230
While ensuring her safe medication use,

27
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,270
we have done our best

28
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,790
to prolong her life.

29
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,870
I saw other parents in the patient support group

30
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,430
talking about a special drug.

31
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,829
Can Doudou switch to that medicine?

32
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,310
There's no such thing as a special drug.

33
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,430
What you're referring to

34
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,030
is just a new imported medication.

35
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,590
Switching to a new drug might be effective, but only

36
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,470
if the patient has already developed resistance to the current treatments.

37
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,350
So, in your opinion, given Doudou's current condition,

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,670
could she switch to this new drug?

39
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,510
Yes, she can.

40
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,870
However, this medication is not covered by insurance.

41
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,510
It's not cheap.

42
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,950
Doudou's mom,

43
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,110
we are aware of

44
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,190
your financial situation.

45
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,750
The burden would be too heavy.

46
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,510
So I hope you'll consider this decision carefully.

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,770
[Gu Nian: Doudou is in critical condition! Come quickly! Need to consider a new treatment plan]

48
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,030
So you've decided to try the new drug,

49
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,990
right?

50
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,030
Don't you want to?

51
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,750
I've thought a lot on my way here.

52
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,659
I want Doudou to live too.

53
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,950
But if...

54
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,630
I mean, if...

55
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,190
If the doctor says

56
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,790
this is the final countdown of Doudou's life...

57
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,540
What do you mean by that?

58
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,670
You don't want to save Doudou anymore, is that it?

59
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,150
Did I say that I don't want to save her?

60
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,130
I'm just trying to reason with you.

61
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,670
I think you should make

62
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,790
a more rational decision!

63
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,390
Gu Nian, we're divorced.

64
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,940
You're Doudou's mother.

65
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,060
But what about me?

66
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,950
I'm Doudou's father too.

67
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,910
So I can understand how you feel.

68
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,990
I also hope that Doudou can survive!

69
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,310
But have you thought about it?

70
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,990
You have no income.

71
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,550
You have no source of income now.

72
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,790
You had none before the divorce,

73
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,430
and you still have none after it!

74
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,390
All these years,

75
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,390
I've been shouldering the cost

76
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,150
of Doudou's medical bills alone.

77
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,230
Now, I really...

78
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,460
You have a new family now.

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,340
So you can just abandon Doudou?

80
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,730
Is that how it is?

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,470
This is not a small amount of money,

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,110
Gu Nian.

83
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,590
When we divorced, didn't we already

84
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,870
divide our assets clearly?

85
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,909
Now, my money...

86
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,159
my money isn't just mine alone!

87
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,020
Do you understand?

88
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,950
This isn't as simple as you think!

89
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,810
Who made this situation complicated?

90
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,909
Was it me?

91
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,950
Feng Huanan,

92
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,990
it's you!

93
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,350
You owe this to our daughter.

94
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,780
You should pay her back!

95
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,070
Doctor!

96
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,500
Doctor, please save my daughter!

97
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,360
Doctor, please save my daughter!

98
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,030
You've built your business step by step to where it is today,

99
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,590
using the money my parents left me.

100
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,150
I want to get my own money back.

101
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,110
There's no problem with that, right?

102
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,790
Yes, when we got divorced,

103
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,150
you said the money was tied up in the company

104
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,950
and that you'd find a way to give it to me later.

105
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,270
I never pressured you about it, did I?

106
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,280
Because I believed that no matter how you treated me,

107
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,280
you would always treat Doudou 100% well.

108
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,170
But now I realize...

109
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,580
you don't.

110
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,550
I don't want to argue back and forth anymore.

111
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,260
I just want my money back.

112
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,020
I want to give Doudou a chance to survive.

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,000
Do I not want to give Doudou a chance to survive?

114
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,540
Gu Nian, let me tell you!

115
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,100
I don't have the extra resources

116
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,030
to handle any more of your demands right now!

117
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,210
Gu Nian,

118
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,580
you're already too deep in this quagmire.

119
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,590
Let yourself go,

120
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,220
okay?

121
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,540
Let our daughter go too, okay?

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,310
Life must go on after all.

123
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,350
Feng Huanan,

124
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,250
you really are, time and time again,

125
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,120
showing me...

126
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,480
how despicable you are.

127
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,350
You think these words come

128
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,040
so easily from my mouth, right?

129
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,280
Feng Huanan!

130
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,930
If even her parents have given up on her,

131
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,370
she really has no way to survive.

132
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,480
Doudou is my only family now.

133
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,030
I don't care,

134
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,090
I don't care whether Doudou can last more than a year,

135
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,010
half a year, or just ten days.

136
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,720
I just want her to live.

137
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,840
I really can't live without her.

138
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,159
I beg you.

139
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,320
I beg you to help me this time.

140
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,640
I... I beg you.

141
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,840
P-Please, please help me, will you?

142
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
What are you doing?

143
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,840
Get up quickly.

144
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,600
Get up.

145
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,620
Why are you here?

146
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I'd been waiting for you in the car for a long time,

147
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
but you didn't come back.

148
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,040
I was worried you two might have had some unpleasant conversation,

149
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,100
so I came.

150
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,290
No, nothing unpleasant.

151
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,900
Have a seat over there.

152
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,440
Doudou? Doudou, you're awake?

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,850
How do you feel?

154
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,120
Is there anywhere that still feels uncomfortable?

155
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,810
Mommy, I scared you again, didn't I?

156
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,260
Actually, I was just tricking you.

157
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,500
You little brat, always tricking me.

158
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,520
You really scared me.

159
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,160
You must be hungry, right?

160
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,570
Mommy bought wontons, porridge, and dumplings.

161
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,860
Which one would you like?

162
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,370
We haven't had any fruit today.

163
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,480
How about a small apple?

164
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,570
Mommy, I don't like eating fruit.

165
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,960
Mommy can cut the small apple into a little star.

166
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,600
Oh? Then I'll consider it.

167
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,210
When Mommy was little

168
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,670
and sick,

169
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,120
your grandma

170
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,370
used to cut apples for me like this too.

171
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,490
Grandma would say,

172
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,010
even the most ordinary apple,

173
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,360
deep inside,

174
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,570
is a shining little star.

175
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,670
Mommy, do you miss your mommy?

176
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Was that little apple you're wearing

177
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,130
a gift from your mommy?

178
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,010
Mommy needs to help you sit up first, okay?

179
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,690
How about this? After you eat the little star,

180
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,890
Mommy will tell you the story, okay?

181
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,430
What's wrong?

182
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,800
Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere again?

183
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,930
Mommy, I miss Daddy.

184
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,240
Then you need to get better quickly.

185
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,080
So, Daddy can take you out to play,

186
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,640
right?

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Today is my birthday.

188
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,400
Why didn't Daddy come to see me?

189
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,280
Does he not want me anymore?

190
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,970
How could that be?

191
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,160
You're Daddy's most adorable little princess.

192
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,480
How about we video call Daddy?

193
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,280
Daddy!

194
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,400
Daddy must be in a meeting.

195
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,010
He'll definitely call back later.

196
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,830
Let's eat the little apple first, okay?

197
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,170
Mommy,

198
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,170
I want to eat wontons.

199
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,400
Okay, I'll bring them for you.

200
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,340
Doudou?

201
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,780
Doudou?

202
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,330
Doctor!

203
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,800
Doctor!

204
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,490
Ma'am, please wait outside.

205
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,580
[Emergency Room]

206
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,030
Here's the form.

207
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,730
Doctor, how is my wife, Lyu Tu?

208
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,640
We're not sure about her condition right now.

209
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,290
Please wait.

210
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,070
Please make sure both my wife and our child are safe.

211
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:36,760
I beg you, doctor.

212
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,250
We'll do our best.

213
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,690
Please, make sure they're safe!

214
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,640
Please, I beg you.

215
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,360
Please.

216
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,210
Feng Huanan!

217
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,000
Why didn't you answer my calls?

218
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,840
Doudou is in the emergency room,

219
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,190
and you're here to have a baby?

220
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,860
When Doudou's life was hanging by a thread during immunotherapy,

221
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,040
it was when you and Lyu Tu

222
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,170
had this child, right?

223
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Tell me!

224
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,560
Gu Nian, can you calm down?

225
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,170
Gu Nian.

226
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes, it was that time.

227
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,750
I don't want to live in self-deception anymore.

228
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,230
Three years.

229
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,730
It's been three years! Doudou's cancer for these three years

230
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,560
has already worn down her body!

231
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,810
Do you understand?

232
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm not like you.

233
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm not as strong as you are.

234
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,790
I love Doudou.

235
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,730
I want to cherish her.

236
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,450
But at the same time, I also want to cherish

237
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,450
the child I'm having now.

238
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,690
What's wrong with that?

239
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,280
Don't you think... your child's life

240
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,330
was exchanged for Doudou's?

241
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,360
This is a hospital. Please remain quiet!

242
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,560
Lyu Tu's family members?

243
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,250
I, I am, I am.

244
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,930
The patient is experiencing uterine bleeding.

245
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,880
The situation is very serious.

246
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,040
The fetal heartbeat is also dropping.

247
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,890
If this continues,

248
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,680
it may lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus.

249
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,440
We need to perform a C-section immediately.

250
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,850
If you agree, please sign quickly.

251
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,650
What are you waiting for?

252
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,080
The baby can't wait! Hurry up!

253
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,540
What am I doing?

254
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,610
Thank you, Gu Nian.

255
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,520
I know.

256
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,020
You've always been so kind.

257
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:46,930
That's why...

258
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,420
you managed to deceive me for seven whole years.

259
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,140
No wonder you don't want to save Doudou.

260
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,140
It's because you're having another child.

261
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,330
That's also why you forced me

262
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,440
to divorce back then, right?

263
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,930
You two... you've really kept it from me so well.

264
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,140
Gu Nian, I know you're feeling awful.

265
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
After all, we were such close friends.

266
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,570
If it weren't absolutely necessary,

267
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,170
I wouldn't want to appear in front of you either.

268
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,930
But Huanan, he

269
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,810
really isn't that heartless.

270
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,740
He has really tried his best.

271
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,520
This is the last gesture from Huanan and me.

272
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,940
Take good care of yourself.

273
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,280
Take this.

274
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,940
We're the same.

275
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,540
It's all for the children.

276
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,210
Let's go. It's time for our prenatal check-up.

277
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,010
How ironic!

278
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,330
For the children.

279
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,720
Lyu Tu's family member?

280
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm here. I'm here, doctor.

281
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
Both the mother and girl are safe.

282
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,530
Thank you, thank you, doctor.

283
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,360
It's my duty.

284
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
Please come with me to complete the paperwork.

285
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,110
Thank you.

286
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,270
-Let's go through the procedures.
-Thank you.

287
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,079
Feng Yu's family member?

288
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,640
Doctor, how is Doudou?

289
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,670
I'm sorry. We did our best.

290
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,300
Goodbye, Mommy.

291
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,360
We were best friends.

292
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,610
Yet you became the third party in my marriage!

293
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,520
What are you doing?

294
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,460
When I was with Feng Huanan,

295
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,150
you weren't even in the picture.

296
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,180
You call me the third party?

297
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,050
You're the real intruder!

298
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,960
You know that?

299
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,480
Goodbye, Mommy.

300
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,040
Are you sure

301
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,840
you want to end this life

302
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,360
with regret, resentment, and anger?

303
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,610
You've completely squandered the good hand

304
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,680
your parents dealt you.

305
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,680
How do you plan to face them?

306
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,010
If you were given a chance to start your life over again,

307
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,300
to live selfishly just once,

308
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,160
would you go back to your previous life path?

309
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,820
Do you regret marrying Feng Huanan?

310
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,240
Would you go back?

311
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,240
Do you hate him?

312
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,320
Congratulations.

313
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,370
Your mother, before your wedding,

314
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,320
purchased for you

315
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,880
a high-end customized insurance policy,

316
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,830
and it's about to take effect.

317
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,350
You can travel back to any time,

318
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,340
any place,

319
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,020
and even inhabit any person's body.

320
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,420
Simply put, your main account is ruined,

321
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,330
and now you get a chance to start over with an alt account.

322
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,590
[Do you want to go back to the past?]

323
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,000
Life is a choice.

324
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,920
Make your choice.

325
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,210
You don't have much time left.

326
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,050
You'd better choose wisely.

327
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,770
If you choose wrong,

328
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,730
many, many accidents will happen.

329
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,570
Of course, it has nothing to do with us.

330
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,690
[No]

331
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,040
Only ask about the past,

332
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,610
not the future.

333
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,560
Gu Nian,

334
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,130
have a pleasant journey.

335
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:55,520
[7 years ago, 2018]

336
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,240
This back view looks so familiar.

337
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,960
This place looks so familiar.

338
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,590
Is this the theater from college?

339
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,010
2018?

340
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,080
Is this a rehearsal?

341
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,700
Isn't this Jiang Kele?

342
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,810
Lights on! Now!

343
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,630
Darling!

344
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,520
I love you.

345
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,110
From the first time I saw you,

346
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,880
I fell deeply in love with you.

347
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,660
I don't want to miss out on your future.

348
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,630
Will you marry me?

349
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,600
I want to have a beautiful tomorrow with you

350
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,290
and a bright... future!

351
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,540
Feng Huanan!

352
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,870
Why has my voice become like this?

353
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,650
You darn scumbag!

354
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,370
What...

355
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,640
Did the script change while I was absent?

356
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,300
No. Let me take a look.

357
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,870
You darn scumbag!

358
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,680
Don't say yes!

359
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,970
He's just a scumbag!

360
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,240
Are you crazy?

361
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,220
Feng Huanan!

362
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,730
You lied to me for seven whole years!

363
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,720
You had another child,

364
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,000
so you abandoned me and Doudou.

365
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,410
You took what my parents gave to me for yourself!

366
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,800
You've ruined my life!

367
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,960
That attacker!

368
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,910
That is my own voice.

369
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,700
I've gone back to the campus in 2018.

370
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,240
I've met my old classmates

371
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,090
and Feng Huanan, the scumbag.

372
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,780
I've met the version of myself from seven years ago.

373
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,600
Then who am I?

374
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,090
And I even got hit on the head by my own past self.

375
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,900
Everything is happening so suddenly.

376
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,180
It's not just them who are confused,

377
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,650
but I am too.

378
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,310
Hasn't anyone ever told you this in your life?

379
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,370
You shouldn't hit people in the face!

380
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,850
Who are you?

381
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,850
What are you doing?

382
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,600
Who are you?

383
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,330
I'm warning you, keep your hands to yourself.

384
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,480
It's me. I'm Gao Ren.

385
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,210
Gao Ren?

386
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,080
Where... where am I?

387
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,840
You're in the hospital.

388
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,410
What happened to me?

389
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,630
You got into a fight. Don't you remember?

390
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,520
Alright.

391
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,860
Have some water. Collect your thoughts.

392
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,220
What water?

393
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,550
Bathroom, where's the bathroom?

394
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,400
I'm about to burst.

395
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,100
Go out, turn left, and keep walking. You'll get there.

396
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,570
You...

397
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,680
Forget it. I'll go with you.

398
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,320
Why would a grown man like you come with me?

399
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,590
What... What grown man?

400
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,770
Gao Ge, on the left, right?

401
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,940
Gao Ge?

402
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,330
What Gao Ge?

403
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,500
My name is Gao Ren!

404
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,850
What's going on?

405
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,110
What's happening?

406
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,410
Ouch.

407
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,040
Gu Nian.

408
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,420
Gu Nian!

409
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,640
Gu Nian!

410
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,290
G-Gu Nian!

411
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,440
Gu Nian!

412
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,890
Gu Nian!

413
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,120
Gu Nian!

414
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,970
Gu Nian!

415
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,250
Nian?

416
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,250
Nian, how are you?

417
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,400
Let me see. Come on, is it serious?

418
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,920
Lin Xi, I called you over.

419
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,090
Your supervisor won't scold you, will they?

420
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,540
It's fine. I'll head right back to the outpatient clinic after.

421
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,320
Come on, let me take a look.

422
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,570
I feel like it's broken.

423
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,150
Broken?

424
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,720
Can you move your hand?

425
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,700
I think I can move it.

426
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,690
How about this? Does it hurt?

427
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,490
It hurts a little bit.

428
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,380
How about this? Is it fine?

429
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,710
It seems fine.

430
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,210
You're acting, aren't you?

431
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,470
It's not broken. It's fine. It's just a minor sprain.

432
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,430
Just rest it for a while.

433
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,930
As long as it's nothing serious.

434
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,030
It scared me to death.

435
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,380
I heard from the nurse that two men were fighting over you.

436
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,340
Quite a scene.

437
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,720
Don't tease me.

438
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,130
You know what?

439
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,640
Today was our campus heartthrob's first time

440
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,800
getting back into acting after the breakup.

441
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,490
He was rehearsing a confession scene,

442
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,400
super romantic.

443
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,210
But then some lunatic came out of nowhere.

444
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
He ruined everything.

445
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,310
You mean that president of your drama club?

446
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,320
Didn't you tell me

447
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,810
he was dating a senior?

448
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,860
Something about being the golden couple, a legendary romance?

449
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,960
I heard that the senior was going abroad,

450
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,120
so they broke up.

451
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,280
It's quite a shame.

452
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,550
He hasn't gotten involved with some gang, has he?

453
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,610
Didn't you tell me

454
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,880
his family isn't quite well-off?

455
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,660
Maybe he took out a high-interest loan or something.

456
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,420
How could that be?

457
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,280
He doesn't even know that guy.

458
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,090
Talking about it just makes me more upset.

459
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,870
It's that guy.

460
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,960
Why is he here?

461
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,990
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

462
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,650
Be careful.

463
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,120
Gu Nian!

464
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,520
Gu Nian!

465
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,360
Gu Nian!

466
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,760
Sir...

467
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,360
Listen to me!

468
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,960
You must not go to the cafeteria today!

469
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,140
You must stay away from Feng Huanan

470
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,490
and live for yourself just once, Gu Nian!

471
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,160
Calm down,

472
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,790
sir!

473
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,620
This is a hospital!

474
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,020
Lin Xi?

475
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,320
Lin Xi!

476
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,130
You... you need to calm down again!

477
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,600
Come on, follow me.

478
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,340
Come on, take a deep breath.

479
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,250
Now, inhale.

480
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,130
Exhale. Look at me. Focus a bit more.

481
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:30,930
Now, inhale.

482
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,010
Exhale, inhale,

483
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:32,570
and exhale. Good.

484
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,570
Come on, let me check your eyes.

485
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,370
Good.

486
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,480
You seem fine.

487
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,080
Calm down.

488
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,940
Lin Xi, I'm Gu Nian.

489
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,440
I know I don't look like myself now,

490
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,400
but it's me on the inside anyway.

491
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,130
I was in the hospital.

492
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:42,920
Something happened to me.

493
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,240
Then, I closed my eyes, and when I opened them,

494
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,410
the moment I opened them, I was here.

495
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,210
I don't know what happened either.

496
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,210
I really am Gu Nian,

497
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,530
Xi! You have to believe me!

498
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,010
I understand now.

499
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,320
You closed your eyes and opened them,

500
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,100
and you're Gu Nian now.

501
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,350
Right? I get it.

502
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,100
[Su Yin; Male]

503
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,730
Su Yin.

504
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,930
I really am Gu Nian.

505
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,820
I'm Gu Nian from the future.

506
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,720
That's right. You closed your eyes and opened them,

507
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,210
and now you're here from the future.

508
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,700
I understand. No problem.

509
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,230
Xi.

510
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:13,950
Calm down.

511
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,470
Please contact the psychiatry department for me.

512
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:17,800
Okay.

513
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,130
Xi.

514
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,160
I understand. I understand.

515
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,490
Please contact the security department as well.

516
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,040
Okay.

517
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,110
Sir, do you need help?

518
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,650
Okay.

519
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,940
Let me help you. Let me help you.

520
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,430
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

521
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,460
Xi, I really...

522
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,510
I really am Gu Nian.

523
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,010
I, I need to find Gu Nian.

524
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,680
I get you.

525
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
I have to let her marry someone else

526
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,400
so that she can live a different life.

527
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,560
You're Gu Nian. Who else would you look for, right?

528
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,540
I...

529
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,520
Stop spinning around.

530
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,720
You're making me dizzy with all your spinning.

531
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,560
Yes, right here.

532
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,400
No, why are you here...

533
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,200
The psychiatrist said you're fine now.

534
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,820
Turn right when you exit, and take the elevator directly to...

535
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,770
I sent Gao Ren.

536
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,250
That chubby guy who took care of me.

537
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,230
But I don't know him either.

538
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,100
You don't even know the person taking care of you?

539
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,210
Then who do you know?

540
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,210
I know you, Lin Xi...

541
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:18,570
Hold on!

542
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,280
Take a step back.

543
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,190
You can speak now.

544
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,260
Lin Xi, it's me, Gu Nian!

545
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,530
President, y-your face...

546
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,760
It's nothing, not even worth mentioning!

547
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,740
Gu Nian?

548
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,380
Gu Nian!

549
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,170
Gu Nian!
