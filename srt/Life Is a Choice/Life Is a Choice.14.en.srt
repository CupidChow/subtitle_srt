Sir, two bowls of wontons, please.

Virtual reality helping you make up for life's regrets?

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,270
This idea

14
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,800
is indeed more empathetic than simply revisiting memories

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,590
or simulating the future.

16
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,490
Where did you get the inspiration?

17
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,669
I talked to Mom about this plan.

18
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,070
Mom said if she were the user,

19
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,640
she wouldn't want to change the past—

20
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,270
she'd just want to have one more meal with Dad.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
A meal?

22
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,390
Have you forgotten? That day I went to my tutoring class,

23
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,270
and Dad and Mom planned to have a meal together,

24
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,870
just the two of them.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
But then Dad had to leave for a last-minute business trip.

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,800
So that meal ended up being Mom's regret.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
Why did Mom never tell me about this?

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,380
Well, it's not too late to know now, is it?

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,340
Anyway, I got this inspiration from Mom and Dad.

30
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,060
So now I know how to approach Mr. Li.

31
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:47,910

Thank you.

Just eat mine.

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,710

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,880
It's really delicious.

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,950
I just love this taste.

Not used to it, are you?

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,230
This way of eating is not something most people can handle.

57
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,710
So, what's your purpose

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,160
in going through all this trouble

59
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,180

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,000
Well,

61
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,390
Mr. Li, we...

62
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,010
really did come here to wait for you.

63
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,110
You must be familiar with this place.

64
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,230
We also know that this place

65
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,590
holds special meaning for you.

66
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,190
Here's the thing:

67
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,430
we have a

68
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,230
virtual reality software

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,140
that offers an immersive experience,

70
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,990
giving people the chance to go back to the past

71
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,820
and make up for regrets.

72
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,830
Well, you look like an honest person.

73
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,100
Actually,

74
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,630
this way of eating wontons is something I developed

75
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,350
when I was staying at the hospital every day,

76
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,390
accompanying my daughter for treatment and staying up late.

77
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,960
It was a way to keep myself energized.

78
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,430
Later, after my daughter passed away,

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,410
this habit stayed with me.

80
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,870
It looks like you've really done your research on me.

81
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,390
We indeed thought of many ways

82
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,350
to impress you,

83
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,220
but we were also afraid you might find it too abrupt.

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,540
At the same time, we wanted to show you

85
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,970
the original intention behind creating this software.

86
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,790
What we really want is to give more people a chance

87
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,660
to go back to the past and make up for regrets.

88
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,900
Regrets are called regrets

89
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,280
because they can't be made up.

90
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,250
Even if you use virtual technology to go back to the past,

91
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,159
it's just self-comforting.

92
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,470
Excuse me, your wontons are here.

93
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,140
Okay.

94
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,430
Mr. Li, you're right.

95
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,080
Regrets are in the hearts of those who are still alive.

96
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,670
The people who have passed are gone.

97
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,530
But the reason we want to make up for regrets

98
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,750
is that we hope the living can find peace

99
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,600
and move forward better.

100
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,600
Because so many regrets

101
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,300
come from not having a proper goodbye,

102
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,640
and so many goodbyes

103
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,370
come suddenly and unexpectedly.

104
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,800
You really understand human nature.

105
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,670
Mr. Li,

106
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,680
I can actually understand your habit

107
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,100
very well.

108
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,260
My father also passed away very suddenly.

109
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,030
So I know

110
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,650
this is a form of longing,

111
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,570
and it's about not being ready to let go yet.

112
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,350
To be honest,

113
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,390
your idea is quite good.

114
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,570
However,

115
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,070
have you ever considered that

116
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
this could involve a lot of people's privacy?

117
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,720
For example,

118
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,300
if a customer

119
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,260
can't provide the data,

120
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,370
how will you be able to

121
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,110
quickly create this scenario?

122
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,550
If you collect the data on-site,

123
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,470
that would require a huge amount of computational processing.

124
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,150
Do you have that capability?

125
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,350

The reason we came to you

137

we've finally managed to get Mr. Li to our company to discuss the contract.

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,990
I'll...

153
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,790
Have a drink.

154
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,240
Yes, that's good.

155
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,790

158
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,630
Great!

159
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,550
The last time we were this excited

160
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,110
was when we were raising money

161
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,390
for Grandma He.

162
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,980
Yes.

163
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,650
Exactly.

164
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,630
Gao Ren, don't take it to heart.

165
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,350
Gu Nian's just happy.

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,750
I'm okay.

167
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,630
To be honest,

168
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,890
if our product is successfully developed,

169
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,480
the first person I'd want to give it to would be Grandma He.

170
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,390
She told me back then

171
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,590
that her son only comes to her for money

172
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,390
and doesn't care about her otherwise.

173
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,440
Her husband passed away early, and her health wasn't great either.

174
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,470
If she were to leave this world with regrets,

175
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,480
that would be really sad, right?

176
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,950
When our project really succeeds,

177
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm going to get myself a cat.

178
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,910
Can't you do that now?

179
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,070
I can't. My whole family is allergic to cats.

180
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,270
How can I keep one?

181
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,150
That's pretty unlucky.

182
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,370
Jiang,

183
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,430
I know what your regret is.

184
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,540
Come on, let's have a toast.

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,220
Well...

189
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,150
Shut up.

190
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,220
Tell us, tell us, tell us.

191
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,160
Shut up.

192
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,020
Just the other day, when we were playing basketball,

193
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,350
he lost to me.

194
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,200
He couldn't even beat me.

195
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,310
How could he not regret it?

196
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,650
It's really typical of Jiang.

197
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,990
But the fact that we can celebrate this time

198
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,550
is all thanks to Mom.

199
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,150
It's all thanks to your mom.

200
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,470
Of course.

201
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,790
You know what?

202
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,470
My mom even said she wants to meet you.

203
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,990
You didn't agree, did you?

204
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,910
Of course I refused.

205
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,870
That's my mom.

206
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,180
I'm so scared.

207
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,820
Come on, cheers.

208
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,780
Come on, come on.

209
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,590
Wait, wait.

210
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,370
It's Mr. Sun from Lipu Technology.

211
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,750
Hello, Mr. Sun.

212
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,660
Okay.

213
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,870
I got it.

214
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,850
Mr. Sun said...

215
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,120
Mr. Li has decided.

216
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,630
He said...

217
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,880
"Give them the green light all the way!"

218
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,570
Come on!

219
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,200
Next time,

220
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,600
can you speak without pausing for so long?

221
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,760
Come on, let's celebrate.

222
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,810
Oh, right,

223
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,820
you guys keep eating.

224
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,730
I'm leaving.

225
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,480
What are you going to do?

226
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,830
Prepare the plan.

227
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,680
Besides, do the rising stars in the workplace even deserve a meal?

228
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,590
Bye,

229
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,510
my colleagues.

230
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,510
Come on, come on.

231
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,750
Gu Nian, settle the bill later.

232
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,330
You're so funny.

233
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,230
Come on, come on.

234
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,390
Bai Guo, with your qualifications, you wouldn't have stayed.

235
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,720
With so little experience, you were actually assigned to a project.

236
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,920
Do you know how jealous everyone is of you?

237
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,460
I've done a lot for this.

238
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,530
How are you going to thank me?

239
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,460
Mr. Ye, I know you've been good to me.

240
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,970
I'll work hard.

241
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,380
Work is one thing.

242
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,670
You're my secretary.

243
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,310
You shouldn't only focus on work.

244
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,550
You need to know

245
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,390
how to take care of your boss.

246
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,620
Mr. Ye.

247
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,140
Mr. Ye!

248
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,420
Mr. Ye!

249
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,940
Well...

250
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,650
If you don't leave now, you'll miss your late flight.

251
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

252
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,510
I was in a hurry to remind you to catch your flight.

253
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,770
Gu Nian, you're still in your probation period,

254
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,580
and you've already learned to be jealous?

255
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,670
Being jealous?

256
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,890
Are you alright?

257
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,780
Gu Nian. Gu Nian, why did you leave so fast?

258
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,340
You're not answering my calls.

259
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,350
Mr. Ye, we bought you some late-night snacks.

260
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,140
Is there anything else?

261
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,820
No.

262
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,890
You can go now.

263
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,010
Mr. Ye,

264
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
aren't you catching a late flight today?

265
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,800
You're still at the company and haven't eaten yet.

266
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,580
I got you some wild vegetable buns,

267
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,530
freshly made. Please have a try.

268
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,810
Let me tell you,

269
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
although wild vegetables

270
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,910
taste better than those from greenhouses,

271
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,750
you can only eat them occasionally.

272
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,260
If you eat too much, they're hard to digest.

273
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,970
And this kind of thing is fine only occasionally—

274
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,850
just for a change.

275
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,350
If you eat too much, you'll feel uncomfortable.

276
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,140
There's quite a bit of lard in these.

277
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,540
Otherwise, they might irritate your throat.

278
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,870
You don't work hard during the day,

279
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,750
but you're quite diligent at night.

280
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,100
Mr. Ye, are you not eating the buns?

281
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,220
Just have a couple of bites.

282
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,490
Keep them for yourself.

283
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,000
That scumbag.

284
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,780
Not only does he treat you like an assistant,

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
but he's also so despicable.

286
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,410
Could you please

287
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,760
keep what happened today a secret?

288
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,010
Mentor, tell me the truth.

289
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,230
How long has this been going on?

290
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,130
I don't want to talk about it.

291
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,670
Please don't ask me anymore.

292
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,900
I just want to keep this to myself.

293
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,680
You can't think like that.

294
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,470
The more you endure in silence,

295
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,130
the worse he will get.

296
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,180
This is outright workplace bullying.

297
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,480
You can totally speak up

298
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,150
or even quit.

299
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,430
I didn't quit

300
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,460
because I've already tried.

301
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,190
After that, he would just keep harassing me

302
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,970
and increasingly threaten me.

303
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,310
And even if I find another job,

304
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,830
I'd still need a resume, right?

305
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,380
What should I put on it?

306
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,180
Making coffee?

307
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,900
Or being humiliated?

308
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,380
Mentor, don't be so self-deprecating.

309
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,290
If you need help,

310
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,730
you have us now, don't you?

311
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,780
That's right.

312
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,579
I just want to establish myself in this city

313
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,010
and then bring my parents here from our hometown.

314
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,190
I've worked hard...

315
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,410
I've worked so hard for over a year

316
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,670
just to become permanent.

317
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,700
It's not that I want to live in a lowly way.

318
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,030
It's just that I can't afford to be willful.

319
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,390
Today,

320
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,900
you made me feel warmth

321
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,600
in this city for the first time.

322
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,030
But I just want this

323
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,550
to quietly pass by.

324
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,790
I'm begging you.

325
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,780
Thank you so much.

326
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,970
I'll head back now.

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,030
Wait, Mentor...

328
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,710
You were quite bold today.

329
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,390
Weren't you afraid

330
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,920
he'd make things difficult for you?

331
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,190
Didn't you barge in there as well?

332
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,470
Weren't you afraid?

333
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,510
I was.

334
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,440
But for you,

335
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,810
I'm not afraid of anything.

336
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,030
Why did you...

337
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,220
come back...

338
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,250
today?

339
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,190
I was planning to come back to work overtime.

340
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,150
My boss asked me to give the statistics

341
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,870
to that pervert,

342
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,930
but I didn't expect to run into this.

343
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,900
You've got it tough too.

344
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,310
It's not easy for any of us, I guess.

345
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,950
I think

346
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,970
no matter how shabby life gets,

347
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,710
we still have to patch things together and keep going.

348
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,960
It's that pervert's bad luck that he didn't get to eat them.

349
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,430
Let's eat.

350
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,350
Let me tell you, I just bought

351
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,320
these buns

352
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,310
from a street vendor.

353
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,160
They're freshly made.

354
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,560
Try them. They're so good.

355
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,940
Thank you.

356
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,480
Come in.

357
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,550
Mr. Ye, you're looking for me?

358
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,020
This deck is really unlucky.

359
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,560
Come on.

360
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,750
What?

361
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,480
It's over. I lost.

362
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,890
Oh, right.

363
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,290
I'm looking for you.

364
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,110
On the night I left for my business trip,

365
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,750
the last person who came into my office

366
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,480
was you, right?

367
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,530
Yes, it was me.

368
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,710
It's okay.

369
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,620
I lost 20,000 yuan in my office,

370
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,110
and I can't find it anywhere.

371
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,210
Mr. Ye, could you please look again?

372
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,500
It definitely wasn't me.

373
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,780
No matter how poor I am, I wouldn't steal money.

374
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,140
If there were no evidence, I wouldn't have called you in.

375
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,340
You know you're still on probation.

376
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,070
The company absolutely doesn't tolerate

377
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,310
people who steal.

378
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,180
Mr. Ye,

379
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,670
I just treated you to some wild vegetable buns before.

380
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,010
I don't know anything else.

381
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,590
If you didn't like them,

382
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,150
just tell me.

383
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,310
I'll bring you a different flavor next time.

384
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,980
No need.

385
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,430
The wild vegetable filling is fine.

386
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,460
No need to change.

387
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,710
I'm thinking...

388
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,920
I'll be magnanimous for once.

389
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,760
I... I'll let you leave on your own,

390
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,130
letting you keep some dignity.

391
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,190
Otherwise, you know,

392
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,830
with my connections and resources right now,

393
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,750
I could make you disappear from this industry in a heartbeat.

394
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,960
I once had a mentor who told me

395
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
that men

396
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,990
are either cowardly or brave.

397
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,190
If you want to make money, you have to be shameless.

398
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,250
At first, I didn't understand.

399
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,710
I just felt wronged.

400
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,840
But now I understand.

401
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,640
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

402
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,510
Thank you for teaching me

403
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,000
the second invaluable lesson in life:

404
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,070
as long as a man stands at a high position,

405
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,940
anything he does is right.

406
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,430
You made a mistake with this card.

407
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,580
Bomb.

408
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,900
You just lost, didn't you?

409
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,870
Feng.

410
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,950
Actually, you're quite smart

411
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,590
and very hardworking.

412
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,510
You just need some experience.

413
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,750
You know,

414
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,310
sometimes not saying everything you see

415
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,980
is also a form of wisdom.

416
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,250
Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Ye.

417
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,280
And thank you for leaving me with some dignity.

418
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,760
We will definitely meet again.

419
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,310
Hello, who is this?

420
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,210
Yes.

421
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,350
I am indeed Feng Huanan.

422
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,170
You can't get in touch with Lyu Tu?

423
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,880
Her dad came to see a doctor?

424
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,780
Which hospital?

425
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,680
[Outpatient Building]

426
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,640
You're here.

427
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,740
Thank you.

428
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,230
Today I heard from my uncle

429
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,270
that he threw up,

430
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,800
but you didn't mind.

431
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,200
It's fine.

432
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,150
Why don't we go outside and talk?

433
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,820
Your dad just fell asleep.

434
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,370
I'm really sorry.

435
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,720
I left your phone number with my dad before.

436
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,110
I didn't expect he'd really bother you.

437
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,270
It's not a bother at all.

438
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,270
Luckily, you left my contact with him.

439
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,400
It was such an emergency,

440
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,690
and he couldn't reach you.

441
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,420
What if something really had happened to him?

442
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,270
What would happen to you?

443
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,850
What would happen to me?

444
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,140
Anyway,

445
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,940
thank you so much.

446
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,670
There's no need to thank me.

447
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,910
No matter what our relationship was in the past

448
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,490
or what it will be in the future,

449
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,680
when it comes to your family or your affairs,

450
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,990
it's my responsibility.

451
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,620
You should go back and get some rest now.

452
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm here now.

453
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,910
Come on, are you really so resistant

454
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,660
to others helping you?

455
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,730
Haven't I always been like this?

456
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,870
I'd rather owe people money

457
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,480
than owe them any favors.

458
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,480
Then why are you

459
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,690
so unwilling to owe me a favor?

460
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,560
Do you still love me?

461
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
What's the use of love?

462
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,380
Can love support a person's ambitions?

463
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,430
Have you realized your ambitions?

464
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,590
I just quit my job at the previous company.

465
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,610
Now I'm preparing

466
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,860
to pick up the entrepreneurial project

467
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,290
I abandoned earlier.

468
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,910
Starting a business requires financial support.

469
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,740
Otherwise,

470
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,040
it will likely remain just on paper.

471
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,390
Well, that depends on

472
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,970
whether you're willing to help me.

473
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,770
We haven't seen each other for so long.

474
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,850
Can we not talk about

475
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,430
such a formal topic right away?

476
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,520
Let's relax a bit.

477
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,120
I've just realized that

478
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,950
being strict with you was the right choice.

479
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,620
My efforts weren't wasted after all.

480
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,830
Coffee.

481
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,660
Thank you.

482
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,610
Since Feng Huanan was forced to leave by Mr. Ye,

483
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,950
I've been thinking about it.

484
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,010
I think you're right.

485
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,050
Bai Guo being safe

486
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,670
is the biggest change we can make.

487
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,830
Gu Nian,

488
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,830
it's not that we can't do more,

489
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,940
but the premise is that Bai Guo has to cooperate with us.

490
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,540
To be honest, changing you was already hard enough.

491
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,210
Wouldn't changing Bai Guo be even harder?

492
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,570
So...

493
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,260
What did you do?

494
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,460
That bastard Ye Weijian.

495
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,860
He put such a big obstacle in my way.

496
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,230
Do you think I'll let him get away with it?

497
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,930
Back then, I didn't have the chance

498
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,440
to talk directly to the higher-ups.

499
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,440
But now it's different.

500
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,790
Times have changed.

501
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,670
You didn't report this to the higher-ups, did you?

502
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,540
I promised my mentor I'd keep it absolutely confidential.

503
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,470
How could I?

504
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,970
I took the opportunity that Mr. Li is giving us funding

505
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,680
and proposed an internal audit to the company.

506
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,340
Coincidentally, Lipu Technology

507
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,730
has very high standards in this area.

508
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,640
And guess what happened?

509
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,790
What happened?

510
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,930
Ye Weijian is an embezzling bastard!

511
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,900
The company will definitely punish him severely.

512
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,160
He's done for, I'm telling you.

513
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,200
Director Su, you're quite something.

514
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,810
You accomplished something big quietly.

515
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,250
I'm impressed.

516
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,720
Well, if I tell you

517
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,830
that I applied for Bai Guo's promotion

518
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,220
because of her outstanding performance

519
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,440
during her project,

520
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,440
how will you compliment me?

521
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,780
Really?

522
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,400
I'll go find my mentor and tell her.

523
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,500
If she knows that

524
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,640
she can become stronger on her own,

525
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,270
her future will definitely be bright.

526
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,480
Praise me.

527
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,110
You know what?

528
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,040
You made me feel so confident

529
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
about my future self.

530
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,670
Do you think I could become President Gu someday?

531
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,180
I asked you to praise me.

532
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,290
But isn't praising me praising yourself?

533
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,550
Aren't we the same person?

534
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,080
You're right.

535
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,630
But you're still the most unlucky one.

536
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,220
Actually, I applied for both of you.

537
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,370
But you have to get through the internship period.

538
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,470
I don't mind.

539
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,500
[Announcement: Congratulations to the people on the promotion list for the new quarter]

540
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,060
The promotion list is out.

541
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,580
Look, she's on it. Great!

542
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,390
That's great.

543
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,850
Ye Weijian got fired!

544
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,670
Yes!

545
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,190
Let's go and enjoy the show.

546
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,630
Keep a low profile. We're both newcomers.

547
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,390
This matter

548
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,910
should have nothing to do with us.

549
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,060
Makes sense.

550
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,440
Gu Nian.

551
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,790
Bad news.

552
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,740
What's this Ye up to?

553
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,790
Trying to drag everyone down with him?

554
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,030
Oh no.

555
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,880
My mentor's promotion got canceled.

556
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,850
What's the date today?

557
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,980
May 28th.

558
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,880
28th...

559
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,980
28th! It's today! That's when Bai Guo's incident happened!

560
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,660
Bai Guo!

561
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,400
Don't come over!

562
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,860
Mentor, don't step back.

563
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,050
I'm doomed.

564
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,500
You're not! You're not doomed.

565
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,350
You still have us, don't you?

566
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,150
Bai Guo, life can start over.

567
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,430
You must not give up on yourself!

568
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,430
Look at me.

569
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,860
I came back from the future.

570
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,670
I swear,

571
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,650
I will help you return to your starting point.

572
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,720
Can you give me some time?

573
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,270
Just give me some time!

574
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,340
It's useless now.

575
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,910
No matter how clean a fruit is,

576
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,760
if it falls into a muddy ditch,

577
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,070
even after it's washed,

578
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,680
the stains will still seep in.

579
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,520
I've worked so hard. I've worked so hard!

580
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,030
But now, no one will believe that

581
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,370
this success was earned through my own efforts.

582
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,720
We saw it. We saw it.

583
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,590
Mentor, please calm down.

584
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,910
You still have us to help you.

585
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,110
Help me with what?

586
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,900
Help me make a fool of myself in the mud?

587
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,880
Bai Guo, you can't give up your life

588
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,740
for that scum.

589
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,580
It's not worth it.

590
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,810
You still have many chances to prove yourself.

591
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,830
It's over.

592
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,010
Ye Weijian has nothing left!

593
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,680
He won't let me go!

594
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,800
[Mom]

595
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,470
Sweetie,

596
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,940
your Aunt Wang said she saw some photos of you.

597
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,600
I asked her, but she wouldn't say anything.

598
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,550
What's going on?

599
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,720
Bai Guo.

600
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,460
Mentor.

601
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,540
Bai Guo.
