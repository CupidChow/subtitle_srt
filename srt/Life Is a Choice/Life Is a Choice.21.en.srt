What Doudou?

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,670
There's never been anyone there.

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,160
No, Yuan,

15
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,829
aren't you best friends with Doudou?

I'm Gu Nian.

I'm Doudou's mother.

28
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,740
Didn't we always chat here?

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,360
Doudou has always been here.

30
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,510
No, that bed has always been empty.

Could it be that since I now have money,

32
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,380
Doudou has been moved to a private room?

33
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,360
Doudou, my little Doudou.

34
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,470

Six years old.

Don't tell me you don't remember either.

She really isn't here.

be full of Doudou's photos?

Do you have a headache?

83
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,190
How about I take you for a check-up in a bit?

84
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,680
No, Lin Xi,

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,310
I'm not sick,

86

but I don't know

87
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,640
why suddenly, I can't remember many things.

88
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,280
I can't remember where Doudou is.

89
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,070
She's in critical condition now.

00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,840
She really needs me.

You're not Doudou.

Yes, of course. Whose else could she be?

125
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,190
Impossible.

126
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,570
Lyu Tu, Lyu Tu has just given birth.

and you're so nervous.

When Doudou was in the hospital bed

147
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,430
and in so much pain,

148
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,790

149

You don't deserve to be a father!

Gu Nian, are you okay?

152
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,080
We've been divorced for seven years.

153
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,230
Seven years!

154
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,840
We got divorced shortly after we got married.

155
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,830
How can we have a child?

156
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Seven years...

157
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,030
Have you lost your memories?

158
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
I admit it.

159
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,620
Yes, I did wrong you back then.

160
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,630
But whether you believe me or not,

161
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,390
I've felt guilty towards you all these years.

162
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,680
I've always wanted to make it up to you.

163
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,440
But...

164
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,840
Are you nuts?

165
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,190
Feng Huanan.

166
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,840
Let's get a divorce.

167
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,310
Doudou?

168
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,430
Doudou.

169
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,150
I will definitely find you.

170
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,200
Gu Nian.

171
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,470
Why did you come to the hospital alone?

172
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,990
Jiang.

173
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,230
Do you still remember this hospital?

174
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,920
You used to visit Doudou and me every week

175
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,320
and always brought lots of fruit.

176
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,200
You even paid 50,000 yuan for Doudou's medical expenses

177
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,310
and gave me a card with another 50,000 yuan on it...

178
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,950
Alright, slow down. I don't...

179
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,680
What 50,000 yuan?

180
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,440
Who is Doudou?

181
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Who's Doudou?

182
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,670
What are you talking about?

183
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,440
It's changed.

184
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Everything has changed.

185
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,990
Jiang,

186
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,710
do you believe in multiple dimensions?

187
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,190
If one small detail in one's life changes,

188
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,840
it can alter the entire outcome.

189
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,630
I went back seven years ago

190
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,070
and tried everything to change the outcome.

191
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,390
I thought it wouldn't change,

192
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,880
but it really did change.

193
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,280
Feng Huanan and I got divorced in August.

194
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,360
But I got pregnant with Doudou in October.

195
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,680
The divorce happened too early.

196
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,590
Not only am I no longer with Feng Huanan,

197
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,580
but more importantly, Doudou is also gone.

198
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,640
Hey, I don't understand what you're saying now.

199
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,840
What do you mean you divorced Feng Huanan?

200
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,120
Gu Nian, you... you've been under too much stress lately,

201
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,030
you know?

202
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,760
I've long told Su Yin about this.

203
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,550
Leave the company to us for now.

204
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,470
You don't need to be so busy.

205
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,350
I'm fine! I'm not under pressure!

206
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,240
Jiang.

207
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,870
You know what?

208
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,630
I have to go back now.

209
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,640
I can't live without Doudou,

210
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,230
and I can't divorce Feng Huanan either.

211
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,840
You're my best friend.

212
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,870
You must help me find Doudou,

213
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,480
you know?

214
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

215
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,440
Su Yin.

216
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,030
Where is Su Yin?

217
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,200
Do you still need to ask me where he is?

218
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,910
His life revolves around

219
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,200
only work and home!

220
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,190
Since yesterday, we've only reached 2.36 million

221
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,300
paying users,

222
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,240
far below our expectations.

223
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,670
I suggest...

224
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,470
Su Yin.

225
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,950
Su Yin, I want to go back to seven years ago.

226
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,470
I need to go back.

227
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,800
Okay, I'll take you home.

228
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,630
I don't mean going home.

229
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,950
I want to go back to seven years ago!

230
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
I know it was you.

231
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,430
Back then, at the hospital bed,

232
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,280
it was you.

233
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,990
You sent me to another space

234
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,270
where I made many choices.

235
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,070
I thought that was just a game,

236
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,760
but I didn't know the ending would change.

237
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
You know I can't live without Doudou.

238
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,520
Let me go back.

239
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,430
You're talking about the Time Tunnel, right?

240
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,430
That's the game we just developed.

241
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,620
I don't care what it's called.

242
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,590
The point is, it's real!

243
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,440
I want to go back!

244
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,560
Gu Nian, this isn't real.

245
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,640
It's just a game.

246
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,830
No one can go back to the past.

247
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,990
You're lying to me, aren't you?

248
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,350
I have a witness.

249
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,450
Jiang, seven years ago,

250
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,990
I inhabited his body

251
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,360
and lived with you.

252
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,510
Together, we

253
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,880
stopped my past self of seven years ago

254
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,030
from marrying Feng Huanan.

255
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,110
You remember that, don't you?

256
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,910
What are you talking about, Gu Nian?

257
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,950
I've said so much,

258
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,360
but why won't you admit it?

259
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,580
It never happened. What am I supposed to admit?

260
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,750
I suspect

261
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,440
there's something wrong with her mentally.

262
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,400
You're lying to me.

263
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,670
-Lying…
-You…

264
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,870
Even you're lying to me too.

265
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,430
Gu Nian, we're not lying to you.

266
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,120
Right.

267
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
This is the game.

268
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,230
And the glasses. Where are the glasses?

269
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,810
I know an excellent psychiatrist.

270
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,160
I'll contact him now, okay?

271
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,680
Where are the glasses?

272
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,070
Where are the glasses?

273
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,230
Give them to me.

274
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,600
Tell me, where are the glasses?

275
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,870
Gu Nian.

276
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,270
Take a look at this.

277
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,520
What is this?

278
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,140
We're married.

279
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,310
Impossible.

280
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,270
Seven years ago, I borrowed your body.

281
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,510
We had no connection after that.

282
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,820
This is our marriage certificate.

283
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,710
You can believe me now, can't you?

284
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,560
It's photoshopped, right?

285
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,880
Why don't you believe me?

286
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,470
You're lying to me.

287
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,870
You're lying to me too.

288
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,390
Even you, you're also lying to me along with them!

289
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,720
He really is your husband.

290
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,310
Gu Nian!

291
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
What they said is true.

292
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,630
You and Su Yin really did get married.

293
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,360
Then why don't I have any of these memories?

294
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,630
How did I meet him?

295
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,910
I'm not sure about the details.

296
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,200
How can you not know?

297
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,069
We all became very busy after we started working

298
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,270
and rarely had time to get together.

299
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,750
The first time you brought him to meet me

300
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,790
was about a week before you got your marriage certificate.

301
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,319
You told me then that you were getting married,

302
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,349
and it really scared me that time.

303
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,520
That's impossible.

304
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,839
If I were in a relationship,

305
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,480
how could I have kept it from you?

306
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,920
I was also very puzzled at that time.

307
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,910
You hadn't said a word about it.

308
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,910
You said, with Feng Huanan's precedent,

309
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,109
you wanted to be more cautious this time.

310
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,400
You waited until you were sure about marriage before bringing him to meet me,

311
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,110
afraid of wasting feelings and time.

312
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,800
But this memory you're talking about,

313
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,030
I'm completely blank about it.

314
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,230
It can only mean one thing.

315
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,510
Parallel universes are real.

316
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,170
There are now two parallel universes.

317
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,480
Doudou is in the other universe.

318
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,910
And she is seriously ill now.

319
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,680
I must go back.

320
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,350
Lin Xi,

321
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Jiang doesn't believe me.

322
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,870
I have only you left.

323
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,600
You're the person I trust the most in this world.

324
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,040
You must help me find Doudou.

325
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,560
Nian, there are no parallel universes.

326
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,910
It's all fake.

327
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,030
That only happens in games.

328
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,720
None of the stories you just told,

329
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,280
including Doudou,

330
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,510
are real.

331
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,270
What you just said...

332
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,070
Wait, you,

333
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,760
why, why are you lying to me too?

334
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,110
Why is everyone helping Su Yin?

335
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,030
Nian, I'm not lying to you.

336
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,310
I have no reason to.

337
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,510
What I said is all the truth.

338
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,990
Well, Su Yin and I

339
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,030
have no relation whatsoever.

340
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,190
Why would I help him?

341
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,350
I only know him

342
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,390
because he's your husband.

343
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,400
I have no reason to lie.

344
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,670
But these memories feel so real.

345
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,240
They can't be fake.

346
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,620
There are similar medical cases.

347
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,830
You might have dissociative identity disorder,

348
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,670
imagining a virtual life.

349
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,590
Lin Xi,

350
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,040
I'm not sick.

351
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,390
My mind is very clear.

352
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,990
Why don't you believe me?

353
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,030
Parallel universes aren't scientific.

354
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
But it really happened.

355
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,960
Do you have any evidence to prove it happened?

356
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,190
Do you have any evidence to prove it didn't happen?

357
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,870
Nian, listen to me.

358
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,190
You may be very seriously ill now.

359
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,270
I must take you for an examination.

360
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,110
Trust me. I won't harm you.

361
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,320
Come back to the hospital with me, okay?

362
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,310
Lin Xi.

363
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,110
I'll say it again: I'm not sick.

364
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,190
And I'll find evidence to prove

365
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,630
what I said is true.

366
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,470
Nian.

367
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,660
You want to find evidence, right?

368
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,230
I'll take you.

369
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,560
Nian!

370
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,390
This is our first photo together.

371
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,270
I don't really like taking photos,

372
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,470
and I'm not very good at it either.

373
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,790
So when I took a photo with you for the first time,

374
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,720
I was particularly nervous

375
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,230
and had no confidence at all.

376
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,510
But I got better after taking more photos.

377
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,760
Look.

378
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,250
In the later photos, you can see me getting more confident

379
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,640
and more natural.

380
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,990
This one, this one, this one,

381
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,620
and this one.

382
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,470
These were all taken when we were camping by the sea.

383
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,710
It was your 25th birthday.

384
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,530
A little kid took these photos for us.

385
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,990
To get him to take photos for us,

386
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,280
you even gave him two rides on your motorbike.

387
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,680
Mom.

388
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,110
This photo was photoshopped.

389
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,600
On our wedding day,

390
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,500
I noticed your eyes were red the whole time.

391
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,610
I knew you were missing your mom.

392
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
So, when we were taking this photo,

393
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,350
I intentionally left a space for your mom.

394
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,510
This is Grandpa.

395
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,110
You still remember Grandpa?

396
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,030
Of course, I do.

397
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,200
When I was working at Shiyi Technology,

398
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I met Grandpa for the first time.

399
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,200
That's impossible.

400
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,510
You only met him once, on our wedding day.

401
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,470
When did we meet?

402
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,270
In 2019, when I started my business,

403
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,550
I invited Jiang Ze to join me.

404
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,420
Jiang Ze introduced you to me.

405
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,150
So we started the business together.

406
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,240
Didn't we already meet

407
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,030
in college?

408
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
We didn't know each other in college.

409
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,550
We didn't?

410
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,510
That time when your grandpa was sick,

411
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,830
I took you to the hospital on my motorcycle.

412
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,590
That did happen, indeed.

413
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,870
But we never met again after that,

414
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,440
and we didn't have a chance to talk either.

415
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,400
So I wouldn't count that as officially meeting.

416
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,600
It was when we started the business together

417
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,030
that we officially met.

418
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,350
Then how did we start dating?

419
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,240
A year after starting the business together,

420
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,150
we got together.

421
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,630
After dating for two years,

422
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,750
we got married.

423
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,390
I want to look around.

424
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,470
Um, I'm a bit hungry.

425
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,910
Could you make me something to eat?

426
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,740
I want to be alone for a while

427
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,160
to find our memories.

428
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,430
Okay.

429
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,710
I'll call you when the food is ready.

430
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,030
No rush; take your time to think.

431
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,500
[Do you want to go back to the past?]

432
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,090
[Do you want to see things from your own perspective again?]

433
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,310
Su Yin?

434
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,240
Dinner will be ready soon.

435
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,320
Stop pretending.

436
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,870
How do I use this to get back?

437
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,430
How do I use it?

438
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,870
This is just a pair of regular 3D glasses.

439
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,000
Gu Nian,

440
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,470
you can't go anywhere.

441
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,750
Tell me, how do I use it?

442
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,630
You're actually threatening

443
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,120
me with a knife over a hallucination, over memories

444
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,030
that never existed?

445
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,470
I don't want to hurt you

446
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,110
or anyone else.

447
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,840
I just want to get my Doudou back.

448
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,030
Doudou isn't real.

449
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,920
Gu Nian, please wake up.

450
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,190
Look carefully;

451
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,190
I am the real one!

452
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,880
This family of ours is real!

453
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,230
Our life together is real!

454
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,320
You're not real.

455
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,460
Tell me! How do I use it?

456
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,270
What's really going on with you?

457
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,990
Just last night, you told me

458
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,710
that our company is now on the right track

459
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,320
and that next year,

460
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,550
next year you want to have

461
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,350
a child with me.

462
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,640
But now you're telling me

463
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,310
that you already have a child with another man!

464
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,040
Do you have any idea how much you're hurting me?

465
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,080
Gu Nian.

466
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,670
Think about it calmly.

467
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,720
Stop talking!

468
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,030
I want to go back to the past!

469
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,790
If you don't believe me,

470
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,040
then go ahead and do it.

471
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,260
You think I don't dare?

472
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,230
Do it.

473
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,400
Su Yin,

474
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,750
I beg you.

475
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,870
Doudou is really very sick.

476
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,470
If I don't go back,

477
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,230
she'll be terrified when she can't find me.

478
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,280
Doudou might really die.

479
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,270
Please, for the sake of us, mother and daughter,

480
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,870
who are so pitiful,

481
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,010
I beg you.

482
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,670
Please help me.

483
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,910
Please help my child.

484
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,910
Help her.

485
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,870
I beg, I beg you.

486
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,110
Gu Nian,

487
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,030
none of this is real.

488
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,790
It's all fake.

489
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,990
It's so late. Why are you only coming back now?

490
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,630
Keep your voice down.

491
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,150
I just got her to sleep.

492
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,270
Doesn't she have tutoring sessions?

493
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,670
After class, she said she wanted McDonald's,

494
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,460
so we ate and then came back.

495
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,230
You could have let me know you were getting McDonald's.

496
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,510
I haven't even eaten dinner yet.

497
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,530
You should watch fewer of those soap operas.

498
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,400
Your phone might as well be a decoration.

499
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,150
I'm telling you, can you

500
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,390
not make me pick up the kid again?

501
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,830
I work such long hours every day,

502
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,990
over ten hours.

503
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,030
I'm telling you,

504
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,110
after a day of work like this,

505
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,670
I'm exhausted, both physically and mentally.

506
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,590
You've only picked up our daughter once,

507
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,830
and you're already completely exhausted?

508
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,340
I've been the one picking her up after work all this time.

509
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,840
When I come back after picking up the child,

510
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,670
I still have to cook for both of you.

511
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,480
After cooking, I have to clear the table,

512
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,550
wash the dishes, and clean up.

513
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,670
You've only done it once, and you're already complaining about being tired.

514
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,880
Why can I do it but you can't?

515
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,320
Who makes more money in this house, you or me?

516
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,650
Who's paying the car loan and mortgage?

517
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,030
Let me tell you, it's me.

518
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,350
I'm making more money to pay for all of them.

519
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,400
You know very well

520
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,430
the current situation at the company.

521
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,720
If I don't work overtime,

522
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
I might get laid off.

523
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Let me ask you.

524
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,070
If I were to get laid off,

525
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,200
then lose my job,

526
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,960
and only be able to stay at home to take care of the kid,

527
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,310
would you be happy then and satisfied?

528
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,870
Is that what I meant?

529
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,480
You just go on and on without stopping.

530
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,960
Look at yourself.

531
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,870
Have you finished eating this?

532
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,600
You haven't finished.

533
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,830
You can eat so much.

534
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,920
Are you a pig?

535
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,150
You didn't even clean up

536
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,390
the watermelon rind.

537
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,320
This empty bottle, you don't throw it away either.

538
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,790
Can you please pay attention to what needs to be done around here?

539
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,160
Don't just focus on eating and drinking, okay?

540
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,550
This wasn't just eaten by me alone.

541
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,240
The kid ate this this morning; have you forgotten?

542
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,680
Even if the kid ate it, couldn't you have cleaned it up?

543
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,800
I couldn't because I had no choice.

544
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,760
I had to go to work.

545
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,590
You're just sitting at home doing nothing...

546
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,390
Let's hire a part-time cleaner.

547
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,750
I can't take it anymore.

548
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,160
I'm also quite tired every day.

549
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
You're also very busy.

550
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,070
Let's hire a part-time cleaner.

551
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,990
It'll make things easier for both of us.

552
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,030
A part-time cleaner, huh?

553
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,920
Alright then.

554
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,460
If that's how you want it,

555
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,440
then you can transfer Doudou

556
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,550
from the international school

557
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,870
to a public school.

558
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,350
Let alone about hiring a part-time cleaner,

559
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,430
we could even afford to hire a nanny,

560
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,740
a 24-hour personal nanny to serve you

561
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,100
and even feed you if you want.

562
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,200
Or better yet, find yourself a sugar daddy.

563
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,550
You can just lie there, do nothing, and earn money.

564
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:25,910
That would be so easy.

565
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,790
Feng Huanan, you bastard.

566
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,510
What are you talking about?

567
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,270
I'm just stating the facts.

568
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,270
There's only so much money at home.

569
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,710
If you want to hire a part-time maid,

570
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,470
there's nothing I can do.

571
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,030
I can only cut costs elsewhere.

572
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,230
The question is, where else can we cut costs?

573
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,670
It'll have to be Doudou's school then.

574
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,600
That's the only area where we can cut back.

575
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,550
I'm telling you, Feng Huanan,

576
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,800
don't even think about it.

577
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,320
We've been behind others from day one.

578
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,910
How many times have I told you?

579
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,550
We absolutely cannot let our child end up like us.

580
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,670
My child must have

581
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,630
the best learning environment

582
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,510
and the best conditions.

583
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,200
She has to win.

584
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,360
Win.

585
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,310
I think what you said is great.

586
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,470
A real truth.

587
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,030
So stop complaining.

588
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,910
Suck it up.

589
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,960
Oh, right,

590
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,480
our daughter, she...

591
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,310
I just put her in bed.

592
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,680
But she hasn't changed her clothes or anything.

593
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,180
Can you go take care of it?

594
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,210
I need to go take a shower.

595
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,830
I'm too tired.

596
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,640
I can't handle it.

597
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Take care of it?

598
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,590
I'll take care of you.

599
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,320
Sweetie,

600
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,920
Mommy's coming in.

601
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,720
I knew you weren't asleep yet.

602
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,830
Come on, let Mommy help you change your clothes.

603
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,030
Rest for a while first

604
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,430
and calm your emotions.

605
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,310
I'll go prepare the meal.

606
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,560
You need to eat something.

607
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,270
Sleep.

608
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,590
Mommy, Mommy.

609
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,710
Doudou, you're awake.

610
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,430
Mommy, did I do something wrong

611
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,030
and make you angry?

612
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,250
Come here.

613
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,430
How could that be?

614
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,440
You're the

615
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,190
best-behaved child in the world.

616
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,080
You could never make Mommy angry.

617
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,580
But you don't want me anymore.

618
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
You've abandoned me.

619
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,720
That's impossible.

620
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,030
You're Mommy's most important little star.

621
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,030
I could never lose you.

622
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Really?

623
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,030
Of course, it's true.

624
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,830
Mommy, I love you.

625
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,590
I love you the most too,

626
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,470
my sweet girl.

627
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,110
Mommy.

628
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,949
Could you cut the apple into little stars for me?

629
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,510
Of course, I can.

630
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,320
I'll cut them for you.

631
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,230
Doudou?

632
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,290
Doudou?

633
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,310
Doudou?

634
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,710
Doudou!

635
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,830
She's very cute.

636
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,310
She has a round face

637
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,230
and round eyes.

638
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,200
She looks just like I did when I was a child.
