00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,550
Sweetie.

6
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,820
Your Aunt Wang said she saw some photos of you.

7
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,740
I asked her, but she wouldn't tell me.

8
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,539
What's going on exactly?

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,370
Bai Guo.

10
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,310
Mentor.

11
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,460
Bai Guo.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,650
Bai Guo!

13
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,880
Mentor!

14
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,410
Mentor!

15
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,710
You haven't said a word since we got back from the hospital.

16
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,550
Don't hold it in.

17
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,370
If you want to cry, just let it out.

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,150
It was a living, breathing life!

19
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,010
Such a lovely young woman.

20
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
I watched her die right in front of me,

21
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,050
again and again.

22
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,130
In that space,

23
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,450
I'm a failure.

24
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,650
If nothing can be changed,

25
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,040
why did they send me back?

26
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,829
Gu Nian.

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
Be brave.

28
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,329
We did our best.

29
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,290
Gu Nian.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
What on earth is the point of living?

31
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,210
Why do we have to suffer like this?

32
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,620
It's endless. Just endless.

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Even though we don't know why we live,

34
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,210
since we are alive, we should be brave.

35
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,050
Gu Nian.

36
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Although we failed to save her,

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
there's one thing we must do.

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,000
What's that?

39
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,279
Clear her name.

40
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,409
Take a look at this, everyone.

41
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,050
There's an anonymous email.

42
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,490
It's a chat log between Bai Guo and Ye Weijian.

43
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,340
[Ye Weijian took advantage of his position to sexually harass and exploit his colleague Bai Guo for a year]

44
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,090
So it turns out Mr. Ye is the real scumbag.

45
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,710
Why was Bai Guo so naive?

46
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,200
She should have called the police. What couldn't she say?

47
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,130
I can't handle this. Ever since I had my daughter,

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,010
I can't stand seeing things like this.

49
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,130
How could Bai Guo's parents deal with this?

50
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,210
Look how outrageous his words are.

51
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't believe this happened.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Why did she have to take it to heart?

53
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,280
Only when Bai Guo's mother showed me her diary from before she died

54
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,640
did I realize

55
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,720
that she had been planning

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,970
to expose Ye Weijian's worst to the public.

57
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,170
Let's help her get this done.

58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,370
I hope there won't be another Bai Guo in this world.

59
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,630
Be careful!

62
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,440
Huanan, are you okay?

63
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,660
I'm okay.

64
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,720
Is this 911?

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,200
Coming.

66
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,480
Coming.

67
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,840
What happened?

68
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,540
It's nothing.

69
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,480
He's injured.

70

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,600
What happened to you?

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,080
It's okay. I'm alright.

73
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,850
What happened?

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,120
It's nothing. I just bumped into something accidentally.

75
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,960
Feng Huanan.

76
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,250
Have you been living here since you quit your job?

77
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,730
So which room do you live in?

78
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,850
Go inside and rest.

79
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,200
You sleep here?

80
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,000
Well...

81
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,410
I should probably go back to my room.

82
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,970
I... I still have some work to finish.

83
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,400
You two talk.

84
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,210
You two continue.

85
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Feng Huanan.

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Actually,

87
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,430
your current situation is largely my fault.

88
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,200
How is it your fault?

89
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,600
Let me tell you, Gu Nian,

90
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,800
you're amazing.

91
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,200
I think I'm pretty amazing too.

92
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,240
I never expected

93
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,600
that one day you'd become so brave.

94
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm also inspired

95
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
by your courage.

96
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,280
Now,

97
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,409
you're the one guiding me forward.

98
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,909
But...

99
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,450
Bai Guo still died.

100
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,490
I failed to save her.

101
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
Don't feel too guilty.

102
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,280
You've already

103
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,470
given it your all, one hundred percent.

105
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:15,970
Mom.

106
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,800
Hey, Mom.

107
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,600
How many times have I told you that

108
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,760
things would never work out between Yongfang and I?

109
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,570
You always think that

110
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,159
since we grew up together

111
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,090
and she's good to you,

112
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,429
we should be together.

113
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,320
But from the beginning to the end,

114
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,679
I've never had feelings for her.

115
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,400
I've always seen her as a younger sister.

116
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,280
And haven't I told you that

117
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,040
I have a girlfriend now?

118
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,480
Her name is Gu Nian.

119
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,310
Alright, I'm done talking.

120
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm with my girlfriend right now.

121
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,950
So stop trying to play matchmaker, okay?

122
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,390
Bye-bye.

123
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,490
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,720
My mom was trying to play matchmaker,

125
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,600
so I got anxious, and I...

126
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,890
Well,

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,280
I noticed there's some bruising on your leg.

128
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Do you want me to help you apply some ointment?

129
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,040
It's alright.

130
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,600
Right? Look.

131
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,990
It's just a minor injury.

132
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,680
It should heal in a couple of days.

133
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I think it's an interview call.

134
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,240
I'll go take it.

135
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,410
Okay.

136
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm going to meet an investor later.

137
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,040
It could be of help to you.

138
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,360
Are you free to come over?

139
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,050
Sure, sure, no problem.

140
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
The usual place.

141
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,810
Okay, I understand.

142
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,280
Well, why don't you take care of your business today?

143
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,640
I'll head back first.

144
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,400
I'll come see you again in a couple of days.

145
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,770
You haven't eaten anything tonight.

146
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,650
You must be hungry.

147
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,440
I have a lot of food here.

148
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,090
Let me make you some noodles.

149
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,050
No, no need.

150
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,960
Well, I'll be off then.

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,710
Well, your leg...

152
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,800
Are you sure you don't need to apply some ointment to it?

153
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,970
My leg is fine. Are you sure you don't want to eat something?

154
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm a good cook, you know.

155
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
No, really. There's no need.

156
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,960
Well...

157
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,010
Have some rest.

158
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,410
I... I'll be going then. Bye-bye.

159
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,820
Be careful.

160
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm off then.

161
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,370
Bye-bye.

162
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,170
Bye-bye.

163
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,200
So you played a hero, saving the damsel in distress?

164
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,010
Stop with the sarcasm.

165
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,920
Help me apply some ointment, will you?

166
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,280
Alright.

167
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,270
Tu.

168
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,850
I didn't expect you'd still be willing to help me.

169
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,040
Walk with me for a bit.

170
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,710
How have you been lately?

171
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,420
I've always loved the sea,

172
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,800
because I can hide my worries there.

In the early hours of last night,

182
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,890
a man surnamed Ye drove drunk and plunged into a river.

183
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,970
His blood alcohol level was over the limit when he drowned.

184
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,170
Take a look at this.

185
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,560
Isn't this Mr. Ye's car?

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,410
That scumbag actually died.

190
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,800
He got what he deserved.

191
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,090
But dying such a quick death,

192
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,120
he got off easy.

193
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,790
If you ask me,

194
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,080
this kind of person should be exposed and condemned online.

195
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,010
Bai Guo, you can rest in peace now.

196
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,210
It's a pity Bai Guo isn't here.

197
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,970
Otherwise, it would be so satisfying.

198
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,110
It really is instant karma, right?

199
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,110
Indeed.

200
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
Let's go, stop looking.

201
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,280
Let's go eat.

202
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,800
Nian, are you coming with us?

203
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,940
I, uh...

204
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,760
Feng, why are you here?

205
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,720
My new company is right downstairs,

206
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,890
and I happened to see Gu Nian's takeout,

207
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,290
so I brought it up for her.

208
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,170
But of course, it was mainly because I missed you all,

209
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,270
and I thought I'd come to see you.

210
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,160
Are you here to see us or Nian?

211
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,390
Let's go. Let's go.

212
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,530
Am I the kind of person who values romance over friendship?

213
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,450
Sure you are.

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,890
Wait.

215
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,360
When did you join a new company?

216
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,890
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,970
I wanted to give you a surprise.

218
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,480
What kind of company is it?

219
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,160
It's a small company.

220
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,860
You've definitely never heard of it.

221
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,800
It's far inferior to Shiyi.

222
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,680
But there's one particularly good thing

223
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,370
about our company.

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,050
That is, I can talk to my boss

225
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,570
directly.

226
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,000
Because we don't have any CEOs,

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,610
presidents, general managers, or any of that stuff.

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's much more efficient to work there.

229
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,400
And there's another reason,

230
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,010
that is it's not far from you.

231
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,320
After that incident with Ye Weijian last time,

232
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
I've been constantly worried about you.

233
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,280
Sometimes, the more I think about it, the more scared I get.

234
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,010
What if I hadn't been by your side then?

235
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,610
I don't even know what the worst outcome could have been.

236
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,080
Don't worry.

237
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,290
It was only because I lost my motorcycle

238
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,210
and I had to take the subway every day

239
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,360
that he took advantage of it.

240
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,560
I've thought it through.

241
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm going to work hard, earn money myself,

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,640
and buy a new motorcycle.

243
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,760
That way, no one will be able to catch up with me.

244
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,350
Is that so?

245
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,720
So even I can't catch up with you?

246
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,410
I was just kidding.

247
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,480
I don't even have a bicycle now.

248
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,570
How could I possibly catch up with you?

249
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,500
But don't worry, Gu Nian.

250
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,680
This is only temporary.

251
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,120
I've never given up on my entrepreneurial plan.

252
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,050
What I'm doing now

253
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,450
is trying my best to accumulate capital.

254
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,830
I believe as long as I work hard enough,

255
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,740
I'll achieve this goal one day.

256
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,870
Do you have a business plan?

257
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,570
Yes, why?

258
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,220
Thank you.

259
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,210
This... This is my motorcycle?

260
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,089
I waited at the trading market for a few days, right?

261
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,560
I can't believe I actually caught it.

262
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,240
At first, I thought

263
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,609
I must find out which bastard it was who stole it.

264
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,760
I had to report it to the police, right?

265
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,079
But the shopkeeper said it changed hands too many times,

266
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,829
so it couldn't be traced.

267
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,520
Take a look. Is this still your motorcycle or not?

268
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,350
Is anything missing or damaged?

269
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,040
It's exactly the same as before.

270
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,520
You've been injured recently.

271
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,390
You didn't spend all your break time staking it out, did you?

272
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,210
How much did you spend to buy it back?

273
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,090
Not much.

274
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,170
Didn't I get that project bonus?

275
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,520
Along with the previous

276
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,640
earnings from being a designated driver, and what's left in my card.

277
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,000
It all added up just right. It didn't cost much.

278
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,370
Are you stupid or what?

279
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,370
Spending so much money to buy it back.

280
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,080
At worst, I could earn money myself

281
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
and buy a new one.

282
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,420
But it has a different meaning to you.

283
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,800
You were riding it

284
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,370
when you won your first motorcycle race prize.

285
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,010
It took you to so many

286
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,280
beautiful places.

287
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,810
It must mean the world to you.

288
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,400
Huanan.

289
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,400
Thank you for knowing me so well.

290
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,600
There's no need to say thank you between us.

291
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,910
It's just that with my current abilities,

292
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,160
this is all I can do for you for now.

293
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,270
Why do I need more?

294
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,340
As long as it's what I need.

295
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,180
That's enough.

296
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,510
No matter what,

297
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,730
Huanan, you helped me retrieve

298
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,070
my favorite motorcycle.

299
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,140
From now on, whenever you need anything,

300
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,650
I'll give you a ride, rain or shine.

301
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,970
You said it.

302
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,760
You'll give me a ride, rain or shine.

303
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,520
Actually, I happen to

304
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,800
need to deliver something to a client.

305
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
How about you give me

306
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,520
a ride now?

307
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,110
My baby.

308
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,480
I missed you so much.

309
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,820
Let me feel you.

310
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,330
Nian.

311
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,230
Give me a ride, will you?

312
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
Oh, right. Get on.

313
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,750
Look how excited you are.

314
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,000
Here, take this.

315
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,450
Gloves.

316
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,260
Thank you.

317
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,010
Mom, here's the thing.

318
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,280
I have an exceptionally talented classmate.

319
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,740
In order to help

320
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,450
a girl who was being harassed at work,

321
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,880
he got fired by his boss.

322
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,950
And now he's thinking about starting his own business.

323
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,500
Don't you always want to invest in good projects?

324
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,990
Could you give him a chance?

325
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,010
I assure you, he has excellent character.

326
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,800
I'll send you his resume later.

327
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,210
Okay.

328
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,850
Thank you, Mom.

329
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,580
Gu Nian, are you crazy?

330
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,410
You called our mom

331
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,610
to find investment for that scumbag?

332
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,490
What's wrong, Su...

333
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,810
Older Gu Nian.

334
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,690
I don't think Huanan is like what you described.

335
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
He's really a great person now.

336
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,680
As for conflicts between husband and wife,

337
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,200
it takes two to tango.

338
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,640
Have you considered that it might be your problem?

339
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,490
I should have known it.

340
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,450
I couldn't intervene in Bai Guo's death.

341
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,410
I can't intervene in your relationship with Feng Huanan, either.

342
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,760
I only came back to experience all the pain

343
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,600
and suffering I've been through again.

344
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,920
Who exactly sent me back?

345
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,480
Who was it?

346
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,500
Who?

347
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,510
Su Yin.

348
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,610
Su Yin, was it you?

349
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,180
Was it you who sent me back?

350
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
Hey, are you alright?

351
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,820
The ending is irreversible.

352
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,770
A tragedy is destined to be a tragedy.

353
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,880
As for this multiple-choice question of life,

354
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,620
no matter what I choose, there will always be regrets.

355
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,680
Gu Nian.

356
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,250
I lost.

357
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,050

♫Through the seasons♫

♫Even though I know the door isn't locked♫

375
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,590
[I've been having meetings non-stop, and I have to go on a business trip at short notice. Don't miss me too much]

376
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,100
♫Time♫

377
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:51,600
♫Could you please not take my stories away♫

378
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,330
[Okay. Take care]

379
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,800
Huanan, this place is quite beautiful.

380
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,260
Indeed.

381
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,180
What are you delivering to your client that brings you here?

382
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,450
It's a little secret.

383
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,410
Well, Nian.

384
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,960
I'll go deliver the item to the client first.

385
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,870
Wait for me here for a moment.

386
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,400
Okay.

387
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,170
I'll be right back.

388
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,080
Wait for me, alright?

389
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,910
Okay.

390
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,120
[Marry Me]

391
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,410
♫Nobody knows♫

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,370
♫This feeling I behold♫

393
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,230
♫I feel younger but I'm wrong♫

394
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,770
♫I've seen highs♫

395
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,540
♫I've seen lows♫

396
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,390
So beautiful.

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,580
♫These days come and go♫

398
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,640
What special occasion is it today?

399
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,610
♫Some beautiful, some cold♫

400
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,940
♫I've been walking on my own♫

401
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,690
♫It's like I can't move on♫

402
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,410
♫Oh♫

403
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,400
Huanan.

404
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,320
♫I can't move on♫

405
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,560
♫Even if I want to♫

406
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,060
♫These days come and go♫

407
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,940
♫It's like I can't move on♫

408
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,280
♫Oh, to let go♫

409
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,090
I know I was the problem before.

410
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,130
♫This future so unknown♫

411
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,720
I made many mistakes.

412
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,140
But perhaps, fate sees that our connection is deep.

413
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,900
♫All these wounds that I've sewn♫

414
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,410
It has given me another chance,

415
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,650
♫Scars remind me of home♫

416
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,930
allowing us to be by each other's side

417
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,610
at every critical moment.

418
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,440
♫So, when you fall♫

419
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,160
I don't want to miss out on you again.

420
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,600
I want to be by your side forever,

421
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,010
♫It doesn't matter anymore♫

422
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,410
and protect you at all times.

423
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,150
♫I don't feel much at all♫

424
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,290
So the best solution I could think of

425
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,730
is to propose to you directly.

426
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,200
I know this might seem abrupt to you,

427
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,350
♫It's like I can't move on♫

428
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,600
because you might have just accepted me.

429
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:53,390
♫Oh♫

430
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,330
But it's different for me.

431
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,730
My feelings for you,

432
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,160
from college until now,

433
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,060
have never changed.

434
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,540
♫Woo♫

435
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
Well, you are being abrupt, indeed.

436
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,330
♫I can't move on♫

437
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,250
♫Even if I want to♫

438
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,570
Huanan.

439
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,080
Marriage is not something to joke about.

440
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,650
♫These days come and go♫

441
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,340
I'm not joking.

442
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,540
♫It's like I can't move on♫

443
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,620
Nian.

444
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,770
You've seen me at my best,

445
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:18,210
♫Oh♫

446
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,000
but you didn't despise me at my worst.

447
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,050
You might not have noticed,

448
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,440
but actually, I've expressed my true feelings...

449
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,360
I've expressed my true feelings

450
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,310
♫These days come and go♫

451
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,160
to you long ago.

452
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,730
♫It's like I can't move on♫

453
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,170
On stage, do you remember?

454
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,490
"You are my light."

455
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,850
Actually, I was quite hesitant at that time.

456
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,670
But until...

457
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,540
Until the moment I saw you in trouble.

458
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,290
At that moment, I felt certain that

459
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,920
you're the person I want to protect for the rest of my life.

460
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,560
You're an independent and strong girl,

461
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,930
but I know

462
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,370
beneath that independence and strength, there hides vulnerability.

463
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,400
So I want to be your safe harbor,

464
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,800
to shelter you from the storm,

465
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,160
to build a family with you,

466
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,130
and to protect you and your mother.

467
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,190
Nian.

468
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,480
Would you give me this chance?

469
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,340
It's okay. Don't feel pressured.

470
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,210
I'm just expressing my feelings.

471
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,870
You don't need to give me an answer right away.

472
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,720
I will use my actions

473
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,130
to bridge the gap between our families.

474
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,210
I can wait.

475
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,640
I can wait forever,

476
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,180
until you dispel all your concerns,

477
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,400
I mean, completely.

478
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,490
Huanan.

479
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,100
This is really too sudden.

480
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,810
I can't agree to this right now,

481
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,840
because I think

482
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,690
marriage is a matter between two families.

483
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,890
I still need to discuss this with my mom.

484
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,830
But

485
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,840
I accept your feelings.

486
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,100
You're trying to scare me, aren't you?

487
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:36,800
Yes, indeed.

488
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,790
Trying to scare me, huh?

489
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,200
Let's see if you dare to scare me again!

490
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,850
She's so blatantly giving me the cold shoulder.

491
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:10,920
Every day at work,

492
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
she avoids me like the plague.

493
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,610
She even told me to reflect on myself,

494
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,760
saying that I'm partly to blame for our failed marriage.

495
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,410
I spent a whole week seriously reflecting,

496
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,120
and my biggest problem is that I'm stupid.

497
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,450
I only see the surface,

498
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,760
too stupid to understand human nature.

499
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,380
Gu Nian is just stupid like this now.

500
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,690
She's always easily swayed

501
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,100
by Feng Huanan's sweet talk.

502
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,470
She's always siding with him,

503
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
acting like I'm trying to hurt her or something.

504
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,860
Xi, do you think I'd hurt myself?

505
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Well, there's nothing you can do about that.

506
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,880
Who in their early 20s

507
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,150
can truly understand human nature?

508
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,480
Weren't you the same?

509
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,600
It was until the darkest moment of your divorce

510
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,620
that you finally saw things clearly, right?

511
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,590
She's too close to the situation now,

512
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,410
which is normal.

513
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,330
Then why are you so young

514
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,610
yet so wise?

515
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,180
That's because I've seen a lot.

516
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,400
I've seen how much my mom was hurt,

517
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,620
and I've seen my dad's ungrateful,

518
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,310
selfish, and ugly face.

519
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,570
What you call wisdom

520
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,860
is what I've gained from all these painful experiences.

521
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,040
But I can't just stand by and watch her get hurt.

522
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,010
Feng Huanan's game has leveled up

523
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,130
even more than I remember.

524
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,000
If I didn't know his true nature,

525
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,620
with all his heroic acts,

526
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,340
even I

527
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,090
wouldn't be able to resist.

528
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,810
Although Gu Nian used to let my words

529
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,080
go in one ear and out the other,

530
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,080
at least they'd pass through her mind.

531
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,690
But now,

532
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,570
I can't even see her after work.

533
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,480
She won't answer my calls,

534
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,170
won't reply to my messages,

535
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,460
and I have no idea where she goes.

536
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,890
Xi, I'm really at my wit's end.

537
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,050
Can you help me

538
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,280
and talk some sense into her?

539
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,410
With that temper of yours,

540
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,200
you can't even control yourself.

541
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,370
How do you expect anyone else to control you?

542
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,000
Besides, I don't want to get involved.

543
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,890
Why? You two are so close.

544
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,520
Think about it.

545
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,510
When you're desperately seeking a cure,

546
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,400
we can only give you the best treatment plan

547
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,040
from a medical perspective.

548
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,200
But that might not align with your personal wishes.

549
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,320
The first lesson as a doctor

550
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,500
is to learn to respect the patients

551
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,130
and their own choices.

552
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,200
