00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,229

Gu Nian.

6
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,450
We lost our mom.

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,890
Aren't you the cheat code?

10
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,900
You make life start over, right?

11
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,400
Just do it one more time.

12
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,449
This time,

13
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,170
I promise I'll listen to you and Mom.

14
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,930
I... I won't be willful anymore.

15
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,780
Please, please?

16
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,860
If I could reverse life,

17
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,090
I would never let Mom leave me a second time.

18
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,250
The pain I bear is many,

19
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,980
many times worse than yours.

20
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,930
I am the one who most wants to

21
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,450
turn back time for Mom.

22
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,810
But I can't.

23
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,540
I can't.

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,240
Hello, is this Mrs. Dai?

25
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,860
You made an appointment for a motorcycle lesson today.

26
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,680
Are you still coming?

27
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,570
Gu Nian's classmates

28
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,770
and her friends

29
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,210
have all ridden her motorcycle,

30
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,810
but she's never let me ride.

31
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,490
I've always wanted to

32
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,490
have a motorcycle too,

33
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,370
so I can

34
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,690
ride the motorcycle with her.

35
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,290
She's not coming.

36
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,540
She won't come again.

37
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,890
Cancel the lesson.

38
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,890
Mom said

39
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,290
we've given rides to friends

40
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,450
and classmates,

41
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,890
but never to her.

42
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,579
She wanted to ride with us just once.

43
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,760
Gu Nian.

44
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,130
Nian,

45
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,090
today is your wedding day.

46
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,010
Your father should be the one speaking,

47
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,900
but he slacked off and hid away.

48
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,690
Since that's the case,

49
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,130
let me, the mom who plays

50
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,210
both dad and mom,

51
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,280
say a few words to you.

52
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,450
I was once a daughter too.

53
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,810
Although we share the same role,

54
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,570
our lives must be different.

55
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,170
Think of all the things your grandmother asked me to do,

56
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,290
things I couldn't always manage.

57
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,370
So, I owe you an apology.

58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,890
I was wrong.

59
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,210
Please forgive me.

60
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,410
I'm a first-time mom,

61
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,410
still growing

62
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,770
and still learning.

63
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,410
Letting go is a very deep lesson.

64
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,490
I've spent my whole life trying to pass that test.

65
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,810
Life is a series of choices,

66
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,810
and I haven't always gotten the answers right.

67
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,360
There are many things I still haven't fully understood,

68
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,970
and I don't have the right to guide or define your choices.

69
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,650
You're right.

70
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,850
Your own experiences and feelings

71
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,690
cannot be replaced by anyone.

72
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,810
No matter what the future holds,

73
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,650
your dad and I only hope that you are happy and content.

74
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,970
As for this multiple-choice question of life,

75
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,820
there might never be perfect answers.

76
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,610
I know you're not afraid of falling,

77
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,890
because you'll always get back up on your own.

78
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,610
But my precious daughter,

79
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,900
if one day you get tired,

80
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,850
don't worry.

81
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,210
I'll always be standing behind you.

82
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,050
Lastly,

83
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,730
I have a special gift for you.

84
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,320
Mom.

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,680
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,409
Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

87
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,610
Gu Nian.

88
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,220
This trophy...

89
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,690
Mom.

90
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,070
You're back.

91
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,850
Come, quickly. Dinner's just ready.

92
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,210
Come, sit down and eat.

93
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,650
I won first place.

94
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,810
What's this trophy for?

95
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,490
Is it from the university knowledge competition?

96
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,620
That doesn't suit me at all.

97
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,210
This is from my first

98
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,620
amateur motorcycle race.

99
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,900
I won first place right away.

100
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,930
When I bought you this motorcycle,

101
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,010
I wanted to get you a

102
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,330
flashier means of transportation.

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,820
I never meant for you to participate in this kind of race.

104
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,170
Mom, you're overreacting.

105
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,580
Look at me, I'm perfectly fine,

106
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,370
no injuries at all.

107
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,870
You're a girl,

108
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,490
can't you be gentle

109
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,530
and pretty?

110
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,880
Why do you have to

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,159
do something so risky?

112
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,610
Mom, you're such a buzzkill.

113
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,100
I just wanted to share with you

114
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,170
that I won.

115
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,970
Now it feels like I'm the one being unreasonable.

116
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,010
You are being unreasonable.

117
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,690
Let me tell you,

118
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,450
don't ever do

119
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,490
this kind of sport again.

120
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,610
I have no interest

121
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,770
in these trophies.

122
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,350
Go wash your hands and eat.

123
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,690
I thought she threw it in the trash

124
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,220
and it broke.

125
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,090
I didn't dare ask later.

126
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,970
Turns out,

127
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,090
it wasn't that Mom didn't understand us,

128
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,289
it was that we didn't understand Mom.

129
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,010
When I got married

130
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,010
and had children,

131
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,450
I gradually began to understand

132
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,410
the struggles of being a mother.

133
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,610
Wanting your child to be happy and carefree,

134
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,540
but at the same time, desperately wanting to protect them from harm.

135
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,090
In the hospital,

136
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,970
Mom said to me,

137
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,490
if she was standing,

138
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,890
you couldn't fall.

139
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,370
Now, it's our turn to push forward.

140
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,370
No matter how tough it gets,

141
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,410
we must keep going, like Mom taught us.

142
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,260
Stay strong.

143
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
I never expected that

144
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,610
one day, my future self

145
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,210
would be the one to comfort me.

146
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,050
I will never, ever forget today.

147
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,090
Oh, right,

148
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,250
we need to go to Lin Xi's place quickly

149
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,350
to stop her from going to the hospital.

150
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,290
Why?

151
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,930
There will be a car accident surgery today,

152
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,080
and she'll get injured during it.

153
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,450
She won't be able to be a doctor anymore after that.

154
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,210
I was so immersed in the pain

155
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,680
of losing Mom back then,

156
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,810
that I didn't even stay by Lin Xi's side

157
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,050
when she needed me the most.

158
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:22,950
Let's go.

159
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,450
Nian.

160
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,290
Lin Xi.

161
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,530
You... you can't go to the hospital today.

162
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,570
Nian, I know you're

163
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,450
very upset right now.

164
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,450
But the hospital is extremely busy today,

165
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,240
I have to go.

166
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,340
No, if you go to the hospital today,

167
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,330
you'll never be able to be a doctor again.

168
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,090
What do you mean?

169
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,290
It's true, Lin Xi.

170
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,010
There will be a car accident surgery today.

171
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,830
The lead surgeon will let you into the operating room.

172
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,660
When you help lift the patient onto the operating table,

173
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,570
things will lose control

174
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,420
and you'll cut your tendons.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,090
Do you remember when you asked me

176
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,410
if you'd become an expert?

177
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,610
I lied to you.

178
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,450
You didn't.

179
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,570
Because of this surgery,

180
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,290
you won't even be able to be a doctor anymore.

181
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,720
Lin Xi,

182
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,240
being a doctor is your biggest dream.

183
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,170
Don't go.

184
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,250
-Lin Xi!
-Lin Xi!

185
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,610
Boss, Gu Nian. Are you ready

186
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,610
for the Revisit Project test?

187
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,410
Ready.

188
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,890
I promised my mom.

189
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,650
This time it absolutely won't go wrong.

190
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,890
Let's head over then.

191
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,490
We can't keep Mr. Li waiting again.

192
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,860
Good luck!

193
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,810
One, two, three—

194
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,820
go!

195
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,480
Jiang, is the equipment debugging finished?

196
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,010
Don't worry.

197
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,870
Yin?

198
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,600
Yin?

199
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,540
Are you calling me?

200
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,500
Who else would I be calling?

201
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,700
How can I help you?

202
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,130
You little rascal,

203
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,070
you've got some guts, huh?

204
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,770
Not even a single phone call

205
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,610
in more than a month.

206
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,040
You had me worried sick.

207
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,290
I've been looking for you for three days and nights.

208
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,690
Why didn't you even answer my calls?

209
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,520
Grandpa, Grandpa.

210
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,440
I've been a bit busy lately.

211
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,920
Look, I'm doing fine, aren't I?

212
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,850
How did you know I was here?

213
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,300
If your mentor hadn't told me,

214
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,690
where would I have found you?

215
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,210
How long were you planning to keep this from me?

216
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,450
Grandpa, how about this?

217
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,730
Why don't you wait for me in my office?

218
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,970
I'll come find you once I'm done here.

219
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,970
All this "you, you, you." Am I a stranger to you?

220
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,610
If you're embarrassed of me,

221
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,810
I'll leave right now!

222
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,850
But one thing,

223
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,810
don't forget your roots.

224
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,330
Grandpa.

225
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,180
Please, sit down. Wait for me a moment.

226
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,360
Let me talk to my colleagues.

227
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,610
Come.

228
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,500
Careful.

229
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,780
Okay.

230
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,740
You guys go up first.

231
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,290
I'll see Grandpa out.

232
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,210
Boss, it's about time.

233
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,000
Hurry up.

234
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,510
Alright.

235
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,780
Go ahead.

236
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,780
Let's go.

237
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,980
Mr. Li.

238
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,940
The Revisit Project test is about to begin.

239
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,060
I'll give everyone

240
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,370
a quick demonstration

241
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,810
of the core and background first.

242
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,610
Yin,

243
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,050
don't be mad at me.

244
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,010
I'm really worried about you.

245
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,150
If one day I close my eyes for good

246
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,050
and go to the other side,

247
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,410
I won't be able to face anyone.

248
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,450
Grandpa, don't say this.

249
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,250
You'll live a long, long life, I'm sure.

250
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,970
Okay, you get back to work.

251
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,300
I'm leaving.

252
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,500
Go back, go back.

253
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,610
Go on with your work.

254
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,120
Director Su will be here shortly.

255
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,810
He'll give everyone detailed...

256
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,580
Sorry, I'm late.

257
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,410
Please continue.

258
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,570
The background of the Revisit Project...

259
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,650
Excuse me,

260
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,450
let's pause for a moment.

261
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,410
Mr. Li,

262
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,530
do you have any questions?

263
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,240
Now that Director Su is back,

264
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,600
I'd like to ask him to personally

265
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,930
take over the rest of the demonstration.

266
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,850
We chose this project

267
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,170
largely because of

268
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,690
Director Su's reputation in the industry.

269
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,690
After all,

270
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,050
a leader's ability

271
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,570
determines the team's vitality.

272
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,460
Last time, Director Su had to cancel due to some matters.

273
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,100
But I trust that this time,

274
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,810
he won't miss the opportunity to demonstrate

275
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,610
his capabilities and sincerity.

276
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,190
Let's begin.

277
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,370
I've been looking for you for three days and nights.

278
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,810
You can't forget your roots.

279
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,850
Good luck.

280
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,330
Go back, go back.

281
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,370
Get back to work.

282
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,900
We've done a lot of research

283
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,420
and preparation for this project.

284
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,090
The Revisit Project...

285
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,890
The hidden big shot majoring in computer science, God Su.

286
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,540
My supervisor's favorite disciple.

287
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,780
The Revisit...

288
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,820
Are you really Gu Nian?

289
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,170
Boss.

290
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,150
You've changed.

291
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,960
Gu Nian.

292
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,859
Su Yin, hurry up. Don't waste everyone's time.

293
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,920
Okay.

294
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,670
Let's get to the point.

295
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,810
I don't know anything.

296
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,810
How do I do this?

297
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,290
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,410
We might have made a mistake

299
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,610
with the initial data.

300
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,370
It'll be fixed soon.

301
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,850
It's okay. Since this happened,

302
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,590
let's solve it on-site.

303
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,860
After all, in the mass production phase,

304
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,520
there might be some issues.

305
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,850
This is a good opportunity

306
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,140
to see Director Su's optimization abilities.

307
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,160
Mr. Li, you may not know.

308
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,130
Technical issues like this are my responsibility.

309
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,410
I've got it covered.

310
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,450
I said

311
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,170
I wanted to see Director Su's

312
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,610
optimization skills.

313
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,960
Our supervisor has been asking about your plans lately.

314
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,210
You should pop into the lab from time to time.

315
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,410
The department is looking for you everywhere.

316
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,770
They've circulated a notice of criticism of you,

317
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,200
and they said if you didn't show up soon,

318
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,610
they'd contact Su Yin's grandfather.

319
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,800
How come he doesn't even know how to code?

320
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,020
Is he a fraud?

321
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,230
If this gets out,

322
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,780
how will he survive in the tech industry?

323
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,490
It's one thing if his skills are lacking,

324
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,570
but his character is also questionable.

325
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,130
Su Yin,

326
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,390
you've disappointed me greatly.

327
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,370
From now on,

328
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,990
you and every company you work with

329
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,010
will forever be removed

330
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,290
from my collaboration list.

331
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,690
Mr. Li.

332
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,670
So you actually don't know anything.

333
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,200
No, Mr. Liu.

334
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,850
No, I don't understand...

335
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,660
Gao Ren.

336
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,170
Su Yin.

337
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,130
How come he doesn't even know how to code?

338
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,490
Is he a fraud?

339
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,610
If this gets out,

340
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,050
how will he survive in the tech industry?

341
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,730
It's one thing if his skills are lacking,

342
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,890
but his character is also questionable.

343
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,530
I trusted you so much before.

344
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,090
I even handed over the whole project team to you.

345
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,870
You've disappointed me greatly.

346
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,700
Su Yin, from now on,

347
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,540
you and every company you work with

348
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,380
will forever be removed

349
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,650
from my collaboration list.

350
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,970
Su Yin.

351
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:33,940
What are you doing?

352
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,370
Why come to such a dangerous place?

353
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,690
If you want to die, find somewhere closer to do it.

354
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,530
Didn't you say,

355
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,770
"As long as Mom is still standing, we won't fall"?

356
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,810
What are you doing?

357
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,970
If I jump off,

358
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,010
will everything be over?

359
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,290
What are you talking about?

360
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,130
I saw Grandpa Su's eyes today,

361
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,540
and his lonely figure.

362
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,570
I feel so selfish.

363
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,090
I've occupied someone else's body,

364
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,570
but I didn't fulfill my filial duty.

365
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,820
I ruined his career.

366
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,050
I'm so bad.

367
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,550
If you think you're bad,

368
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,690
then I'm worse.

369
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,730
If it had been Su Yin at the meeting today,

370
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,690
he would have handled everything perfectly.

371
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,940
Maybe not long from now,

372
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,690
he would have become a

373
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,610
world-renowned tech mogul.

374
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,370
But today, I made him

375
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,610
the laughingstock of the entire industry.

376
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,210
Gu Nian,

377
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,130
we can't ruin someone else's life

378
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,610
just to change our own.

379
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,510
You're right.

380
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,530
So I think

381
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,610
it's time to return Su Yin's body to him.

382
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
With his abilities,

383
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,010
maybe he can still turn things around.

384
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,570
You mean

385
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,930
you're saying goodbye to me?

386
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,490
I've come back this time

387
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,490
to make up for my regrets.

388
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,340
I've understood my own issues.

389
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,220
I believe you won't make the same mistakes again.

390
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,170
You won't get back together with Feng Huanan.

391
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,410
My task is complete.

392
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,970
If you leave,

393
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,180
I'll be all alone again.

394
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,250
Even though we've fought so much,

395
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,290
I've gotten used to having you by my side.

396
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,570
You still have Jiang,

397
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,610
and Lin Xi.

398
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,460
You'll meet many people who love you.

399
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,930
You're already

400
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,210
a very strong person now.

401
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,180
Without me,

402
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,280
you can still go far.

403
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,930
There's someone

404
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,450
who needs me more than you do right now.

405
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,450
I can't stand seeing her fight the illness alone.

406
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,850
Even if I can't keep her,

407
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,290
I need to go back

408
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,330
and walk with her till the end.

409
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,930
Are you talking about Doudou?

410
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,660
Does she look like you?

411
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,790
No.

412
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,340
Does she look like me?

413
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,210
Well, how should I put it?

414
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,370
She's very cute.

415
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,050
She has a round face,

416
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,570
round eyes, and...

417
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,690
Well...

418
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,130
Do you have paper and pen?

419
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:00,850
I'll draw her for you.

420
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,310
She looks just like I did when I was a child.

421
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,090
After I go back,

422
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,670
I'll tell her

423
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,590
that you've seen her.

424
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,810
Older Gu Nian,

425
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,610
did you know

426
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,620
how to go back all along?

427
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,180
But you stayed here because you were

428
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,530
worried about me and Mom?

429
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,690
Well, not that early.

430
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,370
Remember when Jiang

431
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,730
found the initial version of the Revisit Project

432
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,370
from Su Yin's computer?

433
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,570
Jiang didn't say anything at the time,

434
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,860
but later he told me

435
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,290
that he tried it himself

436
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,810
and nothing happened.

437
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,730
Afterward, he cracked a password

438
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,780
and then told me

439
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,610
those glasses were

440
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,380
the medium Su Yin left for me.

441
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,060
Gu Nian,

442
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,950
take good care of yourself.

443
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,430
Boss,

444
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,150
are you really going back?

445
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,350
It's so sudden.

446
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,720
I'm kind of reluctant to see you go.

447
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,290
Don't worry.

448
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,320
In that timeline,

449
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,250
you'll still be like a little bee,

450
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,250
buzzing around me every day.

451
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,240
I won't lose you.

452
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,010
Alright then.

453
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,140
Okay,

454
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,730
since it's all decided,

455
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,720
let's begin.

456
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,480
Wait.

457
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,370
No matter which timeline we're in,

458
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,270
we'll meet again.

459
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,550
Goodbye, Gu Nian.

460
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,810
Take good care of yourself.

461
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,650
Thank you,

462
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,370
Future Gu Nian.

463
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,650
Jiang,

464
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,380
I'm leaving Gu Nian in your hands.

465
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,590
Take good care of her.

466
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,170
You're back.

467
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,050
I'm very busy, you know.

468
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,490
Go ahead.

469
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,410
Do you want to choose again?

470
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,250
How did you know?

471
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,050
You're not the first,

472
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,310
and certainly not the last.

473
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,930
As the most professional in personalized insurance,

474
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,570
we prioritize customer satisfaction.

475
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,070
We can offer you this chance

476
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,050
to choose again.

477
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,170
You call yourselves professional?

478
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,850
The last time I went back,

479
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,170
I got my gender wrong.

480
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,490
That was your own choice.

481
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,570
It had nothing to do with us.

482
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,890
It was so urgent at that time.

483
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,890
I was completely dazed.

484
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,210
How could I make the right choice?

485
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,850
Wasn't it a good choice?

486
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,290
Your life

487
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,730
has already changed dramatically,

488
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,450
and it's moving in a better direction.

489
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,970
What kind of change?

490
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,970
It shows that your

491
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,700
life countdown has been paused.

492
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,420
Your life has been extended.

493
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,220
What about other people's lives?

494
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,570
What about Su Yin and Jiang Ze?

495
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,300
Well, about that...

496
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,210
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

497
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,050
What about Doudou?

498
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,550
Has Doudou's life been extended?

499
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,740
You can only choose your own life.

500
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,250
Are you sure you want to go back?

501
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,450
I'm sure.

502
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,450
I want to go back

503
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,090
and face our lives with Doudou.

504
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,530
Do it.

505
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,080
[Do you want to go back to the past?]

506
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,660
[No]

507
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,180
March 11, 2025.

508
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,510
They only gave me one month.

509
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,720
Doudou should be undergoing immunotherapy now.

510
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,820
I should be at the hospital.

511
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,380
You're finally awake.

512
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,490
How much did you drink?

513
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,900
You slept the whole morning.

514
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,170
Don't drink so much next time.

515
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,100
Jiang, why did I drink?

516
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,690
Last night at the celebration party,

517
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,650
you and Su Yin were drinking red wine non-stop.

518
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,780
We couldn't stop you.

519
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,900
You forgot?

520
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,450
No, what celebration party?

521
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,690
Why would I drink?

522
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,530
You can even forget things before you drink?

523
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,170
The Time Tunnel launch event.

524
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,090
Afterward, we all went to the celebration party.

525
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,760
You forgot?

526
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,890
Wait a moment.

527
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,210
Where is this place?

528
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,120
Oh, boy.

529
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,050
This is your office.

530
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,170
My office?

531
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,610
What's my position here?

532
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,300
Gu Nian, CEO.

533
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,850
CEO?

534
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,370
I'm the CEO?

535
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,210
Don't shout. Everyone in the company knows.

536
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Feng Huanan.

537
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,000
Didn't you say I could only be a housewife?

538
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:38,930
Look,

539
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,770
I, Gu Nian, can not only work,

540
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,820
but also be the CEO.

541
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,020
Jiang,

542
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,530
how much is my annual salary here?

543
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,890
That's not something we should inquire about.

544
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,100
The whole company belongs to you and Su Yin.

545
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,640
You mean

546
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,770
this company belongs to Su Yin and me?

547
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,290
Well,

548
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,460
you can give it to me if you want.

549
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,700
Is this car key mine?

550
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,970
Yes.

551
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,810
Where are you going?

552
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,080
Why play dumb with me?

553
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,530
Yuan.

554
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,160
Doudou, Doudou. Where did she go?

555
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,770
Are you crazy or what?
