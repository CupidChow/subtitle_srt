[Episode 9]

3
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,640
[I believe it now. You're the future me.]

4
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,160
President?

5
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,280
You're here.

6
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
Sit for a bit.

7
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,040
It'll be ready soon.

8
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,840
This is the crispy pork lard

9
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,479
that I fried just before you arrived.

10
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,080
Try some.

11
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,050
It's really good.

12
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,800
This place is really nice.

13
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,280
How did you find this place?

14
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
One of my classmate's uncles helped me find this place.

15
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,720
Since I'm hosting you as an honored guest,

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
I had to go for the highest standard.

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,440
I found a place with a slightly better environment.

18
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
I'm doing the cooking myself today.

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,160
If the food doesn't taste good,

20
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,490
please bear with me.

21
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,040
Don't mind it.

22
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,079
I'll definitely appreciate it.

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,800
As they say,

24
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
the highest standard of hospitality is a home-cooked meal.

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,420
President, I didn't know you could cook.

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,720
I can't make the fancy dishes,

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,600
but I can manage some

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
local specialty dishes.

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,400
These ingredients

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,450
were all just bought fresh from the market.

31
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,930
They're very fresh. Don't worry.

32
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,500
What's this?

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,840
Oh, this?

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,850
These two have quite a story.

35
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,680
Let me tell you,

36
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,160
this is the pickled chili pepper that my mom made.

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,150
Smell it.

38
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,560
Good, isn't it?

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,680
This is the pickled radish that my mom made.

40
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,110
These are what make this dish special.

41
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,410
There are about ten other ingredients.

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,200
It's quite complex.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,050
Then wrap them all in a freshly made pancake

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,000
with the traditional secret spicy chili dipping sauce.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've already prepared the dough for you.

46
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,840
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,150
I'm here to help.

48
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Jiang Ze just gave me a good scolding.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,990
Said I was being petty,

50
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,760
needed to be more generous,

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,840
and learn from our President.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320
So I rushed over here

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,280
to be free labor

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
to show my apologies.

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
How did you know I was going to make Shredded Baby Rolls?

56
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,250
Isn't this your specialty?

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,000
Let me help you.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,020
No, no, no need.

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,890
You don't know how to make it.

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,800
Just sit down.

61
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,230
President,

62
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,900
why is this called Shredded Baby Rolls?

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,880
About the name,

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
there are actually two folk stories.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
The first one is that...

66
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,420
A farmer found an abandoned baby girl

67
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,360
and was afraid that he couldn't keep her alive,

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,400
so he gathered many ingredients from the villagers,

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,400
cut them into thin strips,

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,240
wrapped them in thin pancakes, and fed them to the child.

71
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,810
Can you not interrupt?

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,079
Well, he's right.

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,760
There's actually a second story.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
There was once a woman

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,440
who was infertile and sought various ways to conceive a child everywhere.

76
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,730
Her husband went to a temple to pray for a child.

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,960
Then the monk at the temple

78
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,280
told him this recipe.

79
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,040
Then his wife asked,

80
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
"What is this recipe called?"

81
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,040
Her husband, knowing how desperate she was for a child,

82
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,200
said, "This is called Shredded Baby Rolls."

83
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,399
Afterward, they indeed had a big, chubby boy.

84
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,180
That's how it came about.

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
That's quite interesting, huh?

86
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,839
Yes.

87
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,290
Actually, there's an even deeper meaning to this.

88
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,960
It's the family's

89
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
-longing and hope for you children
-Longing and hope for you children

90
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,200
-who have left home.
-who have left home.

91
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,430
You even know about that?

92
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,040
Let me help chop the vegetables.

93
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,800
You can roll out the dough.

94
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,600
What's left to chop?

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,240
Can't you see?

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,000
I've already finished.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Once we roll out this dough, it'll be ready to eat.

98
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,600
I've chopped the mung bean sprouts,

99
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,750
seaweed, pickled radish,

100
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,480
cucumber, cabbage...

101
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,460
Fish mint...

102
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,680
celery, fern,

103
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,080
cold noodles, crispy soybeans, and crispy pork lard.

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,990
Su Yin, how did you know?

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,200
I used to make this dish...

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,000
for someone for seven years.

107
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,260
I've lost my appetite.

108
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
I don't want to eat anymore.

109
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,580
President, I'm leaving first.

110
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,520
Gu Nian?

111
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,320
Gu Nian!

112
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,870
What are you doing, Su Yin?

113
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Don't you know that I invited Gu Nian to a meal today?

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
And you come here and mess everything up!

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,240
You've stolen all the spotlight!

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,320
Weren't you drunk

117
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
and telling me that you don't like her?

118
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,710
Wasn't I helping you?

119
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,490
Is this helping me? Is this helping me?

120
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,950
Enjoy your Shredded Baby Rolls.

121
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,560
Your systolic pressure is 119.

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,960
Alright, it's fine. Nothing serious.

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Wait, what did you do

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,600
to make her so angry?

125
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,480
I just helped Feng Huanan

126
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,830
make some Shredded Baby Rolls.

127
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,520
What?

128
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,570
Hold on,

129
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,000
before you explain the condition to the doctor,

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,440
can you at least tell the backstory?

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
The doctor isn't omniscient, you know.

132
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,110
Lin Xi.

133
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,760
I believe it now.

134
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,680
He is my future self.

135
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,740
That sudden?

136
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,080
Wait, what did you do

137
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,280
to make her believe you?

138
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,159
Feng Huanan was making me a dish from his hometown in Guizhou.

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,480
As soon as he started talking,

140
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,040
Su Yin knew every detail

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,200
and the story behind it.

142
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,470
He has foreseen it all.

143
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,360
That's quite a sudden change of heart, huh?

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,720
No.

145
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,909
When you mentioned that the password was Gu's birthday,

146
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,200
I couldn't hold it together anymore.

147
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,850
I was just using time

148
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,620
to give myself a moment to process.

149
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,180
Plus, everything from your handwriting to the Shredded Baby Rolls

150
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,390
and those little mannerisms of yours—

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
all match up.

152
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,240
I can't help but believe it.

153
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,280
Gu Nian, your intelligence is finally online.

154
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,200
But I still feel like there's a bug in all of this.

155
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
What bug?

156
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,560
On the way back,

157
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,280
didn't I explain everything clearly to you?

158
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,000
Back then, it all started

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
when I had that meal with him.

160
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
He personally made this dish

161
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,680
and told me these stories.

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,960
After we got married, he loved eating the dish,

163
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,490
so I made it for him for seven years.

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But none of what you said has happened.

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
And there was an unexpected incident

166
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
at the nursing home that you didn't anticipate.

167
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,500
Even...

168
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,920
my feelings for him... aren't that intense.

169
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,390
Let me sort this out.

170
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,280
You didn't go to the cafeteria for soup,

171
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,140
didn't have dinner with him because of your birthday,

172
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,159
and didn't kiss.

173
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,830
The balloons and banner were from me,

174
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,670
and you didn't get the lead role.

175
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,670
You had an accident at the nursing home.

176
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,310
Could the ending really have changed?

177
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,020
You're here.

178
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
I thought you couldn't drink.

179
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
Why are you drinking alone now?

180
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,850
Tu.

181
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,039
I'm sorry for putting you through that today.

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,760
So, you do know you put me through something.

183
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,240
Then why did you tell Su Yin

184
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
about our relationship?

185
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,560
That guy Su Yin

186
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,560
beat me up out of nowhere the other day.

187
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,000
I had no choice.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,200
So I told him everything.

189
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,430
I told him that we were together.

190
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,540
But I didn't know you'd mind my telling him.

191
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,460
It's not that I mind.

192
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,880
It's just that I think

193
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,960
it's not the right time yet.

194
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,050
You know, Tu,

195
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm not someone who easily

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,760
opens up to others.

197
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,760
I don't want to keep our relationship in the dark.

198
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,430
But if it really troubles you that much...

199
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,970
I'll go talk to Su Yin right now.

200
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,040
Alright, alright, alright.

201
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,800
Don't go.

202
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,610
Sit down.

203
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,340
Sit down first!

204
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,350
I understand your feelings now.

205
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,030
It's not that I mind.

206
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,390
I just think

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,560
we should keep a low profile for now.

208
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,760
What do you think?

209
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,380
Keeping a low profile is good. I understand.

210
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,600
Did you make all of these?

211
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,650
Yes.

212
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,310
After all, Gu Nian arranged the performance at the Wellness Center.

213
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,480
So I had no choice

214
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
but to intentionally praise her

215
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,720
in front of everyone,

216
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,480
even overlooking your contributions.

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
And I didn't dare to

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,240
pay extra attention to you in front of others.

219
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Why are you saying all of this?

220
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm not a little girl anymore.

221
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,470
I won't care about those things.

222
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,880
I know you don't care,

223
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,870
but for this meal today,

224
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,680
I specially went to the market early to buy groceries.

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,240
I put in so much effort

226
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
to find this venue.

227
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,400
I spent so much energy and money.

228
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,440
And Gu Nian... She just decided she wasn't going to eat and left.

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
And that Su Yin,

230
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,400
he came and stirred up trouble.

231
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,080
After causing a mess,

232
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,670
he just left without a care.

233
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,060
For those of us who come from the mountains,

234
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
we can't stand food going to waste.

235
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,190
It pains me to see all these.

236
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,710
It's okay.

237
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,140
If they don't eat, I will.

238
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
Shredded Baby Rolls.

239
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,120
Shredded Baby Rolls.

240
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,240
Missing our babies.

241
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,040
Mama misses her baby.

242
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,150
And the child misses home.

243
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,880
Delicious.

244
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,320
Don't be like this.

245
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
The more you act like this, the more it breaks my heart.

246
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,440
What's heartbreaking about this?

247
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,360
For people like us,

248
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
we have thicker skin compared to others.

249
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,520
After weathering storms,

250
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,680
we've gained another layer of armor.

251
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,160
This is how we become stronger and stronger,

252
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,080
right?

253
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,470
Yes.

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
But the more you act like this,

255
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,040
the more vulnerabilities you'll develop.

256
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,510
It's really delicious.

257
00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,880
Huanan,

258
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,600
are you alright?

259
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,120
I'll eat it myself.

260
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,490
Don't be upset anymore.

261
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,590
It's okay.

262
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Here, this is yours.

263
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,510
Why did you print my resume?

264
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Since the ending has been completely rewritten,

265
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,280
from now on,

266
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,240
your world and Feng Huanan

267
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,320
have nothing to do with each other anymore.

268
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,200
Our next step is to

269
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,400
make you a rising star in the workplace.

270
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,440
You're really funny.

271
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,200
You've been a housewife for seven years,

272
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,090
and you're trying to be my career counsellor.

273
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,990
You're not being precise with your words.

274
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,680
I've worked before, you know?

275
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Although it was only for a brief period.

276
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,090
Lin Xi,

277
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,870
he didn't even give me a single day to heal from my broken heart.

278
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,490
I actually think he, like this,

279
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,280
is more like Gu Nian than you are.

280
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,440
Look at you;

281
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
you've always been so quick and decisive

282
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,920
in everything you do,

283
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,000
never dragging your feet.

284
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,640
How come when it comes to matters of the heart,

285
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,520
you get all sticky and indecisive?

286
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,000
Seeing you like this now

287
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,540
makes me want to date even less.

288
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,160
This was my first love.

289
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,080
It was nipped in the bud

290
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,550
before I even got to taste its sweetness.

291
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm not stopping you from having a real relationship.

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,280
Jiang Ze or Gao Ren, take your pick.

293
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,720
Bah, life is short.

294
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,430
Even if my future is tragic,

295
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,550
I still want to experience

296
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,800
that feeling of happiness being with my dream man.

297
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,290
But you severed this fate between him and me directly.

298
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,100
I really can't escape the fate

299
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,000
that graduation inevitably leads to a breakup.

300
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,000
Stop being so romance-obsessed.

301
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,880
If it can be severed so easily, it wasn't meant to be.

302
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,670
It's an ill-fated relationship!

303
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
Come on, let's get down to business.

304
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,410
This company is not bad.

305
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,800
A future listed company.

306
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,400
The two companies below are no good.

307
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,870
Although they seem promising now,

308
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,880
they'll go bust in a few years.

309
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,950
The bosses will jump off the buildings.

310
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,680
Your next step...

311
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,680
is to save for a down payment as soon as possible

312
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,330
and buy an apartment in this part of the old town area.

313
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,800
Even my grandparents wouldn't live in

314
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,210
the old apartments in this area.

315
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,640
Who mentioned anything about asking you to move there?

316
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,120
It'll be demolished in a few years.

317
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,240
Once you get the demolition compensation,

318
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,920
immediately buy an apartment downtown.

319
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,940
The apartment will appreciate substantially,

320
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,400
and it's far away from the neighborhood that Feng Huanan wants to buy.

321
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,480
Can I invest in this too?

322
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,920
Of course, you can.

323
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,840
Xi, if you put it that way,

324
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,640
let me think about it.

325
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,480
Xi, don't buy in downtown.

326
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,120
Buy an apartment here,

327
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,920
Taoyuan New Residence Villas.

328
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,800
The environment there is good with an elderly care center.

329
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,510
It's suitable for you to live with your mom.

330
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,680
That won't work. It's too far from my hospital.

331
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,970
It's better to be far away.

332
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,550
Stay at the hospital when you're working,

333
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,240
and completely relax when you're off work.

334
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,350
Trust me, it's the right choice.

335
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,000
Lin Xi, don't you think

336
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,110
he looks like

337
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,960
he's settling his final affairs?

338
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,830
Kind of.

339
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,640
Since the ending has completely changed,

340
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,960
there's no need for me to stay here anymore.

341
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
You want me gone completely...

342
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,160
and I'll give you what you want.

343
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,800
You're going back to the future?

344
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,560
If you're going back,

345
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,920
could you take me with you to see it?

346
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,200
That may be a bit difficult.

347
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,120
I haven't found my way back yet.

348
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,410
But before that,

349
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,730
I need to search for

350
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,200
an answer to a question that has always been bothering me.

351
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,200
That won't do. If you're leaving,

352
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,650
who's going to play that old geezer who crashes into the tree?

353
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,790
Gao Ren, of course.

354
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,120
We've spent the money, so we might as well make the most of it.

355
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,360
Eat it. Eat it.

356
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,220
No, no.

357
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,870
I'll eat.

358
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
Feng Huanan.

359
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,750
I hope that the beginning of our ill-fated relationship back then

360
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,220
is the end of the current Gu Nian's intersection with you now.

361
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
Don't tickle me!

362
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,710
Why are you running so fast?

363
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,480
I won't tickle you, I won't!

364
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,880
Be careful. Don't fall.

365
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,680
Really?

366
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,350
Let's go.

367
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,680
Stop right there. Don't run!

368
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,280
Don't run!

369
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,560
I won't. I won't!

370
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,250
This isn't over yet.

371
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,150
Still awake?

372
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,760
Were you asleep?

373
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
How can I sleep with you beside me?

374
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,280
Tu.

375
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,000
It's been so, so long...

376
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,080
since I've wanted to

377
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,040
plan a future with someone like this.

378
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,240
In all my previous plans,

379
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,350
it was all about myself,

380
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,960
just me and no one else.

381
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,080
Because of you,

382
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,060
all my plans have been th-th-thrown into chaos.

383
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
What's so chaotic about it?

384
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,750
Later, when we walk out of this door

385
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,400
and put on our clothes,

386
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,240
nothing will have changed.

387
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,630
We'll go back to our own normal lives.

388
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,000
How could nothing have changed?

389
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,630
A love without financial support

390
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,570
will run into problems sooner or later.

391
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,670
You may not think so now,

392
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,640
but when you step out of school

393
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,050
and into society,

394
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,960
everything from food, clothing, shelter, and transportation

395
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,360
will cost money.

396
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,550
I'm a rational person.

397
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
Anyway, I'll say this upfront:

398
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,070
I don't have the courage right now...

399
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,160
to be in a relationship with you.

400
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,640
But I want to be responsible for you.

401
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,760
Really?

402
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,920
Of course.

403
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,020
If I really wanted to find someone

404
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,440
who I could cling to every day

405
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,180
and force to be responsible for me,

406
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,830
why would I pick you?

407
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,100
You think my family is poor?

408
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,380
You think I'm not good enough?

409
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,760
Of course not.

410
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,090
I know you too well.

411
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
I know what you want.

412
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,080
Actually, we're quite similar sometimes.

413
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,800
The road ahead of us is long.

414
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,400
How can we find a shortcut so quickly?

415
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,150
So asking you to take responsibility for me before graduation

416
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,830
would be too much pressure on you.

417
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,590
If there's pressure, we'll bear it together.

418
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,600
You might not mind,

419
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,160
but I can't not care.

420
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,190
Tu, you know what?

421
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,160
You've given me so much, so much happiness.

422
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,440
So much happiness.

423
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,120
I can't bear to let go of you.

424
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,280
I just hope that tonight...

425
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,350
to be the fireworks when we're deeply in love,

426
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,050
not the shackles that bind you.

427
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,560
What if I'm willing

428
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
for you to become my shackles?

429
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,350
Really?

430
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,190
Of course.

431
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,240
Alright.

432
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,580
I get it.

433
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,730
I'll make our relationship official tomorrow.

434
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,480
No.

435
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,400
I'll do it now.

436
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
I'll call Gu Nian right now.

437
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,240
You're being naughty, aren't you?

438
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,610
Being naughty, huh?

439
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,970
You're not afraid at all

440
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
of ruining your friendship with your bestie, huh?

441
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,310
What do you mean?

442
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,730
You know that she likes you, don't you?

443
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,140
I can sense a little, at least.

444
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,620
But I really didn't expect

445
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,550
that you two were such close friends.

446
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,590
Back in our freshman year,

447
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,220
she didn't have many friends.

448
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,340
I didn't have any friends either.

449
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,560
So we became really good friends.

450
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,600
Are you secretly dieting behind my back?

451
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,800
How could I?

452
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,470
If I were on a diet, would I buy so much food?

453
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
She's been out all night every day since her freshman year.

454
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,360
What kind of person is she?

455
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,040
Always hanging out at karaoke bars.

456
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,440
Who knows what diseases she may bring back?

457
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,900
I must be cursed to end up with her as a roommate!

458
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,060
I'm not exaggerating at all, really.

459
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,690
You'd better buy some disinfectant

460
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,080
and wipe everything down every day.

461
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,530
What are you guys talking about?

462
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,120
I'll tear your mouths apart if you don't shut up.

463
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,460
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

464
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
I'm just being too nice to them!

465
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,800
Alright, alright.

466
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,490
Why are you getting so angry?

467
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,530
What are you looking at? Eat your food!

468
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,220
It's okay. She's actually a pretty nice person.

469
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,380
She's just a bit hot-headed.

470
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,430
Let's eat. Let's eat.

471
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,600
Sit down.

472
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,360
Don't be angry anymore.

473
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,200
Don't touch me.

474
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
We're in public!

475
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,200
Tu, listen,

476
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,720
don't take

477
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,080
what they say to heart.

478
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,800
There's no shame in earning money through your own abilities.

479
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,040
Slandering others is what's shameful.

480
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,080
They have no manners at all.

481
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,440
I don't care about what they say.

482
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,930
They can say whatever they want.

483
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,400
The more you care, the more they'll act out.

484
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,040
I only care about the people I care about.

485
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,960
Put it on properly.

486
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,510
This is improper.

487
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,120
♫Never let it go♫

488
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,250
♫Time to let it show♫

489
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,200
♫Set my heart on light♫

490
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,850
♫We are shining bright♫

491
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,610
♫Vertigo, vertigo, vertigo♫

492
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,040
Nian?

493
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,030
What's the matter?

494
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
Close your eyes.

495
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,450
Three,

496
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,360
two.

497
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,030
one.

498
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,540
Since then,

499
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,190
she often talked to me about her father.

500
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,690
I frequently told her about my mother.

501
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,290
Then we grew closer and closer,

502
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,290
closer and closer.

503
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,520
So, I don't dare tell her

504
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,920
that we're together.

505
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,840
I'm afraid it might hurt her.

506
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
I see.

507
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,450
What do you want to do?

508
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
I'll do whatever you say.

509
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,300
Everything else doesn't matter to me,

510
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,990
but I'm a bit greedy about this one matter.

511
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
I want both you

512
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,310
and my bestie.

513
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,910
But now we have to keep it a secret from her.

514
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,600
Let's see how it goes.

515
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,910
If we go our separate ways in the future,

516
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,380
let's find a chance to tell them.

517
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,080
It's just that you might have to make some sacrifices.

518
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,830
You really are quite greedy.

519
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm not sacrificing anything.

520
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,200
As long as you're not making sacrifices,

521
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,440
then I'm not making sacrifices either.

522
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,350
In this lifetime,

523
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,910
I, Feng Huanan, will do just one thing,

524
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,400
and that is to do everything in my power...

525
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,320
to give you what you want.

526
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,360
Nian.

527
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,900
Lyu Tu,

528
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,620
you haven't been back these past few days.

529
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,120
I was worried sick about you.

530
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,110
What are you worried about?

531
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,880
I was thinking that the holiday is coming soon,

532
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,400
so I wanted to earn more money to enjoy a wonderful New Year with my dad.

533
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,740
This is too hard on you.

534
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,800
You have to work part-time

535
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
and come here for rehearsals.

536
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,510
Are you getting enough sleep?

537
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,560
I was just about to talk to you about this.

538
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,160
Why don't you play the female lead?

539
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,150
I can just play a tree.

540
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,980
You see, I don't even have time to rest.

541
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
If you play the female lead,

542
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,000
I could catch some sleep here

543
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,870
during rehearsals when I'm free.

544
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,340
You sleeping here?

545
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,750
Come on, no way.

546
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,930
You should go home now,

547
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,280
remove your makeup, take a shower, and get a good night's sleep.

548
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,480
I'll cover for you in the rehearsal.

549
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,350
President.

550
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,360
Okay, I'll listen to you.

551
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,920
Perfect timing.

552
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,440
I just suggested Nian

553
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,470
take the female lead,

554
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,880
and I can just play that tree.

555
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,320
Keep the role for me, okay?

556
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,010
Fine, there's no one else but you anyway.

557
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,440
I'm off then.

558
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,020
Get some more sleep when you're home.

559
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:32,860
Gu Nian.

560
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,590
I want to go to the Wellness Center in advance to check out the venue.

561
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,520
I need to check the scenery and props and such

562
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,000
and see if there's anything that needs adjusting.

563
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,770
And then visit Uncle Wang while I'm there.

564
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,800
Don't you think we

565
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,450
should give him a heads-up?

566
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
There's no need.

567
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,440
If you need any materials,

568
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,560
I can have Uncle Wang send them directly to me.

569
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,750
You don't need to go in person.

570
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,020
The materials are important,

571
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,330
but it's more important that I go there in person.

572
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,880
They're giving us this opportunity

573
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,160
out of respect for your mother.

574
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,950
As the president of the club,

575
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,670
if I don't go there in advance

576
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,390
and your mother finds out later,

577
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,240
she'll criticize me.

578
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,880
She'll say, "Your classmate is so inconsiderate."

579
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,590
Right?

580
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,000
You're right.

581
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,790
This time, I want to show my mom

582
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,990
that we've thought of everything.

583
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,620
Exactly.

584
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,170
Otherwise, she'll keep saying I'm just a kid.

585
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,430
Also, Uncle Wang has helped us so much.

586
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,920
Both out of courtesy and obligation,

587
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,840
we should show our appreciation, right?

588
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,190
Gu Nian, you know Uncle Wang better.

589
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,420
What do you think we should give him?

590
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,040
Here's what we'll do. I'll take care of it.

591
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,200
You don't need to worry about it.

592
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,260
Alright then, I'll listen to you, Ms. Gu.

593
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,490
Give me a hand.

594
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,130
Let me do it.

595
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
You're good at this.

596
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,170
It's been a few days since I last saw you,

597
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,490
and your skills have improved.

598
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,960
That proves I'm dexterous.

599
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,890
Guo Yongcheng, don't you dare run!

600
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,810
I'll break your leg!

601
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,240
Sit properly!

602
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,000
Eat your rice noodles!

603
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,800
I won't eat.

604
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,980
Eat your rice noodles!

605
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,950
You little brat, eat quickly!

606
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,440
Would you like some noodles?

607
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,760
The prices are listed up there.

608
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,560
Choose for yourself.

609
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,880
Hello, I'm Feng Huanan's friend.

610
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,440
Hello, hello, hello.

611
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,680
He asked me to bring you something.

612
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
That kid is Guo Yongcheng, right?

613
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,900
Yes, he's my little brother.

614
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,220
I'm Guo Yongfang.

615
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,870
I know. Feng Huanan calls you Fang.

616
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,870
He even mentioned me to you?

617
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,880
That's nice.

618
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,320
Your rice noodles look delicious.

619
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,080
Can I have a bowl?

620
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,720
Sure, have a seat.

621
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,150
Okay.

622
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,860
Sit down.

623
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,240
Coming right up.

624
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,570
Thank you.

625
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,630
This is for you.

626
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,880
How did you know that I like balloons?

627
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,840
It's a secret.

628
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,760
Just kidding.

629
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,470
I did my homework.

630
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,260
Do you like it?

631
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,810
It's beautiful.

632
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,080
Actually, I came here...

633
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,960
to apologize to you.

634
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,990
Apologize?

635
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,740
It's about the birthday gift I gave you.

636
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,810
That bead bracelet.

637
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,680
The truth is, it wasn't

638
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,400
made by me and the children from the orphanage.

639
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,350
I bought it near the school.

640
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,960
Because on that day,

641
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,680
I was quite harsh when speaking to you,

642
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,370
and my attitude wasn't very good either.

643
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,320
I kept thinking about how to make it up to you.

644
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,630
Then in the evening, I found out

645
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,130
that your birthday was coming up soon,

646
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,180
so I desperately came up with

647
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,240
a bad idea.

648
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,080
Let's just forget about it.

649
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,110
I think it's perfect

650
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,720
for Uncle Wang's wife. A scarf.

651
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,550
This is so beautiful.

652
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,450
Gu Nian.

653
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
You have such great taste.

654
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,520
Won't you come with me then?

655
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
I haven't memorized

656
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,680
any of the female lead's lines yet.

657
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,840
I still need to go back and memorize them hard.

658
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,970
Go ahead and drink. I already ordered.

659
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,090
Thank you.

660
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,320
Thank you for the scarf.

661
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,510
It's nothing.

662
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,770
Boy, would you like some chili sauce in it?

663
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,050
Just a little bit.

664
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,640
Okay.

665
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,600
There aren't many customers at this time, huh?

666
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,440
Right.

667
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,090
We're usually busier during lunchtime.

668
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,090
Here you go.

669
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,460
Thank you, thank you.

670
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,550
Please enjoy.

671
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,760
You're not busy now.

672
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,720
Why don't you sit down and let's chat for a while?

673
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,010
Sure, sure.

674
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,350
How's Huanan doing?

675
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,220
Will he be back in about six months?

676
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,950
He's about to graduate.

677
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,670
That's great.

678
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,970
Does Huanan have many friends at school?

679
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,040
He has a lot of friends at school.

680
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,800
He's the president of our drama club.

681
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,480
He's in charge of quite a few people.

682
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,030
Really?

683
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:58,910
Oh, right.

684
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,160
This is the money he asked me to bring you.

685
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,350
Thank you, thank you.

686
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,880
Does he often send money here?

687
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,850
Yes.

688
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,600
In our place, we cover our noses when it's sunny

689
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,240
and roll up our pants when it rains.

690
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,680
Our livelihood depends on the whims of nature.

691
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,430
It's been years since we've had a genius like Huanan.

692
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,050
When Auntie Feng knows about it,

693
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,400
she'll be overjoyed again.

694
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,060
I'll take it to her in a bit.

695
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,150
So, every time he sends money to Guo Yongcheng,

696
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,500
you always pass it on to his mother, right?

697
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,620
We don't draw lines between what's his and what's mine.

698
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,850
We grew up together.

699
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,840
When he finishes college and comes back,

700
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,800
we can get married.

701
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,120
He's saving up for our bride price.

702
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,710
I give it to Auntie Feng.

703
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,770
Isn't that just taking care of my future mother-in-law?

704
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,310
So, you're not his childhood friend.

705
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,670
You're his fiancée?

706
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,120
Auntie Feng says...

707
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,290
I'm pretty much like her own daughter.

708
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,790
This is quite spicy.

709
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:04,940
I forgot.

710
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,690
Our chili sauce isn't ordinary, huh?

711
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,550
Yes.

712
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,490
Thank you.

713
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,840
Ma'am, one bowl of rice noodles, please.

714
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,880
You... you go ahead and get busy.

715
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,800
I'll get back to work first.

716
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,430
Alright.

717
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,280
Wait for me a moment, okay?

718
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,080
Will you marry me?

719
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,240
I do.
