[I'm the Other "Other Woman"]

4
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,880
Hello.

5
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,020
I'm looking for Manager Wang.

6
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,590
I have an appointment with Manager Wang to discuss something.

7
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,630
Give him a call

8
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,310
and confirm it.

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,250
Alright, please wait a moment.

10
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,670
Mr. Wang,

11
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,180
it's Feng.

12
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,820
Yes, I'm already

13
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,340
at the entrance

14
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,120
of the wellness center.

15
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,789
Feng, I have a meeting right now.

16
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,490
Can you wait for me for a bit at the garden

17
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,720
of Building No.1?

18
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,690
Sure, sure, no problem.

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
Please go ahead with your work.

20
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,380
You made that move.

21
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,070
I'll place it here.

22
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,980
You took too long to think.

23
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,540
Don't say anything.

24
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,750
Be quiet while watching a game.

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,940
Li.

26
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,020
What's wrong?

27
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,480
Now you're in trouble.

28
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,030
You're in deep trouble now.

29
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,550
Those shiny black eyes...

30
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,000
I lost to you again.

31
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,010
Alright, I'm done playing.

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,910
Come on.

33
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm not playing anymore.

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,070
There's still hope.

35
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,220
What hope?

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,680
If I keep playing, I'll just keep losing.

37
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,960
Li,

38
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,520
call Wang over.

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,300
I want to play a few rounds with him to get my fix.

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,760
Okay.

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,430
Wang, go play a few rounds over there.

42
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,820
Alright, alright, I'll go over when we finish here.

43
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,090
I lose every time.

44
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,950
Do you know how to play?

45
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,430
I know a little.

46
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,090
Then what are we waiting for?

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,170
Come on.

48
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,730
Let's have some fun, come on.

49
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,230
Alright.

50
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,950
Young man,

51
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,120
how good are you at chess?

52
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,980
It's alright, I guess.

53
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,790
I know a bit, just the basics.

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,910
In this courtyard,

55
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,700
I'm the king of this.

56
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
Sometimes,

57
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,350
I even play against myself.

58
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,810
You're really at a high level.

59
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,790
It's called

60
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,590
"attacking with one's own spear against one's own shield"—

61
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,260
it's like a battle with yourself.

62
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
Just like chess,

63
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,270
sometimes,

64
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,910
our greatest opponent

65
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,150
might just be ourselves.

66
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,670
I didn't expect you to be so insightful

67
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,750
at such a young age.

68
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:53,750
You flatter me.

69
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,070
But when you play against me,

70
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,870
no taking back moves.

71
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,340
Don't worry, sir.

72
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,350
I never take back my moves.

73
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,630
Then let's begin.

74
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,190
You go first.

75
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,060
Then I'll respectfully obey.

76
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,920
Sir, your approach

77
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,740
is very similar

78
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,310
to what we study in economics.

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,550
In economics, what you're doing here

80
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,790
is called "retreating to advance"

81
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,270
and "cooperation for mutual benefit."

82
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,380
You, you study economics?

83
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,830
Then why are you here?

84
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,030
I'm a college student.

85
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,990
We have a drama club.

86
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,990
In a couple of days,

87
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,230
we might have a performance here.

88
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,990
I came to find the intermediary

89
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,950
to coordinate the venue.

90
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,150
You're an actor?

91
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,590
Don't I look like an actor, sir?

92
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,620
No wonder you're so handsome.

93
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,150
When I was young,

94
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,390
I wanted to be an actor too.

95
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,450
But later,

96
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,710
my dream was shattered.

97
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,750
Well, you're still in your prime, aren't you?

98
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,190
Sir,

99
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,340
when we have the performance,

100
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,450
why don't you come and watch?

101
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,030
It's a deal?

102
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,660
Of course. It's a deal and nothing can change it.

103
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,550
When I was sitting over there,

104
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,590
watching you play chess,

105
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,270
for a moment,

106
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,710
it reminded me of when I played chess with my dad when I was little.

107
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,270
Nowadays, there aren't many young people

108
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,970
who would play chess with the elderly.

109
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,500
They just go online,

110
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,790
scroll through screens, and stay up all night.

111
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,220
Sir, please don't mind me saying this,

112
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,900
but I wouldn't recommend

113
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,270
sitting for long periods like this.

114
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,670
It can easily

115
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,620
trigger heart and vascular issues.

116
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,909
I didn't expect someone as young as you

117
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,630
to know about health preservation.

118
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,070
I'm not convinced, sir.

119
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,870
Let's play another round.

120
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,420
Bring it on.

121
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,600
Today, I must challenge you.

122
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,140
Mr. Meng, you're playing chess.

123
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,900
Ah, Wang.

124
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,150
You're Feng Huanan, right?

125
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,470
My surname is Wang.

126
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,790
Uncle Wang?

127
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,590
Hello, Uncle Wang. Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,550
Nice to meet you.

129
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,750
Mr. Meng, you know each other?

130
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,030
We just met.

131
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,590
Feng is here

132
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,900
to discuss the performance venue with us.

133
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,390
Then take Feng and get to work.

134
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,180
Don't forget

135
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,420
to save me a ticket for the performance.

136
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,670
Don't worry, Mr. Meng. You'll have a seat in the first row.

137
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,110
It's a deal then.

138
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,390
You've got it.

139
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,750
Well,

140
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,230
I'll play chess with you again

141
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,660
when I have time.

142
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,510
Sure thing.

143
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,970
Go ahead.

144
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,430
Alright, I'll take him over first.

145
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,870
There's no need for the gifts.

146
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,130
Go on.

147
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:47,600
Let's go.

148
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,630
The rice noodles are here.

149
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,070
Coming.

150
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,900
Sister.

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,810
Auntie!

152
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,260
Yongcheng, take your time eating.

153
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,560
Eat more.

154
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,870
What brings you here today?

155
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,010
Missing my food?

156
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,090
I'm here to tell you some good news.

157
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,870
Isn't Huanan about to graduate?

158
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,540
He told me today

159
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,870
that he made a connection

160
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,160
with some chairman of an investment firm.

161
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,750
He's a wealthy man,

162
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,390
and he really appreciates him.

163
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,360
Oh right,

164
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,270
Auntie.

165
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,130
Huanan's classmate delivered some money over here.

166
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,710
He's here.

167
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,420
Oh.

168
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,030
Huanan's classmate?

169
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,040
Please, have a seat.

170
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,890
It's really troublesome for you.

171
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,710
Coming all this way to deliver money.

172
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,430
Thank you so much.

173
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,310
It's no trouble at all.

174
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,500
Auntie,

175
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,460
I knew Huanan was capable.

176
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,350
He's the shining star that rose from this town.

177
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,370
What is a chairman?

178
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,190
I'm not sure either.

179
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,610
What is a chairman?

180
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,750
A chairman is...

181
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,070
the highest-ranking leader.

182
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,430
The highest-ranking leader.

183
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,010
The highest.

184
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,020
The highest.

185
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,670
He said that he originally went to ask him for a favor.

186
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,040
But this big leader

187
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,810
refused to accept the gifts.

188
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,230
He even said

189
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,260
that if he needed help finding a job,

190
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,820
he'd be willing to help.

191
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,710
Huanan is really impressive.

192
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,670
Huanan is going to make a lot of money.

193
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,080
He's graduating in six months.

194
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,220
All of you are.

195
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,690
When Huanan comes back,

196
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,750
I'll handle the house and the banquet for him.

197
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,390
By then, all of you, his classmates, should come.

198
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,470
The more people, the merrier.

199
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,990
When spring comes,

200
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,429
you should go and live in the city with Huanan.

201
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,640
Don't worry about Yongcheng.

202
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,010
Leave him to me.

203
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,240
Auntie, what are you saying?

204
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,730
Of course we'll take you with us when we go to the city.

205
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,660
Me? I'm not going.

206
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,190
I'm just an old woman from the countryside.

207
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,270
If I go to the city,

208
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,620
I'll embarrass you young people

209
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,810
and hold you back.

210
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,610
Feng Huanan, you're too selfish.

211
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,090
I'm selfish?

212
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,470
All these years, I never brought my mother

213
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,470
to the city to enjoy life because I'm afraid you'd be upset!

214
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,620
At her age,

215
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,470
she still has to feed chickens and ducks in the countryside every day!

216
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,580
So, who's selfish here?

217
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,990
Who's selfish?

218
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,070
Let's get a divorce!

219
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,270
I'm used to living here.

220
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,630
The vegetable garden is right outside my door.

221
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,590
It's so inconvenient to buy things in the city.

222
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,670
Besides,

223
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,850
what about the chickens and ducks I'm raising? Leave them behind?

224
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
Even if you invite me, I won't go.

225
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,120
[The president of the school student council and drama club, Feng Huanan, courageously saved Mrs. He from the nursing home]

226
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,270
Isn't that right?

227
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,310
Thank you very much.

228
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,670
Thank you.

229
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,630
It really doesn't matter.

230
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,220
When I go back to school, I'll tell Feng Huanan

231
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,830
to find some time to come back and keep you company more often.

232
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,230
Oh no, please don't.

233
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,670
Huanan's time

234
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,790
should be spent on studying and working.

235
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,750
There're a bunch of old ladies here.

236
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,670
We pass the time quickly

237
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,630
playing mahjong together.

238
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,670
If you're not in a hurry to go back, why don't you come to our house?

239
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,350
Come on, let's go.

240
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,580
Mrs. Feng, thanks but I'm not going.

241
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,140
I have to leave now.

242
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,110
I've got something to do.

243
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,790
But you haven't finished eating.

244
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,580
I've finished.

245
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,550
Be careful.

246
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,920
Why are you in such a hurry?

247
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,610
Look at them, they're all in a rush.

248
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,430
Everyone in the city is busy.

249
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,480
Kele,

250
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,870
did you send the photo

251
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,940
of Feng Huanan saving Grandma

252
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,110
to the publicity department?

253
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,230
No, I didn't.

254
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,390
Right, I didn't even get to take any photos that day.

255
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,950
I gave Huanan

256
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,190
the only things I had.

257
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,220
Okay.

258
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,800
Oh, by the way,

259
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,950
how's your rehearsal going?

260
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,830
Why is Gu Nian, the tree, in the center?

261
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,070
Don't you know?

262
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,070
Gu Nian is playing the lead female role now.

263
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,090
The lead female role?

264
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,470
The lead female role.

265
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,550
Alright, I got it.

266
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,150
Gu Nian.

267
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,470
I love you, my dear.

268
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,460
From the first time I saw you,

269
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,150
I fell hopelessly in love with you.

270
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,190
I don't want to miss the rest of your life.

271
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,780
Will you marry me?

272
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,070
I want to share a bright life

273
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,080
and a beautiful future with you.

274
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,990
I will.

275
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,530
[Su Yin]

276
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,210
President.

277
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,710
Gu Nian.

278
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,990
A flash delivery courier outside has been looking for you for a while.

279
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,670
Take a look.

280
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,950
You didn't answer his calls.

281
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,070
President,

282
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,190
here's the quotation document

283
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,910
from last time.

284
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,630
It needs your signature.

285
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,430
Let me take a look.

286
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,510
Are you Gu Nian?

287
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,790
Here's a flash delivery document

288
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,980
that requires your signature.

289
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,680
I've called you several times, but you didn't answer.

290
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,140
Please give me the pickup code.

291
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,080
Okay.

292
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,610
Sorry,

293
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,870
I really didn't hear it just now.

294
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,510
5220.

295
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you.

296
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,670
Su Yin called me so many times.

297
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,790
What does he want this time?

298
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,390
What document?

299
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,790
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

300
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,740
I'm telling you,

301
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,590
my mom is great in every way,

302
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,110
but she's so stubborn.

303
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,750
I've told her hundreds of times

304
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,910
that the world is so big,

305
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,870
and not only her company has good jobs.

306
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,070
She insists on making me take this test.

307
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,190
It's just frustrating.

308
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,870
The Fortune 500 company application form?

309
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,350
Gu Nian,

310
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,550
are you sure you're not trying to show off?

311
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,350
I think it's just that joining the drama club

312
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,030
made you neglect your studies.

313
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,250
You're just afraid of exams.

314
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,230
Come on.

315
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,680
Who studies hard when they're about to graduate?

316
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,770
Besides,

317
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,060
if I got in through a rigged exam,

318
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,260
I'd have to work right under my mom's nose.

319
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,550
I'd have no freedom.

320
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,830
What if my colleagues find out

321
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,510
I got into the company because of my mom?

322
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,510
Our relationship would be suffocating.

323
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,830
And I told my mom about it, but she didn't listen.

324
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,380
She even said,

325
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,430
"It's all for your own good."

326
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,020
See? Not a word different.

327
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,070
[Nian, have you received the application form? Fill it now and send it over. Opportunities won't wait for anyone. It's all for your own good]

328
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,110
She's not wrong.

329
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,750
It's such a good job opportunity.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,390
If it's not for your own good, then what is it?

331
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,590
Well then, would you want

332
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,870
this kind of opportunity?

333
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,620
Of course I would.

334
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,150
I'm not afraid of exams anyway.

335
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,310
Next time you have such an opportunity,

336
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,120
tell me.

337
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,390
I'd sign up in a heartbeat.

338
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,730
Their group doesn't hire fresh graduates.

339
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,790
Even if they do, it's all pre-determined.

340
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,090
If I go like this, it'll be so embarrassing.

341
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,030
So what?

342
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,230
Opportunities are far more important than choices.

343
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,430
Even if people look down on you

344
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,020
because you're pre-determined,

345
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
so what?

346
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,710
You just need to prove yourself

347
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,870
in future opportunities.

348
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,270
One day, when you use your strength

349
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,510
to win everyone over,

350
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,510
no one will care about your background.

351
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,590
So, you should cherish

352
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,870
such a good opportunity.

353
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,430
Seize it.

354
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,470
It's not that I don't cherish it.

355
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,460
It's that I can't fall into my mom's trap.

356
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,660
If I compromise this time,

357
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,230
I'll have to compromise every time from now on.

358
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,750
I'll lose my voice.

359
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,190
I have no idea how to respond to this message.

360
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,550
Just say,

361
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,750
"Mom, I'll do my best in the exam.

362
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,660
Don't worry."

363
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,470
Then she'll definitely be happy, right?

364
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,730
Then, when it comes down to it,

365
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,030
whether or not you take the exam

366
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,110
is still up to you, right?

367
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,750
That doesn't sound like something I'd say.

368
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,430
No, no, that won't do.

369
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Just give it a try.

370
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,620
Mommy, I got it.

371
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
Stop nagging me, okay?

372
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,590
Mwah.

373
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,710
Do you know what you remind me of?

374
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,470
You're like a little kitten,

375
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,310
struggling

376
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,950
to keep your claws from showing.

377
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,270
President, you really do understand me better.

378
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,430
But to be honest,

379
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,990
I think this wellness project suits you pretty well.

380
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,910
So what?

381
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,390
Originally,

382
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,590
I thought effort

383
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,520
was more important than choice.

384
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,070
But now I realize

385
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,340
that background

386
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,650
is even more important than choice.

387
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,070
Didn't you always want to do charity work?

388
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,030
I really think you can give it a try.

389
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,150
Use what you've learned to give back to society

390
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,190
and help others.

391
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,190
I think that's really meaningful.

392
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,750
It's far more meaningful

393
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,100
than the status

394
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,150
or salary of any job.

395
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,790
What's truly important in life

396
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,470
is realizing our own value

397
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,590
and making our lives meaningful, right?

398
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,590
Don't you think so?

399
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,460
President,

400
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,100
I really should have talked to you earlier.

401
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,990
Dear Queen Dai,

402
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,630
I'm in the library.

403
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,030
You call me more often than my professor does

404
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,430
to rush me about my paper.

405
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,030
Do you think I'd be at ease

406
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,190
just because you said you understand?

407
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,460
I've been around for over 20 years;

408
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,589
how could I not know

409
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,780
your little tricks?

410
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,589
If I don't rush you, will you follow through?

411
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,780
Since you know everything anyway,

412
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,230
why did you even bother calling me?

413
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,390
Well, I just got another big project.

414
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,410
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

415
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,130
Really?

416
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,510
Well, I should congratulate you then.

417
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,540
Our Queen Dai is going further and further down the path

418
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,650
of becoming a strong, independent woman.

419
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,550
Now, besides you,

420
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,620
there's nothing else I need to worry about.

421
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,980
I promised your dad

422
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,830
I'd take good care of you.

423
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,530
Wait a minute, Mom.

424
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,990
Is this how you usually

425
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,390
persuade your subordinates?

426
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,000
Pulling the emotional card?

427
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,880
If Dad knew that after all these years,

428
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,070
you haven't made any progress

429
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,230
in dealing with me,

430
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,350
he'd definitely laugh at you.

431
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,390
If he dared to mock me,

432
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,310
do you think you'd get off easy?

433
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,850
So, that's why I'm good with my dad.

434
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,790
We have

435
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,840
a friendship forged in one trench.

436
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,430
Even he couldn't protect me

437
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,430
forever,

438
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,750
and you think you can find me a job to protect me?

439
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,080
That shouldn't be how a strong, independent woman thinks.

440
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,990
You want to go out and face hardship, huh?

441
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,910
Originally,

442
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,830
I planned to work for a few more years, then quit

443
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
and travel the world

444
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,550
with you.

445
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,790
But looking at how slowly you're making money,

446
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,590
I'm afraid there's no hope for that.

447
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,710
So what?

448
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,350
We could always travel on a budget.

449
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,520
As long as I take you

450
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,580
to see the world that Gu didn't,

451
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,670
I'll be better than him.

452
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,450
Gu Nian,

453
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,150
are you trying to get me

454
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,820
to reunite with your dad sooner?

455
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,310
Is that it?

456
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,940
Stop right there.

457
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,240
Gu has finally

458
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,950
had some peace and quiet for more than ten years.

459
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,430
I feel for him.

460
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,950
Mom,

461
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,830
give me some time to think.

462
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,050
Don't push me.

463
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,990
Pushing me will only make me rebel.

464
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,950
Well,

465
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,660
remember to eat, okay?

466
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm hanging up now.

467
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
Did you argue with your mom?

468
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,490
Worse.

469
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,480
When I was on the phone with my mom just now,

470
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,950
everything she said really hit me.

471
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,710
It was like if I don't work at their company,

472
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,470
I'll be letting both her and my dad down.

473
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,350
It's okay.

474
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,900
If you need to vent, just vent.

475
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,070
You don't need to pretend to be strong in front of me.

476
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,950
Let me take you to a good place.

477
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,610
But I haven't written my resume yet.

478
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,340
With me here,

479
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,990
are you still worried that you can't get these things done?

480
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,180
Let's go.

481
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,180
How do you like this place?

482
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,990
Aren't these lights really atmospheric?

483
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,590
Isn't it perfect for venting?

484
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,880
It's so bright here.

485
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,400
Won't it attract the security guards?

486
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,950
I'm not afraid of attracting the security guards.

487
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,390
What I'm afraid of is attracting Su Yin, that jinx.

488
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,700
That makes sense.

489
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,690
It's much quieter without him.

490
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,470
Well,

491
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,230
he cares so much about you.

492
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,910
Have you considered being with him?

493
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,380
He should never have appeared in my world.

494
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,980
I was unlucky to have met him.

495
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,930
Yes! Just meeting him is bad luck.

496
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,240
Let's not talk about him anymore.

497
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,740
Let's stop talking about that jinx.

498
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,180
I'm telling you, right now,

499
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,150
it's just you and me, no one else.

500
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,310
Whatever you want to say,

501
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,270
say it out loud.

502
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,030
Whatever you want to vent,

503
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,870
shout it out.

504
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,790
Here.

505
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,590
Cheers.

506
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,990
Cheers.

507
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,750
Let me set an example.

508
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,760
Gu!

509
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,190
I miss you!

510
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,750
Gu!

511
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,670
Gu Nian misses you!

512
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,990
Feng!

513
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,390
I miss you too!

514
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,590
Your father also...

515
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,270
At that time, I was in college.

516
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,590
My dad suddenly got a fever,

517
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,430
so he went to our small clinic for an IV.

518
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,660
You know our village.

519
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
It's pretty remote,

520
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,420
and the conditions aren't great.

521
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,130
Then, a medical accident occurred.

522
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,530
I'm telling you,

523
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,670
this can't just end like this!

524
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,990
You misdiagnosed him.

525
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,750
You killed him!

526
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,740
Stop making a scene here!

527
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:56,150
[Ningshan Village Clinic]

528
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,750
Don't get physical!

529
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,550
You killed him!

530
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,030
I've seen many people like you.

531
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,990
You only came to me because you had no money.

532
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,390
We're here saving people,

533
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,390
and now you're calling us murderers?

534
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,710
Stop talking nonsense!

535
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,060
He's dead,

536
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,380
and now you're trying to use this as leverage to extort money.

537
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,640
You shouldn't have come to me for help when he was sick.

538
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,460
If you had money, you should have gone to a big hospital!

539
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,140
Nonsense!

540
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,490
You should pay with your life for killing him!

541
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,860
Feng,

542
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,470
now that you're gone,

543
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,790
our son and I have no way to survive out here!

544
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,390
Fine, fine. I'll just say I'm unlucky.

545
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,220
Is this enough? Take it and go.

546
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,650
Leave!

547
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,660
Huanan, Huanan!

548
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,400
What are you doing? Are you going to hit me?

549
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,160
The person

550
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,230
who was on the phone asking about my well-being,

551
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,660
reminding me to study well,

552
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,000
telling me not to worry about

553
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,380
things at home just a day before,

554
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,950
was gone just like that.

555
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,510
Yeah.

556
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,480
Life is so fragile.

557
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,390
I didn't expect...

558
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,030
you're just like me.

559
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,190
When I was eleven,

560
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,190
my dad had a serious car accident while on a business trip.

561
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,310
I didn't even get to see him for the last time.

562
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,630
At that time, I messed up my middle school entrance exam.

563
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,220
My mom is a very strong person,

564
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,190
but she fainted crying several times.

565
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,870
She said that

566
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,280
if it weren't for me,

567
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,070
she would have gone with my dad.

568
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,440
So,

569
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,990
at that time, I cut my hair short,

570
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,220
started learning taekwondo,

571
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,560
riding motorcycles, and skateboarding,

572
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,630
just to become someone like my dad—

573
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,160
someone who could protect my mom

574
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,270
when I grew up.

575
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,030
No wonder.

576
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,500
No wonder you're such a tomboy.

577
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,670
Here.

578
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,070
To Gu.

579
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,530
To Feng.

580
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,830
Huanan,

581
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,670
why didn't I realize before that

582
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,990
you understand me so well?

583
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,580
Even though

584
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,110
we're different in gender

585
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,050
and background,

586
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,350
I feel like we share

587
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,630
the same point of empathy.

588
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,990
And I think,

589
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,220
sometimes, father-daughter bonds

590
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,840
can actually be stronger

591
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,190
than father-son bonds.

592
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,110
I think you're absolutely right.

593
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,550
You know,

594
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,230
when I was little,

595
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,270
I saw my dad as my hero.

596
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,470
His emotional intelligence was incredibly high.

597
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,030
Really?

598
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,190
Whenever there was

599
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,870
any conflict between my mom and me,

600
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,340
he'd always find a way to mediate

601
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,190
and make both of us feel like princesses.

602
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,110
And he was really good at so many things.

603
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,190
You know,

604
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,110
he was the one who taught me how to play basketball.

605
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,820
He's amazing.

606
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,150
He's a role model.

607
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,190
Let me test

608
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,590
how good you are.

609
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,790
I know you're great at basketball.

610
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,470
Why don't you show me?

611
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,030
Well, looks like I'm about to show off

612
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,580
in front of an expert.

613
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,030
Who are you guys?

614
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,670
Someone's coming!

615
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,670
Gu Nian, someone's coming!

616
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,780
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

617
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,300
Did they follow us here?

618
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,430
I don't think so.

619
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,570
At this speed, no one can catch up.

620
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,530
Did you grab the cans?

621
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,390
I... I didn't.

622
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,390
I forgot.

623
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,460
I was so scared.

624
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,330
I was so scared.

625
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,230
What are you afraid of?

626
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,070
Aren't you Gu Nian?

627
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,020
You're fearless.

628
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,320
I was afraid they'd find us at the basketball court.

629
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,990
Well, you didn't have the key.

630
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,670
You could say the key was with me,

631
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,910
and pin it on me.

632
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,850
Then they'd know it was the two of us who were there.

633
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,640
So you're afraid people will find out

634
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,910
we were together?

635
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,870
You're twisting the meaning of it.

636
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,670
Do you like it?

637
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,700
I'm just kidding with you.

638
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,020
If you really catch a cold,

639
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,070
I couldn't take responsibility for that.

640
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,710
How is it?

641
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,390
Do you feel any better now?

642
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,190
Much better.

643
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,340
You know what?

644
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,810
Over these college years,

645
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,160
I've absorbed

646
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,410
so much positive energy from you.

647
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,310
Whether it's charity performances

648
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,070
or basketball games,

649
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,520
they've helped me

650
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,540
find more reasons to be happy.

651
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,480
Really?

652
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,110
It's my honor.

653
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,620
Alright then, let's call today

654
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,180
your graduation defense.

655
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,710
Congratulations.

656
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,380
It was approved with a stamp.

657
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Full marks!

658
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,170
Why isn't she answering the phone?

659
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,910
You finally picked up.

660
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,310
I thought something bad happened to you.

661
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,970
Can you wish me well for once?

662
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,670
I just came back from the library.

663
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,710
You called me so many times.

664
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,910
I thought something bad happened to you.

665
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,280
What could possibly happen to me?

666
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,180
Let me ask you,

667
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,430
why did you become the female lead?

668
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,350
You saw the poster?

669
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,500
I look beautiful, don't I?

670
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,510
If it weren't for your meddling,

671
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,750
I probably would have played the female lead already.

672
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,110
You play the tree more naturally.

673
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,310
The clueless charm you radiate from the inside out.

674
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,750
Can you speak nicely for once?

675
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,430
I'm hanging up.

676
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,670
Wait, wait.

677
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,550
Listen to me.

678
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,950
If you're going to play the female lead,

679
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,100
wouldn't that just be going back?

680
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,690
Have you forgotten our previous review

681
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,190
of my dating timeline with Feng Huanan?

682
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,870
Come on, you've already ruined it.

683
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,030
It's because Lyu Tu is too busy with work

684
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,340
that I'm filling in for her in this role.

685
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,870
Do you really need to

686
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,230
call me so many times over this?

687
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,920
So, what's the deal with Feng Huanan

688
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,510
and our mom's company?

689
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,560
Is he going to work there?

690
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,850
Wait, which time and space are you in now?

691
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,790
Feng Huanan was just thanking Uncle Wang

692
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,320
for giving us the chance to perform.

693
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,710
Isn't this just normal social etiquette?

694
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,880
I see.

695
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,790
Now I can be at ease.

696
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,080
There wasn't this part originally.

697
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,460
So, are you saying that

698
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,100
in your memory, he chose to work in investment?

699
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,030
No, he was focused on starting his own business.

700
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,470
But later, he found an investor

701
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,790
who's in the same field as our mom.

702
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,130
Totally different.

703
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,540
I'm curious,

704
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,610
back then, did you also

705
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,920
not listen to Queen Dai?

706
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,620
I...

707
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,830
Of course I didn't.

708
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,650
But now I really regret

709
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,240
not listening to our mom back then.

710
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,370
What's there to regret?

711
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,060
The choice you made at that time

712
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,630
was what you wanted the most.

713
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,840
I never regret my own choices.

714
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,150
Alright.

715
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,350
Just keep that positive attitude.

716
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,230
Go to sleep now.

717
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,990
Staying up late makes you gain weight.

718
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,780
Bye.

719
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,530
Since the path has deviated so much,

720
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,610
you must have changed too, right?
