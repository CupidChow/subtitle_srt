00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,210
President Feng is really good at sailing under false colors.

[Episode 12]

4
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,380
How sanctimonious.

[It's just a breakup]

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,390
Really admirable.

7
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,000
There were some small mistakes in the setup.

8
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,990
Let's coordinate.

9
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,770
Please, everyone, stay calm.

10
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,810
Su Yin,

11
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,440
there should be limits to your recklessness!

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,850
Where are we?

13
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,580
I'm asking you, where are we?

14
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,770
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,690
this is the big talent from our Economics department.

16
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,190
For the past two years,

17
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,660
under the pretext of helping left-behind children in his hometown,

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,990
he has "donated" all the money

19
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,980
to his own family.

20
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,230
While gaining a good reputation,

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,870
he also managed to make himself rich.

22
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,460
He really knows how to scheme.

23
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,540
Don't slander me.

24
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,180
Guo Yongcheng, sponsored by the drama club, is a left-behind child.

25
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,220
What does that have to do with me?

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,820
Am I slandering you?

27
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,440
Guo Yongcheng has nothing to do with you?

28
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,620
What about his older sister, Guo Yongfang?

29
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,030
Does she have nothing to do with you either?

30
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,610
Are you not willing to answer,

31
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,430
or just afraid to answer?

32
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,220
So, every time he sends money to Guo Yongcheng,

33
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,660
you transfer it back to his mother, right?

34
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,670
Well, his mother is basically also mine.

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,890
We grew up together.

36
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,020
When he finishes university and comes back,

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,950
we'll get married.

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,180
He's saving up for our dowry.

39
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,440
I give the money to Auntie Feng

40
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,460
to show respect to my future mother-in-law.

41
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,090
Guo Yongfang is your fiancée back in your hometown.

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,420
Every penny you send to Guo Yongcheng

43
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,810
is transferred to your mom through Guo Yongfang

44
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,910
Because she knows

45
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,300
you two are going to be family sooner or later.

46
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,140
How would I know

47
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,430
she transferred the money to my mom?

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,900
I was just reasonably and lawfully

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,790
sending money to her.

50
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,710
Because she is Guo Yongcheng's only guardian.

51
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,700
What's wrong with that?

52
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,820
So, you admit

53
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,990
your relationship with her, then?

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,020
In such a large place,

55
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,420
with so many left-behind children eligible,

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,220
why did you choose Guo Yongcheng?

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,750
Could it really be a coincidence?

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm really sorry.

59
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,190
I didn't expect this to happen.

60
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,820
What kind of person is this?

61
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,829
Su Yin, don't go too far.

62
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,890
What exactly are you trying to do?

63
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,940
Feng Huanan,

64
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,510
go ahead, hit me.

65
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,020
Nian.

66
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,990
You really have no shame.

67
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,020
Gu Nian, it hurts. It hurts!

68
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,820
Let go, let go, let go!

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,700
It really hurts!

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,500
Su Yin.

71
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,230
Can you stop being so childish?

72
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,649
I have to destroy him with everything I've got,

73
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,860
or he'll destroy you in the future.

74
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,780
Yes.

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,810
Now you're ruining me.

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,790
You've vented your frustration, feeling better now?

77
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,070
Did you ever think about me?

78
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,420
How am I supposed to explain this to my mom,

79
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,980
Uncle Wang, and Grandpa Meng?

80
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,980
Can't you just leave this place

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,140
or go back to school before doing this?

82
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,020
No way.

83
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,700
Feng Huanan is fooling all of you.

84
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,500
And he was so self-righteous.

85
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,460
I almost exhausted myself explaining to the professor today

86
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,310
just to barely get out of it.

87
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,260
As soon as I rushed over here,

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,860
I found everyone talking about Feng Huanan.

89
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,930
Even the security guards knew that Grandpa Meng had taken a liking to him.

90
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,060
I asked around and found out you were the one who helped him.

91
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,500
I wanted to ask you for clarification,

92
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
but as soon as I entered the makeup room,

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,480
I saw Feng Huanan begging Lyu Tu to forgive him.

94
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,880
He said Lyu Tu was his first woman

95
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
and that you were the one who seduced him.

96
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,340
Do you know what you're saying?

97
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,150
Tu would never do something like that.

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,260
She would never betray me like that.

99
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,060
Yes.

100
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,050
Lyu Tu wasn't intentional.

101
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,020
She was another victim of the lies,

102
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,860
so nothing really changed.

103
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,500
I thought everything was over.

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,690
That's why I left with peace of mind.

105
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,820
But in the end, Feng Huanan

106
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,940
still made you fall in love with him,

107
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,100
made you help him,

108
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,650
and made you his mistress.

109
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,580
No, Lyu Tu is the mistress.

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
He has a fiancée at home.

111
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,280
Gu Nian, we're the fourth party here.

112
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,670
Can you shut up?

113
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,380
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,820
My dear self,

115
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,330
I was negligent.

116
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,950
I let you get hurt.

117
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,820
I totally understand your pain.

118
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,230
The pain I would feel seven years later

119
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,300
is no less than what you're feeling now.

120
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,650
You don't understand at all.

121
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,659
You always think

122
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,180
you're saving me.

123
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,300
But it's you

124
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,900
who has step by step

125
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,940
shattered all the beauty in my life.

126
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,020
Self-deception won't save you, Gu Nian.

127
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,270
You think I care about Feng Huanan?

128
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,360
Then you're wrong.

129
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,790
I, Gu Nian, have always been someone

130
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,110
who can let go when needed.

131
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,740
I know.

132
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,270
Whether it's now or seven years later,

133
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,470
the one we care about the most is Lyu Tu.

134
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
Although she's also a victim,

135
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,750
I really can't accept

136
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,420
her being with Feng Huanan.

137
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,380
Instead of wasting time arguing with me here,

138
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,670
why don't you go ask Tu yourself and get it straight?

139
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,430
I...

140
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,450
Gu Nian.

141
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,920
You've changed.

142
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,600
Gu Nian.

143
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,250
Have I... have I changed?

144
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,060
Be careful.

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,580
Everything's packed, right?

146
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,340
It's all packed.

147
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,240
Come on.

148
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,540
Alright, these things are all packed up too.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Gu Nian, I'll give you a ride.

150
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,410
No. You guys go ahead.

151
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,100
Alright, we're leaving then.

152
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,830
Where are you?

153
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,360
I just saw you downstairs, and I opened it for you.

154
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
If you had told me earlier

155
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,510
that you and Feng Huanan were already in a relationship,

156
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,740
I honestly wouldn't have cared.

157
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,560
Why did you hide it from me?

158
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,100
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

159
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,820
I just couldn't find

160
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,660
the right time to tell you.

161
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,980
He's your idol.

162
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,810
I was afraid you'd scold me when you found out

163
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,980
he ended up with me.

164
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,090
What would I scold you for?

165
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,419
That you're not worthy? Or that he's not worthy?

166
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,370
Tu, how long have we known each other?

167
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,700
You know I care about you, not him.

168
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,640
You should scold me!

169
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,039
You should say, "Lyu Tu, you deserve this!"

170
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,300
You do deserve it.

171
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,020
Taking me to make chocolates was your idea, right?

172
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,870
If I'm not mistaken,

173
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,050
you paid for it too, right?

174
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,130
I just remembered,

175
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,020
he also gave me a silk scarf.

176
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,060
Now that I think about it, that scarf

177
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,860
probably wasn't from him either.

178
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,000
It was indeed from me.

179
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,960
He said he wanted to thank Uncle Wang.

180
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,820
How could I let him pay?

181
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,380
But Uncle Wang didn't want it at all.

182
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,390
Why don't you take it back?

183
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,770
First come, first served.

184
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,730
It's yours now.

185
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,590
I don't want this dirty thing he gave me.

186
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,660
But I bought it after all.

187
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,780
It's not exactly dirty.

188
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,300
He touched it.

189
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,500
Doesn't that make it dirty?

190
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,460
I don't want it.

191
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,420
Fine, we both won't take it.

192
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,870
No,

193
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,430
I just don't get it.

194
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,020
I've never been in a relationship,

195
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,270
and I guess I was just misled,

196
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,540
but you?

197
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,180
Extremes meet, maybe.

198
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,870
If some random guy

199
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,020
told me

200
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,220
he'd take responsibility for me,

201
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,540
I'd laugh

202
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,220
and ignore him.

203
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,830
But why did I take him seriously

204
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,040
when he said it to me?

205
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,120
I really… I'm such a fool.

206
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,030
My brain must have been kicked by a donkey.

207
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,370
I can't believe I fell for it.

208
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,810
I see it now.

209
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,300
The alcohol

210
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,820
is ruining your head.

211
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,470
I really feel so sorry for you.

212
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,620
I'll drink this to punish myself.

213
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,260
Don't drink anymore.

214
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,380
You'll only make things worse.

215
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,180
I'm going out for a bit.

216
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,470
Where are you going?

217
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,360
Throwing out the trash.

218
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,180
Don't wait for me.

219
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,420
It's so late...

220
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,910
Nian.

221
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,290
Thank you.

222
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,420
Are you avoiding calling her,

223
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,180
or are you waiting for her to call you?

224
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,660
Which one do you think is more likely?

225
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,860
Neither is likely.

226
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,230
You still don't know yourself, do you?

227
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,950
When you're falling apart, you just want to hide away,

228
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
wishing the whole world

229
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,580
couldn't find you.

230
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,620
Give her some time.

231
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,740
She'll figure it out.

232
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,180
I thought I could change the ending completely,

233
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,650
but after going around in circles,

234
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,220
it feels like it's all come back to the same point.

235
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,260
Everything I've done was for her.

236
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,910
But when I saw her break down today,

237
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,760
I felt so heartbroken, so very heartbroken.

238
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,420
After all, she is me.

239
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,420
You're not wrong.

240
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,100
But you can't stop her from walking her own path

241
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,890
just to keep her from making mistakes.

242
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,340
Sometimes, facing painful truths

243
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,730
is the real growth.

244
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,610
So you mean,

245
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,070
the only way the ending can change

246
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,490
is if she grows on her own?

247
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,460
I don't know.

248
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,740
I just think

249
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,380
no matter what you do,

250
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,740
she will always have to face the storm alone.

251
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,750
What she needs isn't a cage,

252
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,980
but armor.

253
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,570
You can't walk this road with her forever.

254
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,420
After all,

255
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,190
you don't belong to this time and space.

256
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,020
Gu Nian.

257
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,500
What do you want from me?

258
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,970
I'm of no use to you anymore.

259
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:08,980
No.

260
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,940
After you left,

261
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,820
you never came back.

262
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,780
I've been so worried about you.

263
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,260
Don't play the emotional card.

264
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,980
It used to work, but not anymore.

265
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm not trying to play an emotional card.

266
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,660
I just think

267
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,670
it's necessary to make things clear with you.

268
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,820
For work-related things, just talk to Uncle Wang directly.

269
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,760
You don't need to go through me.

270
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,460
About you and Lyu Tu, talk to her.

271
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,420
I don't know about your fiancée.

272
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,820
As for us,

273
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,370
it's over.

274
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,020
Gu Nian.

275
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,020
Gu Nian!

276
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,860
Can't you just give me one more chance

277
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,180
to explain things to you?

278
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,100
From the basketball court

279
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,970
to the chocolate workshop,

280
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,870
can you really end things so easily?

281
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,140
From the drama club to the wellness center,

282
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,220
and then to the final performance,

283
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,940
can you really pretend like

284
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,660
nothing ever happened?

285
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
We've been through so much together,

286
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,300
and now, just because of some casual words from others,

287
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,630
you're willing to turn everything upside down in your eyes?

288
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,150
I don't have a fiancée.

289
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,430
That was just her and my mother's wishful thinking.

290
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,390
You know Lyu Tu.

291
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,830
She's just a player.

292
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,520
If I'm wrong anywhere,

293
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,890
it's that I was too concerned about everyone else's feelings

294
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,220
and didn't flat-out reject them.

295
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,810
Didn't you say I was your idol?

296
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,920
Didn't you say I was your sunshine?

297
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,510
But love isn't just one person's sacrifice,

298
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,380
it's mutual trust between two people.

299
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,660
Isn't that right?

300
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,500
Do you remember how I treated you when you were at your lowest?

301
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,260
But now,

302
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,820
now that I've fallen to this state,

303
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,980
you're avoiding me?

304
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,950
You won't even listen to me?

305
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,550
You did all these things yourself,

306
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,820
didn't you?

307
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,820
Yes, I did them.

308
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,260
But does that mean I'm wrong?

309
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,220
Did I do something wrong?

310
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
Do I have to say

311
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,100
"Yes, I'm just a poor student

312
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,670
and my family is from a remote mountain village"

313
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,550
to earn

314
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,020
your esteemed pity?

315
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,260
Su Yin.

316
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,840
Su Yin blindly smeared and

317
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,830
attacked me.

318
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,470
Yes,

319
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,660
I did transfer the money to my family.

320
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,340
But it was also used

321
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,420
to help my fellow villagers.

322
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,060
Let me be honest with you.

323
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,020
The last transfer I made

324
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,020
was for the uncles in my village

325
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,420
who needed medical treatment.

326
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,080
They've watched me grow up.

327
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,130
They funded me and helped me go to university.

328
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,780
They're like family to me.

329
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,870
I acted according to reason,

330
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,700
sending money to repay their kindness.

331
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,460
Am I wrong?

332
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,350
I.

333
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,300
I am the biggest victim here today.

334
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,260
Do you understand?

335
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,060
Even so,

336
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,230
I'm still very worried about you.

337
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,060
But in the end,

338
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,630
what do I get?

339
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,420
Your disdain,

340
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,030
your misunderstanding,

341
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,740
and your coldness.

342
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,790
If we hadn't acted together in the play,

343
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,700
I would have believed

344
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,880
everything you just said.

345
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,810
You wanted to see me?

346
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,000
Jiang,

347
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,220
Do you think this is it for me?

348
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,620
I don't even

349
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,060
get the chance

350
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,100
to rise again?

351
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,310
You chose this path.

352
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,700
What can others do?

353
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,420
If you choose to be a gambler, you have to accept the loss.

354
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,380
What did I gamble?

355
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,900
What did I gamble?

356
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,310
I...

357
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,350
I, Feng Huanan, for these four years of college,

358
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,210
each step I took, I made sure to move forward steadily.

359
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,410
That's how I've come this far.

360
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,340
But the achievements you gained

361
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,100
mean nothing in your eyes, do they?

362
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,420
It's just like

363
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,220
basketball.

364
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,860
For the first three years, you worked hard

365
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,180
at improving your skills.

366
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,430
But in the last year,

367
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,420
you were only focused on getting new sneakers.

368
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,620
Because I have resentment.

369
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,750
I hate it.

370
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,500
I hate all this unfairness!

371
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,460
But you shouldn't have hurt

372
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,620
the hearts of three girls at the same time.

373
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,860
It's not manly.

374
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,000
Jiang, even you don't understand me anymore?

375
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,060
Jiang!

376
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,980
You need to reflect on yourself.

377
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,020
Jiang!

378
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,370
♫Rain boots in my hand♫

379
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,610
♫The scene totally soaked♫

380
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,810
♫Without you by my side, I can't go back to the past♫

381
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:23,690
♫No sweetness of coffee, only a bitter smile♫

382
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,210
♫Who will pick up the lost memories♫

383
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,890
♫I had too much to drink last night, looking all miserable♫

384
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,370
♫Waiting alone for you to show up again♫

385
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,880
♫Turns out those things deep in my memory still surface from time to time♫

386
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,190
♫But actually, you've gone so far♫

387
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,400
♫I just saw a face similar to yours♫

388
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,280
♫How long do I need to wait before our next meeting?♫

389
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,700
But I want to be responsible for you.

390
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,460
You may not mind,

391
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,020
but I do.

392
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,510
You really gave me so many beautiful things,

393
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,340
so many beautiful things.

394
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,690
I can't bear to harm you.

395
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,910
♫The gathering place♫

396
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,250
Nian.

397
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,130
♫In someone else's world♫

398
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm going to find the future I want.

399
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,220
Not saying goodbye

400
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,910
♫I'm just an audience watching someone else's performance♫

401
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,590
is because I can't bear to say goodbye,

402
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,020
and because I believe we'll meet again.

403
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,180
May we get what we wish for when we meet again.

404
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,030
♫Impulsive actions♫

405
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,260
There's dog poop on my foot.

406
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,020
♫It's too obviously fake♫

407
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,980
♫The promises I hear are too perfunctory♫

408
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,410
♫I had too much to drink last night, looking all miserable♫

♫Sky'll be dry♫

419
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,380
This is for you.

420
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,030
♫You close your eyes♫

421
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,580
How did you know I like balloons?

422
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,640
♫No one can find you♫

423
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,780
Secret.

424
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,580
♫But still, it began, and so it is♫

425
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,860
Will you marry me?

♫Your eyes can't hide you♫

427
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,510
I want to share a brilliant life with you.

428
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,630
♫You build those castles in the sand♫

429
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,520
A beautiful future.

430
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,290
♫And hope with everything you have♫

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,820
♫The wind is calm tonight♫

432
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,060
I will.

♫Looking for answers in the dark♫

434
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,500
♫You search in endless works of art♫

435
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,390
♫To find life inside of them♫

436
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,810
♫Oh, to find light inside of them♫

437
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,950

♫Oh so it seems♫

444
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,240
♫They come and they leave you♫

♫But sure to appease you♫

♫Hope for the first time, it will start to heal all on its own♫

450

♫The sky opens wide♫

451
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,770
♫You close your eyes♫

452
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,870
♫Now we won't find you♫

453
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,440
Who is it?

454
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,660
What's up?

455
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,450
I thought you were dead.

456
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,460
I'm giving you your last bit of dignity.

457
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,190
What, are you planning to smash your head into a rock

458
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,070
or jump into the sea to kill yourself?

459
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,300
I want to be bitten to death by seagulls.

460
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,910
It's all your fault for being blind.

461
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,100
What you said wasn't precise.

462
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,220
I used to be blind,

463
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,390
but I'm not anymore.

464
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,060
I told you

465
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,150
there was a pit and you just had to jump into it.

466
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,780
What could I do?

467
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,170
Well, I didn't want to give up until I hit the wall, okay?

468
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,630
And now you came back with bumps on your head.

469
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,970
You've tried it

470
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,790
and failed.

471
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,130
How does it feel?

472
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,800
Very clear-headed.

473
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,560
But it's also painful.

474
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,570
The pain now

475
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,340
is better than living a life worse than death later on.

476
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,300
The feeling of everything you care about

477
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,700
being taken away and destroyed,

478
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,500
while you're powerless to do anything about it.

479
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,260
I know.

480
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,180
I can't blame you for this.

481
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,340
You told me the ending.

482
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
I didn't believe you.

483
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,340
So some pain

484
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
still needs to be experienced firsthand.

485
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
Actually,

486
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,360
we're like hedgehogs.

487
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,300
We think we're invincible,

488
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,130
but we're not as strong as we think.

489
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,530
To be honest,

490
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,220
after Dad passed,

491
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,690
he was the first boy who made my heart flutter.

492
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,860
Because Dad's passing

493
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,030
left too many regrets,

494
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,300
I started looking for his shadow

495
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,820
in life to fill the gap.

496
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,220
Otherwise, do you think I would have

497
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,620
fallen for someone like Feng Huanan?

498
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,170
Are you asking me?

499
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,200
We're the same person.

500
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,060
Can you get a different answer from me?

501
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,660
Fine.

502
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,160
It's my fault.

503
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,750
It's my fault for not having good judgment

504
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,940
when it comes to men.

505
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,250
Maybe I should just gouge my eyes out and feed them to the seagulls.

506
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,140
Go ahead, gouge them out.

507
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,810
Gouge.

508
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,260
Wait, wait, no, hold on.

509
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,630
Were you self-deprecating or were you insulting me just now?

510
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,980
However,

511
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,340
if it weren't Feng Huanan,

512
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,720
would I still have been hurt?

513
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,260
Right now, the most important thing is not to find a man.

514
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,080
It's to make yourself stronger.

515
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,650
Start by becoming a rising star in the workplace.

516
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,780
No.

517
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,020
Do you have any humanity left?

518
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,550
It's my first love and my first heartbreak.

519
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,340
And you're

520
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,910
telling me to look for a job?

521
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,580
After everything that has happened to me,

522
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,620
I'm still trying to save you.

523
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,510
Gu Nian,

524
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,710
stand up.

525
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,100
Move forward.

526
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,620
What are you doing?

527
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,580
If you kill me,

528
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,700
you'll lose the future predictor.

529
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,220
Aren't we leaving? I'm leaving.

530
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,420
You.

531
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,200
If you want to die, pick a better place.

532
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,350
It's all rocks here and it's far away.

533
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,820
I almost tripped when I just got here.

534
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,870
Wait for me!

535
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,180
No.

536
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,350
Where's the car?

537
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,140
What car? I came by taxi.

538
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,240
No, I mean my motorcycle.

539
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,670
How would I know where your motorcycle is?

540
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,390
You parked it here?

541
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,430
Yeah.

542
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,140
I parked my motorcycle here.

543
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,890
I didn't see it when I came.

544
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,060
I thought you took a taxi too.

545
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,820
How is that possible?

546
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,020
I rode my own motorcycle here.

547
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,580
No.

548
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,710
Think carefully.

549
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,780
Did you park it somewhere else?

550
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,020
Oh no, I didn't take out the key.

551
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,840
It's probably stolen.

552
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,870
They didn't even need to steal it.

553
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,510
They could just ride it away.

554
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,360
It's all your fault.

555
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,080
Why didn't you tell me it would be gone today?

556
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,620
Call the police.

557
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,300
Why are you blaming me?

558
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,670
Calling the police won't help.

559
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,250
There's no surveillance here in this remote area.

560
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,380
We won't get it back.

561
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,070
I don't remember this happening.

562
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,270
I don't recall ever losing my bike.

563
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,860
People always say,

564
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,620
"Fail in love, succeed in money."

565
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,140
How come I'm so unlucky?

566
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,110
Don't think about it.

567
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,100
Let's go back.

568
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,910
I'm not going back.

569
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,860
I want to roam the world.

570
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,340
No.

571
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,390
I want to travel around China.

572
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,370
But you don't have any transport!

573
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,860
After fighting with Mom like that,

574
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,060
how can you still have the nerve to ask her for money for a motorcycle?

575
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,820
I'll go on foot. I'll hike.

576
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,870
I'm happy.

577
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,100
What's the point of hiking?

578
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,220
It's too far.

579
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,780
I spent over 200 yuan on a taxi here.

580
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,710
Why came to the seaside?

581
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,100
It's too far!

582
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,110
Mind your own business.

583
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,100
Look.

584
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,660
I'm really tired.

585
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,860
I've been running around after you every day,

586
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,700
taking care of you.

587
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,710
Coming back is really...

588
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,710
Can you shut up?

589
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,790
Fine, I'll shut up.

590
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Are you wearing this coat?

591
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,990
I'm worried you'll be cold.

592
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,350
Hurry up! You're so slow.

593
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,170
We've only walked a few kilometers, and you're already done?

594
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,260
With your stamina, you want to hike

595
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,110
and travel the world?

596
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,020
Just find a job and earn money.

597
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,540
Do you think

598
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,420
I haven't sent out resumes?

599
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,180
I've sent so many, but they've all gone unanswered.

600
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,140
Wait a minute, wait.

601
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,060
Well, you could ask for my "golden touch".

602
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,860
If you're nice about it,

603
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,470
I might consider it.

604
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,050
I'm not walking anymore. I'm done.

605
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,020
Ask you for help?

606
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,420
I will definitely end up homeless.

607
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,830
Anyway,

608
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,960
I've got a new body now.

609
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,160
My stamina is great.

610
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,260
You said you didn't want to take a taxi, right?

611
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,430
Today we won't take a taxi

612
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,360
even if there is any.

613
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,020
We'll just walk.

614
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,730
A road to the end, no turning back.

615
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,380
I've got an idea.

616
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,530
You got a new body, huh?

617
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,270
We can't let this new body go to waste.

618
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,730
Although I can't touch it,

619
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,890
I can at least ride it!

620
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,260
In your dreams!

621
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,100
No way!

622
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,220
Wait, what are you doing?

623
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,020
Stop right there!

624
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,180
I can't walk anymore!

625
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,300
What's that got to do with me?

626
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,210
Fine.

627
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,480
If you leave, I'll just lie here and die.

628
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,860
Then die.

629
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
You've already died once anyway.

630
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,700
One more time won't make a difference.

631
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,830
Just lie where you fall.

632
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,490
Bye-bye.

633
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,580
I'm really not going.

634
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,380
Fine, fine. I'll just die of sunstroke today. Let me die of sunstroke!

635
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,490
You're really leaving?

636
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,470
Get off. Off.

637
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,900
No way. I've already gotten on.

638
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,820
How could I possibly get off?

639
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,660
Hurry up and go.

640
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,420
You're so annoying.

641
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,730
♫Remember the moments we had♫

642
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,360
♫The ones everyone envied♫

643
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,070
You made me so lost about the future.

644
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,290
♫But later♫

645
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,940
♫But in the end♫

646
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,300
You've been away from the workplace for so many years.

647
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,160
♫Everything turned to nothing♫

648
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,820
And you still think you can be my future changer?

649
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,230
♫I really wish time would slow down♫

650
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,020
Can't you have a little confidence in your future self?

651
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,580
♫Let me lock away all memories♫

652
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,870
You've ended up like this.

653
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,100
How can you expect me to have confidence in myself?

654
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,630
♫Laughing and saying♫

655
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,620
Use your naive innocence.

♫I'm fine♫

657
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,220
Ignorance is bliss, right?

658
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,020
♫Maybe you've forgotten the past♫

659
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,340
What are you doing?

660
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,740
I just want to

661
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,380
♫But I still remember the story♫

662
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,220
ride my little motorcycle

663
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,620
and cruise around everywhere.

664
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,230
Can we upgrade a bit?

665
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,500
Change it to a four-wheeler.

666
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,870
♫Fall into the whirlpool of memories♫

667
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
We could even bring Mom along.

668
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,800
♫No matter how time flies♫

669
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
That's different.

670
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,580
How is it different?

671
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,830
We can take turns driving.

672
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,380
♫Through the seasons♫

673
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,030
Let Mom sit in the passenger seat.

674
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,660
It'll be awesome, right?

675
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,340
Gu Nian, Gu Nian.

676
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,430
Gu Nian!

677
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,470
♫Trapped in my heart, I'm willing♫

678
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,120
Gu Nian?

679
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,010
No.

680
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:53,990
♫Even though I know the door isn't locked♫

681
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,260
Gu Nian, you need to keep going.

00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:03,530
♫Time, can you not take my story away?♫

683
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,130
Our lives are about to

684
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,270
change from this moment.

685
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,380
Why did Tu leave so suddenly?

686
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,620
At least have a farewell meal.

687
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,220
Sometimes letting go is a choice too.

688
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,780
Look at Tu,

689
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,300
she's off to pursue her future.

690
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,960
Don't you think you should make an effort too

691
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,150
and improve yourself?

692
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,580
Otherwise, when you meet again,

693
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,110
she'll transform herself and achieve her dreams,

694
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,790
and you'll still be stuck in the same old rut.

695
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,150
These three companies

696
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,000
are the ones I interviewed with back then.

697
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Each has its pros and cons.

698
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,500
This one is the company our computer science department collaborates with.

699
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,750
Jiang is working for them.

700
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,350
Gao Ren interviewed there too.

701
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,900
This one looks good now,

702
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,960
but seven years from now, it'll be nothing.

703
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,220
Here comes the key part:

704
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,450
This one, Fengzhuo Tech,

705
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
although it's small now,

706
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,920
will go public in the future.

707
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,480
The rumored behind-the-scenes boss is mysterious and very powerful,

708
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,820
and very young,

709
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,170
but no one has seen him.

710
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,310
So what do you mean by that?

711
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,219
My point is obvious.

712
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,060
We can't just focus on the present.

713
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,960
We need to look long-term.

714
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,909
Grow with a small company

715
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,530
can help you reach the top in the future.

716
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,230
You can marry a rich and handsome guy,

717
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,650
become a CEO,

718
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
and reach the peak of life.

719
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,400
So, Fengzhuo Tech

720
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,540
is your best choice.

721
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,940
Not only will you rise as a career newcomer,

722
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,179
but it could also land us a good husband.

723
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,520
Will you go with me then?

724
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,830
I can't go.

725
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,909
I have something very important

726
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,699
that I must do.

727
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,409
What is it?

728
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,320
Take me with you.

729
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,100
I need to go back to my old company

730
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,030
to save people from dire straits.

731
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,380
You shouldn't come along.

732
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,889
Focus on figuring out your own life first.

733
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,710
I understand it pretty well.

734
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,510
Both of us right now:

735
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,560
one is a newcomer,

736
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,780
and the other is a seven-year housewife.

737
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,090
We're almost isolated from the world.

738
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,380
What can we possibly

739
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,660
contribute to a startup?

740
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,630
We'll be lucky if we're not kicked out.

741
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,510
Two burdens still want to be career newcomers?

742
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,110
Why can't our goals

743
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,500
progress together?

744
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,420
This company is full of complicated personnel.

745
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,260
The workplace is treacherous.

746
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,600
I didn't stay long there before.

747
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,830
I quit in a fit of anger.

748
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
After that, I never went back to work.

749
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,620
Now, regretting won't help.

750
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,820
You need to be mentally prepared.

751
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,820
If it doesn't work out,

752
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,900
we'll switch to Fengzhuo.

753
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,780
You're being too cowardly.

754
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,950
You're nothing like me.

755
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,590
The workplace isn't as simple as you think.

756
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,420
That's why

757
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,380
we should get back up where we fell.

758
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,570
Besides, Su Yin,

759
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,020
no, wait,

760
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,130
Gu Nian, you're now a cheat code.

761
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,130
You're unbeatable.

762
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,390
And last time, it was your own fault.

763
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,860
This time, you've got me.

764
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,340
Have you really thought this through?

765
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,680
I want to see

766
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,100
just how scary the company was

767
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,060
that scared me away back then.

768
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,860
You really won't give up until you hit a wall, huh?

769
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,160
So what if I hit a wall?

770
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,500
At worst, I'll just get a bump on my head.

771
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,060
Two Gus working together...

772
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,590
Is invincible.

773
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,150
Let's go to work.

774
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,700
I'm Bai Guo from the Planning Department.
