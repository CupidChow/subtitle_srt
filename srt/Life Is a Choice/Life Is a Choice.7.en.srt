The Health and Wellness Center

10
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
needs a troupe for long-term collaboration.

11
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,670
They think our repertoire suits them well.

You're so awesome.

15
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,430
Wow.

16
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,390
Actually, I should be blamed for this.

17
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,910
As the leader of our troupe,

18
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,070
I should have resolved this perfectly.

19
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,690
Instead, I've made everyone contribute both money and effort,

20
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,510
hustling about for this.

21
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,960

Don't feel burdened, okay?

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,380
I even call him Uncle Wang in private.

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,810
Although he addressed

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,350

35
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,220

By the way, President,

44
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,300
when I was talking money with them,

45
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,960
I did a rough calculation.

46
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,870
If we put aside the cost,

47
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,460
we'll have some money left over.

48
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,360

Sure. Team-building sounds great.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,040
I'll go with your idea.

53
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,940
Actually, there will still be some money left after the team-building.

54
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,990
I think we could establish a foundation.

but also helped all the students.

Is 6 o'clock okay?

76
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,660
Sure, 6 o'clock, no problem.

77
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,390
I'll wait for you downstairs of your dorm.

78

You jerk.

How dare you ride my motorcycle away?

83
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,940
What's your problem?

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,350
Bring my motorcycle back right now!

85
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,860
Get lost.

86
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,670
What the hell.

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,140
Even the flowers smell better.

88
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,150
The scent of love is in the air.

89
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,800
Nian, come with me.

90
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Why are you here?

91
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,030
Hurry up, something big happened.

92
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,410
But I have something to do later.

93
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,760
Let's go, hurry up.

94
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,860
Sir, let's go.

95
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,350
But I have a dinner appointment with Feng Huanan later.

96
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,310
That's exactly it!

97
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,710
Lin Xi, what's wrong with you?

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,470
I already told you

99
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,530
I have a very important date today.

100
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,300
Why did you...

101
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,830
Hey, Su Yin, what on earth do you want?

102
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,740
And you,

103
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,940
Lin Xi.

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,760
Why are you fooling around with him?

105
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,390
I'm really not fooling around.

106
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,540
Listen carefully to what he said.

107
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,420
He even knew

108
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,940
Feng Huanan would ask you out for dinner today, right?

109
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,500
What's wrong with having dinner? It's just normal social behavior.

110
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,310
And you. Why are you guarding against him like he's a thief?

111
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,750
I'm not guarding against him.

112
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,850
I'm protecting you, okay?

113
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,470
You helped him secure the collaborative performance with the Health and Wellness Center.

114
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,030
I can accept that.

115
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,230
I did the same thing back then.

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,230
But if you're going out to dinner with him today,

117
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,020
I absolutely won't allow it.

118
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,900
It might turn out just like before,

119
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,970
ending up with a kiss that seals the deal, Gu Nian.

120
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,140
So we're about to kiss so soon?

121
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,540
Lin Xi.

122
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,400
What do you think of my look today?

123
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,740
It's good. It's good.

124
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,270
Check out my pout.

125
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,870
Quite nice.

126
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,020
What are you doing?

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,240
Why are you looking forward to it?

128
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,370
And you. Shouldn't you be mature?

129
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,500
I do have feelings for him.

130
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,550
What's wrong with me looking forward to it?

131
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,550
Gu Nian.

132
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,000
It's your first kiss, Gu Nian. You need to be serious about it.

133
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,580
Actually, from a medical perspective,

134
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,010
there's no such concept as a first kiss.

135
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,580
Your first kiss

136
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,460
should already been given to your mother when you were a baby.

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,250
Xi, whose side are you on?

138
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,150
Well, whoever I help, I'm helping Gu Nian.

139
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,790
Am I right?

140
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,550
Gu Nian, listen to me.

141
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,670
I really am you from seven years in the future.

142
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,820
I came back to help you.

143
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,990
It's just that on my way back here,

144
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,870
something might have gone wrong,

145
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,390
so what you see might not be me.

146
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,220
But I really am you.

147
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,060
I mean, I'm...

148
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:29,810
Just...

149
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,510
Calm down a bit.

150
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,179
Feel my sincerity.

151
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,280
Can you feel it?

152
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,730
I don't feel anything at all.

153
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,530
Hey. Su Yin.

154
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm warning you. I can tolerate you once or twice,

155
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,110
but don't interfere with my affairs or try to change me.

156
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,310
To put it bluntly, we are two different people.

157
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,390
We can never have unified thoughts or be on the same page.

158
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,670
And you.

159
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,220
Gu Nian.

160
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,470
If you dare to walk out that door today,

161
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,670
I'll call our mom right away.

162
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,140
I'll tell her that you secretly

163
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,860
discussed business cooperation with Uncle Wang behind her back.

164
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,170
You...

165
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,550
Are you waiting for me?

166
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,390
What's up?

167
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,730
N-Nothing.

168
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,470
I just thought I'd come and see you.

169
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,780
How are you?

170
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm good.

171
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,750
It's good that you're good.

172
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,980
I'm good too.

173
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,820
I'll... I'll leave then.

174
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,670
You told me last time

175
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,500
that you wanted to help raise some money for the drama club, right?

176
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,110
Do you still need it?

177
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,580
Do you have connections?

178
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,950
There's someone I know.

179
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,950
He's quite wealthy,

180
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,740
but he doesn't have much education.

181
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,120
He's always wanted to do something related to culture.

182
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,110
The nouveau riche type, you know.

183
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,270
Always trying to appear cultured and refined.

184
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,660
Sure. That'll do.

185
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,060
When shall we go meet him?

186
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,740
He asked me out today.

187
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,350
I didn't want to go originally,

188
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,670
but if you want to go,

189
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,870
we can go together.

190
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,340
Today?

191
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,590
Okay.

192
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,860
Okay, let's do that.

193
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,220
I'll go upstairs and get changed.

194
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,260
Okay, I'll wait for you.

195
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,050
Hello.

196
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,060
I'm Lin Xi, Gu Nian's sister.

197
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,660
Gu Nian won't be able to make it today.

198
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,970
I'm sick,

199
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,070
so I had to ask her to come and take care of me.

200
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,170
Okay.

201
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,290
I mean, please get some rest.

202
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,350
Thank you.

203
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,950
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

204
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,070
Goodbye.

205
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,240
Do you believe I'll beat you to death?

206
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,610
Come on, give it to me.

207
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,990
Why are you two up there?

208
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,870
Come down already.

209
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,070
Let go of my pants first.

210
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,250
Good for you, huh? You're already a grown-up, yet you're still tattling.

211
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,470
You may be able to stop me from having dinner with him today,

212
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,190
but what about tomorrow?

213
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,530
Do you think you can stop me from having dinner with him tomorrow?

214
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,020
Anyway, it's not happening today.

215
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,440
If I don't go today,

216
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,140
can you disappear from my world?

217
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,790
Two days. Give me two days, okay?

218
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,670
You said it yourself.

219
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,490
I'll be the witness.

220
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,740
See if I can handle you.

221
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,150
I, Gu Nian, have no fear.

222
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,690
The only thing I'm scared of is our mom calling me.

223
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,080
It's my mom.

224
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,710
I didn't say anything.

225
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:57,970
My mom.

226
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,020
Quick, answer it.

227
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,540
Mom.

228
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,950
Nian.

229
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,700
Look what you've done.

230
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,370
Mom, don't criticize me. You love me the most, don't you?

231
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,220
Who allowed you to approach Uncle Wang

232
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,660
under my name?

233
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,620
I was just thinking

234
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,790
before graduation,

235
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,010
I could make one last contribution to our drama club.

236
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,290
I heard

237
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,760
you're planning to perform your drama club's play

238
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,840
at the Desheng Health and Wellness Center?

239
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,390
Isn't that a good thing?

240
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,430
They think the content of our play

241
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,500
is particularly suitable for the elderly.

242
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,990
Then how could you

243
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,070
talk money with them?

244
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,340
Why did that call actually go through?

245
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,100
My mom never answers calls from unknown numbers.

246
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,420
Lin Xi.

247
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,350
I miss my mom.

248
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,890
Promoting their support for college students and giving back to society.

249
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
How positive it is.

250
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,740
If you miss her, go see her.

251
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,740
No matter in what capacity.

252
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,940
I don't know how to face her.

253
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,660
Look at the state I'm in now.

254
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,860
You don't even believe I'm Gu Nian.

255
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
How could my mom believe it?

256
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,810
Her heart is already weak.

257
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,900
If I give her a shock, she may fall ill.

258
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,670
A professional investor's daughter

259
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,300
should be as excellent as her mom, right?

260
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,260
Mom, what is that?

261
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,700
A package.

262
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,990
Look how stupid I am.

263
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,960
I even helped Feng Huanan like that.

264
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,870
It's not from you?

265
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,150
I didn't buy anything.

266
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,420
What is it?

267
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,010
It's a nursing device.

268
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,360
Look. It's odd.

269
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,260
These past few days,

270
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,160
someone kept sending me things,

271
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,460
and they're quite expensive.

272
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,590
Things like cosmetics,

273
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,490
nutritional supplements,

274
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,180
and even health products for cerebral blood vessels.

275
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,500
Hey, Mom.

276
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,900
Don't accept unknown packages carelessly.

277
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
What if they were delivered to the wrong address?

278
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,430
We'd have to pay for them if you open them.

279
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,220
Of course I checked carefully.

280
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,170
They were all addressed to "Queen Dai".

281
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,250
Isn't that the silly nickname you gave me?

282
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,180
You borrowed money from me

283
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,610
and asked me not to tell Gu Nian about it.

284
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,590
Was it to buy those things for Aunt Dai?

285
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,670
Mom, I've got to go.

286
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,500
Bye-bye.

287
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,630
Bye-bye.

288
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,910
Mr. Tong.

289
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,940
Mr. Tong.

290
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,010
You're here.

291
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,390
Mr. Tong.

292
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,050
Hello.

293
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,790
Come on, have a seat.

294
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,540
Long time no see, Mr. Tong.

295
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,630
Tu.

296
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,450
You know I have feelings for you,

297
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,860
so why did you bring this handsome guy here?

298
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,510
This is my classmate.

299
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,070
Didn't you say you wanted to invest in the cultural industry?

300
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,000
He's the most cultured person in our school.

301
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,450
We held a benefit show

302
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,130
at the nursing home before.

303
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,580
We performed a play.

304
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,590
An old lady in the audience

305
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,580
fainted during the show.

306
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,660
He even saved her.

307
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,580
They even recorded a video.

308
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,030
President. President.

309
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,930
Show Mr. Tong that video, will you?

310
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,740
Oh, the video.

311
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,400
What video?

312
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,330
It caused quite a stir back then, Mr. Tong.

313
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,700
It struck quite a chord.

314
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,970
What video are you talking about?

315
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,440
Sit. Sit.

316
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,420
Sit.

317
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,510
Look.

318
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,230
This one.

319
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,300
Is this you?

320
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,350
That one. That's me.

321
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,900
The makeup made you

322
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,180
look far less beautiful than you really are.

323
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,120
That's because we were short of money.

324
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,710
Look, everyone's makeup was like this.

325
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,540
The cosmetics were borrowed,

326
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,360
and we couldn't afford to hire a good stylist.

327
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,830
Mr. Tong,

328
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,000
if you could support our play,

329
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,910
our performance would definitely be better than this.

330
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,200
Your... Your minimum spend for one night here

331
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,350
is almost enough for us to put on a performance.

332
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,830
Come on. Pour her a drink.

333
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,220
Pour more.

334
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,960
Fill it up, fill it up.

335
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,540
Come on, let's drink first.

336
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,580
Alright.

337
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,660
Thanks, Mr. Tong.

338
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,610
Bottoms up.

339
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,700
Come on, pour the drinks.

340
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,120
Lyu Tu. Lyu Tu.

341
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,080
Drink less.

342
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,960
Cheers.

343
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,369
I love how you drink with no hesitation.

344
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,109
I'm okay, Mr. Tong.

345
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,619
I'm just feeling a bit stuffed.

346
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,230
How much does one performance cost?

347
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,710
Well, it depends on

348
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,900
how many actors we need to hire.

349
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,280
Mr. Tong. And it also depends on

350
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,770
the size of the venue where we're performing.

351
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,120
We'll tailor the performance

352
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,630
in accordance with how much you invest.

353
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,220
Is this enough?

354
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,910
You're quite generous, aren't you?

355
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,180
So you got my home address.

356
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,850
After annoying me, you're even annoying my mom now.

357
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,090
Why do you always wrongly accuse a good guy?

358
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,210
I bought some things to show filial respect to our mom.

359
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:04,980
How is that annoying her?

360
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,440
I'm warning you.

361
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,270
You can make up whatever you want to me,

362
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,560
but don't think about taking advantage of my mom.

363
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,900
If I wanted to take advantage of my mom,

364
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,090
I would have gone see her long ago.

365
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,060
Would I have to endure your lecture here?

366
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,510
You don't have time to take care of her.

367
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,700
Why can't I take care of her?

368
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,470
You can't.

369
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,380
Hey, Su Yin.

370
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,470
I didn't realize

371
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,350
you had such a deep crush on me.

372
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,490
Trying to win a fight by taking down the boss, huh?

373
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,810
Trying to win over the mother-in-law?

374
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,910
Ms. Gu.

375
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,550
Can you please

376
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,110
use your pea-brain to think carefully

377
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,560
if there's a second possibility?

378
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,170
The second possibility

379
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,270
is that you are me,

380
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,350
and I am you, right?

381
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,480
That's right.

382
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,030
So if you really are the future me,

383
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,870
you should be penniless, right?

384
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,470
But you bought these clothes

385
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,540
and so many things for my mom.

386
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,420
Where did that money come from?

387
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,330
Lin Xi, did you give him the money?

388
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,980
I didn't give him any. I have no money.

389
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,570
Can't keep up the lie anymore, can you?

390
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,070
Your lie is deeply flawed.

391
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,090
Go on, keep telling the lie.

392
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,560
Oh, right.

393
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
Or maybe Su Yin came to your dream

394
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,680
and told you the password to his bank card?

395
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,130
650716.

396
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,060
All our passwords are Gu's birthday.

397
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,050
Even mom doesn't know about this.

398
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,540
Now you should believe me, right?

399
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960
Say something.

400
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,380
I'm leaving.

401
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,330
Gu Nian, where are you going?

402
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,560
Nian.

403
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,050
Don't rush it.

404
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,830
Give yourself some time.

405
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,090
Xi, I don't have much time left.

406
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,810
This doesn't make sense.

407
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,310
Taking a shortcut

408
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,840
and trying to have dinner with your crush?

409
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,160
You just won't leave me alone, will you?

410
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,270
I know myself too well.

411
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,260
Let me tell you something.

412
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,550
You may not admit it now,

413
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,110
but compared to before,

414
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,950
you're even more eager to prove that everything I said was wrong.

415
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,290
So you're trying to catch me in a lie

416
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,540
and testing the limits of my memory, aren't you?

417
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
Your self-righteous attitude

418
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,300
is really annoying.

419
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,860
I'm going home, alright?

420
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,720
Wait.

421
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,230
You don't believe me, right?

422
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,450
Let me show you who's the one being self-righteous.

423
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,010
[Feng Huanan]

424
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,300
Where are you, President?

425
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,820
Why are you calling me?

426
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,540
I can't hear you clearly.

427
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,810
You can't even talk straight.

428
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,490
Are you singing karaoke?

429
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,550
President, you're so busy every day,

430
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,810
yet you still found time for karaoke?

431
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,320
Good for you.

432
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,020
I'll be out of your hair. Bye-bye.

433
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,150
See?

434
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,430
He didn't wait for you at all.

435
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,130
Time to give up, don't you think?

436
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,990
Su Yin.

437
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,700
Is this fun for you?

438
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,670
If you really were me,

439
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,240
you wouldn't be so eager to brainwash me

440
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,190
and ask for an answer.

441
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,180
Don't you know what I hate the most?

442
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,920
I know. You can test me.

443
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,580
I won't hide anything from you.

444
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,310
But I don't know

445
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,340
how much time I have left here.

446
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,220
I can't afford to wait any longer.

447
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,150
So why do you think I can handle this right now?

448
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,830
Hey, why are you taking it out on me?

449
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,500
It wasn't me who didn't wait for you, okay?

450
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
It was him.

451
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,060
He... He even went to sing karaoke.

452
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,800
Why are you being so stubborn?

453
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,930
Stubborn mule. Stubborn mule!

454
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,540
What does this friend of yours do again?

455
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,640
He's the president of the drama club.

456
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,990
Now that my friends have all arrived,

457
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,610
why don't you perform something for us?

458
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,530
Recite a poem.

459
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,600
If you successfully move me to tears,

460
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,050
you can take this money.

461
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,510
How about this? Mr. Tong.

462
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,370
Look, so many of your friends are here.

463
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,400
You're all good friends of Mr. Tong.

464
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,500
I'd like to propose a toast to all of you.

465
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,190
Mr. Tong.

466
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,620
I'll perform something

467
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,770
for you and your friends.

468
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,920
I'll recite a poem.

469
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,460
Good.

470
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,550
"Song of a Pipa Player."

471
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,660
Bai Juyi.

472
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,260
One night by riverside, I bade a friend goodbye.

473
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,640
In maple leaves and rushes, autumn seemed to sigh.

474
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,380
My friend and I dismounted and came into the boat.

475
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,440
Without music, we drank with heavy heart.

476
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,710
What are you murmuring?

477
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,100
I can barely hear what you say.

478
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,420
Where's your emotion?

479
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,310
There's no emotion at all.

480
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,890
What kind of play is this?

481
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,880
He may not be used to the environment here.

482
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,520
"Song of a Pipa Player!"

483
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,470
Bai Juyi!

484
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,500
One night by riverside, I bade a friend goodbye.

485
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,600
In maple leaves and rushes, autumn seemed to sigh.

486
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,540
My friend and I dismounted and came into the boat.

487
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,750
Without music, we drank with heavy heart.

488
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,910
No pleasure from our tipsiness, only sadness for this coming separation.

489
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,910
The moonbeams blended with water when we were to part.

490
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,240
Suddenly over the stream we heard a pipa sound.

491
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,410
I forgot to go home and the guest stood spell-bound.

492
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,280
We followed where the music led to find the player.

493
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,070
Then the sounds stopped before a hesitant reply came.

494
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,650
Mooring my boat closer, I requested a face-to-face introduction.

495
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,460
Brought back the lamp, asked for more wine and drank again.

496
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,330
After countless calls, she finally showed herself.

497
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,150
Still clutching the pipa, her half-face hidden.

498
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,860
Bravo.

499
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,700
What a line, "After countless calls, she finally showed herself.“

500
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,950
What a talented man.

501
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,110
Here.

502
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,530
Drink this up,

503
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,670
and you can take the money away.

504
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,450
Talented, isn't he?

505
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,800
I... I'll drink for him.

506
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,960
I said I wanted to toast you.

507
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,360
I'll toast you.

508
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,180
I'll toast you.

509
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,040
Tu.

510
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,990
Mr. Tong.

511
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,340
Don't rain on my parade.

512
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,190
You brought him here.

513
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,290
He's a man. He should drink.

514
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,620
You're a woman. How can you

515
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,480
drink for him?

516
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,450
Feng Huanan. Feng Huanan!

517
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,020
What?

518
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,590
You can't accept it?

519
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,820
If you can't accept it, throw your money at me.

520
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,730
Not to mention just a bottle of alcohol,

521
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,770
I'll even call you grandpa if you want.

522
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,990
Do you have the money?

523
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,940
Kid, I'll teach you a lesson today.

524
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,540
A man should either be a coward or a hero.

525
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,820
What are you here for today?

526
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,570
You need to know what you really want.

527
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,170
If you want money,

528
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,720
then don't try to save face.

529
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,180
Understand?

530
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,290
Mr. Tong, are you really angry?

531
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,690
There's no need to stoop to his level.

532
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,510
Don't let him spoil our party.

533
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,060
Come on, come on.

534
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,400
Calm down.

535
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,240
Cheers.

536
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,480
Come on, come on.

537
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,260
Come on, come on.

538
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,000
Alright, come on, come on.

539
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,590
Alright, drink up.

540
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,750
Come on.

541
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,240
Come on.

542
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,530
Be careful.

543
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,660
Tu.

544
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,800
Come back.

545
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,570
Stand still.

546
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,150
This is yours.

547
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,710
Thank you, Mr. Tong.

548
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,370
This is the event fund.

549
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:33,970
As for the investment,

550
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,440
it depends on how you behave in the future.

551
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:48,960
Thank you, Mr. Tong.

552
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,380
Thank you, Mr. Tong.

553
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,980
I'll be off then.

554
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,580
Thank you, Sir.

555
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,920
Get up.

556
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,180
Get up.

557
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,890
What's wrong?

558
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,960
Do you feel uncomfortable?

559
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,190
Or do you feel humiliated?

560
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,530
Terribly humiliated!

561
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,880
Tell me.

562
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,760
I studied hard.

563
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,270
I worked diligently to improve myself.

564
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,270
What was it all for?

565
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,820
Wasn't it just for

566
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,110
living with a bit more dignity?

567
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,720
But look what happened tonight.

568
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,690
Reality slapped me so hard in the face.

569
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,440
The whole night, just for that stack of money on the table.

570
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,490
All my integrity and dignity

571
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,940
are completely gone!

572
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,360
Feng Huanan! Let me tell you.

573
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,160
Graduation is actually a weaning period.

574
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,940
Weaning.

575
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,600
Weaning.

576
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,270
Weaning is painful.

577
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,230
But after the pain,

578
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,490
you'll grow.

579
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,840
You'll mature.

580
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,830
And you'll become able to stand what you couldn't stand before,

581
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,270
accept what you couldn't accept,

582
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,030
and even fall in love with it.

583
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,130
Look, our socializing

584
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,990
tonight wasn't a waste of time,

585
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,060
right?

586
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,230
Take this.

587
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,010
Do you think it's money

588
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,030
or people that are dirty?

589
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,140
Both are dirty.

590
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,180
I... I...

591
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,580
Go ahead, throw it away.

592
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,520
Throw it away.

593
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,770
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

594
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,100
That old man has been fishing for a while.

595
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,020
Do you think he'll catch anything?

596
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,500
What do you think?

597
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,710
I think as long as he persists,

598
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,090
there'll be gains.

599
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,770
I suddenly miss my dad.

600
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,680
My dad is just like that old man.

601
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,900
For the harvest,

602
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,780
his feet were soaked in water year-round.

603
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,500
His feet were all wrinkled and damaged,

604
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,470
yet he was reluctant to spend money on medicine.

605
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,510
When I was little,

606
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,590
my mom ran off with another man

607
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,230
because my dad had no money.

608
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,120
In the end,

609
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,260
my dad and I only had each other.

610
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,360
I have to work hard to make money.

611
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
I need to support my family

612
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,810
and take care of my dad.

613
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,180
Because my dad has nothing but me.

614
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,070
So, you... You work so hard to make money

615
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,890
just for...

616
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,430
I'm not aiming for any grand goals.

617
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,970
I'm just trying to survive,

618
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,520
or rather, to live better.

619
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,350
Because I feel

620
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,290
only money can give me a sense of security.

621
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,910
Only by constantly making money every day

622
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,630
do I feel that my life isn't wasted,

623
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,510
and that each day of my life

624
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,540
has real, tangible value.

625
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,080
Take it.

626
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,920
Let's split it in half.

627
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,240
Living in this world is not easy.

628
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,010
Thank you for listening to me.

629
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,940
What does it feel like to have a crush on someone?

630
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,870
Is it like how you have feelings for Feng Huanan?

631
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,190
Did someone confess his love to you?

632
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,530
That scumbag.

633
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,010
I can't believe he was such a jerk even back in school.
