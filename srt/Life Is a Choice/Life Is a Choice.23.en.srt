[Let's not dwell on the past, just focus on the future]

4
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,670
Tu.

5
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,500
Why are you here?

6
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,420
I've been looking for you all night.

7
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,020
Tu!

8
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,030
What brings you here?

9
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,500
I've told Gu Nian.

10
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,259
I said I don't love her.

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,460
I love you.

12
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,220
Are you drunk?

13
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,100
I'm not drunk.

14
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,300
I just see myself clearly.

15
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,560
I've always loved you,

16
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,430
not Gu Nian.

17
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,300
I really can't

18
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,579
keep pretending to love Gu Nian

19
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,660
and live with her.

20
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,820
Right now, I don't want anything else,

21
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,500
I just want you.

22
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,060
I want us to be together.

23
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,020
Let's start over, okay?

24
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,620
Feng Huanan.

25
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,020
You've been planning to

26
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,060
marry Gu Nian

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,310
since school,

28
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,070
seeing her as your stepping stone.

29
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,100
You got what you wanted today.

30
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,540
So why are you telling me

31
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,810
all of this now?

32
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,170
It's not true.

33
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,670
Because I love you.

34
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,700
I just don't want to leave you.

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,820
I care about you too much.

36
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,510
I don't want to lose you again.

37
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,580
I know you well,

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,980
and I know Gu Nian.

39
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,020
Did you two fight?

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,860
Yes.

41
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,140
Because I told her the truth.

42
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,430
I told her I don't love her.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,700
I just can't

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
wear a mask

45
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,660
and pretend everything's fine with her.

46
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,460
I can't do that.

47
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,260
You're lying.

48
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,510
Did Gu Nian

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,060
find out the real reason you married her

50
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,540
and see through your fake persona?

51
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:47,820
No.

52
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,350
Am I right?

53
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:48,860
No.

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,340
Am I right?

55
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,820
No.

56
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,270
You're not being honest with me, huh?

57
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,540
Since you've already told her,

58
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,980
I'll just call her

59
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,860
and clear things up,

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,620
make sure there's no misunderstanding between us.

61
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,220
Tu, Tu…

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,510
Just forget about her, okay?

63
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,860
Did you forget

64
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,910
she was the one who took me from you?

65
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,500
She knew

66
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,580
we loved each other,

67
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,190
but still did everything

68
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,900
to marry me.

69
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,820
Let's just forget about her, alright?

70
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,980
Feng Huanan.

71
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,820
You really don't know

72
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,900
the relationship between me and Gu Nian, do you?

73
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,950
Gu Nian has never

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,180
hidden anything from me.

75
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,780
She told me everything,

76
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,380
how you liked her, chased her,

77
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,550
wanted to propose and marry her.

78
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,780
On the contrary,

79
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,540
I've been hiding

80
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
the real reason you wanted to marry her.

81
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,420
But I thought, if you married her

82
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,790
you'd treat her well,

83
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,150
and I could ease my guilt

84
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,400
and shame.

85
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,740
But today,

86
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,260
you came to me badmouthing Gu Nian.

87
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,780
How can you be so shameless?

88
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,180
You're right.

89
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,780
I'm shamless.

90
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,070
It's all my fault.

91
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,900
It's my bad.

92
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,270
I shouldn't have...

93
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,780
I shouldn't have said bad things about Gu Nian.

94
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,540
It's my fault.

95
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,350
I just want us to start over.

96
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,230
Is that okay, Tu?

97
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,500
All I want now is

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,380
for us to be together.

99
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,180
Don't you still have

100
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,830
plenty of big shots and resources?

101
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,660
Trust me.

102
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,500
We'll definitely make a comeback.

103
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,900
Trust me.

104
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,810
Okay, Tu?

105
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,550
Feng Huanan.

106
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,580
Am I, Lyu Tu, only someone who appears

107
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,390
when you want me and disappears when you don't?

108
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:37,980
Is that how you see me?

109
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,540
Am I that cheap to you?

110
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,420
When you wanted a stepping stone,

111
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,210
you married Gu Nian.

112
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,340
Gu Nian tore off your mask,

113
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,740
and now you're back to me, Lyu Tu,

114
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,180
to be your backup,

115
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,390
your second choice.

116
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,450
Am I really that cheap in your eyes?

117
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,610
Am I that obsessed with you?

118
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,250
Yes, you're obsessed with me!

119
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,500
Stop lying to yourself!

120
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,700
You love me!

121
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,910
Today is my wedding day.

122
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,790
Then why...

123
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,010
why did you drink so much?

124
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,210
You love me.

125
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,620
I know it's hard for you, Tu.

126
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,630
It's hard for me too.

127
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,340
All I think about now...

128
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,890
all I think about now is you.

129
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,620
All day today, you've been on my mind, Tu.

130
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,020
I miss you.

131
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,820
I miss you.

132
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,330
I miss you, Tu.

133
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,659
I mean it.

134
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,020
All you think about is me?

135
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,140
You're getting married,
becoming someone else's groom,

136
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,460
yet your mind still on me?

137
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,620
What?

138
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Do I, Lyu Tu,

139
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,700
have to be your mistress?

140
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,580
Do I have to accept

141
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,690
this secret love?

142
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,060
Am I that shameful?

143
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,730
Am I that cheap?

144
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,660
No, Tu.

145
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,510
I didn't mean it that way.

146
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,650
Then what do you mean by that?

147
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,900
Feng Huanan.

148
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,420
Let me tell you.

149
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,190
From now on,

150
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,900
I will not allow you

151
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,860
to slander Gu Nian in front of me ever again.

152
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,950
And I won't

153
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,340
let you belittle me again.

154
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,590
We're done, we'll never see each other again.

155
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,740
Tu.

156
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,060
Tu.

157
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,380
Tu!

158
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,659
Tu!

159
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,580
Tu!

160
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,620
Tu, Tu!

161
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,460
Let go of me!

162
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,140
Let go of me!

163
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,100
I don't believe you can just move on, Lyu Tu!

164
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,060
Mom.

165
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,860
Mom?

166
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,300
Nian, remember what I said.

167
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,590
Live in the moment.

168
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,810
[Lyu Tu]

169
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,260
Nian.

170
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,060
Can we meet?

171
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,580
Sure.

172
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
If you don't come to me,

173
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,120
I'll come to you.

174
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,230
Mom.

175
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,900
I understand.

176
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,960
Nian.

177
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,380
I know what you want to ask me.

178
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,100
Feng Huanan,

179
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,980
he did come to me,

180
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,110
and I did love him before.

181
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,310
But it's all in the past.

182
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,780
I haven't been involved in anything

183
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,830
between you two since you two were together.

184
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,730
I don't want to talk about Feng Huanan today.

185
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,410
You don't need to worry about hurting my dignity.

186
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,660
Actually, I don't even have any.

187
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,300
I know you're mad at me

188
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,020
for not telling you about Feng Huanan.

189
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,810
So I've decided.

190
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm going to tell you everything

191
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,390
about me and Feng Huanan today.

192
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,060
I'll tell you all the details.

193
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,300
I don't want any distance between us.

194
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,580
You're right, I'm mad at you.

195
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,310
I'm angry because

196
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,900
when I was at my lowest, the happiest,

197
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,780
and really wanted to see you,

198
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,620
you always avoided me.

199
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,510
What frustrates me even more is that,

200
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,940
when you were out there,

201
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,580
struggling and being exhausted,

202
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,020
you still chose

203
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,860
to avoid me.

204
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,660
We're supposed to be best friends.

205
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,380
Do you just want me

206
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,820
to see the good parts of your life?

207
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,220
It's true that

208
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,750
I want you to be happy,

209
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,170
but I don't want to just see the good side of you.

210
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,180
I want to be the first one to show up for you

211
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,170
when you need me the most.

212
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,380
We didn't get close because of Feng Huanan,

213
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,220
and we shouldn't

214
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
let him come between us.

215
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,420
We are still us.

216
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,950
So we are still us.

217
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,450
Actually, I'm really happy today

218
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,180
that you reached out to me.

219
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Do you know?

220
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,520
You're the girl in this world

221
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,500
who deserves all the love.

222
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,700
Tu,

223
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,100
I miss you.

224
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,490
I really miss you.

225
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,260
I thought you were here to cut ties with me.

226
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,100
I thought you were going to confront me.

227
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,910
But I didn't expect you to forgive me.

228
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,030
Nian,

229
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,460
I miss you too.

230
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,580
You're the one in this world

231
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,220
who deserves all the love.

232
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,350
You've always been so nice to me.

233
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,050
You fought for me,

234
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,990
and stood up for me.

235
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,940
I didn't mean to avoid you.

236
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,180
I just felt very guilty.

237
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,350
I couldn't face someone as good as you.

238
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,500
Silly.

239
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,970
We're all fine.

240
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,970
Look, just like this coffee.

241
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,430
I think...

242
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,470
this is still your favorite flavor.

243
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,780
Let's erase the distance between us.

244
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,580
Let's erase the distance between us.

245
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,030
Gu Nian.

246
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,760
Didn't you take time off for your honeymoon?

247
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,620
Why are you already back at work so soon

248
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,060
instead of enjoying your vacation?

249
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,390
There are things more important than my honeymoon.

250
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,180
By the way, is Director Su here?

251
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,140
Yes.

252
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,480
I'll go now.

253
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,530
[Director's Office]

254
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,660
Come in.

255
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,900
You...

256
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,990
Why are you here?

257
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,740
Well, have a seat.

258
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,740
Since you skipped

259
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,820
your honeymoon trip,

260
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,160
so what about Doudou you've been thinking about?

261
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,630
You were the boss of a big company.

262
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,100
Why did you come back with me

263
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,260
and start from scratch

264
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,910
as a small director?

265
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,820
What about you?

266
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,940
You were also the CEO

267
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,620
of a big company.

268
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,380
And you've got a happy marriage.

269
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,390
Why would you come back

270
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,690
and get caught up in this never-ending whirlwind?

271
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,400
Fine.

272
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,380
Let's skip this topic.

273
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,790
I'll tell you about my choice.

274
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,030
No matter what time you go back to,

275
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,420
I'll always go further than you.

276
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,430
I will give up everything

277
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,570
just to be with you, going back to every time

278
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,860
and every space.

279
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,420
If you're happy,

280
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,910
I won't bother you.

281
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,430
But if you're not,

282
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,580
I'll go after those people

283
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,850
who hurt you and take them down.

284
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,860
That's my choice.

285
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,010
That's why I came back with you.

286
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,230
Do you want to hear my choice?

287
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,260
Yes.

288
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,860
Do you remember this place?

289
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,740
This brings back a lot of memories.

290
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,820
Since the last time

291
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,510
I left here...

292
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,390
I think it's time

293
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,620
to return my body to Su Yin.

294
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,110
If you leave,

295
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,820
I'll be all alone again.

296
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,910
I'm here to resign.

297
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,550
Resign? What for?

298
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,780
Didn't the company fire me,

299
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,020
Su Yin, and Jiang Ze?

300
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,420
Oh, you mean the issue with Mr. Li?

301
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,140
Director Su has already handled it.

302
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,740
Your positions are safe,

303
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,460
and the project's still on.

304
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,300
He has handled it?

305
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,750
Yes.

306
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,460
I'm here to

307
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,980
sign this and wrap it up.

I remember we were alumni.

386
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,660

393

That's right. Back then, you were still Su Yin yourself.

I'll never forget you.

don't take it personal.

406
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,910
I may be a bit rude.

407
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,220
But here's the thing.

408
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,900
Last time, when the other version of me borrowed your body,

409
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,700
we were almost together every day.

410
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,340
You've been through a lot with me.

411
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm used to having you around.

412
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,060
So whenever I see you, it feels so comforting

413
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,220
and familiar.

414
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,820
I've forgotten that you're not me anymore.

415
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,950
Well...

416
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,330
it's okay.

417
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,400
Let's go our separate ways.

418

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,940
I must go.

563
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,820
If I can't be a doctor,

564
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,780
I could still be a psychologist,

565
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,770
or work as a cashier in a pharmacy.

566
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,850
There are so many options for me.

567
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
Medicine is not just about surgery,

568
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,340
right?

569
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,230
But the future...

570
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,420
Let future me deal with that.

571
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,610
Right now, I just want to live in the moment.

572
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,790
Are you satisfied with this answer?

573
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,060
Yes.

574
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,020
We'll get you there

575
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,020
for the surgery.

576
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,380
Hurry up, no time to waste.

577
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:38,960
Let's go.

578
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,920
Let's go.

579
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:51,360
[Outpatient]

580
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,420
You can go back.

581
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,820
So now you know my choice, right?

582
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,110
Yes.

583
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,750
Live in the moment.

584
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,770
This wasn't my choice,

585
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,980
it's what you told me.

586
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,180
Because I couldn't go back to the past,

587
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,830
I had no choice but to live in the moment.

588
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,300
No matter whose choice it was,

589
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
it's ours now.

590
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,340
Time really flies,

591
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,740
it's already been 7 years since we got married.

592
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,230
It really feels fast.

593
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,180
I've been thinking about making an application

594
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,860
that could slow down time,

595
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,860
so we could be together forever.

596
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,590
Wouldn't that turn us into old monsters?

597
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,880
Su Yin.

598
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,660
This kid looks like Doudou.

599
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,610
Doudou.

600
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,860
How did you know my name is Doudou?

601
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,650
Is she really Doudou?

602
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,690
My name is Doudou.

603
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,570
Doudou.

604
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,020
Where is your mother?

605
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,050
I'm here to find my mom.

606
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,910
Where is your mom then?

607
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,940
Mom says

608
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,060
there's a big chocolate factory in the sky,

609
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,800
and every piece of chocolate

610
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,500
is a baby.

611
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,590
She picks one of the chocolates

612
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,970
to be her kid.

613
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,060
I also want to pick one from the chocolate factory

614
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,510
to be my mom.

615
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,620
Can you pick one for me?

616
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,750
Later,

617
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,590
we'll take you

618
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,570
to eat chocolates, okay?

619
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,250
