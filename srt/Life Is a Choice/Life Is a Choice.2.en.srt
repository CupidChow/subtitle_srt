Look.

5
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,750
I really am Gu Nian.

6
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,110
I can't go back.

7
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,470
In my timeline,

8
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,950
I might already be dead.

9
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,000
I had no choice but to come to you.

10
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,820
Dude,

11
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,550
I'm a doctor.

12
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,460
I believe in science, okay?

13
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,580
How can you...

14
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,340
[Do you believe there's another you in this world?]

15
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,310
I've done all the tests.

16
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,230
All the psychiatrists said there's nothing wrong with me.

17
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,450
This is the truth.

18
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,930
This is science.

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,990
This is a repeatedly verified truth.

20
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,669
You need to look beyond the surface and see the essence.

21
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,430
The essence I see

22
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,030
is you using such a despicable method

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,150
to get girls' attention

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,760
and waste medical resources.

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm off work now. Get out.

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,280
I'll leave.

27
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,210
Lin Xi.

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,230
Keep your distance.

29
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,760
Listen to me carefully.

30
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,160
You're three years older than me.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,040
We grew up together.

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
You celebrated every one of my birthdays.

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,040
When we were little, after my dad passed away,

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,170
I lived at your house for a long time.

35
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,440
Once,

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,050
I accidentally broke a vase at your house

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,800
and found your dad's secret savings,

38
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,300
which is when I found out your dad was having an affair.

39
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,550
From then on, you no longer believed in love.

40
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,410
You swore you'd never choose marriage in this lifetime

41
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,290
and would dedicate yourself to medicine forever...

42
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:46,930
Shut up!

43
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,079
Gu Nian would never use these old scars

44
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,450
to hurt me again.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,530
I don't care where you got this information,

46
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,680
but I'm warning you,

47
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,620
if you dare to harass me again,

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,840
I'll call the police and have you arrested.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,400
Move aside.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,000
Keep moving.

51
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,890
Lin Xi, I really am Gu Nian.

52
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,770
Please believe me.

53
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,720
Is it all?

54
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,400
It's all.

55
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,220
I told you to bring some nice clothes

56
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:38,690
for me.

57
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,610
I usually wear just these few colors.

58
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,640
The people majoring in Computer Science have really terrible taste.

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,410
They look pretty nice to me.

60
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,960

Do you know what spatial computing is?

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,020
What's that?

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,730
It's...

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
Have you ever seen a device that,

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,250
when worn on your face,

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,370
puts you into a multidimensional space

68
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,830
where you can have immersive conversations?

69
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,960
And you can also use this device

70
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,330
as a medium to open a wormhole

71
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,810
to another time and place,

72
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,240
and then open a multidimensional space-time.

73
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,440
Multidimensional space-time, do you know what it is?

74
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,890
Boss,

75
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,060
this idea is amazing.

76
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,520
If you successfully invent this thing,

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,530
you will make history.

78
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,840
It hasn't been invented yet?

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,050
Of course not.

80
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,880
Don't worry,

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,370
I won't tell anyone about this.

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,390
The technology hasn't developed to that point yet?

83
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,460
Oh, no.

84
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,530
I really can't go back.

85
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,880

86
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,320
that there's another version of herself

87
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,370
from the future in this world?

88
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,720
There might be a way,

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
But I guess she'd have to take a hit on the head

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,240
like you did.

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
Think about it,

93

You got hit by a helmet, and your head got cracked open.

94
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,000
Does external force really help brain development?

95
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,430
Forget it, I'll figure it out myself.

96
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,190

97
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,760
I don't know.

Didn't you tell us

100
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,910
that thing is not safe?

101
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,130
Do you have any cash?

102
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,610
No, you still haven't paid me back for your hospital fee.

103
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,210
As you can see,

104
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,090
I can't unlock my phone right now,

105
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,310
so I can't use mobile payment.

106
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,800
Just lend me some cash.

107
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,370
I really don't have much left.

108
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,080
Ask your family for it.

109
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,520
Then it means you still have some.

110
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,570
Come on, lend me some.

111
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,800
This is all I have.

112
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,310
Record it. I'll pay you back.

113
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,930
Gao Ren, you must have more.

114
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,970
I really don't.

115
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,360
You're lying to me, aren't you?

116
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,130
I'm not.

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,090
You must have more.

118
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,680

He's the male lead in that legendary love story,

191
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,230
right?

192
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,570
Don't say anything reckless.

193
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,590
You know what?

194
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,850
He broke up,

195
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,270
and today he got beaten up for no reason.

196
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,410
Don't make things worse.

197
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,410
Alright, alright.

198
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,450
The male lead has turned into a fallen prince, right?

199
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,190
Where is he?

200
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,880
He went to the bathroom.

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,480
You came back last night?

202
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,960
I thought you didn't come back.

203
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,440
If I had known, I would have brought you along.

204
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,110
Don't even mention it.

205
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,960
I thought I'd be able to come back earlier,

206
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,560
but those people can really drink.

207
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,570
They drank all the way until morning.

208
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,290
But they were quite generous.

209
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,250
Look.

210
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,220
Do you remember this dress?

211
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,490
Isn't this the dress you didn't buy last time when we went shopping together

212
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,560
because you thought it was too expensive?

213
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,880
Yeah, I bought it.

214
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,480
Come on, Tu.

215
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,770
I don't think this is a long-term solution.

216
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,330
Have you thought about changing jobs?

217
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,760
You don't know.

218
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,810
Working at the KTV is just a stepping stone for me.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
Once I save enough money,

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,280
I'll learn to play golf

221
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,650
and become a caddy.

222
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,040
It's all about moving up step by step.

223
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,700
Can I eat?

224
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,410
I'm starving.

225
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,870
Wait a second. It's impolite.

226
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,340
Have some water.

227
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,630
You're really

228
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,030
a heartless woman.

229
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
Come on.

230
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,800
Well, Nan, let me introduce you.

231
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,990
This is my best friend

232
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,260
and roommate, Lyu Tu.

233
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,370
And this is

234
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,720
our drama club president, Feng Huanan.

235
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,020
Nice to meet you.

236
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,340
Nice to meet you.

237
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,080
Nan, thanks for getting my helmet back.

238
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,480
I'll treat you to this meal today.

239
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,530
How can that be?

240
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,040
How can I let a girl pay?

241
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,870
Thanks, miss.

242
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,400
What's wrong? Who is it?

243
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,120
The lunatic who hit you this morning.

244
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,090
He keeps calling me.

245
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,970
Is he crazy?

246
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,320
Oh my, now that you mention it,

247
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,080
I should definitely treat you.

248
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,250
You helped me so much.

249
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,120
We can't let someone who just broke up treat us.

250
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,410
Come on. Is my little matter

251
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,130
really that big of a deal?

252
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,660
About your little matter,

253
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,690
I've already heard three versions of it.

254
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,910
So the truth

255
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:29,920
has to come from you,

256
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,490
the person involved.

257
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm telling you,

258
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
the truth is usually the most boring version.

259
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,410
Sometimes, you want to be with someone forever,

260
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,130
but the other person might not feel the same way.

261
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,040
Why does it sound like

262
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,170
your ex is a bit of a player?

263
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,270
It's not that.

264
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,200
It's just that we want different things.

265
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,200
Everyone has their own aspirations.

266
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,330
So what's up with your face?

267
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,240
This?

268
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,570
It's all thanks to that crazy person.

269
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,550
Well,

270
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,940
I'm going out for a bit.

271
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,930
Where are you going? We're eating.

272
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,850
Wait for me.

273
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,540
Come back soon.

274
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,960
You guys ordered all this?

275
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,770
Yeah.

276
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,070
These are the dishes that Nian and I love the most.

277
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,660
It's good. You guys have a good appetite.

278
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,170
Xi, you're back.

279
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Put the knife down!

280
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,420
How do you know where I live? Stop!

281
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,660
These are scissors.

282
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,240
Of course I know you live here.

283
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,260
Have you forgotten?

284
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,400
I accompanied you to meet several real estate agents back then.

285
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,340
Only this house was available for full rent and wasn't facing a street.

286
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,360
What exactly do you want?

287
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,530
It's not on the first floor, so it has no bad smells.

288
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,970
It's not on the top floor, so there's no risk of leaks.

289
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,680
The bathroom has separate dry and wet areas, so the shower is independent.

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,490
If it weren't for the homeowner's urgent need to go abroad

291
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,520
to take care of her elderly mother,

292
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,890
you wouldn't have stumbled upon this bargain.

293
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,650
You didn't install surveillance in my house, did you?

294
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,960
Xi, we live in a socialist society

295
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,930
and grew up in a time of peace and prosperity.

296
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,570
Believing in science is the right thing to do.

297
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,770
But it happened.

298
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,440
I don't know why.

299
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,380
Although it's shocking,

300
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,670
it might not be a bad surprise.

301
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,410
Don't you

302
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,050
want Gu Nian to live a happy life

303
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,600
under the guidance of a sage?

304
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,030
You can consider me a sage if you want.

305
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,520
What are you talking about? What sage?

306
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:21,920
I don't understand.

307
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,720
I'm telling you,

308
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,800
if you don't explain clearly

309
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
how you know the situation of my house,

310
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,410
I'll call the police right away.

311
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,050
Gu Nian. I am Gu Nian.

312
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,130
I really am Gu Nian.

313
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,090
What?

314
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
Lin Xi, don't, don't call the police.

315
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,210
Lin Xi, don't. I'm Gu Nian.

316
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:38,850
What are you doing?

317
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,880
I really am Gu Nian!

318
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,760
Lunatic! Let go of me!

319
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:42,880
Do you remember

320
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
the band-aid we used when we played pretend as kids?

321
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,290
Look. When we were kids playing pretend,

322
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,640
you were the doctor, and I was the patient.

323
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,640
You stuck the band-aid on my head,

324
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,180
and we couldn't get it off.

325
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,230
I had to cut my hair short.

326
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,280
Do you remember that?

327
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,920
Dr. Lin, you're off work?

328
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,930
Are you dating?

329
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,890
This young man seems really nice.

330
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,090
You young people don't like cooking.

331
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,360
Why don't you come and eat at my place?

332
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,970
Sure.

333
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
Carry the vegetables for her.

334
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,620
Let me do it.

335
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,720
Smooth, young man.

336
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,400
I'll make you stir-fried vegetables and braised pork.

337
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,920
Okay.

338
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,560
They're delicious.

339
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,850
I haven't eaten today.

340
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,080
I guarantee you'll have two more bowls of rice.

341
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,880
Sure thing.

342
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,800
Ma'am, I'm not going.

343
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,360
Aren't you going to have the braised pork?

344
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,800
Lin Xi,

345
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,050
I'll definitely find Gu Nian

346
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,760
and get her a new husband

347
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,120
and a new life.

348
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,570
What are you doing?

349
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,840
If you don't go out now, I'll call the police.

350
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,330
I'm warning you.

351
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,330
Get out of here right now!

352
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,010
Xi, look!

353
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,480
They're from your graduation trip.

354
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,100
I took these two for you.

355
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,410
There's more.

356
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,080
Where's the box? Did you throw it away?

357
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,650
What box?

358
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,280
The white box.

359
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,540
The one we made together when we were kids.

360
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,690
There it is. You really didn't throw it away.

361
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,200
This one was made by you.

362
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,880
And you gave this one to me.

363
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,850
Do you remember?

364
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
When you were in fourth grade,

365
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,880
I played in the mud in a skirt,

366
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
came home late,

367
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,840
and got beaten by my dad.

368
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,250
And you argued with your mom

369
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,160
because you did poorly on an exam.

370
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,010
We promised each other to run away from home together.

371
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,800
That night, I waited for you

372
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,530
under the slide all night,

373
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,360
but you didn't show up.

374
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,050
The next day, you told me that

375
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,400
you actually forgot about our plan to run away

376
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,010
because of two Olympiad math problems.

377
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,390
You still remember such a thing?

378
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,750
Of course I remember.

379
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,970
I got bitten by mosquitoes all night long.

380
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,860
You...

381
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,010
really are Gu Nian?

382
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,070
Gu Nian from seven years later?

383
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,740
Lin Xi!

384
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,720
I've missed you so much.

385
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,880
What's wrong with you?

386
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,160
The waiter was carrying it just fine.

387
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,560
Why did you have to grab it?

388
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,680
Why weren't you more careful?

389
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
Look at my dress. I just bought it today.

390
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,080
I thought he couldn't carry that many dishes.

391
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,110
I was just trying to help.

392
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,480
Help? But you spilled it all over me.

393
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,710
Here, use my clothes to cover it up for now.

394
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,480
What good can your clothes do?

395
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,640
Wait, what's going on here?

396
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,730
Did you spill food on yourself?

397
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,730
On myself?

398
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,420
He spilled it.

399
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
It's okay, I'll take it to the dry cleaners.

400
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,560
They can definitely get it clean.

401
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,730
I saved up for a whole month to buy this,

402
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,180
and now it's ruined.

403
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,370
Don't be so loud.

404
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,640
Why are you giving him such a hard time?

405
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,060
I'll buy you a new one.

406
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
No way. Why should you buy it?

407
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,920
Whoever made it dirty should be the one to do it.

408
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,960
Fine,

409
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:01,840
I'll compensate you.

410
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,680
Add me on WeChat right now,

411
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,730
so you don't run away later.

412
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:05,560
Don't worry,

413
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,369
I won't run away.

414
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,690
Just tell me how much it costs,

415
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,400
and I'll pay you back.

416
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,250
I want cash, cash only.

417
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,680
Okay, no problem.

418
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,089
What are you doing?

419
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,680
Shush.

420
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
There's no need for this.

421
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,050
Gu Nian,

422
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,280
I have something to do.

423
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll be leaving now.

424
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,079
Pay the bill.

425
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,890
I've already paid.

426
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,950
Wait.

427
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,120
Sit down and have something to eat first.

428
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,640
Have something to eat first.

429
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,370
Where are you going?

430
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,280
Wait for me, wait for me.

431
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,390
Nan, Nan.

432
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,680
Nan, don't be angry.

433
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,730
My friend was just kidding.

434
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,160
I just went out and bought some medicine for you.

435
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,090
Medicine? What medicine?

436
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,850
Didn't you get hit in the face today?

437
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,650
I bought you some medicine.

438
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,440
You stepped in to save me,

439
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,570
and then bought me medicine.

440
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,770
I feel embarrassed.

441
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,680
But the way you handle things

442
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,170
doesn't really match the Gu Nian in the rumors.

443
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,250
What's Gu Nian like in the rumors?

444
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,780
A tomboy or a tough guy?

445
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,090
Oh, right.

446
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,660
I actually went to the drama club to find you today

447
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,640
for something important.

448
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,730
The list

449
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,880
for last year's financial aid just came out,

450
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
and your name is on it.

451
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,720
The teacher asked me to get your signature.

452
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,840
But with everything that happened today, I forgot about it.

453
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,290
Financial aid?

454
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,120
I don't need it now.

455
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm about to graduate,

456
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,880
so the financial aid should go to someone who needs it more.

457
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,930
Why?

458
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,210
Your name is on the list.

459
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,240
Why don't you want it?

460
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,210
If I take it,

461
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,340
it'll make it look like I didn't make any progress

462
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,820
during these four years of college.

463
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,660
Right?

464
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,300
Alright then. Just keep the medicine.

465
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,050
Okay.

466
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,240
I'll respectfully comply then.

467
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,980
Thank you.

468
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,530
How's your wrist? Is it better?

469
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,870
It's nothing serious.

470
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,680
Oh, by the way,

471
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,530
why didn't I see you at the hospital today?

472
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,490
It's just a small injury, nothing serious,

473
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,550
so I didn't go to the hospital.

474
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,590
By the way, who was that crazy person?

475
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,040
I got beaten up for no reason.

476
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,570
I need to find a chance

477
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,360
to get back at him.

478
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,330
You'd better not.

479
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,760
I think that guy definitely has some mental issues.

480
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,560
Don't mess with people like that.

481
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,490
Lin Xi.

482
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,230
What?

483
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,130
I'm leaving now.

484
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,300
Okay, okay. I'll be right there.

485
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,800
My purse!

486
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,500
My purse!

487
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,380
What's wrong?

488
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,250
Keep eating.

489
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,410
Wait, you're leaving?

490
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,960
You're not eating?

491
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,690
But we ordered so much.

492
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,170
Lin Xi!

493
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,930
What's going on?

494
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,250
I'll call an ambulance.

495
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,800
I've already called.

496
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,330
Come on. What's wrong with him?

497
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,920
He doesn't want to live anymore. He wants to die.

498
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,240
He just took sleeping pills.

499
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,970
I'm useless.

500
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,640
Are you okay?

501
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,150
I'm useless, Gu Nian.

502
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,490
You don't believe me.

503
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,920
I can't change your life,

504
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,820
and I can't sever the fate between you and Feng Huanan.

505
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,400
I came back desperately from the future

506
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,680
to tell you that

507
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,360
Feng Huanan is definitely not a good match for you.

508
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,460
Gu Nian, I know you like Feng Huanan.

509
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,260
But if you can live selfishly for once,

510
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,120
I hope

511
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,510
you'll choose someone who loves you.

512
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,140
Gu Nian.

513
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,680
Gu Nian,

514
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,410
after I leave,

515
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,350
you must stay away from Feng Huanan.

516
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,950
Don't participate in any activities with him.

517
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,060
Staying away from him is loving yourself.

518
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,380
He really can't make it.

519
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,760
Wait a moment.

520
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,290
Your acting is so fake.

521
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,780
She believed it.

522
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,320
Gu Nian, after I leave,

523
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,890
you must listen to Lin Xi.

524
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,770
I'm back. Here.

525
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,540
Drink it.

526
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,550
What kind of water is this?

527
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,750
Dishwashing liquid water.

528
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,370
You need to throw up the pills you took.

529
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,110
If you die, how are we going to talk?

530
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,380
Hurry up and drink.

531
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,500
You're really trying to kill yourself?

532
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,940
Not bad, huh?

533
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Lin Xi, what did you tell me?

534
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,830
You said he followed you home and then,

535
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,460
when his threats didn't work, he threatened to commit suicide.

536
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,090
You two are quite good at making up stories.

537
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,780
I should be the one playing along with your act...

538
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,690
Stop.

539
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,520
As expected of a clever medical student like you.

540
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,290
You thought of using vitamins as sleeping pills.

541
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,490
Impressive.

542
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,070
You really went all out with the act.

543
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,500
What's in your mouth?

544
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,990
Toothpaste foam.

545
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,440
I was afraid you'd smell it,

546
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
so I didn't even dare to use the mint-flavored one.

547
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,080
Pretty meticulous.

548
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,290
Enough. Stop being so harsh on Lin Xi.

549
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,350
It was my idea.

550
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,650
It was his idea to begin with.

551
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,450
I just let him use the place.

552
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,290
Come on, you really forced water down my throat?

553
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,470
What if you had ended up drowning me?

554
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,200
How did you figure it out?

555
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,640
You're a doctor.

556
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,580
He was very logical just now.

557
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,350
And...

558
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,190
-who would try to commit suicide wearing slippers?
-Who would try to commit suicide wearing slippers?

559
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,640
You know it and you still wore them?

560
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,510
Put away that creepy look of yours.

561
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,810
Tell me, how did you deceive Lin Xi?

562
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,880
Get up.

563
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,670
Nian, stop hitting him!

564
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,410
Nian, stop hitting him!

565
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:22,970
Xi, help!

566
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,930
He...

567
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,040
He might really be the future you.

568
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,850
How is that possible?

569
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,000
Lin Xi, come here.

570
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,770
Use your clever brain and think about it.

571
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,170
He must be deceiving us.

572
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,980
He must be plotting something bad.

573
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,780
Get out!

574
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,150
Get out!

575
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,420
I told you to buy slippers one size larger, but you didn't listen.

576
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,030
At least now I could wear them comfortably.

577
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,160
Lin Xi bought them for me.

578
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,760
Take them off.

579
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,460
Fine.

580
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,390
If you really are me,

581
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,290
then you should know

582
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,830
I wouldn't believe your words

583
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,970
or these little tricks.

584
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Say something that can make me believe you.

585
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,310
What do you mean?

586
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,950
You have the habit of washing the left side first when you shower.

587
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,410
Your menstrual cycle is always exactly 28 days,

588
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,380
more accurate than an alarm clock.

589
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,960
Your birthmark is on the inner side of your right thigh.

590
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Since you were little, you've had digestive issues.

591
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,780
If you eat too late or too cold,

592
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,680
you always get indigestion

593
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,450
and constantly fart.

594
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:01,970
And...

595
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,550
Stop, stop, stop.

596
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,570
Let's say what you said is true,

597
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,360
but I still don't know

598
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,230
who's the person that lent you his body.

599
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,800
I only know that he's called Su Yin.

600
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,470
But we can look into this together.

601
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,130
I must be out of my mind

602
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,790
to listen to your nonsense.

603
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,880
Come on, Lin Xi,

604
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,820
let's call the police.

605
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,100
Scammers are getting too bold nowadays.

606
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,130
Why are you accusing me of scamming?

607
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,070
What have I scammed you of?

608
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,920
Your money? Or your body?

609
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
Where's the evidence?

610
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,430
To be honest, with our appearance,

611
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,010
if it weren't for our straightforwardness and loyalty,

612
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,230
getting Feng Huanan,

613
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,420
the "prince of the slums," would indeed be beyond our reach.

614
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,650
The way he talks is exactly the same as yours.

615
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,560
Don't talk to me about science.

616
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,600
This is too unscientific.

617
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,020
If you still don't believe me,

618
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,240
I'll tell you one more thing.

619
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,160
You didn't go to the cafeteria.

620
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,280
You went somewhere else, right?

621
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,770
And you went there on a motorcycle.

622
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,040
How did you know that?

623
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,820
Because...

624
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,930
I think I watched you leave.

625
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,250
Anyway, I am you.

626
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,890
I know how stubborn you can be.

627
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
If I weren't so stupid

628
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
and had any sense,

629
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,280
would I have ended up regretting marrying Feng Huanan?

630
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,670
So, what happened after I married Feng Huanan?

631
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,450
Why are you curious about that?

632
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,150
It's a cursed fate!

633
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,010
Is it his curse or mine?

634
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,700
Yes.

635
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,360
This look of caring for a fool.

636
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,650
You two really are alike.

637
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,020
-Who are you calling a fool?
-Who are you calling a fool?

638
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm a fool.

639
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,210
I am.

640
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Gu Nian, I know you like Feng Huanan,

641
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,410
but I can tell you with full responsibility

642
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,150
that if you insist on being with him,

643
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,600
you'll lose everything,

644
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,130
including your mother

645
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,610
and your daughter with him.

646
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,430
And Feng Huanan will be killed by your own hands.

647
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,380
Well...

648
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,440
You... you saw that

649
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,640
I didn't go to the cafeteria, didn't you?

650
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,040
Although I had a meal with Feng Huanan,

651
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,780
it wasn't a pleasant meal.

652
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,880
He even spilled soup on Lyu Tu.

653
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,800
Lyu Tu?

654
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,250
Fortunately, it was Lyu Tu.

655
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,480
Otherwise, it would have been you who bumped into Feng Huanan

656
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,650
and got soup spilled all over you.

657
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,380
He would have lent you his clothes.

658
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,170
You'd have washed them and returned them to him,

659
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,450
helped him apply for the financial aid,

660
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,490
and accompanied him to student union charity events.

661
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,960
And then, you two would have ended up together.

662
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,920
Now that he lent his clothes to Lyu Tu,

663
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,370
is the problem solved?

664
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,950
I don't know about that.

665
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,100
Pass it!

666
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,710
Mine! Mine! Mine!

667
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,170
Defense! Defense!

668
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,200
Take a shot!

669
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,240
It's okay, it's okay.

670
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,210
It's a good chance.

671
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,490
Nice shot. Nice shot.

672
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,590
President, there's a girl looking for you.

673
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,920
Let's stop here.

674
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,500
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

675
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,290
You're leaving?

676
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:35,790
Bye.

677
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,000
Bye. Bye. Bye.

678
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,350
Bye. Bye. Bye.

679
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,580
Why are you here?

680
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,140
Why do you look so down?

681
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,380
You haven't gotten over your breakup yet?

682
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,020
Do you think a deeply painful breakup

683
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,330
is something you can just let go of that easily?

684
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,130
I feel like

685
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,370
you're not sad because of the breakup.

686
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,120
You're sad

687
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,730
because you invested so much time and emotion,

688
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,610
but in the end,

689
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,770
you got nothing from your ex-girlfriend.

690
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,930
You think it was all for nothing,

691
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,940
right?

692
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm right.

693
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,760
I knew it.

694
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,050
What? You're talking nonsense!

695
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,050
I'm not talking nonsense.

696
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm just telling the truth.

697
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,710
I washed it.

698
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,800
I also patched up the tear for you.

699
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
You're from my hometown?

700
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,680
I originally thought

701
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,640
you two were a golden couple.

702
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,040
In the end, I realized

703
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,290
it's just the old cliché:

704
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,130
a poor boy falling in love with a rich girl.

705
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,090
Let me tell you,

706
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,100
what we had was true love.

707
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,490
True love, do you understand?

708
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,480
What true love?

709
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,710
If you truly loved her,

710
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,240
why didn't you go abroad with her?

711
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,660
Even if you hadn't been able to go abroad,

712
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,680
at least you could have ridden a shared bike

713
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
and gone to the airport to tell her,

714
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,940
"I really love you."

715
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,150
Let me tell you,

716
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,990
love isn't the sentimental romance

717
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,070
that you imagine.

718
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,940
And it's not like everyone's experience of love

719
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,880
is as direct,

720
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,020
straightforward, and shallow as yours.

721
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,280
That's not love.

722
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,330
True love

723
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,280
is simple and direct.

724
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,480
It's human nature.

725
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,560
If I had your knowledge

726
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,640
and your academic background,

727
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,040
I'd definitely go after a rich woman.

728
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,720
But why would someone with money

729
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,890
give you money from the start?

730
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,070
Money in her hands

731
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,900
means power in her hands.

732
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,550
If she gives you money, can you hold on to it?

733
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,320
It depends on

734
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,260
who'll find a foolish rich person first.

735
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,170
Where's my money?

736
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,810
What? You're unwilling to give it to me?

737
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,800
It's...

738
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,160
What?

739
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,130
Is this enough?

740
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,880
What do you mean?

741
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,040
It's all there, not a single penny less.

742
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,940
Come on, who uses cash these days?

743
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,710
Why do you need so much cash anyway?

744
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,070
You don't understand. Only what you can hold in your hands is real money.

745
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,830
The balance on your phone is just a number.

746
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,510
Here, take this.

747
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,480
I'm leaving now.

748
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,430
I'll be fined if I'm late for work. Bye.

749
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,110
Changing your fate by saving money is too slow.

750
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,120
If you want to try a different way,

751
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,490
contact me on WeChat.

752
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,520
I'll think about it.

753
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,000
Let me explain.

754
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,780
Stop right here.

755
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,680
From what I can see now,

756
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,180
you're just a crazy secret admirer and a stalker.

757
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,410
I admit you're a little bit special,

758
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,870
but your brain isn't working properly.

759
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,600
I've never stalked you.

760
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,490
That's all my own real experience.

761
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,640
We have the same past.

762
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,390
Okay, okay, okay.

763
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,830
I take back what I just said.

764
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,480
You're a really good person,

765
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,810
very pure,

766
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,010
and so good to me.

767
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,230
So, thank you.

768
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,650
Let go of yourself

769
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,090
and let go of me, okay? Thank you.

770
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,130
What?

771
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,400
Your ringtone is actually a song I sang?

772
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,910
You still don't dare to admit it. Coward.

773
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,000
Yes, I like you.

774
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,990
Yes, I'm pursuing you.

775
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,330
Didn't you ask me who I am?

776
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,790
I'll tell you the answer today.

777
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,200
Gao Ren, tell her who I am.

778
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
This is why you asked me

779
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,090
to call you?

780
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,860
Jiang! Jiang!

781
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,120
So what do you want me to say?

782
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,960
What major is Su Yin in? What does he do?
