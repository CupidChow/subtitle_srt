00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,110

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,870
to spend other people's money on yourself.

00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,710
Jiang?

00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,170
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,670
Waiting for you.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,740
Come on, let's go upstairs.

10
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,470
Haven't you had dinner yet?

11
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,630
You bought so many things.

12
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,510
I bought a lot of things.

13
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,710
I'm not in the mood right now

14
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,310
to talk about Feng Huanan's life trajectory with you.

15
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,060
I wish I could tear him apart alive.

16
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,310
But sometimes

17
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,140
I still find him quite charming.

18
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,190
I really want to give myself a good slap.

19
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,670
I had some doubts before,

20
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,180
but after hearing you say this,

21
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,590
I'm even more certain

22
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,710
that you are the real Gu Nian, no doubt.

23

24
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,490
I better not say more.

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,200
I might get punched.

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,390
Just say it.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,960
Let's talk about me.

28
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:41,260
Will I really become as awesome as you say in the future?

29
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,020
Everything I told Gu Nian was true.

30
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,050
A business elite, golden bachelor.

31
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,660
So looks like I've succeeded in my startup.

33
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,270
I know what you're thinking.

34
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,090
You're not allowed to start a business with Feng Huanan.

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,210
But if I don't start a business,

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,660
won't you look down on me even more?

37
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,240
Well, actually...

38
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,550
You're a gem.

39
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,910
You'll shine wherever you go.

40
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,470
Moreover, in the end,

41
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,100
you still parted ways with Feng Huanan

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,940
and went off to start your own business.

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,190
Isn't that the same if you start on your own

44
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,910
from the beginning?

45
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,190
Don't worry, am I the kind of person

46
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,930
who would do anything to achieve my goals?

47
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,790
Besides,

48
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,900
Feng Huanan and I don't graduate in the same year.

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,900
When the time comes, I'll just find an excuse

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,740
and turn him down.

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Don't forget.

52
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,040
You still need to keep pursuing Gu Nian.

53

54

when it comes to matters of the heart,

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,710
they can't be one-sided.

56
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,150
It's obvious

57
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,340
that neither the current you nor the future you

58
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,510

82
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,780
I've never seen a sight like this before!

83
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,600
To think of all the great guys I missed out on back then!

84
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,230

85
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,450
Come back here.

86
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,820
Can't you have some self-respect?

87
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,870
You're in a man's body now.

88
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,590
When you go in, don't stare at those men.

89

90
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,190

91
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,960
Go then.

you were just unreliable,

116

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,510
He's just a lunatic.

188
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,190
And because of him,

189
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,900
starting tomorrow, I have to play a tree.

190
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,090
Can you believe it?

191
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,310
Then,

192
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,450
let's just stick to the most objective facts.

193
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,560
He, his speech is quite clear, isn't it?

194
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,300
His thinking is quite sharp, right?

195
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,990
Even the psychiatric department couldn't find

196
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,910
any problems with him.

197
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,630
That's pretty scientific.

198
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,270
That's the biggest problem.

199
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,450
I've looked it up online.

200
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,870
All these stories about time travel to fix regrets,

201
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,780
they all say

202
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,950
it'd only happen as a dying person

203
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,710
enters the body of another dying person.

204
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,030
I've checked it all out.

205
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,270
He's been in perfect health since he entered university.

206
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,470
So if the future me is in his body,

207
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,300
what about his own self?

208
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,350
Well, you have a point there.

209
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,390
Lin Xi.

210
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,480
Does your hospital have a lie detector?

211
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,880
You've been watching too many TV dramas.

212
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,760
So,

213
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,620
I think you

214
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,580
should get your head checked.

215
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,010
Otherwise, how could you believe him?

216
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,230
Both of your handwriting is identical.

217
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,400
Look.

218
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,090
Why don't you write something?

219
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
See for yourself.

220
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,690
No way.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,470
No, I need to have this professionally examined.

222
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,230
How can they be exactly the same?

223
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,720
This is impossible.

224
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:36,980
Xi.

225
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,690
I'm really conflicted.

226
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,810
Don't be too ridiculous.

227
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,900
Can't you be more conflicted than I am?

228
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,370
I'm grateful that I wasn't that stupid before,

229
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,210
but it's precisely because I wasn't that stupid

230
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,720
that I'm really at a loss now.

231
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,810
Now you think you're not stupid.

232
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,850
Then what?

233
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,010
You're dragging me into the middle of all this.

234
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,290
Who am I supposed to talk to about this?

235
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,010
Nian,

236
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,320
I don't know what you've been through

237
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,010
all these years

238
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,780
to become the way you are now,

239
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,300
but you've really changed a lot

240
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,770
from the person I used to know.

241
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,840
Xi,

242
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,960
which one do you think is more clear-headed,

243
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,420
the past me or the current me?

244
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,850
You should ask,

245
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,890
"Which one is more carefree?"

246
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,010
Am I really that incapable of letting go?

247
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,290
You've seen it yourself.

248
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,210
Your past self would sometimes act like a little girl,

249
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,490
experiencing countless emotions in a single day.

250
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,800
But you could quickly heal and recover on your own.

251
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,940
Open and genuine.

252
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,290
When you liked something, you weren't afraid to show it.

253
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,530
When you disliked something, you made it clear.

254
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,610
You're right.

255
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,690
But I really don't know what to do anymore.

256
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,410
You've seen it yourself.

257
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,700
She doesn't believe it when I show up with the same dressing style and preferences.

258
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,650
She doesn't believe it either when you show her the same handwriting.

259
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,720
My future memories stop at the hospital.

260
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,650
They stripped everything

261
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,450
off me in the emergency room.

262
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,250
You should know yourself better than I do.

263
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,090
Why don't you try to put yourself in your past self's shoes?

264
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,970
You mean... seeing is believing?

265
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,530
But I don't know

266
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,050
when Feng Huanan started

267
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,090
turning into such a scumbag.

268
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,130
Nian.

269
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,810
Do you remember what happened with my father?

270
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,370
Xi, don't think about it.

271
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,010
I didn't mean it that way.

272
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,010
No, this is important.

273
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,210
Actually, I want to figure out

274
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,410
what exactly happened.

275
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,730
Trust me.

276
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,970
When you discover that a man

277
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,200
has already cheated,

278
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,410
it's definitely not something that just happened.

279
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,810
Every time it was brought up...

280
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,210
I feel so sad.

281
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,010
I think I should take a shower

282
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,130
to wash away all the bad luck on me.

283
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,810
Right?

284
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,450
What?

285
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:12,890
Yes.

286
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,250
I'm going to take a shower then, Xi.

287
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,250
No, Gu Nian, don't go too far!

288
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,260
Don't use my towel!

289
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
You're a man now!

290
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,610
You go ahead. I'll handle it.

291
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,830
President.

292
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,660
Everything you asked for is ready.

293
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,150
Alright.

294
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,900
President, let's go get something to eat.

295
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,810
I haven't had breakfast yet.

296
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,690
I'll keep setting up.

297
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,490
You guys go ahead.

298
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,420
Don't worry about me.

299
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,370
Let's go together.

300
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,940
You go first. I'm not hungry.

301
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,570
Then, how about we bring you some soup dumplings?

302
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,260
Okay.

303
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,330
Alright.

304
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,250
We're off then.

305
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,490
Okay, don't eat too much.

306
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,170
We have a rehearsal later.

307
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,850
Got it.

308
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,810
We're off.

309
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,810
Wh-when did you get here?

310
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,740
You walk so quietly.

311
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,610
Here, catch it.

312
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,400
You've done an amazing job with this.

313
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,650
Let me show you.

314
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,410
Watch this.

315
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,220
Here we go.

316
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,130
How did you come up with the idea of using fishing line?

317
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,780
When I was little, my mom, for some reason,

318
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,980
really wanted to use my dad's

319
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,490
old fishing line to string chili peppers.

320
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,490
And then,

321
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,250
after stringing them, she would, like this,

322
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,580
hang them out in the wind like this.

323
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,650
And at that time, I,

324
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,410
I'd stand underneath with my eyes closed,

325
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,770
spinning around and around.

326
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,650
I would just keep spinning.

327
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,530
Then I'd open my eyes.

328
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,770
When I opened them, I'd find

329
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,770
it looked like there were real clouds,

330
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,690
white clouds floating in the sky.

331
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
It was so magical.

332
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,610
After hearing you say that, I could even smell

333
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,650
the aroma of

334
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,880
chili pepper skins filling the air.

335
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,770
And in my mind, I can see

336
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,280
Grandma using a bamboo sieve

337
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,230
to separate the dried peppers and seeds.

338
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,560
Then she'd heat up oil by the stove

339
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,910
and add

340
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,330
Sichuan peppercorns, star anise,

341
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,690
cinnamon, and sesame seeds,

342
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,290
roasting the chili seeds until they became crispy and fragrant

343
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,700
and pouring them all into a jar to make spicy five-spice seasoning!

344
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,090
Are you homesick?

345
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,840
No.

346
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,570
If I told you

347
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,390
I've never been homesick, would you believe me?

348
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,980
Sure, why wouldn't I?

349
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,120
Not everyone's home

350
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,450
is warm and sweet.

351
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,580
If you don't miss home, it's a problem with your home,

352
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,420
not with you.

353
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,450
Oh, let me tell you,

354
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,170
when I first got to university,

355
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,330
during the first week,

356
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,020
all my dormmates cried

357
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,530
because they were homesick.

358
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,340
I was the only one who didn't cry.

359
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,090
I felt really happy and excited at the time.

360
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,450
Because I felt like I was finally free.
-Free!

361
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,250
Right?

362
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,810
Let me tell you something:

363
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,050
I never went back home after the college entrance exam.

364
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,490
Because I felt

365
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,090
that I hadn't amounted to much academically.

366
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,480
I was too embarrassed to go back.

367
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,090
It would be so humiliating to return.

368
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,220
Me too. I don't like going back home either.

369
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,570
But sometimes

370
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,340
I still need to go back to see my father.

371
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,020
Didn't you ask me before

372
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,040
why I'm still sticking with the drama club

373
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,450
when I'm about to graduate?

374
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,490
Because the left-behind children

375
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,210
our charity performances support

376
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,070
are just like us.

377
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:45,930
The CCYL Committee

378
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,130
needs to evaluate their situation for three consecutive years

379
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,410
before they can be placed on

380
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,930
the long-term support list.

381
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,250
By the time I found out about this,

382
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,290
I was already in my sophomore year.

383
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,280
Yes, I could've graduated and stopped caring about them,

384
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,930
but what would happen to them?

385
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,170
I didn't expect

386
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,700
that you'd still harbor such a noble ideal.

387
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,210
I don't have any noble ideals.

388
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,849
I just sometimes wonder

389
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,290
if someone had done all this

390
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,819
for me from afar

391
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:18,970
when I was a child,

392
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,010
maybe my future

393
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,290
would have turned out differently.

394
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,619
You make a good point,

395
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,210
though if that had happened,

396
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,890
we might never have met.

397
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,490
Yeah, when you put it that way,

398
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,050
it does seem like a bit of a shame.

399
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,320
Oh, right!

400
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,840
When you were picking chili peppers there,

401
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,220
did the girls dance?

402
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,090
I think they did, yeah.

403
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,010
The dance they did at that time was called...

404
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll dance it for you.

405
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,580
Is this how it went?

406
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,900
Not bad.

407
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,210
No, I just learned it.

408
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,010
I'm not dancing well.

409
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,010
Why are you here?

410
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:45,850
What are you doing?

411
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,650
What are you doing? You, you, you...

412
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,610
Put that down! Put that down!

413
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,840
Reimburse.

414
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,610
Reimburse? Reimburse what?

415
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,770
This can't be reimbursed right now.

416
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,250
Why? The teacher said you have all the money.

417
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,810
This money was for our charity performance

418
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,780
for children in the mountain areas of Guizhou.

419
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,250
I need to transfer it this afternoon.

420
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,450
This weekend.

421
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,090
Isn't there a performance at the nursing home this weekend?

422
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,380
I think there will be some money.

423
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,610
I'll give it to you then,

424
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,360
okay?

425
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,770
Bro.

426
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,450
Okay?

427
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,770
Fine.

428
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,650
I'm not in a hurry to use the money anyway.

429
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,930
You dance pretty well.

430
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,170
Keep dancing.

431
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,850
Gu Nian?

432
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,890
Let go of me first.

433
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,410
Why are you running?

434
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,380
I'm not a ghost.

435
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,210
Is it fun for you to wear the same clothes as me every day?

436
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,270
It's so annoying.

437
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,250
Can't help it. We're the same soul.

438
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,160
Oh, let me show you something interesting.

439
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,790
What's going on?

440
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,970
They're even dancing together now.

441
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,220
This pair of scumbags.

442
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,410
Scumbags.

443
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,890
What are you talking about?

444
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,150
Not manly at all.

445
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,780
Gu Nian, I think we're both so stupid.

446
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
We didn't even know

447
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,120
when they started hooking up.

448
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,780
Does dancing together mean they're a couple?

449
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,930
Then you ran to Lin Xi's house to take a shower late at night—

450
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,210
does that mean you're living together unmarried?

451
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,450
You're such an idiot.

452
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,650
Just go ahead and be stupid.

453
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,370
How could I have been so stupid back then?

454
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,170
What is this?

455
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,930
I made it myself, for you.

456
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,050
Once you've been cheated on, you won't love anyone.

457
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,780
Are you crazy or something?

458
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,010
You're the one who's crazy.

459
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,430
What kind of man are you?

460
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,890
I can't do it, really can't do it.

461
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,190
Nian?

462
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,090
What are you two doing?

463
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,820
Gu Nian, we're going to the cafeteria.

464
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,490
Why don't you join us?

465
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,580
Well...

466
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,570
I'm not hungry.

467
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,170
She's not hungry.

468
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,810
Alright, if you're not going.

469
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,490
I'll leave this key with you.

470
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,570
Before we come back,

471
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,570
make sure someone's here.

472
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,030
If anything goes missing, it's on us.

473
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,710
Let's go.

474
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,570
Let's go.

475
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,560
Bye-bye.

476
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,250
Eat more, okay?

477
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,210
We'll just do our own thing.

478
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,970
No interference with each other.

479
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,990
As if I like being around you.

480
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,500
Wait a moment!

481
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,690
Take it back!

482
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,060
It suits you better.

483
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,360
You...

484
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,580
[First Cafeteria]

485
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,330
I'd like to see

486
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,070
where you've spent all the money.

487
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,240
This can't be reimbursed for now.

488
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,870
Why? The teacher said you have all the money.

489
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,260
This money was for our charity performance

490
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,410
for children in the mountain areas of Guizhou.

491
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,820
I need to transfer it this afternoon.

492
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,130
Your dumplings are here.

493
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,170
Okay, thank you.

494
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,710
Would you like to order anything else?

495
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:13,930
What do you have?

496
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,610
We're out of tofu pudding.

497
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,250
We only have wontons, soy milk, and porridge left.

498
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,170
What would you like?

499
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,130
Are you hungry?

500
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,970
Mommy bought wontons, porridge, and dumplings.

501
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,190
Which one would you like to eat?

502
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,900
We haven't had any fruit today.

503
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,040
How about eating a small apple?

504
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,990
Mommy, I don't like eating fruit.

505
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,290
Mommy can cut the small apple

506
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,610
into a little star.

507
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,010
Then, maybe I'll consider it.

508
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,330
What would you like to order?

509
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,830
Sir, is there any place nearby that sells apples?

510
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,220
There's a fruit shop if you turn left up ahead.

511
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,910
Alright, then please pack these for me.

512
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,270
Okay.

513
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,790
Thank you.

514
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,780
Just a moment, please.

515
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,240
Mommy, I miss Daddy.

516
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,290
Today is my birthday.

517
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,810
Why didn't Daddy come to see me?

518
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,750
Does he not want me anymore?

519
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,210
Daddy!

520
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,460
This is not a small amount of money,

521
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,970
Gu Nian. When we divorced,

522
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,490
didn't we already

523
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,770
divide the assets clearly?

524
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,890
Now, my money,

525
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,090
my money isn't just my own anymore!

526
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,060
Do you understand?

527
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,780
This isn't as simple as you think!

528
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,610
I just want to get my money back.

529
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,460
I want to give Doudou a chance to survive.

530
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,810
Listen here, Gu Nian!

531
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,180
I don't have the extra resources now

532
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,920
to bear your additional demands anymore!

533
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,290
Lyu Tu.

534
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,360
You must have done a lot of bad things

535
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,010
and are afraid of karma, aren't you?

536
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,300
Gu Nian, she's pregnant.

537
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,300
Don't go too far.

538
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,690
When I was pregnant,

539
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,930
you two were already together, weren't you?

540
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,170
It's only been a few months since the divorce,

541
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,660
and the child is already on the way.

542
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,170
How this child came to be,

543
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,290
you two know best!

544
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,090
We were best friends.

545
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,370
Yet you became the third party in my marriage!

546
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,040
What are you doing?

547
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,190
Don't touch her!

548
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,530
Gu Nian.

549
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,970
You take my hard-earned savings,

550
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,610
and you still talk to me like this,

551
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,010
being all aggressive, huh?

552
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,430
Let me tell you,

553
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,250
when I was with Feng Huanan,

554
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,010
you weren't even in the picture.

555
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,040
You have no part in this!

556
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,510
You call me the third party?

557
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,760
You're the real intruder!

558
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,470
You know that?

559
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,340
Mr. Zhang,

560
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,850
these children are all left-behind kids from the mountains.

561
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,370
Their learning progress may be slower,

562
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,500
so you need to be mentally prepared.

563
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,610
So you need to be mentally prepared.

564
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,090
Need to be mentally prepared.

565
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,580
Gu Nian is not here. She went out with Lyu Tu.

566
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:54,610
What's wrong?

567
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,450
Did you upset her again?

568
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,490
Feng Huanan.

569
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,370
Do you like Lyu Tu?

570
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,780
Wait, who exactly do you like?

571
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,050
Which one I like doesn't matter.

572
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,300
What matters is who you like.

573
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,360
Who I like?

574
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,170
I don't like either of them.

575
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,050
Then, what if you have to choose between the two?

576
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,290
No, I just don't understand.

577
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,170
Who are you really interested in?

578
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,100
You're not interested in me, are you?

579
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,810
Of course, it's you.

580
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,380
Su Yin.

581
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,560
Su Yin, is there some misunderstanding between us?

582
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,610
We're brothers.

583
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,210
If there's something, just say it.

584
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,610
Don't keep it to yourself.

585
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:51,780
There's no misunderstanding.

586
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,060
I just think you and Lyu Tu are a better match.

587
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,490
You can rest assured.

588
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,810
I have absolutely no interest in Gu Nian!

589
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,460
Let me tell you.

590
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,690
You scared the wits out of me.

591
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,210
You don't need to play matchmaker

592
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,850
here.

593
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,610
I haven't even gotten over my last relationship yet.

594
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,590
I'm not in the mood to think about this right now.

595
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,970
You, you.

596
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,490
You're too nervous.

597
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,080
You're just not suited for dating.

598
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,410
Then why don't you teach me?

599
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,180
Library, K section, third row, 8875.

600
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,420
What does that mean?

601
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,050
Read it carefully.

602
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,010
Study it well.

603
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,980
[Literature]

604
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,130
K section, third row, 8875.

605
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,240
[The Art of War]

606
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,780
Feng Huanan.

607
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,810
You're really a knowledgeable scumbag.

608
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,410
What?

609
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,250
Well, why are you tsking?

610
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,010
I think your makeup...

611
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,290
is not accurate.

612
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,330
How is it not accurate?

613
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,350
Think about it.

614
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,730
You're a girl from the city

615
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,610
who's come to the mountains

616
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,530
to pursue your dreams.

617
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,650
The mountain wind is harsh against the face.

618
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,980
A city girl definitely couldn't withstand it.

619
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,610
With your delicate skin,

620
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,930
isn't that inaccurate?

621
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,380
Well...

622
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,650
Tu,

623
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,540
I think Su Yin has a point.

624
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,450
I'll head out first.

625
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,130
So, how do you think it should be done?

626
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,250
I'm not very skilled,

627
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,220
but I know a little about makeup techniques.

628
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,610
Let me help you.

629
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,380
A face weathered by mountain winds,

630
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,420
like a baby's drool rash.

631
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,900
A bit red in the middle

632
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,200
but slightly swollen at the edges.

633
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,160
Then it gets a bit darker toward the perimeter.

634
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,810
The further out,

635
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,330
it's a light yellow.

636
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,530
And even further out,

637
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,340
it's a hint of deep, pale yellow.

638
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,290
Right.

639
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,860
You done?

640
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,760
How is it?

641
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,230
Wait,

642
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,630
don't you think this looks too ugly?

643
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,130
But that's how it would really look.

644
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,450
Look at our President.

645
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,730
Even though his collar and cuffs are worn thin,

646
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,890
he keeps them neat and proper.

647
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,780
That's the dignity of his character.

648
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,630
Sometimes you need to use external appearances

649
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,420
to establish your character.

650
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,410
You seem to have a point.

651
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,280
You know quite a lot.

652
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,140
I also know...

653
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,970
you like our President, right?

654
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,740
I also know you have feelings for Nian.

655
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,010
So, are you going to confess?

656
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,310
I'll think about it.

657
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,340
I haven't decided yet.

658
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,920
You should go for it.

659
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,700
How will you know if you don't try?

660
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,330
Some people

661
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,890
are just like that flamboyant... peacocks,

662
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,120
always fanning their tail feathers and making noise.

663
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,730
Nian, let Su Yin do your makeup.

664
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,130
He's really good at it. Look.

665
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,290
Baby, I'm just playing a tree.

666
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,410
Why would I need makeup?

667
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,410
That's true.

668
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,640
All departments, get ready.

669
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,050
Is Gao Ren here?

670
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,180
Let's go. We should take places.

671
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,370
Touch it up yourself.

672
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,870
Okay.

673
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,630
Wait.

674
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,450
Why did you put so much red blusher on your face?

675
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,810
I don't know either.

676
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,650
He said this makeup

677
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,260
fits my character better.

678
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,930
Sunburn makeup?

679
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You're quite like a peacock yourself with your tail fully spread.

680
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,150
All departments,

681
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,250
the performance begins.

682
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,820
Everyone to your positions.

683
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,090
Three,

684
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,240
two,

685
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:23,570
one.

686
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,720
Nan.

687
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,930
You don't need to worry about me.

688
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,490
If you want to spread your wings

689
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,980
and explore the world,

690
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,720
just go.

691
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,360
Grandpa, that's not what I meant.

692
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,410
How could I ever leave you behind?

693
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,310
Nan.

694
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,820
Although I'm not your biological grandfather,

695
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,210
I have always

696
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,409
treated you as my own grandson.

697
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,800
My grandson,

698
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,250
you young people,

699
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,060
once you leave these mountains

700
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,750
and see the world,

701
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,100
your hearts...

702
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,210
just grow restless.

703
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,340
I want to tell you,

704
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,969
no matter when

705
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,900
and no matter where,

706
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,889
you must always keep us, your grandparents, in your heart.

707
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,120
We've all been so good to you.

708
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,230
You must remember us.

709
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,340
Just like this big tree,

710
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,290
generation after generation,

711
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,890
century after century,

712
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,800
it's been protecting us villagers.

713
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,360
You too.

714
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,750
Then, as your grandfather, I'll be content.

715
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,480
Gu Nian!
