Why did you have to crash into me, a big tree, for no reason?

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,540
She's just old

73
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,450

We're arranging for her hospitalization.

They said she needs a thorough check-up.

77
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,030
Alright, alright, Director.

78
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,200
Well... I'm just a caregiver.

79
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,620
I don't have that much money on me.

80
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,970
Can any of you cover the money first?

81
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,170
Aren't you from a nursing home?

82
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,840
How can a nursing home not have money?

83
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,470
Maybe you can ask your director

84
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,170
to transfer some money for this emergency.

85
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,510
We're just a few poor students; we don't have much money.

86
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,330
Yes.

87
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,990
I just called the director.

88
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,390
He's out of town

89
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,200
and doesn't have that much money on him either.

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,750
Besides, our nursing home is privately run,

91
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,060
and using money requires going through an application process.

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
There's no time for that.

93
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,950
Also, the director said this was caused by you,

94
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,550
so you'll need to figure out a solution.

95
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,730
What do you mean it was caused by us?

96
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,200
Grandma He scared herself.

97
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,980
You can't push all the responsibility onto us.

98
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,850
Alright, alright.

99
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,530
Saving her life is the priority.

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,030
How about this? We'll figure something out.

101
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,640

How's it going?

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,270
I put in a lot of effort to scrape together 6,000 yuan,

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
but we need 21,000 in total.

106
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,190
Who else has money right now?

107
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,180
Let's pool it together.

108

Okay.

111
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,610
I have some cash,

112
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,350
1,000 yuan in total. Take it all.

113
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,650
My research team just gave me a 2,500 yuan living allowance.

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,720
I'll transfer all of it to you.

115
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,310
Alright.

116
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,350
I have 800 yuan,

117
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,510
but I need to buy study materials tomorrow.

118
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,790
Can I transfer 500 first?

119
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,660
No problem.

120
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,070
I have a little over 200 yuan.

121
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,090
I'll keep 20 for meals

122
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,150
and transfer the rest to you.

123
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
200 it is, then.

124
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,630
How much are we still short?

125
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,930
We're still about 10,000 yuan short.

126
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,280
That much?

127
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,120
I'll transfer it to you.

128
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,320
Nian, where did you get so much money?

129
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,200
From my mom.

130
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,590
You asked your mom for so much money,

131
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,550
and she didn't even ask why?

132
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,750
I'll pay the fee first.

133
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,890
Actually, I have my own account.

134
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,010
It's just that

135
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,030
I need to let my mom know before I start working.

136
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,780
I really envy you for having such a great mom.

137
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,159
Thanks, Mommy.

138
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,640
Um...

139
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,550
I'm late.

141
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,770
Actually, I had it all planned out.

142
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,510
I thought I had enough time.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,640
But unexpectedly, the interview went on for three rounds.

144
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,210
Oh, right, I had already prepared

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,030
all the equipment at that time.

146
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,430
I left everything to Jiang Ze.

147
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,310
Right, Jiang Ze?

148
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,130
You never told me that.

149
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,610
I saw everyone in the WeChat group chipping in money.

150
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,390
I'll contribute a little too.

151
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,500
Gao Ren,

152
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,560
no one is blaming you.

153
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,030
You don't need to put this on Jiang.

154
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Since this has happened,

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,800
I'll take responsibility for it.

156
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,680
But you're the stage supervisor

157
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,790
and responsible for stage safety.

158
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,409
You should at least have told us you couldn't make it.

159
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,820
I'm sorry, President.

160
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,510
I had no choice.

161
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,030
I had already left home,

162
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,640
but I got a call saying there was an interview.

163
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,340
And...

164
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,030
Let's be honest, we held this event

165
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,430
for free.

166
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,890
It was voluntary, right?

167
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,050
I've submitted dozens of resumes.

168
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,230
Finally,

169
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,350
I got an interview.

170
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,050
Wouldn't you go if you were in my shoes?

171
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,110
You have no idea

172
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,260
what I went through today.

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,970
I went to an interview at a company.

174
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,510
They interviewed me for three rounds

175
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,990
and told me three times

176
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,680
"You can go home now."

177
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,550
I'm really not in a good mood today.

178
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,030
Come on, you're being ridiculous.

179
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,900
Just because your interview didn't go well,

180
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,240
do we all have to listen to you complain?

181
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,720
Do you expect us to cry with you?

182
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,350
Why are you being so childish?

183
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,790
So, what you're saying

184
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,190
is that all the responsibility

185
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,830
should fall on me, right?

186
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,490
Is that what I was saying?

187
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Isn't it?

188
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,350
Let's tone it down a bit.

189
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,890
No one thinks that, Gao Ren.

190
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,360
Let's just think about

191
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,539
how we can solve this, okay?

192
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,610
Are we talking about solutions right now?

193
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,770
Tell me,

194
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,410
what did I do...

195
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,310
Go! Just go!

196
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,090
Nian.

197
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,140
Gao Ren was really out of line.

198
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,910
I don't even want to listen to him.

199
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,580
Me too. I really couldn't stand it anymore.

200
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,110
When I saw you come out, I left as well.

201
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,660
Delivery?

202
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,890
Okay.

203
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,290
What happened?

204
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,050
That bastard Su Yin.

205
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,680
He sent all the costumes, makeup, and props back,

206
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,810
and left my phone number.

207
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,990
That guy!

208
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,750
Let's go.

209
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,910
Gosh.

210
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,090
Let me ask you:

211
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,830
If we don't find a job and have no future,

212
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,630
where will the money come from?

213
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,060
I'm asking you.

214
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,010
Where will the money come from?

215
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,670
Gao Ren, why are you yelling at everyone?

216
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,070
No one asked you to give the money.

217
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,870
Didn't I say that I would take responsibility

218
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,350
for everything today?

219
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,140
Forget it.

220
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,110
Since you're having fun in the drama club,

221
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,150
just have fun by yourself.

222
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,890
I quit.

223
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,470
What do you mean?

224
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,950
Gao Ren.

225
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,200
Gao Ren!

226
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,270
I'll go and check on him, President.

227
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,110
Don't worry.

228
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,390
It's okay.

229
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,500
You worked hard today.

230
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,250
Let's call it a day, everyone.

231
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,760
Well then, President, we'll be leaving too.

232
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,080
Welcome to self-service banking at the ATM.

233
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,040
Please keep your personal belongings

234
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,000
and password secure during the operation.

235
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,160
Mom,

236
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,390
I've transferred this month's living expenses to Yongfang.

237
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,160
Don't worry.

238
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,030
Don't worry.

239
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,790
I have money.

240
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,230
I have money.

241
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,140
I know, I know.

242
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,820
Okay.

243
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,030
Alright, that's it.

244
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm hanging up, bye.

245
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,540
Where is it?

246
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,750
Here.

247
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,450
I can't see it this way.

248
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,750
Take off your clothes.

249
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,130
Take off your sleeve here.

250
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,590
I'll handle it.

251
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,310
Or should I just cut your clothes?

252
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,650
No, no, no. That won't do.

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,290
Slow down.

254
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,660
What? Are you feeling embarrassed?

255
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,510
Come on, you call this an injury?

256
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,030
You don't even have a scratch.

257
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,390
At most, it's just a bit bruised.

258
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,270
You wasted one of my gloves.

259
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,910
Just take a shower, and you'll be fine when you come out.

260
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
That's it?

261
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,950
You've already taken out the gauze and tape.

262
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,070
You should bandage me up.

263
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,620
Do you have to be so dramatic?

264
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,700
It has to be dramatic.

265
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,110
Xi, you have no idea.

266
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,630
When I think about

267
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,690
how I scolded myself, it makes me so angry.

268
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,640
But I still acted cute and tried to make up with her.

269
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,750
If I really

270
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,890
block myself,

271
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,270
won't all my efforts be in vain?

272
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,790
So what do you want to do?

273
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
The more dramatic, the better.

274
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,150
Just put on a few more layers.

275
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,580
Make it swell up like this.

276
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,460
Make it look like I'm all swollen.

277
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,070
Why don't you ask me to get you a pot?

278
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,380
That's a great idea.

279
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,470
Then I'll go to her all hunched over,

280
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,400
sincerely apologize,

281
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,780
and ask her to come with me to see Grandma.

282
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,470
Come on.

283
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,460
I doubt it'll work.

284
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,170
Don't you know your own bad temper?

285
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,870
Would you fall for this?

286
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,280
Isn't this exactly what Feng Huanan did back then?

287
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,810
She had me wrapped around her finger.

288
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,930
Alright, alright. Both of you are the kind

289
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,850
that won't turn back until you hit the wall.

290
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,140
Now,

291
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,930
I'll make it as swell as you want.

292
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,150
Su Yin.

293
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,310
Don't block the way here.

294
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,390
Come here.

295
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,070
You dare come to me after all this?

296
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,580
Do you know how big of a mess you've caused?

297
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,870
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,000
I didn't expect to scare Grandma.

299
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,510
I was just about to go and see her.

300
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,990
I know I was wrong.

301
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,670
Look, these are all the nutritional supplements I bought for Grandma.

302
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,110
I came here to ask you to go with me.

303
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
Let's go together.

304
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,960
After all, I saved your life.

305
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,880
Come on,

306
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,690
Su Yin, I know you mean well and want to protect me.

307
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,040
But I've really had enough.

308
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,430
Before I met you,

309
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,790
everything was so simple and safe.

310
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
All my problems now were caused by you.

311
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,460
So, I'm begging you,

312
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,360
please let me go, okay?

313
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,910
Come on. I'll do anything for you.

314
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm injured.

315
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,550
Look at this.

316
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,290
I'm all swollen,

317
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,310
with a huge bump.

318
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,570
I almost had to go to the hospital.

319
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,870
Look.

320
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,410
Don't pinch! It hurts, it hurts!

321
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,430
You even...

322
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,820
You even dare lie to me?

323
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,630
You know what?

324
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,470
Lin Xi knows I hate being lied to the most.

325
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,710
Lin Xi.

326
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,180
Alright, for the sake of your putting on quite a show

327
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,490
and the things you brought,

328
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I'll forgive you this time.

329
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,550
You should leave now.

330
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,590
Did you lend Feng Huanan money?

331
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,030
Yeah, it was to save the old lady.

332
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,630
Lending money is fine,

333
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,760
and saving her is the right thing to do.

334
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,820
But can you stop being

335
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,430
so unreservedly open-hearted

336
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,830
and generous with your money to Feng Huanan?

337
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,150
He doesn't deserve it.

338
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,840
Aren't you going with me to visit Grandma?

339
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,630
You caused this mess, so deal with it yourself.

340
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,770
Why is there a power outage?

341
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,090
What?

342
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,280
What are you doing in?

343
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,980
It's so dark.

344
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,820
I'm working on my resume.

345
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,010
Do you not care about your eyes?

346
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,890
You know,

347
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,240
I think Gao Ren had a point earlier today.

348
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,170
What have I been doing?

349
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,070
I need to work hard

350
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,980
and find a job.

351
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,730
But look,

352
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,770
I just started working on my resume,

353
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,160
and now there's a power outage.

354
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,100
Jiang Kele,

355
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,990
you don't seriously plan to finish it tonight, do you?

356
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,160
Are you crazy?

357
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,320
I have to finish it before the computer runs out of battery,

358
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,190
then start sending out resumes immediately.

359
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,690
Here.

360
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,810
If I can't find a job this time,

361
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,590
I'll have to wait for the fall recruitment season.

362
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Wait, you have to submit resumes in the right seasons?

363
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,570
If I were like our president,

364
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,910
with an impressive resume,

365
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,980
good looks, great grades,

366
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,550
and, most importantly, a sense of responsibility,

367
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,950
I wouldn't be worried about it.

368
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,590
You're right about that.

369
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,430
He looked so charming

370
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,470
taking responsibility today.

371
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,990
After what happened today,

372
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,410
I feel like

373
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,390
having money is just too important.

374
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,510
So after I graduate,

375
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,540
I must make money like crazy.

376
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,390
Or I'll just marry

377
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,450
a good, rich guy.

378
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,070
Tu, you're being a little shallow.

379
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,760
I am shallow.

380
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,770
Why else would I work at a KTV,

381
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,310
putting in so much effort,

382
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,350
and want to learn golf?

383
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,610
Isn't it all so I can make more money

384
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,350
or marry

385
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,500
a good, rich guy

386
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,060
to change my destiny and future?

387
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,970
Is there anything wrong with that?

388
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,230
But you can't just marry a rich person whenever you want.

389
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,520
Tu,

390
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,510
I think deep down you still long for true love.

391
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,700
Who doesn't long for true love?

392
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,980
Who doesn't want both true love and money?

393
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,020
But you can't have your cake and eat it too.

394
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,430
You can't be too greedy,

395
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,650
or you'll end up with nothing.

396
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,300
Wouldn't all your previous studies be in vain then?

397
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,720
How could it be in vain?

398
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,960
My hard work in studying

399
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,650
was my springboard from the countryside to the city.

400
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,170
But how could achieving everything in one step

401
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,190
be that easy?

402
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,670
So right now, the only things I can rely on

403
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,830
are my

404
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,210
fleeting youth and my beauty.

405
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Gosh.

406
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,800
Nian.

407
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,430
You also don't want to find a job

408
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,190
right after graduation, right?

409
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,970
I'm thinking that after graduation,

410
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,830
I'd ride my little motorcycle to see the world.

411
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,830
If I'm going to end up

412
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,290
with a nine-to-five job

413
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,750
and a repetitive life anyway,

414
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,730
then why not take the chance

415
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,350
to experience life

416
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,820
before being a good child?

417
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,370
This kid who grew up in a bubble

418
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,960
is indeed so different.

419
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm so envious and jealous of you,

420
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,790
but I don't hate you.

421
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,110
It has to be you.

422
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,480
I think the three of us are so interesting.

423
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,510
Look, Jiang Kele

424
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,250
just wants a stable job,

425
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,450
I, Lyu Tu,

426
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,830
want to marry into a rich family,

427
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,040
and Nian

428
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,690
dreams of roaming the world, free as the wind.

429
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,190
Let me say something inspirational.

430
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,610
Darkness is only temporary.

431
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,750
Get through it, and the future will be bright.

432
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,940
So true!

433
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,860
Is this magic?

434
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,160
Let's have a toast, sisters.

435
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,160
Cheers!

436
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,830
Cheers!

437
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,470
Here.

438
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,010
Here.

439
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,410
Didn't we agree to rehearse at 2 o'clock?

440
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,350
Where is everyone?

441
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,520
Where did everyone go?

442
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,690
President, basically everyone is here.

443
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,810
Others have left the group chat,

444
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,980
and there's no way to get them back.

445
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,210
President,

446
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,110
actually, I'm planning to quit too.

447
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,150
But I felt it'd be inappropriate to just announce it in the WeChat group.

448
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,010
So I thought I'd say goodbye in person.

449
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,850
Gen,

450
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,080
what are you doing?

451
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,830
Sit down.

452
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,160
Busy.

453
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,820
Everyone's busy. After all, we're about to graduate, right?

454
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,020
I think this is what we're going to do:

455
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,890
since the drama club has lost its spirit

456
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,550
and no one's interested anymore,

457
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,190
we might as well disband.

458
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,020
Okay?

459
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,740
I'll find a way to pay back the money I owe everyone.

460
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,650
I guess we won't need this anymore, right?

461
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,380
We won't need this anymore, right?

462
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,920
Hey,

463
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,970
who's in charge here?

464
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,980
You must be Feng Huanan.

465
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,200
I am.

466
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,670
Are you the one who caused my mom to end up in the hospital?

467
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,510
Are you Uncle He Yong?

468
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,880
Who's your Uncle?

469
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,130
Kid, my mom ended up in the hospital with a heart attack because of you.

470
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,360
What are you going to do about it?

471
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,900
Sir,

472
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,960
this incident was caused by us.

473
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,500
We'll take full responsibility.

474
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,570
Grandma He is just currently under observation in the hospital

475
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,650
and is doing fine now.

476
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,180
We've even managed to scrape together

477
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,590
the 20,000 yuan

478
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,790
for her medical expenses.

479
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
The doctor said

480
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,710
it wasn't a heart attack,

481
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,500
and there are no serious consequences.

482
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,940
How about this?

483
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,650
If Grandma He needs it in the future,

484
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,970
we'll take turns

485
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,990
looking after her 24/7.

486
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,810
Does that work for you?

487
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,630
Stop it.

488
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,570
Pay up!

489
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,290
How much do you want us to give you?

490
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,550
Since you're all students,

491
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,660
50 thousand.

492
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,190
Fifty thousand? That's robbery.

493
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,050
Sir, you're asking too much of us.

494
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,940
Where are we supposed to find fifty thousand yuan?

495
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,530
Fifty thousand. Not a penny less.

496
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,810
Otherwise, I'll talk to your teachers

497
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,760
and your principal.

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
None of you will be able to graduate.

499
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,400
Alright, if that's how you want to play it,

500
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,040
let's sit down and sort things out properly.

501
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,170
We'll take full responsibility for what we should,

502
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,830
but for what's not our responsibility,

503
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,990
don't even think about scamming us.

504
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,250
Who's scamming you?

505
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,750
You're here pretending to be the perfect filial son, aren't you?

506
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Who are you talking about, brat?

507
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,370
I'm talking about you.

508
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,940
You dumped your mother in a nursing home

509
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,570
and that's it?

510
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,180
As her son, can you face her with a clear conscience?

511
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,070
Have you even visited her once in the hospital these days?

512
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,850
You're drowning in debt,

513
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,200
and now you've finally latched onto us.

514
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,610
You think we're easy to push around?

515
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,400
He's a pushover,

516
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,190
but I'm not.

517
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,430
Who the hell are you?

518
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
None of your business.

519
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,620
Listen to me, you deadbeat,

520
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,550
you're not just threatening and intimidating here,

521
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,500
you're also extorting us.

522
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,010
If I call the police, that would be enough

523
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,270
to put you away for a couple of months!

524
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,230
I'm warning you,

525
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,780
watch what you say.

526
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,500
Without evidence, it's just slander.

527
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,960
So you know a bit about the law, huh?

528
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,970
Then let me give you a lesson today.

529
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,940
You're really good at hiding.

530
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,220
You can even climb trees now?

531
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,690
Brother, please let me explain.

532
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,100
I wouldn't dare not pay you back.

533
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,790
I've just been having terrible luck at cards lately.

534
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,840
It's a good thing I went to find you the day it happened.

535
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,540
Otherwise, I wouldn't have even known about it.

536
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,540
Even if I had a hundred times the courage,

537
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,100
I wouldn't dare not pay you back.

538
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,530
Come down, quickly.

539
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,990
Cut the crap. When are you paying us back?

540
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,950
Give us a date, now.

541
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,030
Recently,

542
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,450
my mom was scared by someone

543
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,440
in the nursing home.

544
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,520
Now she's in the hospital, still being resuscitated.

545
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,020
Let me tell you,

546
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,400
if you don't pay up by the deadline again,

547
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,400
I'll knock out those two big front teeth of yours.

548
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,550
Don't worry.

549
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,100
I've already got that person's phone number.

550
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
He promised to compensate me.

551
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,940
As soon as I get the money, I'll pay you back.

552
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,710
Alright.

553
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,860
If you don't pay next time,

554
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,800
you won't be in a tree—

555
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,750
you'll be in heaven.

556
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,730
Give me one day.

557
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,180
Just one day, okay?

558
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,040
Sirs, just give me one day.

559
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
You're just playing dirty.

560
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,970
It's too much.

561
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,100
Aren't you just extorting us?

562
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,200
You're bullying students.

563
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,060
You're bullying students.

564
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,440
[Outpatient Building]

565
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,350
What are you doing?

566
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,060
Come on, Su Yin.

567
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,550
Don't you

568
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,930
usually like to go against me?

569
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,600
What's going on today?

570
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,230
Did your conscience wake up?

571
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,060
This is just an internal conflict between us.

572
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,200
It doesn't affect our unity against outsiders.

573
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,170
How about that? You still need to count on me in a critical moment, right?

574
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,300
Don't get cocky.

575
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,510
That's because Grandma He is understanding and reasonable.

576
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,570
Otherwise, would He Yong have let it go so easily?

577
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,800
If it weren't for me,

578
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,120
you'd still be there begging him.

579
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,950
Alright, alright. Even if you've been righteous this one time,

580
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,300
that doesn't change the fact

581
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,610
that you're usually a pain in the neck.

582
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,740
Take a look at your phone.

583
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,030
I've transferred the money to you.

584
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,040
President, you're so generous.

585
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,240
I guess the nursing home won't give us the money, right?

586
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,100
Can you lower your voice?

587
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,090
Keep your voice down.

588
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,990
I called you down here

589
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,300
specifically to tell you about this.

590
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,710
This money is coming out of my own pocket.

591
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,910
So you have money.

592
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,580
What money?

593
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,390
I don't have money.

594
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,660
I'm doing this to turn our hostility into friendship.

595
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,140
That's why I paid you back first, okay?

596
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,940
Alright.

597
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,200
If you trust me,

598
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,980
I'll tell you a way to make money.

599
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,100
The CBA Finals are coming up.

600
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,580
Team Liaoning will win the championship 4-0.

601
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,860
Really?

602
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,790
You'll see for yourself when the time comes.

603
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,200
4-0?

604
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,190
It has finally come to an end.

605
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,860
These past few days have been quite a rollercoaster.

606
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,190
Indeed.

607
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,180
Su Yin, I have to say,

608
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,330
today you really did

609
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,650
something heroic.

610
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:24,890
It was nothing special.

611
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,270
Did I complete the task you gave me

612
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,140
beyond expectations?

613
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,280
A little praise, and you're already puffing your chest out.

614
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,570
Lyu Tu, please pass this on to everyone.

615
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,590
I will repay the money

616
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,600
I owe everyone as soon as possible.

617
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,390
Although it might be a bit difficult,

618
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,670
I'll do my best to figure out a way.

619
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,620
Also,

620
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,030
if no one wants to participate

621
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,660
in any more free charity performances,

622
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,300
then we should just disband the drama club.

623
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,910
Don't do that, President.

624
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,520
Actually, I can try to find a way,

625
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,910
but I can't promise anything.

626
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,300
Just give me some time.

627
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,740
Let me tell you,

628
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,490
don't even think about the wellness center.

629
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,360
How do you know?

630
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,440
Don't you know who I am?

631
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,340
I don't care who you are.

632
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,920
If raising the money

633
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,470
can help the drama club through its difficulties,

634
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,500
I'll try to think of a way too.

635
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:19,960
I'll be going then.

636
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,820
Be careful.

637
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,740
Bye.

638
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,750
President, my wallet is so empty right now.

639
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,220
But don't worry about paying me back the money just yet.

640
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,280
I'm not in a hurry.

641
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,550
Are you going back to school?

642
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,750
My car is parked across the street.

643
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,470
President.

644
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,020
Well...

645
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,800
Okay.

646
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,620
Don't even think about ditching me.

647
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,630
Why did you get on my motorcycle?

648
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,340
What do you mean?

649
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,290
Didn't we agree on this?

650
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
Who agreed with you?

651
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,700
Thank you.

652
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,450
Bye.

653
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,310
Let's go.

654
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,180
We're leaving then.

655
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,250
Be careful.

656
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,350
Jiang.

657
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,580
Jiang, what did Gu Nian mean by the wellness house?

658
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,730
It's not a wellness house. It's a wellness center.

659
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,420
Center, center.

660
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,650
When the Communist Youth League organized an event before,

661
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,990
Gu Nian took me to see it.

662
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,370
The service, environment, and facilities there are really good,

663
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,300
but it's just expensive.

664
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,200
I heard the deposit alone is 200,000 yuan just to move in.

665
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,570
200,000?

666
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,950
Gosh, with 200,000,

667
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,390
you could build a villa where I'm from.

668
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,450
Can anyone actually afford to live there?

669
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,500
Can anyone?

670
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,100
Don't ask this question.

671
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,310
Let me tell you,

672
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,290
the waiting list is already full for the next five years.

673
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,540
These old folks are really rich.

674
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,420
Indeed.

675
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,020
Gu Nian's mom is a senior executive at a venture capital firm.

676
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,190
This wellness center

677
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,860
is a project she's primarily in charge of.

678
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,180
If Gu Nian convinces her mom to help,

679
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,960
we could really get a big deal.

680
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,350
Have you really thought this through?

681
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,270
Do you really want to do this?

682
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,160
Can you stop nagging?

683
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,030
You've been saying these same few sentences all the way here.

684
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm not trying to stop you.

685
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,190
I just want you to make a careful choice,

686
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,540
under the circumstances of knowing

687
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,430
what the future holds.

688
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,540
You had someone check

689
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,880
my handwriting on those notes, didn't you?

690
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,840
I won't ask about the result,

691
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,780
but you know it in your heart.

692
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,150
Did you say in the back seat earlier

693
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,590
that as long as I help Feng Huanan,

694
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,840
he'll have a bright future?

695
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,680
Can you focus on the point?

696
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,550
He had it because of your help.

697
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,370
You put in your time, your money, and your resources,

698
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,640
and even showed him warmth later despite his coldness.

699
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,700
After he became successful, he kicked you to the curb.

700
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,500
Well,

701
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,090
what you said earlier is exactly what I want.

702
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,480
Why shouldn't I persist?

703
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,970
You can totally

704
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,530
help me and Feng Huanan have a bright future,

705
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,690
avoid the problems, and successfully manage our marriage.

706
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,350
Why does it have to be someone else?

707
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,670
If it's still the same with someone else,

708
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,830
we still aren't solving the root of the problem,

709
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,980
right?

710
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,620
Yeah, you made a good point.

711
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,270
No!

712
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,660
You just can't manage a marriage well with some people.

713
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,480
As long as it's not the right person,

714
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,830
no matter how you manage it, it will always be wrong.

715
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,620
Gu Nian, I know

716
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,260
you don't quite understand this yet,

717
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,140
but I hope you'll take some time to think before making a decision.

718
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,090
Take some time.

719
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,270
Take some time.

720
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,390
Can you be a little more manly?

721
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,420
Let me tell you,

722
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,480
we can't delay in repaying our classmates' favors and money.

723
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,940
We can't just watch the drama club disband.

724
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,750
Move aside.

725
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,690
Nian.

726
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,830
Uncle Wang.

727
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,610
Uncle Wang.

728
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,050
About the matter I called you about yesterday...

729
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,080
Let's go inside and talk.

730
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,890
So stubborn.

731
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,300
And she didn't take out the bike key again.

732
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,310
I'll make sure you can't go back.

733
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,450
Nice shot!

734
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,920
I must say, you played quite aggressively today.

735
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,510
I know why.

736
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,820
No one wants us to disband.

737
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,910
But you have to accept it.

738
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
There's no such thing as an unending feast.

739
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
I'm not doing this to be noble

740
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,680
or to seek a perfect ending.

741
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,640
But it...

742
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,600
It's just making me so frustrated!

743
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,620
You know?

744
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,840
Jiang,

745
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,720
why don't we move our entrepreneurial plans up a bit?

746
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,560
How about this? Let's do it now.

747
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,840
I'll find some money first

748
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,540
and settle the problem first.

749
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,840
Then, we can figure out our next steps later, okay?

750
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,860
I'm telling you, it's not realistic for us to start a business now.

751
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,130
I'm in my first year of grad school, and you just graduated.

752
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,190
We don't have resources

753
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,500
or experience.

754
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,370
The problem is we don't have money either.

755
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,240
You see, a bird needs to grow its wings evenly first

756
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,310
before it can fly.

757
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,370
Starting a business now is not realistic.

758
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,710
Yes.

759
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,990
I understand what you mean.

760
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,750
You don't understand what I mean.

761
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,590
You're doing so well academically.

762
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,020
Why don't you apply for graduate school?

763
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,450
Why are you wasting it?

764
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,470
I've considered that.

765
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,120
But for me, the time cost is too high.

766
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,270
You know my situation, right?

767
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,980
Then go and find a good job.

768
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,230
Start by accumulating some resources,

769
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,020
building your network,

770
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,640
and making your first bucket of gold.

771
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,670
My mentor is currently handling

772
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,510
a tech outsourcing project from a company.

773
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,070
How about I introduce you to it?

774
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,010
Give me your resume.

775
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,840
Come on! That's too slow!

776
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,020
Do you think we can afford to wait?

777
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,450
Can I afford to wait?

778
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,500
Then what are you going to do?

779
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,350
You can't afford to wait,

780
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,000
and you don't have any resources.

781
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,790
What are you going to do?

782
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm in debt now.

783
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,560
If I didn't owe this money,

784
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,030
I wouldn't be in such a rush to make money.

785
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,940
But right now,

786
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,240
I can't even continue being the president

787
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,220
of the drama club.

788
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,950
Do you understand?

789
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,910
Stop bringing up the drama club president thing.

790
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,510
Solve the current problem first.

791
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,670
Money! What about money?

792
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,240
Money, money, money, money.

793
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,430
All you see is money.

794
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,890
So all my efforts are worth nothing, right?

795
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,530
One accident doesn't define you as a person.

796
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,620
You seem quite familiar with this now.

797
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,570
What?

798
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,650
You're not going to blame me for wrapping you up too extravagantly, are you?

799
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,220
Lin Xi, I beg you, you have to help me.

800
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,000
No matter what, you must stop Gu Nian from going out tonight.

801
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,920
Why?

802
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,100
She's definitely having dinner with Feng Huanan tonight.

803
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,230
To be honest,

804
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,080
seven years ago, on this very day,

805
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,850
at that damn dinner,

806
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,160
Feng Huanan and I started our relationship with a kiss.

807
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,930
See you there.

808
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,910
See you there.
