00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,240
[Su Yin, Who Are You?]

4
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,590
Gu Nian!

5
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,590
-Don't come over!
-Gu Nian!

6
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,030
Su Yin, you knew about Doudou's existence all along.

7
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,510
Why did you lie to me?

8
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,620
I don't want you to hurt yourself!

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,720
Then let me go back!

10
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,780
You worked so hard and rewrote the ending.

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,030
Why do you still want to go back?

12
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,990
We worked together,

13
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,610
started a business together, and got married.

14
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,630
Our lives have long become one.

15
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,310
Didn't you want a child?

16
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,590
We will have a child.

17
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,110
A child of our own,

18
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,870
a perfectly healthy child.

19
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,270
Are you saying

20
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,829
that Doudou's life should be abandoned?

21
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,870
That's what Feng Huanan thought!

22
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,270
Why do you want me to do the same?

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,440
Doudou doesn't even exist in this world!

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,320
There's no such thing as abandoning her!

25
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,530
We've been together for so many years.

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,540
Are you really going to give up on us

27
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,240
over a Doudou who doesn't even exist?

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,760
Those were real experiences!

29
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,250
You won't let me go back

30
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,400
no matter what, will you?

31
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,410
Gu Nian, calm down.

32
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,490
Let's go home

33
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,880
and have a good sleep.

34
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,240
Get a good sleep,

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,810
and you'll remember everything tomorrow, okay?

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,770
Gu Nian.

37
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,590
Su Yin!

38
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,090
If you love me,

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,320
help me find her.

40
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,530
Gu Nian!

41
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,950
I promise you!

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,920
I promise you.

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,370
Su Yin!

44
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,920
I know you're here. Come out!

45
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,240
Gu Nian.

46
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,960
After you make your choice this time,

47
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,890
I'll close this space.

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,410
Are you saying

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,050
this is the last time?

50
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,610
So,

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,840
there'll be no turning back.

52
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,800
I know.

53
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,650
You know me too.

54
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
It's all for Doudou.

55
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,960
Have you made up your mind?

56
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,330
Which point in time do you want to go to?

57
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,710
I'll send you back.

58
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,200
Happy wedding!

59
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,850
Take more photos.

60
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,650
Alright, alright.

61
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's take photos later.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,790
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a favor to ask you.

63
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,960
Could you please

64
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,080
return my beautiful bride to me first?

65
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,970
I'll give her back after I'm done with her, okay?

66
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,240
So, what are you going to do?

67
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,970
There are many parts of the wedding.

68
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,050
Please, have mercy, alright?

69
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,690
You should do something to pick up the bride.

70
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,200
Okay.

71
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,070
They're all here with me.

72
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,390
This is my way.

73
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,330
Get a girlfriend soon,

74
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,230
okay? Gao Ren,

75
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,090
get a girlfriend soon.

76
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Wish you great wealth.

77
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Please.

78
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,280
Please have mercy on me.

79
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,980
I'll give her back to you in a minute.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Don't rush.

81
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,950
Nian,

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,040
at this point,

83
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,130
why hasn't Mom arrived yet?

84
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,680
Why are you saying nothing, Nian?

85
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,000
Mom didn't deliberately disappear

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,050
at such a critical moment, did she?

87
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,920
Today is our big wedding day.

88
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,440
Feng Huanan, you've gone too far.

89
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,640
Is Mrs. Gu that kind of person?

90
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,330
It's okay, Nian.

91
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,890
Today, we'll wait.

92
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,970
Whenever Mrs. Gu arrives,

93
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,350
we'll hold the ceremony.

94
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,720
This wedding must go smoothly.

95
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
What you're implying is a bit hard to get.

96
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,610
You talk too much.

97
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,909
Boss.

98
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,530
Boss is here.

99
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,520
God Su.

100
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,250
God Su.

101
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,560
Do I know your boss well?

102
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,400
You were referred

103
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,520
by our boss.

104
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,130
He's the director of the department.

105
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,040
Show some tact.

106
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680
So, it seems that Su Yin and I

107
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840
are just acquaintances.

108
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,170
Boss, it's a wedding day.

109
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,810
It's inappropriate to come without a gift.

110
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,480
Director Su,

111
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,090
thank you for coming to my wedding.

112
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,170
The gift I prepared will be here very soon.

113
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,170
Congratulations,

114
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,540
Gu Nian.

Gu Nian,

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,520
have you made up your mind?

133
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,090

So, everything you told me

153
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,410
is true?

154
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Yes.

155
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I won't lie to you.

156
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,690
So, I'm here to hear

157
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,240
your answer to the next choice.

158
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,110
Nian.

159
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,840
What choice? What answer?

160
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,130
What are you talking about?

161
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Are you feeling unwell?

162
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,320
Are you okay?

163
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,190
Queen Dai is here.

164
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,170
Mom.

165
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,800
Mrs. Gu.

166
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,930
Mom.

167
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm so glad Mom's alive.

168
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,960
What's wrong?

169
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,370
Silly girl.

170
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,660
You thought I wouldn't come, didn't you?

171
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,440
On such an important day,

172
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,640
how could I not be here?

173
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,680
I just went home to get the necklace for you.

174
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,130
I promised you

175
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,770
that when you got married,

176
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,600
I would give you this necklace

177
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,600
your grandmother gave me.

178
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,720
Do you like it?

179
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,350
Feng, put it on Nian.

180
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,610
That's my plan, Mom.

181
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,490
So beautiful.

182
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,680
Feng,

183
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,160
since...

184
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,840
Nian has made her decision,

185
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,330
as her mother,

186
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,280
I will respect her choice.

187
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,800
Today, I'm giving my daughter to you.

188
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,590
Mom,

189
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,040
don't worry.

190
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,680
I will make Nian happy.

191
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,360
Am I right, Nian?

192
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,520
Gu Nian,

193
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
think carefully.

194
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,890
You're making this choice for yourself.

195
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,800
Don't let anyone sway you.

196
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,040
Su Yin, what do you mean?

197
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,930
What do you mean by that?

198
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,840
Nothing.

199
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,600
Isn't it common for the host to ask such a question

200
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,600
when it comes to the hand-holding part?

201
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,530
Congratulations on your wedding.

202
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,960
Nian.

203
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,250
We've gone through so much

204
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,040
to get together,

205
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,440
so don't let Mom's expectations down.

206
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,770
Let's keep going,

207
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,730
okay?

208
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,750
Let's walk this journey together, for a lifetime.

209
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,530
Stop talking, stop talking.

210
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,650
The auspicious time has come.

211
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,600
It's time for us to enter.

212
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,240
Let's go!

213
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Let's go!

214
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,000
Nian,

215
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,250
we're leaving.

216
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,890
Let's go, Boss.

217
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Let's drink the wedding wine.

218
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,170
You go ahead.

219
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,160
The gift has been delivered.

220
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,060
I won't be going.

221
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,080
Then I'll go.

222
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Thank you.

223
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,280
Go back to work.

224
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,730
I want to be alone for a while.

225
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,850
If I need anything, I'll call you.

226
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,520
Nian, what did you call me here for?

227
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,200
Tu, Huanan and I are getting married.

228
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,730
So soon?

229
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,400
I remember when we were in college,

230
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,250
you said

231
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,960
you'd never get married right after graduation,

232
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,680
and I said

233
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,760
I'd definitely get married right after.

234
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,099
I didn't expect that now,

235
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
we've ended up doing exactly the opposite.

236
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,720
Yeah.

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,680
Things often don't go as planned.

238
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Is he good to you?

239
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,960
Yes.

240
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,780
Otherwise, we wouldn't be getting married so quickly.

241
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,160
That's good then.

242
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,760
Tu,

243
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,120
we've been best friends

244
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,370
since college.

245
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,690
So, I hope

246
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,410
you can be my bridesmaid.

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,800
Bridesmaid?

248
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,830
Nian, I really want

249
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,600
to attend your wedding.

250
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,630
But my schedule doesn't work.

251
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,730
I've been working on a project

252
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,920
for over half a year,

253
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,320
and now it's almost done.

254
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,400
So I'll have to leave in a few days.

255
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,360
When are you leaving?

256
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,280
How long will you be gone?

257
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,170
How about Huanan and I postpone the wedding?

258
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,170
No, no, no.

259
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,810
You two shouldn't delay such an important event

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
because of me.

261
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,080
I'll probably be gone

262
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,290
for at least a month,

263
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,730
maybe even half a year.

264
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't get me wrong.

265
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,080
I'm not...

266
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm not jealous.

267
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,500
♫Rain boots in my hand♫

268
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,120
Although I can't be there in person,

269
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,900
♫The scene totally soaked♫

270
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,480
my red envelope will definitely get to you.

271
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,720
You were so good to me in the past.

272
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,610
I've always wanted to repay you

273
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,480
♫Without you by my side, I can't go back to the past♫

274
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,010
but never found the opportunity.

275
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,450
Finally, I have a chance now.

276
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,360
I'll definitely give you

277
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,850
a huge red envelope,

278
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,600
okay?

279
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:39,730
♫No sweetness of coffee, only a bitter smile♫

280
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,760
You know me.

281
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,490
I don't want a big red envelope.

282
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,890
What I want is you.

283
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,090
♫Who will pick up the lost memories♫

284
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,170
No matter where I go,

285
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,080
my heart and my love will always be with you.

286
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,980
♫I had too much to drink last night, looking all miserable♫

287

Nian, you must be happy,

289
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,050
you know?

290
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:05,010
♫Turns out those things deep in my memory still surface from time to time♫

Feng Huanan, don't touch me.

315
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,950
You're my wife. What's wrong with me touching you?

316
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,690
Move.

317
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,440
Are you that eager to find Su Yin?

318
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,080
I already told you,

319
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,250
I'm going to my mom's place today.

320
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,130
I'm worried about her.

321
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,240
What could happen to your mom?

322
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,600
What could happen to your mom?

323
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,440
Right now, it's about the two of us.

324
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm telling you, Gu Nian.

325
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,310
I'm a man too.

326
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,600
I understand the way Su Yin looked at you today.

327
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,680
If you regret it,

328
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,410
or don't want to get married,

329
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,360
you could have told me before we got married.

330
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
I wouldn't have forced you.

331
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,930
But you shouldn't have humiliated me

332
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,200
in front of so many people.

333
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,960
Do you understand?

334
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,040
Don't forget,

335
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,520
it was you who asked me to marry you.

336
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,400
My mom agreed.

337
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,010
Let's get married.

338
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,840
I didn't force you.

339
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,850
You can't fool me like this.

340
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,800
You're ruining me. Do you understand?

341
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,890
You're not going anywhere today.

342
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,790
Just stay here.

343
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,850
You're not going anywhere!

344
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,450
I don't know if you ruined me

345
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,720
or I ruined you.

346
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,360
Feng Huanan,

347
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
didn't you marry me

348
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,530
just for my mom's house and resources?

349
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,960
You married me to get a business loan

350
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,040
as a couple.

351
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,280
Oh, right,

352
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,920
you don't even love me.

353
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
You love Lyu Tu.

354
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,880
Before me,

355
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,500
you two were already together,

356
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,690
weren't you?

357
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,000
Come on.

358
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,490
Who told you this nonsense?

359
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,160
I don't love Lyu Tu.

360
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,190
I only love you.

361
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,050
From the beginning, I've only loved you.

362
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,160
Gu Nian,

363
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,210
I can swear to you.

364
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,720
I can swear it on my life.

365
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,880
Feng Huanan,

366
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,570
aren't you tired of

367
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,360
living with a mask every day?

368
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,060
Yes, I am.

369
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,600
Every day since I was born,

370
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,320
I've been tired.

371
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,110
Because I have

372
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,820
such a hopeless family.

373
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,250
I confess.

374
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,630
Yes, I love Lyu Tu.

375
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,250
But can I love her?

376
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,400
I can't.

377
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,120
Why?

378
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,380
Because I can't love someone who, like me,

379
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,410
carries a heavy burden.

380
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,200
People like you

381
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,840
could never understand

382
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,960
how heavy our burdens are!

383
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,770
You could never understand

384
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,560
how much suffering we've gone through!

385
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,670
Because since you were born,

386
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,560
you've been standing

387
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,570
at the finish line that's impossible for us to reach!

388
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,240
At least...

389
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,130
At least I can be honest with you and tell you

390
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,840
that I married you

391
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,450
for your family's money

392
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,450
and resources.

393
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,970
What about you?

394
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,240
Can you honestly tell me

395
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,800
why you married me?

396
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,870
We're just making an equal exchange.

397
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,640
Equal exchange.

398
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,770
Feng Huanan,

399
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,680
are you saying

400
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,880
that everything

401
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,160
has a price to you?

402
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,360
Yes.

403
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,250
Everything

404
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,530
has a price.

405
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,880
Family, love, friendship—

406
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,840
as long as money can solve it,

407
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,250
don't bring up feelings.

408
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,240
Mom,

409
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,120
I came home on the first day of my marriage.

410
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,960
Why aren't you scolding me?

411
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,240
You chose him yourself.

412
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,970
No matter the outcome,

413
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,410
you have to bear it yourself.

414
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,010
You're grown up now

415
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,010
and still sleeping with me.

416
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,030
If others hear about it,

417
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,880
they'll laugh at you.

418
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,440
Children who can curl up in their mother's arms

419
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,490
are the happiest.

420
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,690
Let them laugh if they want to.

421
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,120
I don't care.

422
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,480
When I saw you in your wedding dress,

423
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,360
I thought you were so beautiful.

424
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,280
At that moment, I felt that

425
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,940
you had really grown up.

426
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,050
But now, with you lying here,

427
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,250
I feel like

428
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,720
you're still that little kid.

429
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,640
Why are you crying?

430
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,610
Mom,

431
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,210
I miss my child.

432
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,850
I miss Doudou so much.

433
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,350
Nian,

434
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,290
When did you have a child?

435
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,210
Mom,

436
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,720
the last time I came back,

437
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,230
I didn't dare to tell you

438
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,100
because I was afraid it would scare you.

439
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,000
But this time is different.

440
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,220
I just want to tell you.

441
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,980
Because I'm so afraid of losing you.

442
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:04,960
You know what?

443
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,360
I want you to be here, and I want Doudou to be here.

444
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,430
Su Yin was right.

445
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,450
You should stop centering your life around others

446
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,360
and being swayed by them.

447
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,760
Mom, I'm not centering my life around others.

448
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,080
I really just want to change myself.

449
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,560
What have you changed?

450
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,600
You've gone back and forth,

451
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,720
and returned to the beginning.

452
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,530
You still haven't gotten rid of Feng Huanan.

453
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,390
You always like to point out the problems,

454
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,360
but don't want to solve them.

455
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,230
I think

456
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,650
Feng Huanan has no problem.

457
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,550
He understands himself very well.

458
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,990
From the day he got together with you,

459
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,970
he already knew

460
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,810
what he wanted to gain from you.

461
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,960
But what about you?

462
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,270
You've been going back and forth,

463
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,880
and in the end, you messed up your own life.

464
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,000
What's the point?

465
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,170
Come on, Mom.

466
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,940
I know what I want.

467
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,600
I want you to be here, and I want Doudou to be here.

468
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,690
You said Doudou needs you.

469
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,650
But is it really that Doudou needs you,

470
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,520
or are you using Doudou to prove you're needed?

471
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,530
You just told me

472
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,320
that seven years later,

473
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,440
you experienced failure in life.

474
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,850
You lost your career,

475
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,490
your husband,

476
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,250
and your friends.

477
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,130
But you didn't lose them.

478
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,160
You lost yourself.

479
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,450
Don't live in such an exhausting way.

480
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,880
You need to learn to live in the moment.

481
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,810
Mom,

482
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,240
if it were you

483
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,040
who had a chance

484
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,970
to go back to the past

485
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,090
and change something,

486
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,780
wouldn't you choose the same as I did?

487
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,970
For example, to see Dad again?

488
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
I would think about it.

489
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,730
But if he were to

490
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,440
mess up other people's lives after he came back,

491
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,430
I wouldn't.

492
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,120
Everyone is just a fleeting visitor

493
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,480
in other people's lives.

494
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
Sooner or later, they will leave.

495
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,500
Your dad will leave, your mom will leave,

496
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,540
and your children will leave.

497
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,280
In the end,

498
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,360
the only one left with you will be yourself.

499
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,180
You should find yourself,

500
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
love yourself,

501
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,160
and cherish those who love you.

502
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,730
This is more important than anything else.

503
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,250
Should I really give up on Doudou?

504
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,280
Children are the fruit of love,

505
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,240
not products of exchange.

506
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,240
You've always

507
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,580
understood this.

508
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,320
Otherwise,

509
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,010
you wouldn't have come back from Feng Huanan.

510
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,570
You need to respect your heart,

511
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,920
hold on to what's in front of you,

512
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,520
and stop dwelling on the past.

513
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,640
Understand?

514
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,130
Mom, then you...

515
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,970
I'll face my life myself.

516
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,450
Just take care of yourself.
