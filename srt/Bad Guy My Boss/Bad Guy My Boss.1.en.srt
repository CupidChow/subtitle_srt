1
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Elis.

2
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,440
Please, wait for me!

3
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,080
Thank you.

4
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
Good morning, boss.

5
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
You're ten seconds late.

6
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,440
At least the coffee is still hot.

7
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,240
You're late for work and the cup has stains.

8
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,880
Didn't I tell you to keep
housekeepers away from my desk?

9
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,520
I don't like disorganization.

10
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,120
Yes.

11
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
If the same problems happen
tomorrow, call HR to see me.

12
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,240
And remember,

13
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,960
don't call me boss.

14
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
I don't like it.

15
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,560
Do you get it now? Working here is tough.

16
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,840
[Five years later]

17
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,160
Working here for five years
makes difficult issues easier,

18
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Good morning, Mr. Elis.

19
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,200
Do you have a stomach ache?

20
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,960
How do you know?

21
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,160
You always have one before a crucial meeting.

22
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,320
Medication for your stomach, Mr. Elis.

23
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,480
But I have no idea why easy issues become harder.

24
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,680
My stomach churns whenever I'm close to you.

25
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,440
What can cure me, I wonder?

26
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,760
It's harder because of this.

27
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,900
"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 1)

28
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,000
We'll part from here.

29
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,880
Of course.

30
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,240
But I still insist I can't pay a higher price.

31
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,160
You should reconsider it for a night.

32
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,000
We won't agree if you still insist on your price.

33
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,080
You should know that I also
deal with other companies.

34
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,480
Hello, is this Nine One One Company?
Mr. Elis is with another customer.

35
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,800
Is it urgent?

36
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,360
Of course, I'll tell him to
call you back right away.

37
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,080
Mr. Elis, Nine One One Company urgently
wants to discuss a contract with you.

38
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,520
A seaside project?

39
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,560
Please excuse me.

40
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,960
Oh,

41
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
you should know I don't only deal with you.

42
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,280
- What's next on the schedule?
- You have a dinner appointment with Miss Gift.

43
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,520
- Gift?
- Yes.

44
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,360
I think I didn't appoint her.

45
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
Don't tell me...

46
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,160
Yes, I appointed Kim.

47
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,880
Understood.

48
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Mr. Patt.

49
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,400
Good evening, Miss Gift.

50
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,200
What about Mr. Elis?

51
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,400
He has an appointment,
so he doesn't want you to wait.

52
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,383
He told you to dine with me?

53
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes. You may order anything
you want. I'll pay for it.

54
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,000
Waiter.

55
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,120
I want to order the large Beef Welling
with a special sauce for Mr. Elis.

56
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,280
Mr. Elis's specialty, as usual?

57
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,640
- Yes.
- Right away.

58
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,280
Let's go eat something.

59
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,560
That's fine. I'm full.

60
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,680
I must go somewhere else.

61
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,720
Wait.

62
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,800
How was she?

63
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,880
She was upset and went home.

64
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,280
I knew it.

65
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,600
I ordered Beef Wellington for you.

66
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,440
Thanks. I'm hungry.

67
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,520
What about you? Hungry?

68
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,880
I've already had dinner.

69
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,960
Mr. Elis,

70
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,600
Could... I ask something from you?

71
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
What is it?

72
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,680
Please...

73
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,120
don't appoint someone like
this again. It gives me a headache.

74
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,120
Is it okay for once in a while?

75
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,160
Once in every two
weeks isn't once in a while.

76
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,680
You don't make an appointment for me, do you?

77
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,840
If I make every appointment,
I can't do the company's work.

78
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,960
Straight back home?

79
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,960
I'll put the stuff here, Mr. Elis.

80
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,640
I'll take my leave.

81
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,920
Hello, Kim.

82
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,160
We just met.

83
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,120
Why do you call me?

84
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,960
I want someone to dine with. Is it odd?

85
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,040
It is.

86
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,600
Don't you wanna eat with me?

87
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,560
Why not?

88
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,960
- Another bottle of this.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,880
Isn't a bottle enough?

90
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,280
You should stop.

91
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,680
Have you ever loved someone?

92
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,440
I love you.

93
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,680
Don't include me.

94
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,360
You know I can't love anyone.

95
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,320
Why?

96
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,440
Because of Run?

97
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,360
Don't mention that guy.

98
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,320
Then, just move on and start anew.

99
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm trying.

100
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,840
Trying?

101
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,680
With who?

102
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,720
Forget it.

103
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,920
Patt, are you really
okay with arranging my...

104
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,680
private schedule?

105
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:52,615
Yes, I'm okay. It's also my work.

106
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,760
How?

107
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,200
If you don't let me arrange your private schedule,

108
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,280
it'll affect your working schedule, and I must
rearrange everything for you again. Am I right?

109
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,680
Why do you ask?

110
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,920
I just wonder about...

111
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,200
your feelings.

112
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,480
I'm okay if you don't feel anything.

113
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,840
Why?

114
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,360
I don't have to do it if I feel something?

115
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,760
I'll find someone to do it if you don't.

116
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm the one who can train, am I not?

117
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,280
Yep.

118
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,160
I'll arrange everything for you, as usual.

119
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,760
Don't worry. I don't feel a thing.

120
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,160
Mr. Elis?

121
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,080
Is he that drunk?

122
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,760
- Take care of him, Mr. Patt.
- Mr. Elis.

123
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm okay...

124
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
Be careful.

125
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
Easy there.

126
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,720
Watch your head.

127
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,480
Sit slowly.

128
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,760
Please take care of him.

129
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,040
Yes.

130
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,680
Are you really okay?

131
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:03,360
Here we are.

132
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,840
You're leaving now?

133
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,680
Yes.

134
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,600
Excuse me. One, two, three!

135
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,800
What are you doing, Mr. Elis?

136
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,120
Stay with me.

137
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,760
Waiter,

138
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,920
I want a glass of Blue Hawaii.

139
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,000
And...

140
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,080
What's wrong?

141
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,960
Waiter, excuse me.

142
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,400
I'll get three glasses of Blue Hawaii.

143
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,720
I thought you wouldn't come.

144
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,960
What took you so long?

145
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,440
After my work at a construction site,

146
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,560
Vexter and I come right at you.

147
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,480
It's not often you're down.
We must come to see you.

148
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,360
What if you're stressed and die?

149
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
Yeah, I'm kinda stressed recently.

150
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,560
About what?

151
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, what is it?

152
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,560
Do you... like someone?

153
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,120
I knew it!

154
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,360
Our boy has grown.

155
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,840
I'm not confident.

156
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,800
What? Giving up now?

157
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,160
You won't succeed.

158
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
I don't know...

159
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,120
what to do next.

160
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,880
Use your feelings.

161
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,760
We have no idea if you don't know.

162
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,600
Who do you like?

163
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,840
Yeah, who's that?

164
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,640
You two wanna know?

165
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,240
Was that for me?

166
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,120
No, for the person across the
street. Of course, it's you two!

167
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,640
I...

168
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
won't tell.

169
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,720
What?!

170
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,880
Who's Gretel?

171
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,720
Gretel, my ass! I won't tell!

172
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,560
[Dork]

173
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,760
Get heartbroken for not telling us!

174
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,680
I'm already heartbroken, thanks.

175
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Poor him. He fails with love.

176
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,160
Come, come. Let's forget it and cheer.

177
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,880
Yeah.

178
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,400
It's refreshing.

179
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,400
Play "Burn It Down" for us.

180
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
You know it?!

181
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,320
You da man.

182
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,120
Good afternoon, Mr. Elis.

183
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,800
Good afternoon, Mr. Elis.

184
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,280
What happened last night?

185
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Nothing.

186
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,680
Did I say something... strange?

187
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,480
Not a word.

188
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,120
You were so drunk last night, Mr. Kim carried
you to the car and I drove you back home.

189
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,160
That was all.

190
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,440
Why did you drink that much?

191
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,000
Thought of an old memory.

192
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,760
Are you free this evening?

193
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,200
Excuse me?

194
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
Have dinner with me.

195
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,640
That's all for now.

196
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
When was the last time
we had dinner together?

197
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,720
Almost a month.

198
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,560
That long?

199
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
We had it together almost every day.

200
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,960
Our work is settled, so we don't
need to eat while working like before.

201
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
Telling me I overused you?

202
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Isn't that the truth?

203
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,920
You're right. But I'll still do it because
we need to expand the business together.

204
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,560
Put the phone down.

205
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,440
I want a relaxed dinner.

206
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,400
Yes.

207
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,600
Haven't... you appointed anyone today?

208
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,040
If so, why did I invite you?

209
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Oh, Mr. Patt? Do you two have dinner together?

210
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,800
Kim?

211
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,280
You appointed me yesterday, remember?

212
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,480
You may sit here, Mr. Kim.
I just finished talking with Mr. Elis.

213
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,040
Thank you, Mr. Patt.

214
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,360
You may call me anytime.
I'll wait for you in the car.

215
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,320
Upset?

216
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,000
Would you like me to drive you home?

217
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,440
Upset because of me?

218
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
Would you like me to drive you home?

219
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,920
Yes.

220
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,920
Are these all work in the schedule?

221
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,720
Yes.

222
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,680
Continue with your work.

223
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,240
Yes.

224
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,160
Oh,

225
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,160
I won't accept any appointment
this evening. I'll meet Kim at the hotel.

226
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,960
Yes.

227
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,760
Hey, you invite us to eat at the company.

228
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:44,872
No one here wants to be friends with you?

229
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
I only invite you to eat here.

230
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,280
- Stop asking already.
- Come on, I was joking.

231
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Don't be serious.

232
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,000
By the way, are you okay?

233
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Yep.

234
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,360
Why?

235
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,400
You're pulling a long face.

236
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,120
My face? Really?

237
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,240
- I'm gonna slap you.
- Measure it for me.

238
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,120
I mean you look sad!

239
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,520
What a rascal! You're fine now!

240
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,200
It's good you're fine.

241
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
Let's continue with your boss.

242
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,480
Why?

243
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Because I'm curious.

244
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,760
Your boss' house is huge,

245
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,080
he always has flings at the hotel.

246
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,680
The vibe's better?

247
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
I don't know.

248
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,800
Mr. Elis is an introvert.
He doesn't like people to visit his house.

249
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,560
Damn...

250
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:40,960
Hey!

251
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,360
Sorry...

252
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,640
Rich and mysterious.

253
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,800
Just stay out of his affair.

254
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,320
When will you two go back to work?

255
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,320
What? Tell us to go away after lunch?

256
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,640
I didn't.

257
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,360
Just ask what time you work.

258
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,520
Don't you have work to do?

259
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,200
Yeah, I wonder.

260
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm upset.

261
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,320
Sometimes, I feel like I want to quit.

262
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,800
What?

263
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,280
- Quit?!
- Shush!

264
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,360
I want to quit.

265
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,920
What?

266
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,560
Quit?!

267
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,480
Shush!

268
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,400
Have a seat.

269
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,040
What about Mr. Kim?

270
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,360
I cancelled.

271
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,880
This is my treat.

272
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,680
I even ordered the restaurant to be closed.

273
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,680
For what?

274
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,520
For the best employee.

275
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,200
You do excellent work every year.

276
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,320
I must give you a reward.

277
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,840
These are the place's recommended dishes.

278
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,840
You can check the reviews later.

279
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,320
Yes.

280
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,400
Dig in.

281
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,760
Mr. Elis.

282
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,880
Want to order more dishes?

283
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,280
Go ahead.

284
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,040
I'm allergic to seafood.

285
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,400
Here's your food, Mr. Elis.

286
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,360
Are you hungry? You ordered two dishes.

287
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,640
We've been in the meeting the whole day.
You haven't had anything in the morning.

288
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,200
It's okay. Please eat.

289
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,640
I'm not hungry...

290
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,400
I mean it...

291
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,320
See?

292
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,080
Your stomach's rumbling.

293
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,480
Eat. Don't make me force you.

294
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,520
Right, I'll eat.

295
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,360
Why don't you eat?

296
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,160
I order you to eat.

297
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
Dig in.

298
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,200
This is my favorite.

299
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,080
Do you want chicken?
I can share some with you.

300
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,560
Just eat your food.

301
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,080
A piece?

302
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,840
Okay.

303
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,280
Want pork?

304
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,880
Haven't you checked
that the figures are wrong?!

305
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,760
Mr. Patt usually helps...

306
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,080
Don't mention others!

307
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,680
Want to use my secretary for your convenience?

308
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,280
If you can't do your duty,

309
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,960
share your salary with Patt!

310
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,160
Correct the figures.

311
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,640
I beg your pardon? Do I have a day off?

312
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,320
Yes.

313
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,680
But today's schedule is tight.

314
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Isn't following my orders your job?

315
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,480
You're right.

316
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,880
I order you to have a day off.

317
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,640
Don't worry about the work.
I can handle them.

318
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,680
Are you sure?

319
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,480
I'll suspend you from work if you don't.

320
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,400
Okay.

321
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Call me anytime if you need something.

322
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,880
Have a day off.

323
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,280
Hello.

324
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:34,552
I want this one.

325
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,280
Thank you.

326
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,640
Do you want chicken?
I can share some with you.

327
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,840
Just eat your food.

328
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,440
A piece?

329
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,960
Okay.

330
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,480
Excuse me,

331
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
I'd like the same cake to go.

332
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,440
Come in.

333
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,000
Don't you have a day off?

334
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,200
I did.

335
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,960
I bought this for you. It's tasty.

336
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,400
How's the work?

337
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Good. I've cleared them all.

338
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,680
What are you thinking?

339
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,000
Nothing.

340
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
You're lying. It shows on your face.

341
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,800
Why do you look at my face?

342
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,560
Are you free tonight?

343
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,360
You still force me to go anyway.

344
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,640
What do you need me to do?

345
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,480
There's no seafood this time.

346
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,520
I didn't say anything.

347
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,560
Is something wrong? This is unusual.

348
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,160
I want you to rest,

349
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,040
but you didn't take a day off.

350
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,800
How could I relax and let you work alone?

351
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,800
By the way,

352
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,440
we haven't rested like this for a long time.

353
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,960
Yes.

354
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,800
We normally ate while talking about work.

355
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,880
It was more fun back then.

356
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,480
For our first project.

357
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,640
No, for our next projects too.

358
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,320
You just signed one project.
How many more do you want?

359
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,240
Until you can't bear them.

360
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,160
That would take hundreds of them.

361
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,840
You said it. Don't quit if I can
get hundreds of projects.

362
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,600
If you can do it, our company must
be included in the stock exchange.

363
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,160
That's "our" goal.

364
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,760
Our?

365
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,880
Our.

366
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,360
For our goal.

367
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,080
For our goal.

368
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,560
I still can't believe that we
succeeded in what we planned here.

369
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,600
Yes, it wouldn't be possible
that quick without you.

370
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,600
But you cleared all the
work without me today.

371
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,840
You're right.

372
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,360
While you were out, I could work
smoothly because I can do everything.

373
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,760
You'll be fine without me.

374
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,440
No way!

375
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,440
Why don't you let me quit?

376
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,240
I didn't say I wanted you to stay.

377
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,560
You may not notice that your office
computer logins with my Google ID.

378
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,480
I know what you searched for.

379
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,200
You wouldn't want to reserve a place
in a restaurant without a reason.

380
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,440
I plan to quit one day,

381
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,080
but not soon.

382
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,320
Don't worry.

383
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,120
I won't allow it.

384
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,320
Excuse me?

385
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,520
How long will you employ me?

386
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,960
Forever.

387
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,240
(Next Episode)
Look at me like last night.

388
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,000
I know you have a bond with this place.
But that Elis is... unbearable!

389
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,760
I'm also sly,

390
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,600
I'll lend you a loan in exchange
for 70% of the company's share.

391
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,880
Vile,

392
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,120
and can be much worse.

393
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,695
When will you stop being
prejudiced against Mr. Teeranai?

394
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,400
May I accompany you to the Khao Kho project?

395
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,240
Patt is Mr. Elis' secretary.

396
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,480
That adorable man.

397
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,600
Get Patt to see me.

398
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
Patt has a day off today.

399
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,280
I don't see where this is going.

400
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,520
You fall for him.
