"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 3)

2
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,760
(Previously)
Get to the point of this meeting.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,760
You shouldn't do that to Mr. Teeranai.

4
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,720
Why?

5
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,400
He's your stakeholder and a relative.

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,440
I don't care about
relatives. Only benefits.

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,160
May I accompany you
to the Khao Kho project?

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,120
Mr. Elis requests the inspection of my
department and needs me to clarify his doubts.

9
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,720
I can't go with you.

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
I helped you by dealing with Teeranai.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,520
You were upset that I
went with Mr. Teeranai.

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,080
Don't use me as an excuse.

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,720
If you think ordering me to find a present
for Mr. Kim or serving you and Mr. Win

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,000
hurt me,

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,080
then I'm sorry.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,960
How's the project in Hua Hin?

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,520
It goes well.

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,720
Good.

19
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,320
That's all for today.
The meeting's dismissed.

20
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll let a housekeeper
take care of your lunch.

21
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,480
- Bring it to my office.
- Yes.

22
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,680
- Wait.
- Yes?

23
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
I've changed my mind.

24
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,000
Appoint Kim to have French cuisine with me.

25
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
What would be a meeting
place? At your condo or...

26
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
At my office.

27
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,640
Wine too.

28
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,600
And don't let anyone
interrupt my precious time.

29
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,280
Yes, I'll make sure no one
interrupts you and your special guest.

30
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,120
You really know what I want.

31
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Yes.

32
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,720
Everything's in order.

33
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,960
All dishes have no shrimp
because Mr. Kim is allergic to it.

34
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,680
And that's your wine.

35
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,200
Am I on time?

36
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,760
Yes, you are. Patt just
prepared everything.

37
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

38
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,840
Shall we eat?

39
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
Of course.

40
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,840
You told me to eat, but
why are you absent-minded?

41
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,160
The wine's not good. I
must call Patt to change it.

42
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,760
But that's your favorite
brand. How's that possible?

43
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
It's not good today.

44
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,800
Hello. See you at the coffee shop.

45
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Yeah, see yah.

46
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,360
Ms. Aeom.

47
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,840
Take care of Mr. Elis
and his special guest.

48
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't let anyone interrupt them.
I must be out of the office this afternoon.

49
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,400
The whole company would
be chaotic without you.

50
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,360
Who knows Mr. Elis better than you?

51
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
Mr. Elis will be busy the whole day.
He won't notice my absence.

52
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,920
Okay.

53
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,920
Comin'.

54
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,760
You're late.

55
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,440
I hurried, but the traffic was jammed.
Invite me for coffee? What's on your mind?

56
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,880
Can't I invite you?

57
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,489
Of course you can, but
how can you be free?

58
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:18,040
You're always with your boss
like two peas in a pod.

59
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,040
I already invited you.

60
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
You asked too much.

61
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,240
Fine, I'll head back.

62
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,320
Wait, wait.

63
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,400
Dude, I want to treat you coffee.

64
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,560
That's sweet. I'll give you a reward later.

65
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll order coffee.

66
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,360
I want... a white
chocolate macchiato.

67
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
A dessert is...

68
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,280
banoffee.

69
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,680
Make it two. I'll eat
one here and one to go.

70
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,480
I'll see my mom after you.

71
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll tell her it's your treat.

72
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,320
You're so kindhearted.

73
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,720
That's all. Be my guest.

74
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,040
Talk to him. He'll pay.

75
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,760
How's your provincial project?

76
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Not as busy as you.

77
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,200
He's still harassing you
while having a half day off.

78
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,560
I wouldn't work if I were you.

79
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Yeah, I want to find a new job.

80
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
Are you serious?

81
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm sick of the problems there.

82
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,200
Working outside Bangkok
like you would be nice.

83
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,200
This can't be good. Is he lazy or
something? Can't he do anything without you?

84
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,080
Watch your mouth. He's my boss.

85
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,920
You're protecting him, eh?
Didn't you say you wanna quit?

86
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
Here are your drinks.

87
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,800
Fought with your boss?

88
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,640
Shut yah trap. Drink up.

89
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,080
Man, just answer him! It's annoying!

90
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Fine!

91
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,400
Yes, Ms. Aeom?

92
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,600
Hello, Patt.

93
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,600
Patt,

94
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,200
why didn't you answer me?

95
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,280
I'm not free.

96
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Where are you?

97
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,960
Around here.

98
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,440
Where is that? I'll go to you.

99
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,280
Why would you come?

100
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,360
I want to.

101
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,360
I'm not free.

102
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
Kim isn't here.

103
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,880
Yes.

104
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,080
I can't find my ID and credit card.

105
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,520
Did you take them out of your wallet?

106
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,440
Stop asking and help me find them.

107
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,960
Do you need them now?

108
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,720
Yes.

109
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,960
They're necessities I must carry.

110
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,200
Then why did you take
them out of your wallet?

111
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Come back and help me find them.

112
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
I won't do it again.

113
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,240
I can't. I'm busy right now.

114
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,400
I must go. See you tomorrow.

115
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Patt!

116
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,600
Patt!

117
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,320
Patt!

118
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
I start to think...

119
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
that two of you...

120
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,000
are something more.

121
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,560
Don't overthink. Eat the dessert.

122
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,400
Hope you don't mind my spoon.

123
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,160
Eat your own thing.

124
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Come and see me here right now.

125
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,000
Patt!

126
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,680
[Two years ago]

127
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,200
Come here right now before
I have no suit for the party!

128
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,320
That new housekeeper put them
away somewhere! Sack her tomorrow!

129
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,440
Even neckties!

130
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,160
Right now!

131
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,360
Here's your suit, Mr. Elis.
The housekeeper took it to a laundry.

132
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,440
Hold on.

133
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,400
Here you go.

134
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,320
You're wet.

135
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm fine. Though I'm wet,
your suit definitely isn't.

136
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,040
But the floor is.

137
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,600
Wait here.

138
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,520
Wipe yourself.

139
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,600
Why ride a bike taxi, not a cab?
The rain can make you sick.

140
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,040
The rain and traffic are terrible. If I came
by taxi, you'd be late for the party.

141
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,520
You're crazy.

142
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,720
Here.

143
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,400
Change your clothes.

144
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,560
Yes.

145
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
Mr. Elis.

146
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
Mr. Elis.

147
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,680
Mr. Elis.

148
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
Mr. Elis?

149
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,000
Huh?

150
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,200
I'll drive you there.
The traffic will make you frustrated.

151
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,280
It's almost 8 PM. Did you eat anything?

152
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,480
If not eating on time,
you'll get gastritis again.

153
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,720
Mornin', dude. Rise and shine.

154
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,640
Dang...

155
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,840
Always wear your boss' t-shirt.
Don't you wear something else?

156
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
It's comfy.

157
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,920
And jolly.

158
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,760
Shut up.

159
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,640
It makes me sleep well.

160
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,040
You can't stand a tease, huh?

161
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,400
After dragging me with
you last night, happy now?

162
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,400
A bit.

163
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh, will you go to work?

164
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,960
Yes, I will.

165
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,760
My day off isn't like yours.
You can have it for being mad at your boss.

166
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,040
Come on, that was my first time.

167
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,640
I always work 24/7 like
a convenience store.

168
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,680
Have another day off. Don't go to work.

169
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,120
Wash dishes for me.

170
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,360
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,320
I'm goin'.

172
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,240
See yah.

173
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,480
I think...

174
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,640
your work...

175
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,720
has arrived here.

176
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,480
What work?

177
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,920
What's wrong with you,
having a day off and flirting with others?

178
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,480
What's wrong with that? I manage your
fling schedule every day without complaint.

179
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,600
I'm hungry.

180
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,400
Have anything to eat?

181
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,720
I haven't eaten since last night.

182
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,600
Go ahead, Mr. Elis.
I'm heading out to work.

183
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm going, babe?

184
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,480
Yes, be right there.

185
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,600
My wife called me.

186
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,320
I wasn't home last night. She misses me.

187
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,600
Nothing for you to eat here.

188
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,760
There are eggs!

189
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,840
Mr. Elis,

190
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
want to eat something light?

191
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,080
[Asshole.]

192
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,720
It's because I love you, that's why.

193
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
Please excuse me.

194
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,360
Eggs won't satisfy you.

195
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
I want an egg.

196
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,800
A fried one.

197
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,880
You can't bear bland food.
That seasoning may help you.

198
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,920
If you know me well, didn't you know
I was upset when you were gone?

199
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
Of course, I know.

200
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,560
It was my intention,

201
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,960
to show you I'm a human. You can't do
anything or hurt my feelings as you please.

202
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,880
Why didn't you say you
don't want me to see Kim?

203
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,520
Do I have that right?

204
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,480
Ask me, so you know whether I do it or not.

205
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,800
Yes?

206
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,800
See you in half an hour.
Prepare the meeting room.

207
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,120
Change your clothes and go to the company.

208
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,200
Right now.

209
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Now!

210
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,320
The materials cost for the Hua Hin
condo construction increased by 20%.

211
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,120
Didn't you say everything went well?
How did your deal cause the loss?!

212
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,040
They just announced a cost
increase of 20% more than last year.

213
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,240
It's an uncontrollable factor.

214
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,560
Uncontrollable or not
meant to be controlled?

215
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,600
I didn't mean to make a mistake.

216
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,240
Besides, I prepared all material
cost lists and reports as you see now.

217
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,120
You can't be serious.

218
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,960
You must know the budget has
a tendency to increase each year.

219
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,560
How can you set room
prices that risk a high loss?!

220
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,240
Idiot!

221
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:28,975
Well... I see we have many competitors and
want to sell our rooms as much as possible.

222
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,400
So, I set a price not too high.

223
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,360
If you can't settle this
by tomorrow, then quit!

224
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Mr. Patt.

225
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,920
Could you talk to Mr. Elis for me
that the material cost is uncontrollable?

226
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,880
He won't believe me

227
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,800
because he's still furious.

228
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,000
Maybe you could bargain
with the material company.

229
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,720
I did,

230
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
but they can't help at all.

231
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,160
My father

232
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,720
will suffer if I'm fired.

233
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,040
Calm down, Mr. Teeranai.

234
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,040
Give me some time to think
about how I can help you.

235
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,280
Mr. Patt, you must help me.

236
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,880
Please.

237
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,400
I beg you.

238
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,600
Thank you.

239
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,800
Mr. Elis!

240
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,040
Mr. Elis!

241
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,720
The material cost...

242
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,280
Teeranai knows he must set a markup price.

243
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,000
He intends to mess it up
and let the company go red.

244
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,680
No one intends to let this happen.
We should find a way to solve the problem.

245
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,360
Your optimism lets others take advantage
of you. You wouldn't survive without me.

246
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,960
Are you really the boss who
doesn't take advantage of me?

247
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
Why do you take his side? Fond of him?

248
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,120
I don't take sides.

249
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,240
He has evidence of his innocence.

250
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,040
I don't care! I'll sack him if he fails!

251
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,600
Mr. Teeranai won't get sacked
if the project is profitable?

252
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,160
Do you think you can do it?

253
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,440
With my full effort.

254
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,640
Not for Mr. Teeranai, but for the company.

255
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,920
Hello, dear client. I must
inform you something.

256
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,880
Our construction materials are out of stock, So
I'm looking for substitutes of similar quality.

257
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,800
Thank you very much!

258
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,720
Please deliver them to Burton's project.

259
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,440
Yes, I've sent it.

260
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Yes, I'll take care of it and hurry them.

261
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,440
This was for a guard.
Accidentally bought one more.

262
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,160
Hello, mister customer.

263
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,480
Yes.

264
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,120
Oh, it's Oasis' project.

265
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,080
Eat and have a rest.

266
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,440
Hello, Mr. Manoch. I'm
in front of the coffee shop.

267
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,280
Yes, see you.

268
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,120
Hello, Mr. Manoch.

269
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Thank you, Mr. Patt.

270
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,440
You don't have to come yourself.

271
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,880
Did you sleep?

272
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,800
I want to... ask you a favor.

273
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,920
Our company is... facing a loss crisis.

274
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,400
So, I want...

275
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,880
Mr. Patt? Mr. Patt!

276
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,520
Patt!

277
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,800
Patt!

278
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
Mr. Elis?

279
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,320
What's the hurry? Sleep.
You didn't sleep last night.

280
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,280
I must talk with a contractor.
As well as ten more of them.

281
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,440
Want to beat me that much?

282
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,480
Our company is facing
a problem. I must do it.

283
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,200
Stop worrying about others than yourself.

284
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,160
Don't be stubborn.

285
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,760
Have a rest.

286
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,040
Hey!

287
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,680
What are you doing?

288
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,400
I never force anyone.

289
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,560
I just don't want a stinky
man to make my sofa stinky.

290
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,840
I can't quit because you're like this.

291
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
Then don't quit.

292
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,640
I'm not mean.

293
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:32,040
You're sharp-tongued but kindhearted.

294
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,560
Where are you going?

295
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,560
I must be away from
you, or you'll get sick.

296
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,920
Look at yourself. Don't worry about me.

297
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,920
I ordered boiled rice for you. Now, rest.

298
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,360
Get up when you're better.

299
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,920
Why am I smiling?

300
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,680
Thank you for reducing the cost.

301
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,120
I sympathize with Mr. Patt.

302
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,360
The company must be in big trouble
that he came to see me himself.

303
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,560
Your secretary is admirable.

304
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,240
You should thank him.

305
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,520
I really appreciate it.

306
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,160
Sorry for a long sleep.

307
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,600
Yes, so long that I must put boiled
rice in a fridge and boil it again.

308
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,560
Then, I'll head back to work.

309
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,400
Don't go anywhere. I order you to have a break
because you've saved the company and Teeranai.

310
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,160
How?

311
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,200
The contractor decreased the contract cost.

312
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,960
I used the remaining budget to fill the
material adjustment cost. And it's acceptable.

313
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,560
Thank you for negotiating with him.

314
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,120
I did nothing. It was you.

315
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,520
Here.

316
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,920
Eat.

317
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,920
I can eat it myself.

318
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,000
I warmed this for you.

319
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,200
Eat.

320
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,560
Open your mouth.

321
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,720
Thank you for your effort for our company.

322
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,360
What did you say?

323
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,360
I said thank you.

324
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,920
Can I record when you say that?

325
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,520
Stop being silly and eat.

326
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,600
It's bland. Can you add more soy sauce?

327
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,120
You'll catch my cold.

328
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,040
This won't affect me. And it's not bland.

329
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,080
Here, eat.

330
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,040
You look cute... without glasses.

331
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,960
Good evening, Mr. Elis.
May I pick my friend up?

332
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,040
How do you know this place?

333
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,120
I called him.

334
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,480
Patt said he doesn't
feel safe in your house.

335
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,600
I mean...

336
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
doesn't want to bother you.

337
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,360
You can sleep here if you're not well.

338
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,720
No, it's okay I don't want to bother you
any further. Thank you and see you tomorrow.

339
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Ah!

340
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
He forgot his glasses.

341
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,840
Ah!

342
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,200
A suit.

343
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,920
It's behind you.

344
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,600
If you don't mind, could you...

345
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,280
Thank you. See you next time.

346
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,480
Tell the whole story.

347
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,720
My boss will drive me crazy.

348
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:31,480
You're going crazy because
you see your boss as... adorable?

349
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,000
Isn't your boss a playboy?

350
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,280
Gotta be careful.

351
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,080
He may be flirting with you.

352
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,000
That's what I'm afraid of.

353
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,800
I'd get hurt if I fell for him.

354
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,080
Congratulations, dude!

355
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,240
You're in the vicious cycle of love!

356
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
No way!

357
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:05,560
You'll see that I'll keep a five-meter
distance from him tomorrow!

358
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,920
Wait and see!

359
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,480
Gotcha!

360
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,040
I told you not to use my
spoon. You'll catch a cold.

361
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,040
I didn't expect your
cold would be this potent.

362
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,000
I'll get you medication.

363
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,280
Don't take too long.

364
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,600
Yes.

365
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,560
That's fine. I've brought the medication.

366
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,160
The medication's here. You would
want to have private time with Mr. Kim.

367
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,120
You don't have to. Stay here.

368
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,800
I want you to stay with me
while I'm sick in case I need you.

369
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,120
Don't worry. Give Elis his medication.

370
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,560
I'll tell someone to bring boiled rice.

371
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,640
No need.

372
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,240
Patt ordered it.

373
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,840
I'll bring you a blanket.

374
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,640
No need.

375
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,200
He prepared one for me.

376
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,200
Patt.

377
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,360
- Yes?
- Bring it to me.

378
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,800
Where's Patt?

379
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,280
He's preparing documents.

380
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,640
Can you work now?

381
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,360
Yeah, I'm better.

382
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,960
Do you have feelings toward Patt?

383
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,600
What would you do...

384
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,840
if I say "yes?"

385
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,400
Will Patt be in my position?

386
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,640
Not everyone can accept it.

387
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,800
You're not the same as him.

388
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,520
I see that you're better now. I'll leave.

389
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,000
If Patt asks,

390
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,880
tell him I'll be sleeping for a long time.

391
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,480
Elis is sick, so he's
sleeping for a long time.

392
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,320
Hasn't he got up since I was out?

393
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,520
Have you expected
disappointment from loving Elis?

394
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,040
Excuse me?

395
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,120
I know what I see.

396
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,600
I don't think of him that way.

397
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,640
Even if you think, or
there's something more.

398
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,200
I don't mind if he has partners.

399
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,840
I agreed with him we
could have someone else.

400
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,360
Hope you can accept that.

401
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,240
I knew you can't be away from him!

402
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,760
I tried.

403
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,840
Then, can you elaborate
on your "attempt" to me?

404
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,200
I...

405
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,440
didn't talk to him.

406
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,160
[Don't forget to sign the documents.
I've prepared them for you.]

407
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,640
Patt.

408
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,160
Don't go anywhere.

409
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,520
Be with me.

410
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,360
Yes, I do. Don't worry.

411
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,400
Tell me if you need anything. I've
done all the work. I won't go anywhere.

412
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,160
So, what's next? Get closer to him?!

413
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,680
Dude! Why would I do that?!

414
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,320
Would you stay with him
if he pretends to be sick?

415
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,720
Who would agree with that!

416
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,560
Talk to you later.

417
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,000
Patt,

418
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,280
didn't I tell you...

419
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,680
not to leave me when I'm sick?

420
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,560
Mr. Elis!

421
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,600
And until I'm better,
you must take care of me. Got it?

422
00:47:55,975 --> 00:47:57,975
(Next Episode)

423
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,120
Just wipe him until he's
fine, then ask him to leave.

424
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,800
Fine. Do it, Patt.

425
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,560
Go.

426
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,760
Don't overthink it.

427
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,560
Reserve a hotel room and appoint Kim.

428
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,720
Woah! Does Mr. Elis have high sex drive?

429
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,840
Here's a list of Mr. Elis' friend with
benefits you must manage, Mr. Thiti.

430
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,680
He works really well. I
don't have to worry if I quit.

431
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,200
You're mean.

432
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,520
What am I to you?
