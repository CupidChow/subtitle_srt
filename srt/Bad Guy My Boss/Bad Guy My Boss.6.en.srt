"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 6)

2
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,160
(Previously)
I can sense a handsome 190 cm high man!

3
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,560
You know how much I'm worried about you?

4
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,120
You don't have to serve me.

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,320
You're cute when you're…

6
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
worried about me.

7
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,960
I want you to work for me.

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
I don't know about your
conflict with Mr. Fei Long,

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,600
but I can promise you I'll
never work for him.

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,920
This man isn't arrogant.

11
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,840
More like worried about Elyes.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,280
Hope you'll play fair.

13
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,560
Does it mean you're afraid…

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,440
to lose?

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,840
Still miss him?

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,200
No, I don't.

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
I can see it on your face.

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,840
Mr. Elyes!

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,240
How was the meeting? Did Mr. JC choose us?
Should I prepare our competitor's information?

20
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,320
I don't know which
question I must answer first.

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
Up to you.

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,400
It made me glad.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,880
Did Mr. JC choose us?

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,360
No,

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,600
the companies are here for the information.

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,480
What do you mean by you're glad?

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
I'm glad that you're worried about me.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,920
Pat.

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,320
I miss you.

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,920
I didn't think I'd see you again.

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,960
Paeng, are you here to work?

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,960
No, I came to see you.

33
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,800
How do you know I'm here?

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
But I…

35
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,160
blocked my contacts
after I broke up with you?

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,000
That's easy enough. I have a finsta.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,480
I was worried after seeing your sad posts.

38
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Then, I checked and knew you were here.

39
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,040
It's the same password.

40
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,840
Answer my calls and texts next time.

41
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
You two talked a lot.

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,000
The wind's strong and the sun's
brighter. Come and talk inside.

43
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm Elyes, Pat's boss.

44
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,840
He's “my”

45
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,000
secretary.

46
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,040
Good afternoon. I'm Paeng, Pat's ex-

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
She's my friend!

48
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Where are you staying?

49
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,000
Here.

50
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,960
You'd better go check in.

51
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,040
Okay, we'll talk later.

52
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
Excuse me.

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,960
I had to check since you
were talking for a while.

54
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,760
It wasn't long.

55
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,240
I have many things to talk about with you.

56
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,760
Don't you want to know
the meeting's result?

57
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Thinking of him?!

58
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,080
Stop harassing me!

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,320
- Where are you going?
- To take a walk.

60
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm not your prisoner,
so I'm free to do so.

61
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,480
I see now why Mr. Fei Long invited me.
He wants to bid on the project against you.

62
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,520
He didn't come here just for that.

63
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,520
Fei Long must see that you're valuable.

64
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
But you didn't agree to go.

65
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,040
Right?

66
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,800
You seem to wary about that.

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,320
I can't lose to him again.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,680
Again?

69
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,295
There you are.

70
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
What's wrong?

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,720
Looking for you is stressful enough.

72
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Is there something else?

73
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,200
I just had a walk.

74
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,040
Must I always be under your watch?

75
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,200
Of course, not.

76
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
But…

77
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
But what?

78
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,090
I can't stop being worried about you…

79
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,960
when I can't find you.

80
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,120
Run.

81
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,880
I love you.

82
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,400
I'm sorry.

83
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,200
We should break up.

84
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Why?

85
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
Is it Fei Long?

86
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,800
Is he better than me?

87
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,160
Is it money?

88
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,360
Or sex?

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,160
How can you do this?

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,120
You don't get it.

91
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,920
How can I?!

92
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,680
You don't say a thing!

93
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,600
I just chose him over you.

94
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,720
Have you ever loved me?

95
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,200
Can't you answer that?

96
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I just want to know…

97
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,880
if you have ever loved me.

98
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,480
Your ex?

99
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,640
So, that's the reason.

100
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Forget it. It was a long time ago.

101
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,000
You forbade me from working for Fei Long.

102
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,120
There's nothing indeed.

103
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:14,504
You want to win the bid because
you don't want to lose again.

104
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm worried about you too.

105
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,400
Fei Long is a vile man.

106
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
You're partly right about the project.

107
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,840
I also want the company to make a profit.

108
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,840
What's wrong with that?

109
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,240
No, nothing's wrong at all.

110
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:39,296
You understand everything, right?

111
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,720
Hope you don't quit.

112
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,920
I think I only promised you
I won't work for Mr. Fei Long

113
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,040
but not about my resignation.

114
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,240
I don't fall for it.

115
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,720
Nice beach, huh?

116
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,600
It's good to come to the
beach once in a while.

117
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,480
Yes, the weather's nice today.

118
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,680
It's been ages since I came to the beach.

119
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,280
Didn't think the vibe was this good.

120
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,680
It's tasty.

121
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,400
Mine as well.

122
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200
Trade?

123
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,240
- Yours is tasty!
- I told you. Yours is tasty too.

124
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,040
- Go that way?
- Yes.

125
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,520
Watch the right.

126
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,720
The weather's nice.

127
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,560
Pat!

128
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes?

129
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,960
Want one?

130
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't think so.

131
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,040
Are you sure?

132
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,960
It's cute.

133
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,680
I'll wear it if you wear one too.

134
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,120
Challenge accepted.

135
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,440
Excuse me,

136
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,400
I want two of these.

137
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,440
Let's change pants.

138
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,120
Mr. Run.

139
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,640
Let go!

140
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,280
Mr. Fei Long's looking for you.
I'll be in trouble if you don't go back.

141
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,160
Found him?

142
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,240
Give me a break. I just had a walk.

143
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,320
A walk?

144
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,880
Near him?!

145
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,680
You're mine.

146
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,880
I never let you go.

147
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,080
Mark my words!

148
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,080
I'll return to Bangkok
tomorrow. Come with me?

149
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
No.

150
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,920
Why?

151
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,120
You must go with me.

152
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,200
I quit. Remember?

153
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
But I haven't approved.

154
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Remember?

155
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
I don't want to go alone.

156
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,560
Please.

157
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,440
Pat.

158
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,560
Pat.

159
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,880
Come on, go with me.

160
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,600
Pretty please.

161
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,520
Pat.

162
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,800
Paeng?

163
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,160
What's up?

164
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,920
Have dinner with me?

165
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,000
I…

166
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,560
Can't you have a meal with me?

167
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,040
See you at the hotel restaurant at 7 pm.

168
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,760
Okay.

169
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,920
Mr. Elyes,

170
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,000
could…

171
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,160
I have a dinner with Paeng?

172
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,000
You can.

173
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,360
You took a bath before
having dinner with a woman.

174
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
I was sweaty after going out with you.

175
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,800
Pat,

176
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,080
I'll help you prepare.

177
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,400
Done. Let's go.

178
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
To where?

179
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,760
Dinner.

180
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
But I appointed Paeng.

181
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,560
I know. I'll go with you. Come.

182
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Come on, I'm hungry.

183
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,600
Hurry up.

184
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,360
Pat, I...

185
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,840
Pat,

186
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,920
have you checked my tomorrow's schedule?

187
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,840
You're free all day.

188
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,000
What did you...

189
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Pat,

190
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,920
What about the deal with JC?
Have you received an email?

191
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,720
Oh, I've got it. I'll send it to you soon.

192
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,720
Pat.

193
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,800
Yes?

194
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,440
When will you leave?

195
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,360
It'll be a while. Let me...

196
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,440
- We'll go to Khao Kho tomorrow.
- Of course.

197
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Paeng, about...

198
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Bill, please.

199
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,560
You pay right away?

200
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,680
I haven't eaten yet.

201
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,680
What about you?

202
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,280
Maybe the food isn't
tasty. Your friend barely ate.

203
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,080
But you seemed to enjoy it.

204
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,040
So, won't you come back with me?

205
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,040
I'll be here with you.

206
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,120
No, you're the boss. You
can't neglect your work.

207
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,160
There must be a load of
documents at the office.

208
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,360
Please go.

209
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,560
You're mean.

210
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,240
Opportunist.

211
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,280
Don't let me take advantage of you.

212
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,760
Let's go to the room.

213
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,480
Do it right here. I can't wait.

214
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,800
You can't!

215
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,080
I didn't ask.

216
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,560
Just saying.

217
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,080
Mr. Elyes!

218
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,320
Don't.

219
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,040
Don't.

220
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,520
Mr. Elyes.

221
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,920
Mr. Elyes.

222
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,880
Come on.

223
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,520
Let me go.

224
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,720
Mr. Elyes. Stop.

225
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,800
People will see us.

226
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,520
No one is here.

227
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,040
(Elyes: Five missed calls)

228
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,680
(Elyes: Answer my call. That's an order.)

229
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
Order?

230
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,560
What is it now?

231
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
Here's a document you must sign.

232
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,680
What do you want to eat
this afternoon? I'll arrange it.

233
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,640
I'm not hungry.

234
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,720
But I am.

235
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,400
Want to join me for lunch?

236
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
That's all for now.

237
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,640
Please give us a moment.

238
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Didn't you order more?

239
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,080
No.

240
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Damn it!

241
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,920
Why doesn't he answer?

242
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,720
Didn't Pat quit?

243
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,840
No way. I won't let him quit.

244
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
He's my secretary.

245
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,840
Thiti works fine.

246
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,520
No one can replace Pat.

247
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,200
He works with me until he
knows everything about me.

248
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,440
I can't imagine my life without him.

249
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,960
Please excuse me. I'm not quite hungry.

250
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,720
(Thiti)

251
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
Hello. What is it?

252
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,120
Mr. Elyes postponed all of his work tomorrow
and ordered me to book a flight to see you.

253
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,960
I don't know what happened,
but could you talk to him?

254
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,680
All of the work is important.
The delay will jeopardize us.

255
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,320
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

256
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,840
Thank you.

257
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,080
Where are you?! What are you doing?! Are you
with someone?! Why didn't you answer my calls?!

258
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm calling you now.

259
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,200
I won't let you be alone again.

260
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,240
I miss you.

261
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,400
Don't worry, I'll leave tomorrow.

262
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,880
When? I'll pick you up.

263
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,040
It's okay. I can manage that.

264
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,320
I'll send someone to get you.

265
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,960
Mr. Elyes, I can take care of myself.

266
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,480
Okay.

267
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,840
I'm worried about you.

268
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,200
And miss you.

269
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,000
Yes.

270
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,920
Mr. Elyes.

271
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,160
Welcome back to work.

272
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,960
Thank you.

273
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,160
Could I ask you something?

274
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,280
Of course. Ask me anything.

275
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,200
Right. Thank you very much.

276
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,280
It's easier to work inside my office.

277
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,280
As a secretary, tasks come to me.
It's harder to work in your room.

278
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,640
Suit yourself.

279
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,000
Mr. Elyes.

280
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,080
Be your usual self.

281
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,760
What if others see you?

282
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,080
How is this unusual?

283
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,840
It's obvious.

284
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,840
I'm getting hungry.

285
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Will you eat here or
outside? I'll arrange it.

286
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,800
I ordered everything for you.

287
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,560
These are your favorites.

288
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,160
What's wrong?

289
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,320
I'm not used to this. I
always order food for you.

290
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,360
Have a bite.

291
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,520
You'll get used to it.

292
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Refreshing.

293
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,120
Aromatic too.

294
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,280
You're hedging.

295
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,120
You knew it.

296
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,920
Of course,

297
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,840
I know you well.

298
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
It's really refreshing.

299
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,400
I'll eat.

300
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,280
Go ahead.

301
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,000
May I answer this call?

302
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,520
Yes, Paeng?

303
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,240
Are you in Bangkok now? Let's meet.

304
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,440
Well, I…

305
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,920
He can't.

306
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,960
He's busy.

307
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,440
Many work to do.

308
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,000
Mr. Elyes.

309
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
That's it.

310
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,440
- It's work time now.
- Yes.

311
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,280
I'm hungry.

312
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,120
Go ahead and eat.

313
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,960
But I want to eat with you.

314
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,000
Paeng,

315
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,920
this is for you.

316
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,200
Am I cute enough for you to give me a doll?

317
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,920
People may see you're unapproachable,

318
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,720
but I think you also
have a soft spot for a doll.

319
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,120
How about you going out with me?

320
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,040
Shouldn't I be the one who says that?

321
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,000
Come on. It doesn't matter.

322
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
Then,

323
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,520
can you be my girlfriend?

324
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,400
The doll shall be a witness. No take backs.

325
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Of course, I won't.

326
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,640
I went out with her until we graduated.

327
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,280
How did you two break up?

328
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,200
Paeng had to study abroad, saying a
long distance relationship wouldn't work.

329
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,240
There was no conflict but the distance.

330
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,400
She may want to relive the moment.

331
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,640
What do you think?

332
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,680
I don't mind if a method is clean or dirty.

333
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,280
I must get JC's project.

334
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,280
Yes, Mr. Fei Long.
We'll find a way to win the bid.

335
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,320
- I must be the only victor!
- Yes.

336
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,120
What?

337
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
I want you to be
straightforward in business.

338
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,760
It's for your company's credibility.

339
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,400
Worried about me?

340
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,760
Or your ex?

341
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,200
Mark my words.

342
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,360
I must beat Elyes at everything

343
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,200
like when I did it

344
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,720
at all costs.

345
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,400
I'm sleepy. Going to sleep soon.

346
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,760
For a glass of water.

347
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,000
I miss you so much. Can I meet with you?

348
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,040
It's late now. Let's sleep

349
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,400
See you tomorrow.

350
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,960
I told him not to come.

351
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,280
Gimme a sec.

352
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,720
Comin'

353
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,680
Mr. Elyes.

354
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,800
Mr. Elyes?

355
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,440
What are you doing?

356
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,960
Mr. Elyes.

357
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,280
Please get up.

358
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,440
I know I'm Elyes.

359
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,400
Please get up now.

360
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,760
Please get up now.

361
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
You told me it's late.

362
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,960
I came here to sleep with you.

363
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
What's the fuss?

364
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,720
I… thought you'd sleep at your house.

365
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,320
You must join me.

366
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,360
You can choose…

367
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,280
to sleep here…

368
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,800
or at my house.

369
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,680
I'm sleepy now.

370
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,360
Go ahead and sleep. I'm still awake.

371
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,480
I want to do something first.

372
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,560
Mr. Elyes.

373
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,440
I'm really sleepy. Today was exhausting.

374
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,520
Okay.

375
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,680
Do whatever you want.

376
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,600
(Kim)

377
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,960
Hello, Kim?

378
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,840
I'm with another man.

379
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,680
May I sit close to you?

380
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,720
Be my guest.

381
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,520
Are you here alone or waiting for someone?

382
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,440
Alone.

383
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,920
Should we…

384
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,120
have fun somewhere else?

385
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,400
- A glass, please?
- Yes.

386
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,520
Kim?

387
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,320
Why didn't you call me first?

388
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,360
Good morning, Mr. Kim.

389
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,760
Is your secretary back?

390
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,680
Elyes was always hotheaded
when you were gone.

391
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,040
Yes. That was because
no one worked like Pat.

392
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,040
What's your business here?
I'm heading to the project site.

393
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,560
I'd like to invite you for dinner.

394
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,560
You can call me.

395
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,080
I want to see you.

396
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,400
Run?

397
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,360
I'll wait outside.

398
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,240
I'll go too.

399
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,400
I think Elyes wants to talk with Run.

400
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,480
Can I talk with you?

401
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,440
(Next Episode)
Leave me!

402
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,280
He seems to care for you.

403
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,120
He still keeps your photo.

404
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,640
My lover wants to beat Elyes.

405
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,640
If I call Elyes, it means
I backstab my lover.

406
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,600
I care for you, Run.

407
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Go back to your man.

408
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,800
Pat.

409
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,800
I miss you.

410
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,120
Yes, Mr. Elyes?

411
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,440
Why didn't you reply?

412
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,080
If you don't know, keep it that way.

413
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,240
What's wrong?

414
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,560
Mr. Elyes?

415
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,920
Oh, my. You still let him drag you.
