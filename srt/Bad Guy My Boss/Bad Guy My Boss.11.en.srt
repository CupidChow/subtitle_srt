"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 11)

2
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,920
(Previously)
What the hell?!

3
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
You failed an easy job!

4
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,440
Pat only has one broken arm!

5
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,840
For Elyes,

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,160
he's in one fricking piece!

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,080
Come.

8
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,040
Let me hold it.

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,240
Just walk. At least I don't make you sit in a wheelchair.

10
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,440
I want you to find the reason
why the scaffold collapsed.

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,040
It may be an accident...

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,560
My man is fatally wounded!

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,840
Here's the evidence that you contacting the offender.

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,840
Bastard!

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,080
- You can't get in!
- How dare you accuse me?!

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,880
After my legal department draft
the contract, I'll send it to you to check.

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,480
With pleasure.

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,520
Mr. JC, may I have a word?

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
I'll take my leave.

20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,480
See you.

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,560
If I'm not wrong,

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,760
You wonder why I don't choose your company.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,960
I proposed a budget equal to his.
Why don't you choose me?

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,000
How do you know it was equal?

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,880
I have my reason. Hope you understand.

26
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,120
Do what I told you to do.

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Your boss is too hot-headed.
This is Mr. JC's company.

28
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,560
How dare you?

29
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,840
Did you take care of Elyes?

30
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,320
I'll transfer the money to you.

31
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,360
You're quick about that, Mr. Fei Long.

32
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,760
Elyes!

33
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,640
We know each other well.
It's not the first time you play dirty.

34
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,640
Do you think I'm stupid enough to not be wary of you?

35
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Boss!

36
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,320
Hold them!

37
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Let go of me!

38
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,320
To thank you…

39
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,640
for teaching Teeranai a lesson, I won't hurt your men.

40
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,320
Get someone to take them away.

41
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,960
God damn you!

42
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,960
Run.

43
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,520
Run!

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
Don't walk away from me.

45
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,680
Why?

46
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,200
Just kill me like what you tried to do to Elyes!

47
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,600
You know? So what?

48
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,160
- Mad at me or worried about Elyes?!
- What if I'm worried about Elyes?

49
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,040
How dare you? Your brother will...

50
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,480
My brother will be in trouble!

51
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,440
Is that what you want to say?

52
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,480
How many times do you use
my brother to threaten me?

53
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,360
You know what? What you do makes
you too worthless to compare with Elyes!

54
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
You can't compete with him at all!

55
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,880
It's not wrong to be happy after humiliating
Fei Long, but you must be more careful.

56
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,600
It won't end easily.

57
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,240
Don't you think I'm happy about getting Mr. JC's deal?

58
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,320
I do.

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,480
But it seems you're more
satisfied with harassing Fei Long.

60
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,960
You know me.

61
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,320
We've come this far.

62
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,320
Your arm's still hurt. Find a seat.

63
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
I'll grill them for you.

64
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm fine already!

65
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
Even worked for you.

66
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,400
I want to grill them for you. Problem?

67
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
Not at all.

68
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
Rawr!

69
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,480
Just have a seat already.

70
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
Okay.

71
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,240
Welcome!

72
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,880
Elyes' Restaurant gladly serves you.

73
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,760
Can…

74
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,960
I have another stick of barbecue?

75
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,800
With pleasure, dear customer.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,280
Is there only you in this restaurant?

77
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,720
I could give you all-around services.

78
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,120
What's behind this?

79
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
I want to celebrate the big project with you.

80
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
No single waiter.

81
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,920
Just only us.

82
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,760
I'm serious about Fei Long.
You may not be lucky like today.

83
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,160
Don't worry. I've planned everything.

84
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,600
Fei Long is hot-tempered, but not a fool.

85
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
He made a mistake.

86
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
He won't do anything too soon.

87
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,840
But there's a chance he'll do something.

88
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,240
He hasn't defeated you.

89
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,760
He defeated me many times,

90
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,440
including stealing Run from me.

91
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,840
He doesn't think he wins

92
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,360
as long as Run still loves you.

93
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,840
How many times do you use
my brother to threaten me?

94
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,840
You know what? What you do makes
you too worthless to compare with Elyes!

95
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,320
You can't compete with him at all!

96
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,160
Your cocktail.

97
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,280
I didn't order it.

98
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
What happens?

99
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
I… didn't order this cocktail.

100
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,600
It's for table 12. My mistake.

101
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,600
Table 12 canceled the order.
Why didn't you check carefully?

102
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,640
You must pay for this glass!

103
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm sorry.

104
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,840
It's okay.

105
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
I'll pay for this.

106
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,760
Are you sure?

107
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,080
Thank you, sir.

108
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
Thanks.

109
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,120
You're welcome. We do whatever you order.
Even better to get money from it.

110
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
How are you?

111
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,440
Wake up?

112
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,480
Why do you kidnap me?

113
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,440
Fei Long makes me broke.

114
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,520
I want my money back and take
revenge for what he has done.

115
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,760
Poor you.

116
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,840
- Are you hurt?
- Let me go.

117
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
Let go, damn it!

118
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,480
Why are you with Fei Long?

119
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,720
What a pity.

120
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,320
Let me go!

121
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,080
I said,

122
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,760
let me go!

123
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
Let me go!

124
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,320
Shut up!

125
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,520
Let go!

126
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,000
Let me go!

127
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,120
Enough!

128
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,840
Or Mr. Elyes scolds us.

129
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,880
Went out all night? You're bold.

130
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,800
Enough!

131
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,480
Or Mr. Elyes scolds us.

132
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,040
Elyes!

133
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,960
Elyes!

134
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,680
Excuse me! You can't get in!

135
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,960
Let's go!

136
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
You can't get it!

137
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,120
Elyes!

138
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,640
Please no!

139
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,760
Should I fire everyone?

140
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,960
You can't stop a man from barge into my office.

141
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,400
Please forgive us, Mr. Elyes.

142
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,280
Do whatever you work on.

143
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,320
I'll deal with him.

144
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,320
Yes.

145
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,920
Damn you, Elyes!

146
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,560
Failed to backbite

147
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,080
and become a rabid dog?

148
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,800
You attack me directly?

149
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,080
I've prepared everything
since you walked into my company.

150
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,880
Come at me!

151
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,640
What should we do?

152
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,520
What?

153
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
- What happens, Ms. Aeom?
- Pat.

154
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Lodge Industry's CEO comes to see Mr. Elyes!

155
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,640
Mr. Fei Long?!

156
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,720
Yes. And he's furious. We can't stop him.

157
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,440
Call the security now.

158
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,360
Yes!

159
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,720
Mr. Elyes!

160
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,240
I'm gonna kill you, Elyes!

161
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,480
Where's Run?!

162
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,320
Where did you take him?!

163
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Run?

164
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,560
Mr. Run?

165
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,200
Ms. Aeom. Please continue your work.
I'll take care of everything here.

166
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,280
Tell all staff to work normally. We're fine here.

167
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,560
Yes.

168
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,440
Enough!

169
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,240
Or Mr. Elyes scolds us.

170
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
What's your excuse?

171
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,000
I didn't do this.

172
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
Didn't you know someone incite you?

173
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,360
You were mad because I sent people to beat you.

174
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,960
So, you hurt Run!

175
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
I never think of hurting him.

176
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
I would've hurt him…

177
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,680
since the day he left me to you.

178
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,720
It's easy to know who's behind this.

179
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,840
That's the answer.

180
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sure the caller is the one who kidnaps Mr. Run.

181
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,320
Stall the person.

182
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,480
I know you're worried about Mr. Run,
but they'd be satisfied if you fell for it.

183
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,440
And he'll be in danger.

184
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,600
Hello?

185
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,960
What took you so long?

186
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
Aren't you afraid we'll beat your lover?

187
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,560
What do you want?

188
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,480
The damages for your betrayal

189
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,600
for…

190
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,400
your lover's life.

191
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,720
How much?

192
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,200
Woah!

193
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,000
That's more like it.

194
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,560
It seems Run isn't your regular partner.

195
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,440
How much?!

196
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,040
Come on, be polite. We're acquainted.

197
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,960
How much?

198
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,200
200 million.

199
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,400
200 million?

200
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,160
It takes time to withdraw the cash.

201
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,560
You know banks' regulations.

202
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,520
I don't care about that.

203
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
Play by my rule.

204
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
I'll give you the time until tomorrow.

205
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
You'll get the address.

206
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,360
But you should hurry…

207
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,760
before I'm too drunk and see your lover as a sandbag.

208
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
You're awesome.

209
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,240
He'll save you.

210
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,280
It's a win-win situation.

211
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,240
It's Teeranai.

212
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,160
If Run's hurt,

213
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,200
I'll chop him into pieces.

214
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,040
Now, we must find a way to rescue him.

215
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,320
Leave the rest for later.

216
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Do you have a plan?

217
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,080
Yes.

218
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,760
We'll rescue Mr. Run now before they notice us.

219
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,720
But we don't know where he is.

220
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,200
I must ask you something.

221
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,560
Why did Teeranai send
Mr. Run's phone to threaten you?

222
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,960
It can be other personal belongings.

223
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,640
I downloaded a tracking app on his phone.

224
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,000
I know everywhere he goes.

225
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,360
Paranoid.

226
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:53,440
It means Teeranai checked the phone thoroughly
and sent it back to you, so he won't be tracked.

227
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,200
It's possible that… he checked other
things that can be traced back to him.

228
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,280
Wouldn't he delete everything you said?

229
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,640
I know a hacker

230
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,720
who can recover the data

231
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,680
in a very short time.

232
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,160
Don't hesitate.

233
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,480
Mr. Run's life is the most important thing.

234
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,760
Sit!

235
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,560
You think you're tough?!
I'll call the police to drag you all away!

236
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,920
We checked Mr. Run's phone.
This is the last place he checked in.

237
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,000
Confess what happened here last night.

238
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,600
No…

239
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
I don't know anything.

240
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
Cameras are in every corner.

241
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
It's easy to see the record.

242
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,160
It's whether we watch it

243
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,920
or you confess.

244
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,480
The outcomes will be different.

245
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,520
I… really don't know.

246
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,520
Mr. Teeranai ordered me to do it. I'm sorry.

247
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
Where's Run?

248
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,720
Say it!

249
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,480
Pat.

250
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,880
Yes?

251
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,160
Go back alone.

252
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
What's this about?

253
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,240
I must rescue Run.

254
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,000
It's not what you think.

255
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,960
I don't want you to die by Fei Long's hands.

256
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,520
I'll go with you.

257
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,880
I'll…

258
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,240
drive the car.

259
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,360
Let's go.

260
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,440
He looks pathetic.

261
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,680
Wish Fei Long sees him now.

262
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,200
Must be a sight to see.

263
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,120
Tomorrow,

264
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,120
do what we plan.

265
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,800
When we get the money,

266
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,680
kill Run

267
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,720
and go on separate ways.

268
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,880
Must we kill him?

269
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,400
Chicken out?

270
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,400
No,

271
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,120
I think… getting money would be enough.

272
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Reasonable.

273
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,240
Idiot!

274
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,000
Fei Long is a mafia! He's influential!

275
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,920
To get money and run away
only gives him time to hunt us down.

276
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,680
Killing his lover makes him go wild.

277
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,720
Enough time to flee.

278
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,120
And I'll finally exact my revenge on him.

279
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,320
Hey!

280
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Oh, your lover comes.

281
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,640
Teeranai Land welcomes you!

282
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,480
You all, go greet him.

283
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,240
You,

284
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,680
get him a welcome drink.

285
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,600
Yes.

286
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,760
No one's here.

287
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,600
Watch out. We don't know when they come.

288
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,320
Hey!

289
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,480
What?

290
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Where's my money?

291
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,000
Fei Long.

292
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,920
Run, are you alright?

293
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,240
I knew you would come.

294
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,640
Thank you, Fei Long.

295
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,640
‘Sup Teeranai!

296
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,080
I knew you run away.

297
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
Don't be afraid. We're here to help you.

298
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,720
I hate you,

299
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
but don't want you to die.

300
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,880
Run before Fei Long's here.

301
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,280
You know he'll kill you if he finds you.

302
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,400
- Pat.
- Yes?

303
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,320
Tell Fei Long that Teeranai's here.

304
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,280
Right away.

305
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Wait.

306
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Don't do it.

307
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,760
I knew Elyes would help you.

308
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,480
What a pity. I'm one step ahead of you.

309
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Mr. Fei Long,

310
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,480
please calm down.

311
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,400
Let's be civilized here.

312
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,720
We can make a deal.

313
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,000
You're here early.

314
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
What a surprise.

315
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,960
I ordered my men to bring Run to this hospital.

316
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
And here you are today.

317
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,440
Run's my friend. That's why I'm here.

318
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,840
I'll prove it.

319
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,680
Prove what?

320
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,720
Follow me.

321
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,120
I know why Elyes is clingy to you like a child.

322
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,480
It's just his habit. If you're in
my place, he doesn't need me.

323
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,400
It's not true at all.

324
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,440
I know everything about Elyes.

325
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,960
He's clingy to you not because you tend him well.

326
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,480
But because you're what you are.

327
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,440
When you settle your issue with Mr. Fei Long,
I think you can do it better than me.

328
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,360
Why do you laugh?

329
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,000
You're jealous.

330
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,600
No, no!

331
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,720
I'm not!

332
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,120
You revealed it.

333
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,200
I can tell you I don't have feelings for Elyes anymore.

334
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,160
I consider him my friend.

335
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,760
And I feel guilty for what I did to him.

336
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,520
But…

337
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,840
Elyes also doesn't have feelings for me.

338
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,240
I looked into his eyes and knew it.

339
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,760
But you two loved each other.

340
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,080
Can feelings…

341
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,960
change so much over time?

342
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,720
It was soothing to be with Elyes,

343
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,680
but… it wasn't love.

344
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,720
I didn't love Elyes in the first place.

345
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
And…

346
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,640
who do you love?

347
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
I love…

348
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,800
Fei Long.

349
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,440
From what I know,

350
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
Fei Long forced you.

351
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,000
I have a brother.

352
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,880
He's my only relative.

353
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,800
He took care of me after my parents died.

354
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,560
He's in prison for fraud.

355
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,520
That time,

356
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,920
Fei Long wanted to beat Elyes.

357
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,360
He proposed me…

358
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,880
to be with him

359
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,360
in exchange for my brother's well-being.

360
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,920
In that case, you shouldn't love him.

361
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,240
Fei Long and I…

362
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,240
used to be lovers once…

363
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,680
before I even met Elyes.

364
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,360
But…

365
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,040
there was something that separated us.

366
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,880
And you…

367
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,240
met Mr. Elyes.

368
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,760
Yes.

369
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,000
I tried to start anew,

370
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,680
but I couldn't.

371
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,040
Deep inside, I couldn't forget Fei Long.

372
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,440
I felt even more guilty for Elyes.

373
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,360
This is for you.

374
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,840
Did you know that eavesdropping is a privacy violation?

375
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,640
I know, but I have a question.

376
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,200
Shoot.

377
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,120
Between your rights and my safety,

378
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,240
what would you choose?

379
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,480
You knew the answer.

380
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,440
Then stop sulking.

381
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,800
What I did make Fei Long
realize how much Run loves him

382
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,400
and stop being wary of me.

383
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,960
Also,

384
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,920
you don't have to worry
about me getting sneak attacks.

385
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:12,280
But how do you know Mr. Run loves Mr. Fei Long?
If it was the opposite, you would be dead!

386
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,880
Like what Run said,

387
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,760
I knew it by looking into his eyes.

388
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,600
Like what I see in yours.

389
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,000
And I stop the jealous man wary about me.

390
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,720
Killed two birds with a single bullet.

391
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,320
Am I right?

392
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,520
(Next Episode)
Have you ever loved someone?

393
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,720
I don't...

394
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,200
It was fine if you didn't.

395
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
But now,

396
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,760
you must love only me.

397
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,000
I love you, Elyes.

398
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,760
People with uncertain relationships aren't happy.

399
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,320
Trust me.
