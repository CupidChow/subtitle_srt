"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 5)

2
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
(Previously)
Do you need anything else?

3
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,120
Or...

4
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,320
I want to be alone!

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,400
I had that dream again.

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,160
And then, Run became Pat.

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,920
You're mean.

8
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,120
What am I to you?

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,160
Good afternoon, Mr. Elyes.

10
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
I'm Thiti.

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,560
This is my assistant.

12
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,560
But if that new guy is lousy…

13
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,000
you can punish me any way you wish.

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,840
Are you okay? Your
voice doesn't sound good.

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm fine.

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,680
(Mr. Vet (HR))

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,600
Give me the car key.

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,600
I'll drive myself.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,520
I can't. You drank alcohol.
Mr. Pat will tell me off if I let you.

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,560
Call Pat to drive for me!

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,520
Did I upset you, Mr. Elyes?

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,200
I don't like it when you're being Pat.

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,160
Know this,

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,800
no one can replace Pat.

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,160
I can't contact Mr. Pat.

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Turn off your phone from me?!

27
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
Hello?

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Pat!

29
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Yeah?

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,920
Why did you turn your phone off? I had
to ask a receptionist to call your room!

31
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,920
I don't want to be disturbed.

32
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,000
What's up?

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,280
I'll show you around. We're at the beach.

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,440
Take a bath and get changed. I'll wait.

35
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,760
Can you hear me?!

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,760
Sorry.

37
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,200
Can you hear me?

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,720
Okay!

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,840
Over there!

40
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Yeah, it's over there.

41
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Hey!

42
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,520
There it goes!

43
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Thanks, man. You hung
out with me the whole day.

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
Don't mention it.

45
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm happy to see you smile and don't cry
like when I picked you up at the airport.

46
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,920
Yeah, keep talking.

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,600
Oh,

48
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,280
I must go to finish my work.

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,680
Don't forget to turn your
phone on. You can call me 24/7.

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,040
It's okay. I won't disturb your work.

51
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,680
Also, I won't let someone track my phone.

52
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,400
I believe your boss can
even if your phone's off.

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
Watch what you're saying!

54
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Isn't my hunch about my boss bad enough?

55
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,360
Maybe your hunch is right.

56
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,560
Wait.

57
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,200
I can totally feel that
your luck energy is low.

58
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I see a handsome 190 cm tall man!

59
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,520
Oh, yeah? You'd better leave
before my energy kicks you.

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,960
Take it easy!

61
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
- Okay, I'm going.
- Yep.

62
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,040
- Can you be alone?
- Yep.

63
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,080
See you.

64
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm going.

65
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,080
Just go.

66
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,000
I mean it!

67
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,960
Go already!

68
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,680
- Bye.
- See yah.

69
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,160
A handsome 190 cm tall man!

70
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,320
He'll come!

71
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,200
I never appoint those people from now on.

72
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,000
Except for Kim.

73
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,360
Nice beach.

74
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Mr. Elyes?

75
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,640
Hi, Pat.

76
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,400
Where will you go?

77
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,560
Let's settle our issue.

78
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Why are you here?

79
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,280
To get my secretary back.

80
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,480
Working with me for many
years and suddenly disappearing?

81
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,280
Where's your responsibility?

82
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,440
Don't say it like that. You
know I'm hardworking.

83
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,840
Why can't I?

84
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,320
Why do you neglect your work and come here?

85
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
I didn't.

86
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,280
I submitted a resignation letter.

87
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,800
I haven't approved it, so
you're absent from work.

88
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,240
But enough about work.

89
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,680
You know how much I'm worried about you?

90
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,360
How do you know I'm here?

91
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,760
Am I your butler? Why
must I clean dishes for you?

92
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,840
Just a small chore, dude.

93
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,120
Small chore, my ass!

94
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Mr. Elyes?!

95
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
Mr. Elyes?!

96
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,680
- Talk with him!
- No, you do it! Answer him!

97
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,360
Fine.

98
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,320
Answer him.

99
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,120
Just answer him already.

100
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,400
- I'm doing it.
- Do it.

101
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,920
- Gonna do it.
- Do it.

102
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,000
Welcome to call-back service.

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,160
For English, please press ten.

104
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,200
You can't be serious! He
called you via Instagram!

105
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,240
Is Pat there?

106
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,880
He turns off his phone. I can't call him.

107
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,520
I'm worried sick about him.

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,280
Mr. Elyes,

109
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
may I ask you a frank question?

110
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,920
If you're worried sick,

111
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,920
what is my friend to you?
A subordinate or something else?

112
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,800
Well, I…

113
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
You're intelligent.

114
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,440
You know what Pat thinks of you.

115
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,480
If you're not serious with him,

116
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,960
I won't tell you where Pat is

117
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,560
because I can't see my friend sad anymore.

118
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,760
I can only say I'm happy to be with him

119
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,360
and never feel like this with anyone else.

120
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,120
Is the answer… okay for you?

121
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,000
The answer is good enough.

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,840
I'll ask Chonnatee to send a location.

123
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,280
Oh, and please don't tell
Pat you know it from us.

124
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,080
He'll scorn us to death.

125
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
Thank you.

126
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,600
Easy enough. You know I have connections.

127
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,240
And why are you here?

128
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,360
I have an appointment with Mr. JC here.

129
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,880
Oh…

130
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,040
It's about work.

131
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,760
I wish you success.

132
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,680
What the heck was that?!

133
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,800
Do you think…

134
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,400
Mr. Elyes can make up with our friend?

135
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,280
Depends on his technique.
Pat is a softy, you know that.

136
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,600
Be nice to him and he gets over it.

137
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,320
If Mr. Elyes is still being mean,

138
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
Pat can be more upset.

139
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,120
How about this?

140
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,560
I bet Pat gets over it.

141
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,840
No, no, no. Gambling is bad, bro.

142
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,240
Sorry for that...

143
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,520
Wait! Hold on a sec.

144
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm not that decent.

145
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
The smell of 1,000 baht…

146
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,080
is sweet.

147
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,880
I'll bet Pat's upset!

148
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,360
Alrighty.

149
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,080
Mr. Pat.

150
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,160
Your room has water leakage.

151
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,360
Oh, really?

152
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,480
We apologize and will
arrange your new room soon.

153
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,880
- Should I pack my things?
- A bellboy and a housekeeper have done that.

154
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,720
Please have a seat and wait here.

155
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,920
I'll tell you when it's ready.

156
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,240
Yes.

157
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,440
Hey there, dude. Miss a dear handsome me?

158
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,560
Is that Pat?!

159
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,600
How's your life, man?

160
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,520
You know what? After Chonnatee dropped
me off, I met Mr. Elyes at the beach.

161
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,520
When I arrived at the hotel,
staff told me my room's water leaked.

162
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,360
What a wonderful day!

163
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,480
Is Mr. Elyes' here to make up with you?

164
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,400
Not at all. He went to work.

165
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,680
Maybe he needs me to go with him.

166
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,600
Can't work alone, I guess.

167
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,720
Work must be his excuse.

168
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,600
Think so?

169
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,160
Mr. Pat.

170
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm off now. My new room's ready.

171
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,160
A keycard for your new room.

172
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you.

173
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Here.

174
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, no!

175
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
Worried about Pat?

176
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,440
My money!

177
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,320
What the hell?!

178
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
Chill, man. Just 2,000 baht.

179
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,000
Damn it.

180
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,720
Mr. Pat.

181
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,480
What does the man from the giant
corporation need from a puny man like me?

182
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I thought you'd ask who I am.

183
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,800
Though I never met you,

184
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,560
but I know you, Mr. Fei Long.

185
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,000
In a real estate business,
everyone knows you.

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,840
Let's cut to the chase.

187
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,640
You quit your job.

188
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,800
I want you to work for me.

189
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,520
Is a 200,000-baht salary good enough?

190
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,600
You know that I submitted
a resignation letter?

191
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,760
That's why I came to see you.

192
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,440
There's a spy in Mr. Elyes' company.

193
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,920
Just an information share…

194
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,360
from a random person.

195
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
I appreciate your invitation…

196
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,680
I hope there's no “but” at the end.

197
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,520
I do have it.

198
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,560
Why?

199
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,080
You've already quit.

200
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,560
I'm not ready.

201
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm merely Mr. Elyes' secretary.

202
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,240
Your salary doesn't suit
my limited capabilities.

203
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,600
I will assess if you're
capable or not, not you.

204
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,080
Contact me when you're ready.

205
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,080
I'll wait.

206
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,880
Succeed?

207
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,280
No.

208
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,920
Even though you invited him yourself?

209
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He's arrogant.

210
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,440
No,

211
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,160
this man isn't arrogant.

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,120
More like worried about Elyes.

213
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,200
Worried?

214
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,920
Then why did he quit?

215
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,680
A squabble, perhaps?

216
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Though he doesn't want to work for him,

217
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
he hesitates to work for a rival company.

218
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't care about the reason.

219
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,520
That man has worked
for Elyes for a long time.

220
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
He is something.

221
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,800
Won't they be on bad terms?

222
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
So what?

223
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,080
This isn't their first time.

224
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,040
You came to the right room.

225
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,280
Mr. Elyes?!

226
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,480
What's the meaning of this?

227
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,840
I upgraded your room to the
hotel's best presidential suite.

228
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,160
What? Don't like it?

229
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
I'll complain to the manager!

230
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,880
Why?

231
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,320
The room's good,

232
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,160
but I don't like people who
solve problems with money.

233
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
Hey, what are you doing, Mr. Elyes?!

234
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Let me go!

235
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,360
Mr. Elyes!

236
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,680
Mr. Elyes!

237
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,920
Mr. Elyes!

238
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,440
Let me go now, Mr. Elyes!

239
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
What are you doing?!

240
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,680
Mr. Elyes!

241
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,920
I won't kiss you if you're not willing.

242
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,840
You'll get all the staff in trouble

243
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,160
if you make a complaint.

244
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,040
Where do you sleep…?

245
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,520
Don't worry,

246
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,440
I don't sleep here.

247
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,160
What?

248
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,440
Disappointed?

249
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,880
Want me to sleep with you?

250
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,720
Not at all!

251
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,960
I… just wonder where you'll sleep.

252
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,200
I booked another room next to yours.

253
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,880
As I said,

254
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,440
It's not just kissing. I mean everything.

255
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,280
I can do it only when you're willing.

256
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,320
I mean it.

257
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,440
Understand?

258
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,480
Run!

259
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,200
I'll let you decide again.

260
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,840
How can you have his name card?!

261
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,280
Mr. Fei Long invited me to work for him.

262
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,120
What did you answer him?!

263
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Don't worry,

264
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,480
I'm not ready to work for anyone...

265
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
Even if you are, I won't
let you work with him!

266
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,720
- Why?!
- I order you!

267
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,520
But I quit.

268
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,320
I won't let you!

269
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,160
Even how stubborn you are,

270
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,040
I'll never let you work for him!

271
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,760
I lost someone to him.

272
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,520
I won't lose you.

273
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,640
I don't know about your
conflict with Mr. Fei Long,

274
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,600
but I can promise you I'll
never work for him. Okay?

275
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,120
- Sure?!
- Don't you know me at all?!

276
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,000
Sorry.

277
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
I'll take you for dinner.

278
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,160
I'm not free tonight.
I'll go with my friends.

279
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,320
One hour. At the lobby.

280
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,360
You.

281
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,200
Hey!

282
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,000
Self-centered jerk.

283
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,560
It's Pat.

284
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,120
You'll have dinner with
Mr. Elyes instead of us?

285
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,360
Woah!

286
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,240
Are youpsychic? How do you know?

287
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,760
Vexter just guessed!

288
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,360
You told us you met Mr. Elyes.

289
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,160
He must be here to make up with you.

290
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,640
Even upgraded your room

291
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,120
and having dinner with you.

292
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
You know everything.

293
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,840
To answer what Vexter
asks, stop smiling now.

294
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,480
What?

295
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,960
Who's smiling?

296
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Not me!

297
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,880
About our dinner,
want me to sneak out and join you?

298
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,200
Stop. Don't use us as your excuse.

299
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,600
You're willing to go with Mr. Elyes, right?

300
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,280
Not at all! I… was forced!

301
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,840
You're as stubborn as Mr. Elyes.

302
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
Are…

303
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,800
Mr. Elyes' lips soft?!

304
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,880
Yep, they're tenderly soft.

305
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,720
Hey,

306
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,440
cut it out. I'm off.

307
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,440
Heard him? He said soft lips.

308
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,360
I did.

309
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,360
Damn…

310
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
- Mr. Elyes.
- Mr. Pat.

311
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,040
You're making me blush!

312
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
You don't have to serve me.

313
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,560
Sit, or others will see.

314
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Why is no one here?

315
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,840
Don't tell me…

316
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,360
you reserved the whole place?

317
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,600
I ordered food for you.

318
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,720
It's not just you who knows
me well, I also know you well.

319
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
Turned my phone off.

320
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,840
Let's eat.

321
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,760
Here. This is good.

322
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,760
Yes.

323
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,800
Try the chicken.

324
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,920
It's the place's top dish.

325
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,120
Thank you.

326
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,800
Sip the soup.

327
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,920
It's good.

328
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Like the food?

329
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,880
I'm glad you like it.

330
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,160
I haven't said a word.

331
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Your face says so.

332
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,120
You aren't… quitting anymore?

333
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,360
Let's not discuss work here.

334
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,080
Yes,

335
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,840
Mr. Pat.

336
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,960
Hey, Pat.

337
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,200
Do you see the light there?

338
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,240
Yes.

339
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,160
Why?

340
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
A squid-fishing boat.

341
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,200
Want to join them?

342
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Right now?

343
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,920
You have important work tomorrow.

344
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,760
So what?

345
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,080
It'll affect our company's
reputation if you're late.

346
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,160
You said we don't discuss work here.

347
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,320
Let's go.

348
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,120
Fish some squids.

349
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,680
Don't you want to?

350
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,080
Tomorrow's work is very important.

351
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,120
It'll be a disgrace if you're late.

352
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,480
Worried about me?

353
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,120
Okay,

354
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,640
we won't go. Back to our rooms.

355
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,400
Pat.

356
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,200
Are you hurt?

357
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,120
It's okay. I hit a table corner.

358
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
Thank you.

359
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,280
For what?

360
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
For being worried about me.

361
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,960
“Thank you” is for when
people treat you well.

362
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,640
Being worried about you…

363
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,440
is what I do every day.

364
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,360
Let's go to our rooms.

365
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,600
Yes.

366
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,680
Are you sleepy?

367
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,040
Exhausted and need a shower.

368
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,000
Me too.

369
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,120
Good night.

370
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,640
Good night.

371
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,720
Wait.

372
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,960
Can I take a bath?

373
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,520
Yes.

374
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll do it with you too.

375
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,200
Good morning.

376
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
You bought so many. Like it?

377
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,080
I bought them for you. Like it?

378
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,240
I like both tea and the man.

379
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,280
You work during your day off.

380
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,920
I must double your overtime pay.

381
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,680
May I join you in the
meeting, in case I can help?

382
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,480
I can go alone.

383
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
You're having a day off.

384
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,160
Please have breakfast. You'll be late.

385
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,480
I've changed my mind.

386
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,200
I'd rather hug you all day.

387
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,400
You can't. This project
is important to you.

388
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,360
I'm joking. Know what?

389
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,200
You're cute when you're…

390
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,840
worried about me.

391
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Let's eat.

392
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,040
Maybe not?

393
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,880
I'll have breakfast.

394
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,240
Come.

395
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,160
Okay.

396
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,920
Eat.

397
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,520
Yes.

398
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,160
Run?

399
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Elyes?

400
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,240
Oh, Mr. Elyes.

401
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,800
Long time no see. How are you?

402
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,920
Don't you want to know how's…

403
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,520
your ex-lover doing?

404
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
Fei Long.

405
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Hope you'll play fair.

406
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,640
Does it mean you're afraid…

407
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,560
to lose?

408
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,520
Losing in business is totally normal

409
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,760
except when someone
cheats at the beginning.

410
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,920
Always talking about work.

411
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,400
Don't you want to know about Run and me?

412
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,560
I don't meddle with your affairs.

413
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,120
But I want to tell you.

414
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,720
Since Run broke up with you and chose me,

415
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,240
I'm always happy.

416
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,600
Run is good

417
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,440
at everything,

418
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,200
especially…

419
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,360
sex.

420
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,520
Fei Long!

421
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,920
Welcome,

422
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,920
Mr. Elyes and Mr. Fei Long.

423
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,520
I didn't expect the heads of Burton Group
and Lodge Industry to be here themselves.

424
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,400
Thank you for your interest in my project.

425
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,160
This way, please.

426
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,240
I'll eat Kao Lao.

427
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,000
Really?

428
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,720
The seafood one.

429
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,440
Here.

430
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,720
I want this!

431
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,080
- Aren't they the same?
- I saw it first.

432
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,080
You should've taken us to have a buffet
at the hotel instead of eating street food.

433
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,120
Didn't Mr. Elyes pay for everything?

434
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,360
Always complaining.

435
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,760
Do you know “consideration?”

436
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,320
You're bold. Protect
Mr. Elyes' interests, huh?

437
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,040
Mr. Employee of the Year.

438
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,840
Hey,

439
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,640
how was last night?

440
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,600
Enjoyed?

441
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,880
What?! There was nothing!

442
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Just… had dinner together
before going back to our rooms.

443
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,760
And he has a meeting this morning.

444
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,720
Yes.

445
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
Swear on it.

446
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,560
That's nuts!

447
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,800
Why must I?! It's nonsense!

448
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,640
Your high-pitched voice answers everything.

449
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,080
Gimme 1,000.

450
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,760
- Gimme.
- Take it.

451
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,920
That's more like it.

452
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,120
Woah, woah, woah.

453
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,520
What the heck are you two doing?

454
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,320
It was nothing.

455
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,680
Oh, really? Your pitch was high.

456
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,840
Tell the whole story. Make me
forget about that 1,000 baht.

457
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,280
By the way,

458
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,360
- What?
- this month is almost over.

459
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,880
Your 1,000 is mine.

460
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,360
Hey!

461
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,800
I'll look forward to getting
good deals from both of you.

462
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,920
I guarantee Burton
Group won't let you down.

463
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,760
Lodge Industry looks
forward to working with you.

464
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,840
I'll see you soon.

465
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,640
Still miss him?

466
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,160
No, I don't.

467
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,840
I can see it on your face.

468
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,200
Come here.

469
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,000
Hey, we're at the customer's company.

470
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,720
You love excitement, right?

471
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,600
Don't get up.

472
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,400
Your fever just went down.

473
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,520
Thank you.

474
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,400
Hold it right there.

475
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,120
I'll get sick and admitted here too.

476
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,560
Don't you sympathize with a sick man?

477
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,680
Don't be a crybaby.

478
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,160
I'll bring you food.

479
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,400
Wait here.

480
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,120
(Next Episode)
Mr. Elyes!

481
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,840
I'm glad you're worried about me.

482
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,000
Pat.

483
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,040
I'm Paeng, Pat's ex-

484
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,480
She's my friend!

485
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,760
You seem to be wary about this.

486
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,360
Stop harassing me!

487
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,840
No one can replace Pat.

488
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,320
I can't imagine my life without him.

489
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,360
Didn't Pat quit?

490
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,720
I don't mind if a method is clean or dirty.

491
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,720
I want you to be
straightforward in business.

492
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,320
I must beat Elyes at all costs.

493
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,120
I can't lose to him again.

494
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,400
Again?
