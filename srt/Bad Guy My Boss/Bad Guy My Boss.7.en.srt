"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 7)

2
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,320
(Previously)
I'm Paeng, Pat's ex...

3
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,480
She's my friend!

4
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,640
You want to win the bid because
you don't want to lose repeatedly.

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
You understand everything, right?

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,440
Hope you don't quit.

7
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,240
I promised you I won't
work for Mr. Fei Long

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,840
but not about my resignation.

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Come on, go with me.

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Thiti works fine.

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
No one can replace Pat.

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,200
I want you to be
straightforward in business.

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
It's for your company's credibility.

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
Worried about me?

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,640
Or your ex?

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,240
You can choose to…

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,720
sleep here or at my house.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,080
(Last night)

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,440
May I sit close to you?

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,720
Be my guest.

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,480
Are you here alone or waiting for someone?

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,440
Alone.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,360
Should we…

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,160
have fun somewhere else?

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,960
No, thank you. I want to be alone.

26
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,280
Okay.

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,000
- A glass, please?
- Yes.

28
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,040
Keep your hand off this.

29
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,880
Ex-lover?

30
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Yep.

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Hello.

32
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
Where's Fei Long?

33
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,040
Thanks.

34
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,120
Hello, Kim.

35
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,560
I must tell you something.
Can you come to see me?

36
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,880
I'm not free.

37
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
This is urgent. It's about...

38
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm with another man.

39
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,520
Hey,

40
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,640
another shot.

41
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,920
Upset by someone? You drink a lot.

42
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,800
That's my business.

43
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,320
Where are you going? I'll help.

44
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,280
Leave me!

45
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,880
What if I call someone who can help?

46
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
It's Elyes.

47
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,800
How do you know him?

48
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,120
The two of us are very close.

49
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,400
I think you understand the
meaning of my “very close.”

50
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,560
My lover wants to beat Elyes.

51
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,280
If I call Elyes, it means
I've backstabbed my lover.

52
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,480
But Elyes is your ex-lover.

53
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,520
He seems to care for you.
He still keeps your photo.

54
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,840
It'll be trouble if I go.

55
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,200
Hey.

56
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,080
I care for you, Run.

57
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,640
But I can't go to see you anymore.

58
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Enough.

59
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,120
You should call your man.

60
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes, Mr. Elyes?

61
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
Why didn't you reply?

62
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,800
The blue one.

63
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,400
Answer me.

64
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,160
The leather strap one on the right.

65
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,080
Can't drink now.

66
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,680
A leather strap watch and a blue tie.

67
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,240
Okay.

68
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,680
I don't want to drive.

69
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,880
Let Thiti drive for you.

70
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,360
He doesn't work as good as you.

71
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,680
It frustrates me.

72
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,760
Come to see me.

73
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,880
Now.

74
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,760
I can't get mad at my boss!

75
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,360
Good morning, Mr. Elyes!

76
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,480
What's wrong?

77
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,280
You've been quiet while driving.

78
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,960
What's the matter? Say it.

79
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,120
Nothing.

80
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,040
Nothing means something.

81
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,120
Excuse me!

82
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,520
The contractor said he would
arrive at the project site in one hour.

83
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,640
Come with me.

84
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,840
Mr. Elyes!

85
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,880
Mr. Elyes!

86
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
How come they are so cute together?

87
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,320
Oh, my. You still let him drag you, Pat.

88
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,080
Doesn't resist at all.

89
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,440
Kim?

90
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,600
Why didn't you call me first?

91
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,520
Good morning, Mr. Kim.

92
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,480
Is your secretary back?

93
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,800
Elyes was always hotheaded
when you were gone.

94
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
Yes.

95
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,520
That was because no one worked like Pat.

96
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,480
What's your business here?
I'm heading to the project site.

97
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
I invite you for a dinner.

98
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,680
You can call me.

99
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
I want to see you.

100
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,240
Run?

101
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,920
I'll wait outside.

102
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,720
I'll go too.

103
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,920
I think Elyes wants to talk with Run.

104
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
Don't worry.

105
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
Elyes didn't go to see Run last night.

106
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,120
I told Run to call Elyes.

107
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,760
Were you with Mr. Run?

108
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,640
It's you who makes Elyes deny others.

109
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,880
I suggested Run to call because
he saw Fei Long's awful behaviors.

110
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,560
He has no one to depend on.

111
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
Love life doesn't go well?

112
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,400
I think so.

113
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,000
I would've left.

114
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
No idea why he endures it.

115
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,440
Don't ever come here again.

116
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,040
Fei Long will trouble you.

117
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,880
Forget him.

118
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,200
He never cares about my feelings.

119
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,400
You chose your path.

120
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,280
Go back to your man.

121
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
That man, Pat.

122
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,280
Do you like him?

123
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,880
None of your concern.

124
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,880
I know we shouldn't talk,
but you were the only comfort I had.

125
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,920
“Had.”

126
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,640
Isn't that obvious enough?

127
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,240
Watch out for Fei Long.

128
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,800
He won't lose the project easily.

129
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,080
Are you hot?

130
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,600
You should sit at the back, not by my side.

131
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,920
I want to sit here. What's the problem?

132
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,040
Hey?!

133
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,920
What's wrong with you?! That was dangerous!

134
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,480
We must talk. What's wrong?

135
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,440
If you don't know, stay that way.

136
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,480
Pat.

137
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,880
Pat.

138
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
Where are you going?!

139
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,560
Hey!

140
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,520
I'm sick of driving! Drive the car
yourself! I'm heading back to the company!

141
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,880
Come on! Let's talk!

142
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,600
You can go.

143
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Meet me at the site. Almost there.

144
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,560
Pat?

145
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,560
What's wrong? You look grumpy.

146
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,880
Didn't you go to the site with Mr. Elyes?

147
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,640
Ms. Aeom, may I ask you something?

148
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,240
My friend was with his lover.
Then, she went out at night.

149
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,920
First, he thought she went to see her ex.

150
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,040
But there's another
reason she didn't tell him.

151
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,640
Where do you think his lover went?

152
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,920
Did you mean Mr. Elyes last night?

153
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,840
Of course not! It's my friend's lover!

154
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,920
Oh, right.

155
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,480
Maybe she had important things to

156
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
do, so she went to the site today.

157
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,720
Oh, my friend's lover is at
the site? How do you know?

158
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,520
Workers protested last night.
I informed Mr. Elyes to settle it.

159
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,640
I guessed your friend's issue is the same.

160
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,760
Did Mr. Elyes go to the project site?

161
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,800
Yes.

162
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,680
(10,000 baht transferred)

163
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,960
Who did this?

164
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,120
(10,000 baht transferred)

165
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,680
Are you okay now?

166
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,720
(10,000 baht transferred)

167
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,160
(10,000 baht transferred)

168
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,560
(10,000 baht transferred)

169
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,720
Don't be upset.

170
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,040
(10,000 baht transferred)

171
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,480
(10,000 baht transferred)

172
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:29,880
(10,000 baht transferred)

173
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,160
Want this happen ten times?

174
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:33,960
(10,000 baht transferred)

175
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,680
Please, enough.

176
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Tell me what's wrong.

177
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,640
You went out last night.

178
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,640
I settled workers' protest at the site.

179
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,080
About no late-night shift.

180
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,560
I just knew.

181
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm sorry.

182
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,320
Why? That was my fault.

183
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,640
It's okay. I forgot

184
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
I mustn't get mad

185
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,400
and upset.

186
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,280
Pat?!

187
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,320
Pat?!

188
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,880
Are you crying?!

189
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,520
No, I'm fine.

190
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'll go to you!

191
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,480
Please, don't! You don't have to!

192
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,600
Yes, Paeng?

193
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,520
I went to see you at the
company, but you left.

194
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,880
Why did you want to see me there?

195
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,240
I…

196
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,920
I'm off now.

197
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,640
I told you not to come

198
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,200
and transfer the money.

199
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,440
I didn't hear it. Heard you
crying and suddenly I'm here.

200
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,840
Eaten anything yet?

201
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Fried chicken?

202
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,720
For the one who likes it.

203
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
You know what I like.

204
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,760
Let's get in.

205
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,840
Can you tell me now why you cried?

206
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm mad at myself

207
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,760
for being an idiot who
was upset for nothing.

208
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,400
When you're like this, you're…

209
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,400
Cute.

210
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,160
And look yummy.

211
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,920
Let's… eat.

212
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,280
Now?

213
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,160
Yes. Are you hungry?

214
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,440
Lewd.

215
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,080
Is that hot?

216
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,240
Say, “Ahh.”

217
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,480
Good morning, Mr. Elyes.

218
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,240
You two look happy.

219
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,520
Did your friend settle with his lover?

220
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,400
Yes?

221
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,080
A friend and a lover?

222
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,680
Pat's friend came here. Her name was Paeng.

223
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,720
Paeng?

224
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,720
Yes, I told her to wait
at the reception zone.

225
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,760
Oh.

226
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,520
I see.

227
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,000
There's a load of work
today. I'd better see to it.

228
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,520
Oh, my. What do I need to do?

229
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,720
What are you doing here?

230
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,720
We didn't finish talking and you hung up.

231
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,560
I… was busy.

232
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
I miss you.

233
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,200
Isn't that too late?

234
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,960
I really miss you.

235
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
I'm not the same anymore.

236
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,080
It's almost time. I must work now.

237
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,160
Wait.

238
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,840
See you next time.

239
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,360
You said, “Next time.”

240
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,440
Where have you been?

241
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,000
Why do I have so many documents?

242
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I have loads to do, so I gave some to you.

243
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,240
But your work schedule is empty.

244
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,800
What do you mean by “loads of work?”

245
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,960
I must correct my secretary
before they go astray.

246
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,680
Huh?

247
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,240
Work.

248
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,680
Send them before noon.

249
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,640
They're all done.

250
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
You're quick. Going to see someone?

251
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,800
I work quickly. You know that.

252
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,840
Who will you meet with?

253
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,320
“Who?”

254
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,360
Do you mean Paeng?

255
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,160
It seems you're free.

256
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,720
Want more work?

257
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,120
Fine.

258
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,920
Aeom,

259
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,320
ask everyone in the company
who has overloaded work.

260
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,440
My secretary's keen
to work. Send it to him.

261
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,040
Everyone?!

262
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,720
Someone told me you met with Elyes.

263
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,320
Why?

264
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,000
Why can't I? You never
care about my feelings.

265
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,480
I don't even know what I am to you!

266
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,200
What's with that face?

267
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Hate it? Just break up with me.

268
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
Break up?

269
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,560
What's wrong with you?

270
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,200
Of course. Fei Long Lodge

271
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,360
can sleep with anyone because he's rich.

272
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,512
How was I so stupid to choose you?

273
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,480
Why didn't I choose a loving and caring man

274
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,280
like Elyes...

275
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,960
Don't say his name!

276
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,920
Why can't I say his name?

277
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,760
Elyes! Elyes! Elyes!

278
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,800
Don't. Say. His. Name.

279
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,200
No, you can't order me.

280
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
Then you'll get your brother's corpse.

281
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Don't forget our deal.

282
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,000
Your brother lives well in jail

283
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,640
and doesn't get killed by

284
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
the loan sharks' goons because of me.

285
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,800
You won't see him again if you defy me.

286
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
I'm sorry.

287
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,400
Don't go back to your old love

288
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,000
because you're my property.

289
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,640
Why don't you let me go?

290
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
What for?

291
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,640
You'll be free

292
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
when I get bored.

293
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,800
Then just be sick of me.

294
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,320
Start from today.

295
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,720
Long time no see. Miss me?

296
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,480
I heard your brother's in jail.

297
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,040
You spied on me.

298
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,280
You're not like the others.

299
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,480
If you break up with Elyes and
be with me, I'll help your brother.

300
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,920
Oh, poor you.

301
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,840
Your friend's in big trouble.
He made his lover upset.

302
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,960
Upset?

303
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,640
Because your friend
met an ex in front of her.

304
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,560
Of course, she was upset.

305
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,520
How do you know about
my friend and his lover?

306
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,800
I haven't told who he is.

307
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,520
Sorry, I mistook it for my friend.
I tend to be spaced out recently.

308
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,040
I'll tell my friend to
make up with her lover.

309
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,760
Fighting. I'm rooting for you.

310
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,040
Loads of work here.

311
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,080
Here's all the work.

312
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,240
That's quick. Will you go somewhere?

313
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,200
What do you mean?

314
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,760
I won't go anywhere.

315
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,560
Not to see your ex?

316
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,360
See my ex?

317
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,640
…in front of his lover
Of course, she'll be upset.

318
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
In front of…

319
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,480
lover.

320
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,880
Crap, I upset him.

321
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,280
Who's upset?

322
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,120
It's…

323
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,880
you.

324
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,520
I upset you.

325
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,200
Who's upset because of you?

326
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,000
You're not that important.

327
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,320
Fine!

328
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,200
If I'm not, check all the work by yourself.

329
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,040
I have more to do.

330
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,880
Then, I'll meet with my “ex” after work.

331
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,440
Fine.

332
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,800
Wait.

333
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,040
Haven't had dinner yet?

334
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,520
What about work?

335
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,440
Forget it. I'm hungry.

336
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,040
What do you want? I'll take you there.

337
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,560
Order something to eat at my house?

338
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,880
You can go there to sleep over.

339
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,640
I'll drive.

340
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,920
You're the best.

341
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,640
Of course.

342
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,000
You know?

343
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,200
The day you cried,
I forgot to store my wine.

344
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,960
Now, it tastes lousy.

345
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,720
Regretting coming for me?

346
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Why?

347
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,480
I made your wine taste lousy.

348
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,560
You're better than the wine.

349
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,480
I'll put the stuff here, Mr. Elyes.

350
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,720
I'll take my leave.

351
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,920
Is Mr. Run still deep in your
mind? You're keeping his photo.

352
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,960
What about you?

353
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,520
Is Paeng the same for you?

354
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,360
It is.

355
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,920
But I won't turn back.

356
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,400
Likewise.

357
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:16,560
I keep that photo to remind myself that
he didn't choose me and I won't turn back.

358
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,560
I may be different

359
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,720
because I don't love Paeng anymore.

360
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,880
I also don't love Run.

361
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,120
But you don't love anyone.

362
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,400
Who do you love?

363
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,600
What do you mean by “who?”

364
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,200
Who is the guy?

365
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,800
Me.

366
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,800
I'm used to having you in my life.

367
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,800
I can't live… without you.

368
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,880
I asked the staff to prepare a breakfast.

369
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,320
Here's your coffee.

370
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,320
Eat with me.

371
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,760
You know I must have you around.

372
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,040
Yes.

373
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,800
Pat.

374
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,920
Paeng?

375
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,880
What are you doing here?

376
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,440
Didn't you tell me to come “next time?”

377
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,840
I'll wait in my room.

378
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,520
It's okay.

379
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,160
Let us go.

380
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,880
What is it?

381
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,200
Can I have you for a day?

382
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,880
(Next Episode) Pat, what are
you doing? What took you so long?

383
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,920
Nothing.

384
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,040
Oh!

385
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,120
I want to remind you
who makes you feel better.

386
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,240
She is my ex. And you…

387
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,560
are the boss.

388
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,520
Just a boss?

389
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,840
No, Mr. Elyes!

390
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,240
I said no!

391
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,120
Did I make you two fight each other?

392
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,440
Not at all.

393
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,960
You stay late. The boss will
love you for your hard work.

394
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,160
I don't think so.

395
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,280
I have another thing I must tell you.

396
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,640
What is it?
