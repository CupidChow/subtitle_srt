"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 8)

2
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,080
(Previously)
Run?

3
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,240
It's you who makes Elyes deny others.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
I suggested Run to call because
he saw Fei Long's awful behaviors.

5
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,960
He has no one to depend on.

6
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,160
Is Mr. Run still deep-seated in your mind?

7
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,640
I keep that photo to remind myself that
he doesn't choose me and I won't turn back.

8
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,600
I'm used to having you in my life.

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,280
I can't live… without you.

10
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,720
I asked the staff to prepare a breakfast.

11
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,760
Here's your coffee.

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,360
Eat with me.

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,280
You know I must have you around.

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,920
Yes.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Pat.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,800
Paeng?

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,600
What are you doing here?

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Didn't you tell me to come “next time?”

19
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll wait in my room.

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,160
It's okay.

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Let us go.

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
What is it?

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Can I have you for a day?

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,040
I don't allow you to meet with that woman!

25
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,880
Let me go. I also want to settle with her.

26
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,520
She's an adult. Can't she call you?

27
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,880
Who would work if you go?

28
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,240
May I have a day off?

29
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,720
So, you want to go, huh?

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Yes.

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,400
Fine.

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,560
But you must do something for me.

33
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,080
Woah!

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,440
What are you doing, Mr. Elyes?

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,120
Just want to remind you.

36
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,520
No, Mr. Elyes.

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,280
Mr. Elyes!

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Wait, my phone rings.

39
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
Let it ring.

40
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,360
Hi, Paeng.

41
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Pat, what are you doing? What took you so long?

42
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
Nothing.

43
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh!

44
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,680
Just want to talk about hanging out.
Want to go somewhere specific?

45
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,440
It's okay. I can go anywhere.

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,960
(I'm on the phone.)

47
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Oh!

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,760
Hello? Are you okay?

49
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,480
It's nothing.

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,920
I'll take you to places myself. See you.

51
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,680
Alright. See you.

52
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,720
You're mischievous. I was on the phone.

53
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,400
Who's more mischievous?

54
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,280
You can't prioritize things.

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
How so? What if someone has an urgent matter?

56
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,920
You knew it was Paeng who called you.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,280
And we…

58
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,880
are spending a good time together.

59
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Who makes you feel better.

60
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
What's wrong?

61
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
Nightmare?

62
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,280
No, just need to drink water.

63
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
Sorry for waking you.

64
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
It's okay.

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I won't lose you.

66
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
Pat.

67
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Please, Mr. Elyes.

68
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,840
I don't want you to go.

69
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,040
We've had a deal.

70
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,560
When? I can't remember.

71
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't want you to go.

72
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,480
I must take a bath. You can continue sleeping,

73
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,880
but don't be late for work.

74
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,560
You don't want me to be late, so I came with you.

75
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,680
What's with the face?

76
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,280
I didn't expect you to drive and drop me here.

77
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,880
Don't you know carpool?

78
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,480
Same direction, go together.

79
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,240
The company is right behind us.

80
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,600
Oh, really?!

81
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,480
I think I'm lost.

82
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,840
Lost?

83
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,800
And come to my direction.

84
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,880
Thank you.

85
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,200
Mr. Elyes!

86
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
No one sees us.

87
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to remind you…

88
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,200
who makes…

89
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,440
you feel better.

90
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,000
You can't get away from me.

91
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,360
Good morning, Mr. Elyes.

92
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320
Mr. Pat has a day off?

93
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,040
You also don't come to the office?

94
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,080
Yes, I'll do it for you.

95
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,240
Yes.

96
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,360
Mr. Elyes and Pat don't go to work.

97
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,520
I'm heading to work now.

98
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
See you soon.

99
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,080
Pat, right here!

100
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,920
I ordered your favorite coffee.

101
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,400
Thank you, Paeng.

102
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,040
Doesn't your boss come with you?

103
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,160
Oh, Mr. Elyes goes to work.

104
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,200
Go to work?

105
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,960
So, where will you take me today?

106
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,720
Just for a day, please?

107
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,360
- Come on.
- Okay, fine.

108
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,760
Let's go.

109
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
Damn it!

110
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
Lots of dolls here!

111
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,120
I'll play it.

112
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,240
- Woah!
- You've got it!

113
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,240
- Aww!
- No!

114
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,000
Sticker photo. Let's take some.

115
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,280
Come.

116
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,840
Come in.

117
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,120
Wait. The last photo.

118
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,720
Pat,

119
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,360
let's go there.

120
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,680
- Okay.
- Hurry.

121
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,840
Thank you.

122
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,920
What should I choose?

123
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,760
Maybe salad?

124
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,840
Why sit that close?

125
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,040
Would you like to order food?

126
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,800
Does this restaurant give one menu per table?

127
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Yes.

128
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
I'll look through the menu. You can take other orders.

129
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,720
Yes.

130
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
Steak?

131
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,640
- (Elyes: What are you doing?)
- This looks interesting.

132
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,440
Do you…

133
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,680
Oh, there's fried chicken with fish sauce you like.

134
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,960
That's good. Order it.

135
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,760
You don't reply, do you?

136
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,480
There are fried chicken with fish sauce,
chicken with cashew nuts, and jungle curry.

137
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,560
What about veg...

138
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,320
I'll be right back. Must answer this call.

139
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,360
Don't you order food first?

140
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,680
You do it. I can eat anything.

141
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,360
Yes, Mr. Elyes?

142
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
Took you a while.

143
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
I have a day off.

144
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,920
I didn't blame you.

145
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,680
Is there anything you need?

146
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,520
Well…

147
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,520
I…

148
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,360
I can't find my name card box.

149
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,920
Name card box?

150
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
It's on your table.

151
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,960
I don't move it anywhere.

152
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,560
I must see it by then.

153
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,640
I'll call Thiti to look for it.

154
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,320
No, no!

155
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,880
Oh, here. I've found it.

156
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,400
Where did you find it?

157
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,160
On the table. I pile documents on top of it.

158
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,600
I see. Okay.

159
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,840
I must hang up now.

160
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,320
Wait.

161
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,360
When will you come back?

162
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,400
I miss you.

163
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm having lunch.

164
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,920
You should have it too.

165
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,720
I'll see you when I'm done.

166
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,320
Sure?

167
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,360
Yes.

168
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm off.

169
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Hey there. These are your favorite dishes.

170
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,760
You can order what you like. I'll order some for you.

171
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You remember my favorite dishes?

172
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,440
You know I have good memories.

173
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm glad you still remember.

174
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,440
Does it mean I still have a chance?

175
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,560
Thank you. This looks tasty.

176
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
Eat up, Paeng.

177
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,080
Here's some veggies. You like mushrooms, right?

178
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,400
(Elyes: Will you come right after lunch?)

179
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,200
(Pat: How do you know I had lunch?)

180
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,840
(Elyes: You're not a slow eater. It's been sometime now.)

181
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,040
(Pat: I haven't talked to Paeng yet. I'm going to.)

182
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,320
Pat.

183
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,920
Pat!

184
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,120
Where will you take me next?

185
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh, I…

186
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,080
haven't planned for the afternoon.

187
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,120
Great, I have a list of places I want you to go with...

188
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,920
It's okay. We can talk here.

189
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,920
I… have something to tell you.

190
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Can you postpone that?
You told me you'd give me a day.

191
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,640
This is only half a day.

192
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
Please.

193
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Fine.

194
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,240
Okay, it's my turn now.

195
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,160
(Paeng. Pat.)

196
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,200
(Elyes. Pat.)

197
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,360
Let's sit.

198
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,640
Yeah.

199
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,680
Why don't we walk inside a supermarket?

200
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,880
It has air cons and we can go shopping.

201
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,080
(Elyes: Are you done?)

202
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,160
Your boss prods you to go back?

203
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,120
Well…

204
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,840
Yes.

205
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Paeng, I have to answer the call.

206
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,960
Wait, I didn't ask you much. Just a day.

207
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,360
If you don't want to come or your boss
keeps prodding you, it isn't fair for me.

208
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,760
You shouldn't promise me in the first place.

209
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,040
Hey, Paeng! Wait!

210
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,040
Let me explain.

211
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,880
Your reactions when you're
with me are clear enough.

212
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,040
But I didn't think you'd
see my time was worthless.

213
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,600
I don't think like that.
I really intend to meet with you.

214
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,160
Meet with me? To tell me I'm nothing for you?

215
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Do you love that Mr. Elyes?

216
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Yes.

217
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,320
I love him so much.

218
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,280
I come for you today to tell
you I can't love you like before.

219
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,080
But we can still be friends.

220
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,440
I don't want that.

221
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,280
Pat,

222
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,400
please be with me again.

223
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,320
I'm sorry.

224
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,760
I don't have feelings for you anymore.

225
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,720
But you love someone who's not clear to you?

226
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,040
Can you remember how he
introduced himself when I first met him?

227
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,720
He said he's your boss, not lover.

228
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,040
If he was serious about you,

229
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,120
he'd think of you like one.

230
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,360
But not at all!

231
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,360
Really okay with that?

232
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,360
Whether he's okay with that
or not, you're not with Pat anymore.

233
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,000
Leave him alone.

234
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,200
Mr. Elyes?

235
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,080
How can you be here?

236
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,520
Let's go.

237
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,840
Wait.

238
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,640
Stop. Pat.

239
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,640
No, Mr. Elyes.

240
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,440
I said no, Mr. Elyes.

241
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,280
What's wrong?

242
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,160
Mad at me for dragging you
here or following you all day?

243
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,480
I should be upset.

244
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,640
I knew you ignored my messages
and focused on that woman.

245
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,600
She is my ex.

246
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,200
And you…

247
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,120
are the boss.

248
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,520
Come again?

249
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,600
Just a boss?

250
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,360
No, stop!

251
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,560
No, Mr. Elyes!

252
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,080
I said no!

253
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,840
I didn't mean it.

254
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,480
A boss shouldn't molest a subordinate.

255
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,680
Fine. Okay.

256
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
I'm sorry.

257
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,080
She is my ex.

258
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,880
And you…

259
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,200
are the boss.

260
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,000
A boss shouldn't molest a subordinate.

261
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,880
Fine. Okay.

262
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,680
I'm sorry.

263
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,600
A boss shouldn't molest a subordinate?

264
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,160
Wasn't what he did called molestation?

265
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,760
(Kim: I miss you.)

266
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,880
(Elyes: Let's meet.)

267
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,480
I'll wait in my room.

268
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,640
It's okay.

269
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,440
Let us go.

270
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,360
If not eating on time, you'll get gastritis again.

271
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,400
You're cute when you're worried about me.

272
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,080
Paeng?

273
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,160
Pat.

274
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,480
Can I talk with you?

275
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Yep.

276
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,120
Come right in.

277
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,960
Your house's tidy, as usual.

278
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,920
I… want to say sorry to you and your lover.
What I said also affects the man you love.

279
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,520
It's okay. I'm not upset.

280
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,800
Be upset. I realize what I did was really
terrible. I shouldn't say that to you too.

281
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,240
Okay, I was upset a bit, but not anymore.

282
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,280
Where's your lover?

283
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,440
Oh, he's not here.

284
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,720
Did I make you two fight each other?

285
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,480
Not at all.

286
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,120
It's… complicated. But still okay.

287
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,960
I can talk to him with you.
I'll settle the issue between you two.

288
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,080
It's okay, I'm used to it.

289
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,200
You… can call me to say sorry, though.

290
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,800
But you drove here to see me.

291
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,800
I have another thing I must tell you.

292
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,520
What is it?

293
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,920
Your… assistant.

294
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,680
The day I met you at your company and you left.

295
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,640
Pat!

296
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,160
Oh, Thiti.

297
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm almost late.

298
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,960
Let's hurry.

299
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,720
Okay.

300
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,080
I thought I went home and would meet you again.

301
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,680
Then, I met someone I knew.

302
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,640
Paeng?

303
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,880
Tee?

304
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,080
Tee?

305
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,120
Who's that?

306
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,360
Teeranai.

307
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,680
Oh, do you know Mr. Teeranai?

308
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,360
Yes.

309
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,560
After I broke up with you…

310
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,360
I was with him.

311
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,560
A dish of chestnuts.

312
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,360
And also…

313
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,040
tuna salad.

314
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,280
Thank you.

315
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,200
How are you after we…

316
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
were apart in America?

317
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,280
I studied and worked…

318
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,240
then back to Thailand.

319
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,640
Didn't you tell me you'd work for your family's business?

320
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,320
Was that because you were with me?

321
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,200
I…

322
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,520
Yes.

323
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,800
I didn't know Tee was your boss' relative.

324
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,640
I wouldn't have gone to your
company and met him if I had known.

325
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,280
Why?

326
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,720
He used to hurt me.

327
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,600
What? Mr. Teeranai?

328
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,600
Why did you have dinner with him?

329
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,600
I was afraid.

330
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,040
You don't know that Tee can do anything he wants to.

331
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,800
I don't understand.

332
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:58,400
Didn't you warn me about my assistant?
How come it's about Mr. Teeranai now?

333
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,280
Because your assistant is his partner.

334
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,960
Who's that?

335
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,600
My acquaintance.

336
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,120
Let's go.

337
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,880
Pat!

338
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,200
- Oh, Thiti.
- I'm almost late.

339
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,560
- Let's hurry.
- Okay.

340
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:41,120
When I was in America, Tee said
his relative took over his company.

341
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,520
He always said he would take it back.

342
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,920
I think you should warn your boss to be careful.

343
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,400
And with Tee's partner works close
to you, Tee must plan something.

344
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,720
Good afternoon. Are you Thiti?

345
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,960
Yes. Good afternoon.

346
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Good afternoon, Mr. Elyes.

347
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,920
I'm Thiti.

348
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,520
Do they know about you and me?

349
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,720
I mean, you didn't say to Mr. Teeranai
and Thiti about yourself, right?

350
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,800
Calm down. I didn't say a thing.

351
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,640
I think he doesn't know.

352
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,040
Okay.

353
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,480
I…

354
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,800
need some time to think about what I must do.

355
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,840
Ms. Aeom. Are you still here?

356
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,400
You don't have to be formal.
Be relaxed when talking to me like Pat.

357
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Yes, Ms. Aeom.

358
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,640
You stay late. The boss will
love you for your hard work.

359
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,120
It's nothing special.

360
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,760
You're humble.

361
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,560
I came to see you and will go soon.
Make sure to switch the light off for me.

362
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,520
Of course, Ms. Aeom.

363
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,400
Okay. I'm going. Bye.

364
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,600
Yes, bye-bye.

365
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,200
(Teeranai: How is it?)

366
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,440
I'm doing it right now.

367
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,640
(Next Episode)
Disobey me?

368
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
I'll go.

369
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,760
It's okay.

370
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,760
You must be dedicated to working with me.

371
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,000
Learn your job from Pat well,

372
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,920
so he can finally quit his job.

373
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,440
But he has worked for you for a long time.

374
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,720
Too long.

375
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,720
I come to give this to you quickly.
All information from Elyes' computer.

376
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,720
I must reward you…

377
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,560
for your dedication.

378
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,520
Pat's an idiot.

379
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,680
Give him excuses and he believes them.
