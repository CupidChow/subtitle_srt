"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 4)

2
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,680
(Previously)
Appoint Kim to have French cuisine with me.

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,360
Fought with your boss?

4
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,120
Idiot!

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
Mr. Pat, you must help me.

6
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,040
With my full effort.

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,040
Not for Mr. Teeranai, but for the company.

8
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,200
Pat!

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't quit because you're like this.

10
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,080
Then don't quit.

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,680
My boss will drive me crazy.

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,280
Have you expected
disappointment from loving Elyes?

13
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
Pat,

14
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,080
didn't I tell you not to
leave me when I'm sick?

15
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Mr. Elyes!

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,200
And until I'm better,
you must take care of me. Got it?

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,240
Yes.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
Watch your step.

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,520
Fine. Do it, Pat. Go.

20
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
Go.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Go.

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,920
Just wipe him until he's fine, then
ask him to leave. Nothing at all.

23
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,520
Just wipe him. It's not sex. Ask him
to leave when he's well. That's all, Pat.

24
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,760
It's nothing.

25
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,320
I'll go if you're uncomfortable.

26
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,800
Not at all.

27
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,520
I'll wipe you.

28
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
Then wipe me thoroughly.

29
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,640
Yes.

30
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,160
I was sweating while sleeping.

31
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,760
Can you wipe behind my knee joints?

32
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,640
Yes.

33
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,560
Good morning.

34
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,680
Good morning, Elyes.

35
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,320
Are you okay, Mr. Elyes?

36
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,200
I… had a nightmare.

37
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,960
Nightmare?

38
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
Don't overthink it.

39
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,920
Let's take a bath.

40
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,840
Happy birthday to you.

41
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,000
Happy birthday, my Elyes.

42
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,520
Happy birthday to you.

43
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,520
Make a wish.

44
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,200
Taste it. I made this for you.

45
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,760
How is it?

46
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,640
Good.

47
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,160
It's tasty. I have a present for you too.

48
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,360
Hold this for a sec.

49
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,520
Happy birthday, Mr. Elyes.

50
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,320
Mr. Elyes?

51
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,240
Pat.

52
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,400
Are you alright? You look pale.

53
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:18,872
Just a nightmare.

54
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,280
Had it again?

55
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,760
You have a meeting with the architect
this afternoon. Should I cancel it?

56
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,280
Yes, I need some rest.

57
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,560
As you say.

58
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,400
Do you need anything else? Maybe
some music? A relaxing book? Or...

59
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,560
I want to be alone!

60
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,040
Of course.

61
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,760
Hey there, man?

62
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,320
Wanna drink tonight?
I'll go to work in Krabi tomorrow.

63
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,360
Aww, you leave so
quickly. We barely hung out.

64
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,960
You can come to have a drink. My treat.

65
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
From your sigh,

66
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,920
your boss caused trouble again?

67
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,480
Not exactly.

68
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,400
Pat, wanna quit and work with me?
I'll deal with HR.

69
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Nope.

70
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,360
What do you mean?
Not working or drinking with me?

71
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,640
I mean both.

72
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Pat.

73
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,760
Yes.

74
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm going now. Bye.

75
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,840
Wah? Gosh.

76
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,000
Make a hotel room reservation.

77
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,200
Today?

78
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,696
Shouldn't you have a rest?

79
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,560
Seeing Kim would do.

80
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,320
And I can go there myself.

81
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
Nothing more to do here.

82
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,280
You can go back home.

83
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,760
Hello, Mr. Kim.

84
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,040
Dude, chill!

85
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,720
First, you wouldn't come.
Now, you're drinking non-stop.

86
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,720
That's my business!

87
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,080
Come on. You can tell me what's wrong.

88
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,960
Ah-ah-ah! Just tell me
what you have in mind!

89
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm frustrated! I just wanna drink,

90
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
so I don't have to think about anything.

91
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,400
Both of them must be having fun.

92
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,600
Pat! Come on, chill!

93
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Refreshing.

94
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,320
Is the food not tasty?

95
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,760
You don't look okay at all.

96
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,000
No, it's good.

97
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,200
Have something in mind?
You can tell me. You'll feel better.

98
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,800
I had that dream again.

99
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,880
And then, Run became Pat.

100
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,400
Are you okay?

101
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,600
You'd better wash it.
It'll be hard to clean.

102
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,120
(What are you doing?)

103
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,720
(Ms. Aeom, how's the assistant
hiring? Has anyone applied for it?)

104
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,840
(What are you doing?)

105
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,880
Yeah.

106
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,480
He doesn't reply.

107
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,480
My shirt is wet. Can I borrow yours?

108
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Here, take it.

109
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,080
Wait.

110
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,320
Just wear it, or you'll get sick.

111
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,520
I'll make a call for a minute.

112
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,840
I shouldn't have invited you to drink!

113
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,240
Just drank and didn't talk!

114
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,600
Waiter. Bill, please.

115
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,400
Not just that. Now, you're my burden!

116
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,663
Pat, someone's calling you.

117
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,040
Pat!

118
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

119
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,000
You're not Pat.

120
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,560
Who's that?

121
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,560
I'm Pat's friend.

122
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
Are you Mr. Elyes?

123
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,480
Yes. Where's Pat?

124
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,175
Now, he's…

125
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,960
Dude, sit properly!

126
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,840
How? Why push my head with your foot?

127
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,720
That's my shoulder.

128
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,520
Pat!

129
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,280
Dude!

130
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,560
You're such a burden, devil!

131
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,360
Get up already.

132
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
I'll take care of him.

133
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Yes.

134
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,680
So lucky of Pat that his boss
is worried and arrives to carry him.

135
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm not worried.

136
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,720
Just want to ask him why he drank

137
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,320
even though I ordered him to rest.

138
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,160
People drink for a few reasons.

139
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,480
Celebrate happiness.

140
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,840
Or to forget…

141
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,840
what makes them sad.

142
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,680
Then why did Pat drink?

143
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,080
From happiness

144
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,440
or sadness?

145
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,200
Didn't you notice?

146
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,000
He cried…

147
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
He cried…

148
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,680
“Augh! Augh! Augh!”

149
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
from agony.

150
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,920
Well,

151
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,520
the boss came for his subordinate.

152
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,400
Please take care of Pat.

153
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,680
I'll… go back there and dance.

154
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Mr. Elyes.

155
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,720
You're mean.

156
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,440
You're always mean.

157
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,920
What am I to you?

158
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,080
Don't cry.

159
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Always sad when you're with me?

160
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,000
My head…

161
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,760
How am I here?

162
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,560
I carried you.

163
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,440
Mr. Elyes?

164
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,760
I ordered you to rest, not
get drunk with your friend.

165
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,240
It wasn't my work time.
Can't I hang out with my friend?

166
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,360
Arguing with me?

167
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,160
Get up and have a breakfast.
I'll prepare it for you.

168
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,800
The outfit.

169
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,160
Are you that hungry?

170
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,600
No, I'm not.

171
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,960
Last night, did you…

172
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,760
Nope.

173
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,680
I didn't finish my question.

174
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,720
I know what you think from looking at you.

175
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,960
You're quite lewd.

176
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,560
It's you who took
advantage of a drunk person!

177
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,600
Mischievous.

178
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,080
Here's your breakfast.

179
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,200
And orange juice.

180
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,280
Eat. Cure your hangover.

181
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,680
I'll go to work.

182
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,880
Are you going?

183
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,080
Yes.

184
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,200
You have a rest. That's an order.

185
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,440
Oh,

186
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,607
I didn't take advantage of you,
but the drunkard did it.

187
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,680
Took advantage? What the hell?

188
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,560
Who was drunk?

189
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,040
What did I do?

190
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Screw this.

191
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,000
I can't remember, so I'm not wrong.

192
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,640
He charged my phone.

193
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,560
What a nice guy.

194
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,000
Yes, Ms. Aeom?

195
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,720
I think of having a day off.

196
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,120
A person is coming for an interview?

197
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,440
I've changed my mind. I'll be there.
Please take care of the interviewee.

198
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,160
Okay, I'm off.

199
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,800
Almost forgot.

200
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:23,231
That's correct. You're fine.

201
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,240
Good afternoon, Ms. Aeom.

202
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,440
There you are, Pat!

203
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,800
The interviewee is over there.

204
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,800
Thank you.

205
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,040
Good afternoon. Are you Thiti?

206
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
Yes. Good afternoon.

207
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,320
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

208
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,640
It's fine.

209
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,000
Your profile matches with what I need.

210
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:08,431
Do I start working now?

211
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,640
You can, but there's some concern.

212
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,040
Is it about my salary demand?

213
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,680
No, it's not.

214
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:28,080
My boss is hard to please. There were many
people fired before I started working here.

215
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,680
I'm afraid you'll be discouraged.

216
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,800
You don't need to worry about it.
With your guidance, I believe I can work

217
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,440
with the boss. I won't give up easily.

218
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
That's settled.

219
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,720
Can you start your work next week?

220
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,360
I can. Even now.

221
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,080
Take it easy and be prepared.

222
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,640
Yes.

223
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,360
Pat,

224
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,360
see me in my room now!

225
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:07,495
Please excuse me.

226
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,560
Of course.

227
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,240
Is there something you need?
I haven't finished what I do.

228
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,160
Didn't I order you to rest at home?

229
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,920
I'm interviewing my assistant.

230
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,480
Assistant?

231
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
What assistant?

232
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,280
The one who helps me work with you.

233
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,120
Tell him to go away!

234
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,800
I won't hire him! I can
see he's good for nothing!

235
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,840
I hired him as my assistant. The one
who decides If he's good or not is me.

236
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,120
And I need an assistant because I'm tired.

237
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,280
I hope you understand.

238
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,200
If you were really tired, you wouldn't
disobey my order and drink with your friend.

239
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Am I right?

240
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,320
What about you? You wanna be alone, but
met up with Mr. Kim and told me to go home.

241
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,840
That hurts!

242
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,280
That was for slagging me off in your head.

243
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,960
And I still insist. I won't hire him.

244
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,120
Tell him to go away!

245
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,960
You're mean.

246
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,640
You're mean.

247
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,760
I'll hire him.

248
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,640
But if that new guy is lousy,

249
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,480
you won't get only a forehead flick.

250
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,520
Get it?

251
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,280
I do.

252
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
If I'm wrong,

253
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:17,664
you may punish me any way you wish.

254
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,520
Mr. Elyes.

255
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,480
Mr. Elyes, the Burton Group's CEO.

256
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
Good afternoon, Mr. Elyes.

257
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
I'm Thiti.

258
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,480
Mr, Elyes, this is Thiti, my assistant.

259
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,920
This zone's progress is 90%.

260
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,160
Did I do something wrong?

261
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't understand why
you train Thiti thoroughly.

262
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,800
Do you intend to quit?

263
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,640
I want Thiti to work well quickly,
so I can focus on your other matters.

264
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,240
Other matters? What are they?

265
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,960
You always work for
me without any mistakes.

266
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Oh…

267
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,720
Is it about…

268
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,320
Of course, I mean work.

269
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:25,535
Yes, it is work. What did you think?

270
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Did you think… about sex?

271
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,880
Lose focus?

272
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,320
I knew that was what you thought.

273
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,520
No, it's not! It's because
you kept talking to me!

274
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,480
Please be quiet for your own safety.

275
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,280
Thanks for driving me “safely.”

276
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,360
Thank yourself for not distracting me.

277
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,000
Does the word “sex”
can make you lose focus?

278
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,080
You may say the word without
awkwardness, but not for me.

279
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,760
Please don't say such a thing to me.

280
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,680
Why?

281
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,920
You know we both had...

282
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,240
Yes,

283
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,800
I know we did. But I don't want
to be like your other partners

284
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,880
like Kim

285
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,040
or whoever.

286
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,600
I hope you understand.

287
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,680
How's being my partner bad?

288
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,520
You were happy that night.

289
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,640
That's what a heartless
person, such as you, thinks.

290
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,480
Here's your car key.

291
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,240
I'll take my leave.

292
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,920
What?

293
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,200
Yes, here's a list of Mr. Elyes' friend
with benefits you must manage, Mr. Thiti.

294
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,920
Woah!

295
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:04,367
I didn't think Mr. Elyes was this extreme.

296
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,400
I'm sorry for being frank,

297
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,400
but… does Mr. Elyes have a high sex drive?

298
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,680
You can say that.

299
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,320
I almost wouldn't believe
this if you didn't tell me.

300
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,440
In my training, I saw the
boss was possessive of you.

301
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,520
I even thought you two slept together.

302
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,360
No, no! I always manage
his work and life schedule.

303
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,200
He acts strange because I'll quit.
It's your misunderstanding.

304
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,960
We both are only boss and subordinate.

305
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
I see.

306
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,200
Please excuse me.

307
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,480
Hey there, man.

308
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,520
Where are you? I hear the wind blow.

309
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,760
A cool dude, such as me, is at the beach.

310
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,160
How's your new staff training? Is he good?

311
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,280
So good that I wanna quit.

312
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,960
That doesn't sound good.

313
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,120
No, no. I mean, he works really well.
I don't have to worry if I quit.

314
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,840
Then come to me. The sea welcomes you.

315
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,320
I'll even take a day
off to give you a tour.

316
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,800
Don't use me as your day
off excuse. Keep working.

317
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,000
I must answer Mr. Elyes' call.

318
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,200
Pat, my dude. How will you quit?

319
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,880
Why didn't you answer me?

320
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,200
What are you doing?

321
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,960
Check the schedule.

322
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,720
You can ask me for that.
Need to see for yourself?

323
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,640
Yes, I must.

324
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,560
Here, I'm done.

325
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,280
What?

326
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,520
You deleted your
friends-with-benefits list?!

327
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,800
Even appointments schedule!
How will I manage your time?!

328
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,320
Didn't you say I was heartless last night?

329
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,440
I did, but how's that related to this?

330
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,400
Don't manage it.

331
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,280
I wont meet with those people from now on.

332
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,800
Except for Kim.

333
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,560
Yes.

334
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
Hello, Mr. Pat.

335
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,080
Hello, Mr. Kim.

336
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,080
Are you free today?
Mr. Elyes invites you for a meal.

337
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,480
Of course, I'm always free for him.

338
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,320
Are you okay? Your
voice doesn't sound good.

339
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,520
I'm fine.

340
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,080
I'll reserve the hotel room for you.

341
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,120
Yes.

342
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,280
Have a great day.

343
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,360
(Mr. Vet (HR))

344
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,960
Going with me?

345
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,240
No, I'm heading back for something.

346
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,040
Something?

347
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,920
Who will drive for me if you go?

348
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Don't worry.

349
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,920
You may enjoy your drink.

350
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,400
Someone will pick you up.

351
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,880
Who's that?

352
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Mr. Pat!

353
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,200
Good evening, boss.

354
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,480
Don't call me boss!
Didn't Pat tell you that?

355
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Elyes.

356
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,000
Please take care of him.
I sent you Mr. Elyes' house location.

357
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,560
Yes, Mr. Pat. See you on Monday.

358
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,320
Goodbye, Mr. Elyes.

359
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,720
Pat, wait!

360
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
Mr. Elyes!

361
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,840
Shall we get inside?

362
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,640
It seems you lost focus today.

363
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,000
Should we do this later?

364
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,200
Yeah.

365
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,040
Is there something wrong? You can tell me.

366
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,600
There is, but that's okay.

367
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,360
Did you see Run and Pat overlap again?

368
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,760
I should head back.

369
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,440
I'll tell Pat to connect us again.

370
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Wait.

371
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,040
Don't you want to stay?

372
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,320
We don't have to be here

373
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,280
if it's only about work.

374
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,760
I'm tired.

375
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,960
See you soon.

376
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,440
Give me a car key.

377
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,360
I'll drive myself.

378
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:53,240
I can't. You drank alcohol.
Mr. Pat will tell me off if I let you.

379
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,360
Call Pat to drive for me!

380
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,200
Did I upset you, Mr. Elyes?

381
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,920
I don't like it when you're being Pat.

382
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,800
Know this,

383
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,840
no one can replace Pat.

384
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,600
I can't contact Mr. Pat.

385
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,600
Switch off your phone from me?!

386
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,040
Mr. Pat.

387
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,936
(Next Episode)

388
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,640
You quit your job. I
want you to work for me.

389
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,640
I know you, Mr. Fei Long.

390
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,280
But I don't like people who
solve problems with money.

391
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,240
Is a 200,000-baht salary good enough?

392
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,840
Where are you going?

393
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,320
Call me when you're ready.

394
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,280
Hey, what are you doing, Mr. Elyes?!

395
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,440
Thank you for being worried about me.

396
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,440
Being worried about
you is what I do every day.

397
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,240
I'll let you decide again.

398
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,000
I won't lose you.
