"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 12)

2
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,160
(Previously) I proposed a budget
equal to his. Why don't you choose me?

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,160
About Fei Long,

4
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,880
you may not be lucky like today.

5
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,560
I've prepared everything.

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,760
What you do makes you too
worthless to compare with Elyes!

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,680
Fei Long makes me broke.

8
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,640
I want my money back and take
revenge for what he has done.

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,600
We'll rescue Mr. Run
now before they notice us.

10
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,720
Run before Fei Long's here.

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
Run's my friend.

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
I'll prove it.

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,920
I can tell you I don't have
feelings for Elyes anymore.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,960
I consider him my friend.

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,880
And I feel guilty for what I did to him.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,800
But…

17
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
It was soothing to be with Elyes,

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
but… it wasn't love.

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,560
I didn't love Elyes in the first place.

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,720
And…

21
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
who do you love?

22
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
I love…

23
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,880
Fei Long.

24
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,600
You're not your usual self.

25
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
Don't like it?

26
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,800
No, I'm just curious.

27
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,880
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,920
For what?

29
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
For everything.

30
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Being paranoid,

31
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,360
mean to you, and even threaten you.

32
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,120
I knew you were strange today.

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,440
If you really mean it, you must...

35
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,080
I won't harm Elyes again.

36
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,720
Others too.

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,440
I know you don't like it.

38
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Okay?

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,760
I forgive you.

40
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,520
For using force on you,

41
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,960
I'm not sorry.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,760
Because I know you like it.

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Ah…

44
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

45
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,160
Here's the hospital.

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,320
Just change the vibe.

47
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,160
I love you, Run.

48
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,720
Sorry for not saying so sooner.

49
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,760
I love you so much.

50
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,160
And I know you feel the same.

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,800
Blood pressure measurement.

52
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,720
What is it?

53
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,920
Someone found Mr. Teeranai's body.

54
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,560
Yup.

55
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,280
Was it…

56
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Obvious enough.

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,080
If it wasn't Fei Long, who would it be?

58
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
What will you do next?

59
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,680
Teeranai hurt lots of people.

60
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,280
If it wasn't Fei Long,
someone would kill him anyway.

61
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,760
I feel sorry for him.

62
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,400
So unfortunate.

63
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,080
You're too kind.

64
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,000
Teeranai planned to hurt you.

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,520
You were lucky it wasn't serious.

66
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,760
Or else,

67
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
you could die.

68
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,320
I was upset with him but didn't hate him.

69
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,880
I still feel sorry for him.

70
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,760
Have you hated anyone before?

71
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,920
I've never despised anyone.

72
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
And…

73
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
What about love?

74
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Say it.

75
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,120
Have you ever loved someone?

76
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,680
I don't...

77
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
It was fine if you didn't.

78
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
But now,

79
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,600
you must love only me.

80
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,680
I had a meeting.

81
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,880
This year is more profitable and
the business will expand in Vietnam.

82
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,960
Everything went smoothly.

83
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,800
Is that what you came for me for?

84
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,960
I want to be by your
side with the good news.

85
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,440
Did you drink? I can smell it.

86
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,360
A bit.

87
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
It doesn't matter.

88
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,320
What matters is…

89
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,280
I love you, Elyes.

90
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,280
Kim,

91
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,080
haven't we talked about this?

92
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,560
I really love you.

93
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Why must I always be friends with benefits?

94
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,720
Kim…

95
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,080
I...

96
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,240
Are you sure you'll work here?

97
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,720
I want a stable life, Mr. Pat!

98
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,280
An interior freelancer's income
is uncertain. It's hard to set a life plan.

99
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,040
Working with Mr. Elyes is no different.

100
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,640
I don't think you'll quit.

101
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,280
I can now.

102
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,280
I've been living with an
impossible love long enough.

103
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
Take care of Mr. Elyes for me.

104
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,600
Worried about him?

105
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,120
He's a long-time co-worker.

106
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,840
Take it easy.

107
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,360
Do your remaining work.

108
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,240
Then finish packing things up.

109
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,520
Let's go.

110
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,880
Why did you sneak back home?

111
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,080
To prepare for work.

112
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,800
For work or for quitting?

113
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,640
We'll discuss this while
packing your things at my house.

114
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,040
I did that.

115
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,000
Upset because of me?

116
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,120
Do I have a right to do that?

117
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Yes.

118
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Pardon me?!

119
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,320
The problem is this spot?

120
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,080
Yes.

121
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,440
It doesn't seem to have a problem.

122
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,120
It does because Mr. Teeranai
used all the budget to repair...

123
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
All the budget?!

124
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,880
Yes, our interior design
budget has almost run out.

125
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,200
How's the progress?

126
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,960
We've done about 60% of the work.

127
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,320
There's 40% more. What
should we do, Mr. Elyes?

128
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
As a new interior designer, can you do it?

129
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,600
Yes, I can.

130
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,920
- Don't let me down.
- I won't.

131
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,840
From now on, Vexter will supervise
and manage the construction budget.

132
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,520
Talk to him directly.

133
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,120
Yes, Mr. Elyes.

134
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,320
When will the materials come?

135
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,560
Okay. Thank you.

136
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,600
I'll contact our former suppliers.

137
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,200
Some of them may give us
good credit or special prices.

138
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,480
- I'm counting on you.
- Yes.

139
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
By the way,

140
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,040
you didn't answer me. What did I upset you?

141
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,000
I already answered you that
I have no right to be upset.

142
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,600
I can go home myself if
you don't open the car door.

143
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,880
(Elyes: Won't you sleep over at my house?)

144
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,240
(Pat: I'll be there tomorrow.)

145
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,640
I really love you.

146
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,920
Why must I always be friends with benefits?

147
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,680
Kim…

148
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,080
I...

149
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,880
(Pat: I'll be there tomorrow.)

150
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,760
Won't you answer anything?

151
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,000
Thank you.

152
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Mr. Elyes,

153
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,880
the supplier I talked
with yesterday agreed.

154
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,640
Really?

155
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,880
Are you free this evening?

156
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,400
Have dinner with me.

157
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Thank you.

158
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,760
I'd be in trouble without you.

159
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,840
You can live without me. Trust me.

160
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,480
Just tell me what upset you.

161
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,320
I…

162
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,840
I'm tired. It's nothing.

163
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,840
Want to have a dessert at
my house to refresh yourself?

164
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,440
I won't fall for that.

165
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,200
You knew it.

166
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,640
If I go to your house,
it must be exhausting.

167
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,960
Just come.

168
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,680
Let me get tired instead.

169
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,720
You upset because Kim visited me?

170
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,840
Yes.

171
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,280
I'm not upset. Just…

172
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,200
What do you think happened to me and him?

173
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,400
I don't know.

174
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
I settled with him.

175
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,440
Kim.

176
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,240
You know that between us is impossible.

177
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,480
Why?

178
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,200
I already have the one I want to live with.

179
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,640
So, we stop being friends
with benefits from now on.

180
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,000
Stop?

181
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,840
Let's be friends like what we used to be.

182
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,680
You didn't lie, right?

183
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,440
Want me to prove it?

184
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,080
Is this the way you prove yourself?

185
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,400
No.

186
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,000
It's what comes after.

187
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,160
Coming after?

188
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,880
I'll do this every day with you

189
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,080
to prove I have no
stamina to sleep with others.

190
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,400
But you'll exhaust me instead.

191
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,120
That's your problem.

192
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,560
You wanted me to prove, didn't you?

193
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,040
So, sweat for it.

194
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,400
Answer it later.

195
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,240
Hello?

196
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,160
I don't care what your problem is!

197
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,080
Give me some time to fix it.

198
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,600
Didn't you hear what I said?

199
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,360
I said, “I Don't Care!” Understand?

200
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,520
Right. We'll do our best
to finish the project on time.

201
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,400
Don't disappoint me for
choosing your company, Mr. Elyes.

202
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,280
Please excuse me.

203
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,880
New interior designer?

204
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,960
Can we count on you?

205
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,800
Of course.

206
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,520
I listed materials in new prices,
but the quality is as good as before.

207
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,720
What are the sources?

208
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,040
As a freelancer, I must have good connections
and know how to control the budget.

209
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,560
Also, I must find a way to increase employers'
profit without lowering the work's quality.

210
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,960
I envy Elyes for having you work for him.

211
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,040
Who would've thought that the
supplier suddenly canceled our deal.

212
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,240
Then, we must take the loss.

213
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,840
Did you see the figures?

214
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,000
I did. And I know how serious it is.

215
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,000
The stakeholders won't accept it.

216
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,560
Do we have other options?

217
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,280
I know your problems.

218
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
How do you know?

219
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,320
You said like we've never worked together.

220
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,000
You know that I'm
always willing to help you.

221
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,560
Do you have a solution?

222
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,880
I do.

223
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,240
I wondered why you didn't call me.

224
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
I get it now.

225
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,400
Mr. Pat.

226
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,960
Yes?

227
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,320
Do you still doubt about me and Elyes?

228
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,240
If so, you can rest assured.

229
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
There's nothing between me and him anymore.

230
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,840
We are just friends.

231
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,640
Yes.

232
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,080
I solved one of your
problems. Let's discuss work.

233
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,720
Thank you for being our
project's new supplier.

234
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,080
You can call me anytime.

235
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,120
A friend like me is always there for you.

236
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,120
- Mr. Pat.
- Hello.

237
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,000
Sorry for making you
uncomfortable for some time.

238
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,840
You don't need to. I over thought it.

239
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,480
You don't need to overthink anymore.

240
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,480
I'll try.

241
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
Are you certain about him?

242
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,560
It's Pat. Are you certain about him?

243
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,320
Quite clear.

244
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,080
“Quite” clear? Haven't you
confessed you love him?

245
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,640
Yes.

246
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,080
What are you waiting for?

247
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,720
You know I'm not good at this.

248
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,840
If your feelings are certain,
make what he feels certain too.

249
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,200
People with uncertain
relationships aren't happy.

250
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,760
Trust me.

251
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,480
Thanks.

252
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,240
If your feelings are certain,
make what he feels certain too.

253
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,720
People with uncertain
relationships aren't happy.

254
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,160
Trust me.

255
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,360
What are you doing?

256
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,240
Molesting me while I sleep?

257
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
Who started this?

258
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,680
Didn't you kiss me first?

259
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,320
Okay, I did it.

260
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
I'll do it again.

261
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,320
Please enough.

262
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
I'm still tired.

263
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,080
Pat.

264
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,640
Yes?

265
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,200
Can you accompany me tomorrow?

266
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,640
To where?

267
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,000
Can you stop complaining
about why I brought you here?

268
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,680
We've come this far…

269
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,840
for ice cream?

270
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,440
You're weird.

271
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,800
Isn't it tasty?

272
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,880
Yes, it is.

273
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,640
But I wonder why you
bring me all the way here?

274
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,720
Haven't we gone to places together?

275
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,160
But we went to work.

276
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,880
It's different. Or is it?

277
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,440
For me…

278
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,240
whether we work or
hang out, it's always good…

279
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,400
to have your company.

280
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,600
You said… about the important work.

281
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,520
You mean this?

282
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,000
This is not all.

283
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,960
We've eaten all day. Now, it's dinner?

284
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,680
Not to eat.

285
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,960
Then, why?

286
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,240
I'm afraid you'll think if
you deserve me or not.

287
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,960
So, I brought you here.

288
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,560
Well…

289
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,080
Pat, I don't care about who deserves who.

290
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,480
The one I want to be with…

291
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,960
is only you.

292
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
The day I succeed,

293
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,760
I want to be with you.

294
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,520
The day I fail,

295
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,200
I also want to be with you.

296
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,040
I want you in my daily life.

297
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,640
So,

298
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,280
from now on…

299
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,640
Let us be together every day.

300
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,440
Be my lover.

301
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,440
Yes.

302
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,160
For both of us.

303
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,360
“I love you.”
