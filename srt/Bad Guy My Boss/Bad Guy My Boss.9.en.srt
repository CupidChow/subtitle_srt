"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 9)

2
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Do you love that Mr. Elyes?

3
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,960
Yes.

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
No, Mr. Elyes!

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,840
I said no!

6
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,040
A boss shouldn't molest a subordinate.

7
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,960
Fine. Okay.

8
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,000
Didn't you warn me about my assistant?
How come it's about Mr. Teeranai now?

10
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,240
Because your assistant is his partner.

11
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
Thought it was the same password.

12
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
Day.

13
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,600
Month.

14
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,120
Year.

15
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,320
Gosh!

16
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,520
Try every number, then.

17
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,960
Damn it!

18
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,040
It's you! You almost
gave me a heart attack!

19
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
Can't access it?

20
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Yeah, it isn't Pat's password, birth
date, and ID card.

21
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,640
I must make him reveal it.

22
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Will he do it?

23
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
Pat's an idiot.

24
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
Give him excuses and he believes them.

25
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,240
I must reward you…

26
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
for your dedication.

27
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,240
Right here?

28
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,440
We can try using this room
before this building belongs to us.

29
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
What do you say?

30
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,760
Mr. Pat! Wait for me!

31
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,520
Good. I won't go up alone.

32
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,720
Why?

33
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,720
I…

34
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,600
Good morning, Mr. Elyes!

35
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,120
Order my usual coffee.

36
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,400
Right away.

37
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,800
Why did you two fight?

38
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Dunno and don't care to talk with him.

39
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,680
It's like he has bipolar.

40
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,160
Let's go.

41
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,040
Oh, what's wrong? Something happened?

42
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
It's Mr. Elyes.

43
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,520
Frustrated by a delayed computer.
Ordered me to update it after work.

44
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,080
But he wouldn't tell me the password.

45
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,760
Said, “How come you don't know?”

46
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,360
I see. He said himself not to
let anyone touch his computer.

47
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,680
Don't worry. I'll send it to you.

48
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,040
Thank you.

49
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
There you go.

50
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,400
By the way,

51
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,800
don't tell anyone about this.
Mr. Elyes is protective over his stuff.

52
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes.

53
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,160
I can do it.

54
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,360
Check the materials' prices from this site

55
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
before off-work time.

56
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,520
The site is too far. I won't make it.

57
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,800
Inventory checks take time.

58
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
This is break time. You'll get
the result tomorrow morning.

59
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
But I want it now.

60
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
Then why didn't you order me yesterday?

61
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,280
Disobey me?

62
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,360
I'll go.

63
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
It's okay.

64
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,880
This is “break time.”

65
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,960
It's alright.

66
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,400
He doesn't mind.

67
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,840
You must be dedicated to working with me.

68
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,240
Get it done.

69
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,280
Yes.

70
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,680
You shouldn't spoil him.

71
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
Come on. I'll do all the
work in your place one day.

72
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm going.

73
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,240
I'll walk with you to the front door.

74
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Mr. Elyes.

75
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,000
Thiti.

76
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,440
Your assigned work is done.

77
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,520
You work better than I expected.
I must reconsider you again.

78
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,600
Thank you.

79
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
I'll read all the details tonight.

80
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,280
Yes.

81
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
I'll drive for you.

82
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,800
It's okay.

83
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,320
Learn your job from Pat well.

84
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,440
Tell me when you can work in Pat's stead.

85
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,320
So, he can finally quit his job.

86
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you sure?

87
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
He has worked for you for a long time.

88
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Too long that he thinks
I need to depend on him.

89
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,040
I'm going.

90
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,920
Yes.

91
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,800
I've done it.

92
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,560
See you at the car park.

93
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,320
Mr. Teeranai.

94
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
Not going together?

95
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
You should go. I haven't
packed my stuff yet.

96
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,360
I came to give this to you quickly.

97
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,040
All the information from Elyes' computer.

98
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,240
That was a deposit.
The rest is at the condo.

99
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
See you.

100
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
Mr. Elyes? Pat? When… did you two come?

101
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,840
Want to confess anything to us?

102
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,000
What are you talking about?

103
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,600
I trusted you. Thought we were friends.

104
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,520
I never thought you could betray me.

105
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,160
Of course not. I didn't
do anything, trust me.

106
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,080
Be quiet.

107
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,520
I don't want to feel more
disappointed with you.

108
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,680
I didn't believe what people
said, so I proved it myself.

109
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,920
Why doesn't he answer?

110
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,480
The house lights are on.

111
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,280
What's the point?

112
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
Why didn't you answer?

113
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,200
Don't want to talk with and
hear a man who returns to his ex.

114
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,560
What are you talking about?

115
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,840
You're being childish.

116
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,120
What do you mean?

117
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,480
I didn't go back to Paeng. Satisfied?

118
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,280
There's something more important.

119
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,480
What?

120
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,840
Thiti and Mr. Teeranai are together.

121
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,880
He intends to spy on my secrets!

122
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,520
Where are you going?

123
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
Take action!

124
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,360
Calm down. It's no use without evidence.

125
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,960
You're right.

126
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,040
We must catch them red-handed.

127
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,160
Do you have a plan?

128
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,960
You shouldn't agree with
that self-centered man!

129
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,400
It's okay.

130
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
Does the car come?

131
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,760
Almost.

132
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,680
You can go home if I'm late.

133
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,000
Are you sure?

134
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,400
It's fine. I must work
in your stead one day.

135
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,960
Here it comes.

136
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,440
Safe travel.

137
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,440
(Surveillance Camera)

138
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,480
Yes. You may check on the app.

139
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,080
How is it?

140
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,800
Crisp image and sound. Thank you.

141
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,120
We only need the fish to take the bait.

142
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,840
Let's get the thief.

143
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,560
Yes.

144
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,320
Crisp image and sound. Any excuse?

145
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,640
Let me go!

146
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,120
You're fired from now on.

147
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,240
If you don't want to be in jail,
confess that Teeranai hired you.

148
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,920
I only do this by myself!

149
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,480
Hope you're still this resolute.

150
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,400
You'll know the culprit won't save
you when you mess up his plan.

151
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,680
If you're still alive, of course.

152
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,400
What do you mean?!

153
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,520
Do you think you'd get the information
from Mr. Elyes' computer with my password?

154
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,640
What you got were viruses.

155
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,240
What are you doing?!

156
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,320
Let go!

157
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,760
Talked with Mr. JC personally?

158
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,600
You two are such…

159
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,880
(Thiti) See you tomorrow.

160
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
What's your plan?!

161
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,920
I'll give it back after everything's done.

162
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,160
You must stay in the
storage room in exchange for…

163
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,320
not being sent to the police.

164
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,680
Take him away.

165
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,560
Let me go, damn you!

166
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,600
Can't wait for tomorrow.

167
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,920
Thank you for your time to see me.

168
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,800
From what I know,
you're Mr. Elyes' relative.

169
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,840
Is it wise to come to my company?

170
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,360
No problem.

171
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,720
Your hotel project needs

172
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,960
the most prepared contractor.

173
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,120
Consider me as another option.

174
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,200
You're smart.

175
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,720
Whether I choose Mr. Elyes or Mr. Fei Long,

176
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
you're the one who gets the benefit.

177
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,120
I want you to choose
Mr. Fei Long, if possible.

178
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,840
Why?

179
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,440
Because I think Mr. Fei
Long suits your needs.

180
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,800
I'll consider it.

181
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,640
I'll contact you later.

182
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,320
If you'll excuse me, I
have another appointment.

183
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,880
Thank you. I'll take my leave.

184
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
Is his voice clear?

185
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,840
Thank you for the help.

186
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,320
Don't mention it.

187
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Benefits are important for businesses,

188
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,880
but sincerity and integrity
are far more important.

189
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm sorry… for not listening to you.

190
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,800
Even better. I can finally sack him.

191
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,400
So, do we let Thiti go?

192
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,800
Yes.

193
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,680
Please leave.

194
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,160
Mr. Fei Long's computer got viruses
because of you. You failed an easy task.

195
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,480
Apologize to him for me. I don't know why.

196
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,440
He only gives you a chance. Do you understand?

197
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,600
Damn you, Elyes.

198
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,680
You'd better go to Teeranai.

199
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,600
What did you do to him?!

200
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,880
I'd send you to the
police if it wasn't for Pat.

201
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,080
Get lost and never set foot here again!

202
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,480
Announce the staff about
the dangerous person.

203
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,080
How do you feel after
getting rid of a traitor?

204
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm fine, but not sure about you.

205
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Didn't you see how resent he was?
If I wasn't got in his way, he'd hurt you.

206
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,160
Better watch out next time.

207
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Yes, I'll be careful.

208
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,160
We can unmask the culprit because of you.

209
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,320
Want a reward?

210
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,880
No,

211
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,280
it's my duty.

212
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,720
The one who revealed the culprit is Paeng.

213
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
I only told you.

214
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,720
She wouldn't have told
you if you weren't her ex?

215
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,680
Childish.

216
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,000
Who did you call that?

217
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
You.

218
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,360
There are two of us here.

219
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,400
Only children talk about the same problems.

220
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,880
I'm not wrong and won't apologize to you.

221
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,160
Okay.

222
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,120
Back to the topic.

223
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,680
Though you don't want
a reward, I still give it to you.

224
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,760
Well, then.

225
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,160
A meal is enough.

226
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,320
Agree.

227
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,360
But I must choose a place.

228
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,800
It's hot out here. Let's get inside.

229
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,920
Why this one?

230
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
You can be frank.

231
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,720
Whenever I go with you, you always

232
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,560
choose luxury restaurants or hotels.

233
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,200
Try the food from these vendors.

234
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,000
I wonder if you can eat it.

235
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,200
Of course, I can.

236
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,480
Here's your dish.

237
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,240
Enjoy.

238
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,800
Try it. See if you like it or not.

239
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,040
I'll eat.

240
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,440
It's good.

241
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,400
Told you. Let's dig in.

242
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,320
Here.

243
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,280
This one's good too.

244
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,080
So tasty!

245
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,400
Everything's great.

246
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
But…

247
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,880
they're too spicy.

248
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,840
Hey!

249
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,000
Come on. Always taking advantage of me.

250
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,360
You said the food is spicy,
but you finished it all.

251
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,920
How do you like it?

252
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,840
How do you like it?

253
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,760
Are you implying that I like the food…

254
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,280
or the one who invited me here?

255
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,840
The food's too spicy for you.

256
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,280
Can you… handle the man who invited you?

257
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,960
Hey.

258
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,240
Are you hurt? I'm…

259
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,960
Of course, I am!

260
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,040
Try getting punched yourself!

261
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm sorry. I didn't know Pat observed me.

262
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
That was his doing?!

263
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,880
Yes.

264
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,160
And you were tricked.

265
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,600
Lousy!

266
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,840
Don't say it like that.

267
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,520
I did everything because
I love you. You know it!

268
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,760
Then prove it to me you can get rid of Pat!

269
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,640
Without him…

270
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,440
Elyes can't do a thing.

271
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,720
I'll dress your wound.

272
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,640
Leave me.

273
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,240
Go away.

274
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
And if…

275
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,000
you fail again,

276
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,120
don't come to see me again!

277
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,040
Scram!

278
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,240
Will… you use the toilet first?

279
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,920
Use the toilet or have a shower together?

280
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,640
Use the toilet.

281
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,240
Because you drank a lot of
water, let it go in the toilet here.

282
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,320
Still, depends on you.

283
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,120
You don't have to.

284
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,800
I will.

285
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,320
I just teased you.

286
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
But…

287
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,280
it'll take some time.

288
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,200
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

289
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
You said it.

290
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,040
Then prove it to me you can get rid of Pat!

291
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,920
Without him…

292
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,880
Elyes can't do a thing.

293
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,720
Damn you, Pat!

294
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,840
Thanks for everything today.

295
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,160
Yes.

296
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,000
I thought about dealing with Thiti

297
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
and forgot about Paeng's story.

298
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,520
What about it?

299
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,200
I told you everything.

300
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,680
I want to hear it again... clearly.

301
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,200
Tell me.

302
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,960
She wanted to be with me again,

303
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,240
but I denied her

304
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,480
because I have someone I love.

305
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,000
Do you love that Mr. Elyes?

306
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,360
Yes.

307
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,040
I love him so much.

308
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,960
I came for you today to tell
you I can't love you like before.

309
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,480
But we can still be friends.

310
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,000
I don't want that.

311
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,880
Pat,

312
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,360
please be with me again.

313
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,920
I'm sorry.

314
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,480
I don't have feelings for you anymore.

315
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,640
But you love someone
who's not clear to you?

316
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,640
Can you remember how he
introduced himself when I first met him?

317
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,600
He said he's your boss, not lover.

318
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,360
If he was serious about you,

319
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,920
he'd think of you like one.

320
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,160
But not at all!

321
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,560
Really okay with that?

322
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,000
What's wrong?

323
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,280
Want to take a bath first?

324
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,480
No.

325
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,040
What's the matter?

326
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,760
What…

327
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,040
am I to you?

328
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,640
Do we need to talk about this now?

329
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,760
You don't or can't answer that?

330
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,320
Am I like Mr. Kim?

331
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,080
How's he involved in this?

332
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
It is.

333
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,400
You see me like Mr. Kim.

334
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,120
Want to know the answer? I'll tell you.

335
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,520
You're not the same as Kim.

336
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,600
Satisfied?

337
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,920
What am I to you?

338
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
You're…

339
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,120
I'm more inferior than Mr. Kim.

340
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,080
He's your thinking and...

341
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,960
sleeping partner,

342
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,040
but he's still your friend with benefits.

343
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,000
It's obvious to see what I am.

344
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,560
Why are you pressing me?!

345
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,840
Because I want it to be clear!

346
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:06,320
I'll work with you until
Mr. JC's project is over.

347
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,280
Pat.

348
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,680
What's the matter?

349
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,400
I can't be like this anymore.

350
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,040
I love you.

351
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,400
I love you so much.

352
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,600
But I have my dignity.

353
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,120
Pat.

354
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,000
Please leave.

355
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,640
Please.

356
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,760
(Next Episode)
Pat!

357
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,240
Watch out!

358
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,760
I want you to find the reason
why the scaffold collapsed.

359
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,400
It may be an accident...

360
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,000
My man is fatally wounded!

361
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,560
What's this?!

362
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,560
You said you don't want to move
to my place, so I'll stay here with you.

363
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,920
Who's not a kid? Have another spoon.

364
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,160
That person hurt you.
I won't let that slide.

365
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,480
You gave me an urgent call.

366
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,400
Need someone killed, Mr. Elyes?
