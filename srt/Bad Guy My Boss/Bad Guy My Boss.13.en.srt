"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Special Episode)

2
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,280
Oh!

3
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,480
Mr. Elyes.

4
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
Let me put my coat down.

5
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,320
Come on.

6
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
What are you doing?

7
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,000
Punishing you for
humiliating me in the meeting.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,400
You didn't pay attention there.
You can't blame me.

9
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,920
Well,

10
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,760
you were more interesting.

11
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Hey.

12
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
Wait.

13
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,960
Are you going to do it
now? I'm still sweaty.

14
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,240
Let's have dinner first. I'm hungry.

15
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,680
I want to eat you first

16
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,200
before eating food.

17
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,320
But…

18
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,480
Can I do it, please?

19
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,160
Woah! Mr. Elyes!

20
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,120
What are you doing?!

21
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,000
I lost focus for a while.

22
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,680
This can't be “a while.”

23
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,200
I think…

24
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,040
we must eat instant noodles instead.

25
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm done, Mr. Elyes.

26
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Please let me cook next time.

27
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,040
I really lost focus for a while.

28
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,160
You said you were hungry
while I was eating you,

29
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,080
so I hurriedly cooked for you.

30
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,560
Thank you.

31
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,240
But let me cook next time.

32
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,280
Let's eat.

33
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,680
Want another round?

34
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,080
Much obliged.

35
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,280
Lewd.

36
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,320
I mean this.

37
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,480
You must be tired.

38
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Have a big bite.

39
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Ahh.

40
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,360
Here comes a train. Choo choo.

41
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm not a kid.

42
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,040
You called me a kid.

43
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,040
Let me feed you next.

44
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,640
That was unexpected.

45
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Wanna eat more?

46
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
I'll eat it myself.

47
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
Or I don't eat at all.

48
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,640
Won't you go out?

49
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,160
It's okay to have a bath together.

50
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,760
I'm not used to this.

51
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,680
You'll be.

52
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,160
Your beard's coming in.

53
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll shave it for you.

54
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,600
You too!

55
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,160
Hold still.

56
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,520
Done.

57
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,680
Okay. Now, it's my turn.

58
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,520
But you must close your eyes.

59
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,280
Okay.

60
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
Done.

61
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,400
Did you tease me?!

62
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
Did you tease me?!

63
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm helping you shave.

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,480
Come here!

65
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
Don't smear the cream!

66
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
- Take that!
- No!

67
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,480
Did you tease me?!

68
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The cream is all over me.

69
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,560
Mr. Elyes.

70
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,200
Please enough.

71
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,960
Mr. Elyes.

72
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,480
Enough.

73
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,760
Please enough, Mr. Elyes.

74
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,880
Just a little.

75
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,800
It's fine.

76
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
Mr. Elyes.

77
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Come on, please calm yourself.

78
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,320
Someone may see us.

79
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
Let's work.

80
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,160
We'll continue at my house tonight.

81
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,200
You said it.

82
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,880
This kiss is a deposit.

83
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,920
Wait.

84
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,280
Yes?

85
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,600
I'll drive for you.

86
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,320
You should let me drive.

87
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,400
Come on. Let me.

88
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,880
Hurry.

89
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,680
Get in.

90
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,720
Yes.

91
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
Coffee.

92
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,120
Thank you.

93
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Could you tell me why we're here?

94
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,720
Yup.

95
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,360
Don't “yup” me.

96
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,480
Tell me why.

97
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,560
For a vacation.

98
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,560
Vacation?

99
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,480
Isn't that too sudden?

100
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,800
You're always afraid I'm late for work,

101
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
so I have a day off.

102
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,200
Come on, be serious.

103
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,880
Yes, I am.

104
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,800
We didn't pack our clothes.

105
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,360
For this trip,

106
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,800
clothes aren't needed.

107
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
Should we change the
way we call each other?

108
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,120
What do you have in mind?

109
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,640
First of all,

110
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,000
don't be too polite.

111
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
I'm used to talking this way.

112
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,920
That's a big no.

113
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,200
Okay.

114
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
What should it be?

115
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,000
What do lovers call each other?

116
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,960
Honey.

117
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,480
That's awkward.

118
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,360
Fluffy, baby, babe, cutie,

119
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,200
- teddy bear.
- Enough. We'll think about that later.

120
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
Okay,

121
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,880
darling.

122
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,360
That would do, right?

123
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,880
Let's get in the car, darling.

124
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,600
Where is he?

125
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,080
Pat.

126
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh, Mr. Elyes.

127
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,560
I bought this for you.
I wanted this yesterday.

128
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,840
Can you still remember?
You didn't seem to care.

129
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,560
I always care about you,
but not obviously show it.

130
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,480
Why?

131
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Bad timing, clients, or work.

132
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
I recorded what you need and dealt with it.

133
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,480
You rubbed me with your
leg while having a meeting.

134
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,600
I wanted to tease you.

135
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,160
Come.

136
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,800
We've come to the beach.

137
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,840
Do you think I let you
only sleep in your room?

138
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,760
Should we put our things in our room?

139
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,440
We don't bring anything.

140
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,960
But we should...

141
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,280
Woah.

142
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,960
Want to change your glasses?

143
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,280
Come on. Try.

144
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
It suits you.

145
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
You laughed.

146
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,480
It looks good on you.

147
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,320
Let's check over there.

148
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
Let's go.

149
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
Thank you.

150
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,840
Here.

151
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,160
Thank you.

152
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,680
Mr. Elyes.

153
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,560
Yes?

154
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,640
Look over there.

155
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,520
Let's jam with her.

156
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,040
Huh?

157
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,600
- Let's go.
- Now?

158
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,200
Yes.

159
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,320
Come.

160
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
- Shall we jam with her?
- No.

161
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,920
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

162
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,080
Excuse me.

163
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,680
I don't want to do it.

164
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,120
Let's do it.

165
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,760
Pat.

166
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,280
Don't.

167
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,560
Come.

168
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,800
Excuse me, can we jam a song with you?

169
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,520
- Let's do it.
- No.

170
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,400
You ate a lot.

171
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,760
I'm stuffed.

172
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,920
Of course, you are.

173
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,280
I couldn't finish mine,
but you insisted on having it.

174
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,400
That would be a waste. There are
lots of starving people out there.

175
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,680
What a good man.

176
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Want to go somewhere else?

177
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,240
To the beach.

178
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,600
We've come here, so we need to go.

179
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,200
Alright. Which beach?

180
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,040
What are you doing?

181
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,720
Chonnatee posted a beach photo.

182
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,280
This is the one.

183
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,560
Wow, that's far.

184
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,440
Okay, I'll find other beaches.

185
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
It's okay.

186
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,240
If you want, let's go there.

187
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,000
You said it's far.

188
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,160
I just complained.
It matters if you want to go or not.

189
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,320
I want to.

190
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,120
Then let's go.

191
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,600
After you.

192
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,800
We're strolling around here.
Don't you want to buy anything?

193
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,720
Nope,

194
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,480
the stuff is all the same.

195
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Come on, it's not the same.

196
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,680
Will you go back to the room?

197
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,120
You want to go?

198
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,320
I'm going.

199
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
You can walk around yourself.

200
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,480
Okay.

201
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm going back. Take care of it.

202
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,360
Surprise!

203
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
For which occasion?

204
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,120
I just want to do it for you.

205
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,640
That's why you wanted to come back.

206
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,400
There's a surprise.

207
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,760
Did you do something wrong?

208
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
Great.

209
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,240
I wanted to surprise my dear,

210
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,840
but he misunderstood me.

211
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,880
I was joking.

212
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,720
I know you love me.

213
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,720
Do you love me?

214
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,560
Of course, I do.

215
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,760
Who's that?

216
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,960
Elyes.

217
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,680
Didn't you say you loved me?

218
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,840
What did you say to him?

219
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,960
That was an appetizer.

220
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,400
This is the main course.

221
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,200
Stop overthinking.

222
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
Elyes wants to consult me.

223
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,920
Wait, wait.

224
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,280
Why? Don't like it?

225
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,400
I do,

226
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,280
but you weren't like this before.

227
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,040
I was surprised.

228
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,120
A punishment for making me worried.

229
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,120
Worried about what?

230
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,480
You were with another guy, but I don't.

231
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Because I love…

232
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,400
only you.

233
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,520
Because you're like this,

234
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
I can't stop myself.

235
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,480
This place is beautiful.

236
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,840
It's beautiful during the sunset,
but it's getting dark.

237
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,280
Don't you want to go back to the room?

238
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
We can lie around here.

239
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,080
Sleep here?

240
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I didn't say we slept here.

241
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,120
Don't even think about it.

242
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,800
People will see us.

243
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,280
No one will.

244
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,520
How do you know?

245
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:45,752
Your friend told me.

246
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,880
I want a place where no
one will bother me and Pat.

247
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,200
Can you help me, Mr. Chonnatee?

248
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,240
What?

249
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,400
Did you plan with Chonnatee?

250
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,160
That rascal.

251
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,960
Don't say a word.

252
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,520
I consulted with many people
before mustering the courage.

253
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,360
Will you marry me?

254
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,520
We'll kiss right here?

255
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,640
I love you.

256
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,400
I love you too,

257
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,680
dear bad guy my boss.
