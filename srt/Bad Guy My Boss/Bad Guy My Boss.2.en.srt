"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 2)

2
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,280
(Previously)
Isn't following my orders your job?

3
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,040
Could... I ask something from you?

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,080
You know I can't love anyone.

5
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,120
I just wonder about...

6
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,800
your feelings.

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,600
Don't worry. I don't feel a thing.

8
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,320
You lie. It shows on your face.
Are you free tonight?

9
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm not confident.

10
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,400
I don't know what to do next.

11
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,120
Sometimes, I feel like I want to quit.

12
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
Quit?!

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,560
Stay with me.

14
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,960
I plan to quit one day,

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,440
but not soon.

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,320
Don't worry.

17
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,080
I won't allow it.

18
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,280
Excuse me?

19
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,440
How long will you employ me?

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Forever.

21
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,520
Change your lipstick color? Looks nice.

22
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,840
Really? Thank you.

23
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,120
Get Patt to see me.

24
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,640
Patt has a day off today.

25
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,680
I haven't permitted it!

26
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,840
- What's the reason?!
- I really don't know.

27
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,120
Leave.

28
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
Yes.

29
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,720
Running away from me?

30
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,480
How did you know I came?

31
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,960
Security camera.

32
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,200
Why don't I see it?

33
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,320
I lied.

34
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,880
I know it's you, mannerlessly
pressing a doorbell repeatedly.

35
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,560
You dare call me mannerless?

36
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,360
No one thinks pressing a doorbell
repeatedly is something decent.

37
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
Please get to the point.

38
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,280
Are you upset because I took a day off?

39
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
You know me well.

40
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,560
I have a right to do so.

41
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,120
You can't...

42
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,480
Look at me like last night.

43
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,920
I look at you and feel nothing.

44
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,520
Are you sure about that?

45
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,720
Patt?

46
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,560
What's wrong? Why do you run from me?

47
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
No, I don't.

48
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,480
Is that so?

49
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,080
What's wrong? Tell me.

50
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,960
We're... the boss and employee.

51
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,760
Yes.

52
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,120
So what?

53
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Well...

54
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,560
You tried...

55
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,760
You're shy.

56
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
You feel the same,

57
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,600
but you refrain.

58
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,200
I don't feel a thing!

59
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,120
Stop kidding around!

60
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,840
I don't feel anything.

61
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,400
What you said has no meaning to me.

62
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,720
I need you to do two things. First,

63
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,000
I want some info about the Khao Kho project
from the actual place, not from reports.

64
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,640
Yes.

65
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,760
Second,

66
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
prepare a birthday present for Kim.

67
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,920
You know what he wants.

68
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
See it done.

69
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,400
But I have a day off!

70
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,120
I don't care.

71
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
Bring it to my house.

72
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,440
What the hell?

73
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,200
Doesn't even close the door.

74
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,840
Mr. Elis.

75
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,880
Mr. Elis.

76
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,920
Mr. Elis.

77
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,640
Mr. Elis.

78
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,240
You came to my place. Miss me?

79
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,480
We parted a few hours ago.
Missing me wouldn't be possible.

80
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
You're right. I don't have such a thought.

81
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,520
Mr. Kim's present

82
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,160
as you ordered.

83
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,920
I put it here.

84
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,360
You really find it?

85
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
I'm leaving.

86
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,560
Mr. Elis?

87
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,840
Please don't leave yet.

88
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,480
Well...

89
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
I...

90
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,720
I'm...

91
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
I'm...

92
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,760
hungry.

93
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Order something for me.

94
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,520
Excuse me, I have a day off.

95
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,520
Even if I work,

96
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,920
the work time is over.

97
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
I'll take my leave.

98
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
He could find it.

99
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,200
Yes, Mr. Elis?

100
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,480
I know the work time is over,
but can I ask you something?

101
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,120
When will you go to Khao Kho?

102
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,160
The day after tomorrow.

103
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,600
I'll go with you.

104
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,520
Huh?

105
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,920
That's all.

106
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,760
What's wrong with him?

107
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,720
You said it's urgent. What
do you need, Mr. Elis?

108
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,680
Where's Patt? Why can't I contact him?

109
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,200
He's meeting with a customer.

110
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Didn't you tell him there's a
meeting this afternoon?!

111
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:13,975
I did, but Patt told me to tell you
he will be there at the meeting.

112
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,680
He also said...

113
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,640
What?

114
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,480
"Mr. Phichet has the Ratchada project document.

115
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,280
At 10.30 AM, a housekeeper will brew
you light roast coffee. No milk and sugar.

116
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,640
At 12 PM, I'll order fried rice noodles with
chicken for you. Don't bother calling me."

117
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,280
Thanks.

118
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,600
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

119
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,440
Think you can get away from me?

120
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,800
I don't intend to do that!

121
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,160
It's nothing.

122
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,240
You can go.

123
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,080
Yes.

124
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Last year, around 38,000 tourists visited Khao Kho.

125
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,720
The tendency is increasing
because it's not far from Bangkok.

126
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,920
Either driving or taking a flight to
Phisanulok and traveling by bus.

127
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,840
Also, there are tourist sites,
such as Phu Thap Boek,

128
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,520
Wat Phra Thad Pha Son Kaew,

129
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,200
and Si Thep Historical Park,

130
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,760
a registered world heritage site.

131
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,120
These places can support both
domestic and international tourists.

132
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,240
Be specific!

133
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,375
Get to the point of this meeting.

134
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,800
The estimated budget for the resort
we're building is 500 million baht.

135
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,280
200 million.

136
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,040
That's all I can pay.

137
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,400
Everything's included.
Not only construction costs.

138
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,160
Mr. Elis, you should listen
to what Mr. Teeranai says.

139
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,920
No!

140
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,160
I don't believe we must invest this much.

141
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
Unless...

142
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,280
someone gets the benefit.

143
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,320
The meeting's dismissed.

144
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,880
You shouldn't do that to Mr. Teeranai.

145
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,560
Why?

146
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,520
He's your stakeholder and a relative.

147
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,240
I don't care about
relatives. Only benefits.

148
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,840
But he's one of the executives.

149
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,000
Who would work with you if
you humiliate people like this?

150
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,480
Worrying about me?

151
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,800
As a secretary, I must warn a boss.

152
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,480
I never humiliate anyone. You know it.

153
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:35,960
Except for him. He can quit, get only
dividends, and leave the administration behind.

154
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,240
Oh, I get it.

155
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,600
We'll go to Khao Kho
tomorrow. Have you prepared?

156
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
Yes, I have.

157
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,760
Tomorrow, I'll pick you up at 6 AM. It takes
around three hours. We may be there at noon.

158
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,640
After the survey, we'll
arrive home around 9 PM.

159
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,320
Reserve a room there.

160
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,280
Huh?

161
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Nice view. I love it.

162
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,720
Will you... spend a night there?

163
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,840
Why not?

164
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes, Kim?

165
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,520
I'm not free tomorrow.

166
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,840
I need to go to Khao Kho.

167
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,680
Fine.

168
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
I'll see you tomorrow if I have free time.

169
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Cancel the overnight stay?

170
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,840
Kim appoints Mr. Dennis.

171
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,080
Many estate companies
are in a critical state.

172
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,800
I need other business partners.

173
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,160
That's great. I can go
there alone without delay.

174
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,440
I'll go back to my work.

175
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,880
Go.

176
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,920
May I sit with you?

177
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,400
Please sit.

178
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,200
Here isn't the regular
place for executives.

179
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,680
What if I'm your friend?

180
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,720
Is there anything you need, Mr. Teeranai?

181
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,600
Mr. Patt. You're straight to the point.

182
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,280
I'll be frank.

183
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,120
May I accompany you to the Khao Kho project?

184
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,880
It's late. Not going home yet?

185
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,920
A few more issues to clear
before heading to Khao Kho.

186
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,800
I'll work with Mr. Patt at Khao Kho.
Let's postpone our appointment.

187
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,680
Patt is Mr. Elis' secretary.

188
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,400
That adorable man.

189
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,920
No, it's nothing. I just adore him.

190
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,360
Of course not.

191
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,680
Talk to you later.

192
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,520
Why do you go with him?!

193
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,160
Do you know?

194
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,400
I ask... Why do you go with him?!

195
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,600
Why can't I?

196
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,640
Mr. Teeranai knows this project more than anyone.
I'll get more information if he goes with me.

197
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,560
He's not a good guy.

198
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,120
He's your relative.

199
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,600
That's why I know him.

200
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,760
I can't cancel it. I promised him.

201
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,560
Going with him will benefit our work.

202
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,840
Vexter!

203
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
Sorry, I'm late.

204
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,560
So late! I almost went back.

205
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
Wanna eat something?

206
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,640
Anything that serves quickly.

207
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,640
I'm so tired and hungry.

208
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,360
Two milk cartons, then.

209
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,000
Gosh.

210
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,720
Fine. I'll find a place.

211
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,640
Let's go.

212
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,840
I work and have
ready-to-eat food every day.

213
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,720
It's been ages since
I went to a restaurant.

214
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,560
I miss the time I was
with you and Chonnatee.

215
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,080
Yeah, I miss you two too.
Getting a hold of both of you is hard.

216
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,920
Always busy as bees.

217
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,840
How's your work? Is it exhausting?
Chonnatee told me that.

218
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,800
It is.

219
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,480
It drains my body and mind.

220
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,880
Your face tells me you wanna quit.

221
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,080
I'll find you a new job.

222
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,320
Hey.

223
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,120
I know you have a bond with this place.
You've worked here for a long time.

224
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,160
But that Elis is... unbearable!

225
00:23:39,992 --> 00:23:42,672
I say this because I'm worried about you!

226
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,760
Have some time to think.

227
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,400
A happy hut is better than a gloomy castle.

228
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,040
That's a classic idiom!

229
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,080
Let's hang out.

230
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,560
Thanks, man.

231
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah, we're buddies.

232
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,840
You're right on time.

233
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,520
I can't be late if I go with you.

234
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,120
Let's go.

235
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,840
Give me a minute.

236
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,280
Hello.

237
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,240
What? Right now?

238
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,640
Okay, I'll go right away.

239
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,120
What happens?

240
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,600
Well... Mr. Elis requests the inspection of my
department and needs me to clarify his doubts.

241
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,480
I can't go with you.

242
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,920
No, it's fine. Please do what you must.

243
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,520
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

244
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,560
Drive safely, Mr. Teeranai.

245
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,760
Thank you.

246
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,720
Mr. Elis...

247
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,360
So? I don't care.

248
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,560
Won't Mr. Teeranai be mad at you?

249
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,800
Of course, he must be mad because of it.

250
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,000
Then why...

251
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
Do you think I care?

252
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,760
Not at all.

253
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,200
You know me.

254
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,280
Stop asking

255
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,080
and inspect thoroughly.

256
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,520
Yes, Mr. Elis.

257
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,080
Thank you, Kim. You're connection
makes everything go smoothly.

258
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,080
Don't be humble.

259
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
You know I'm a hothead.

260
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,320
I'm not good with negotiation.

261
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,240
Crystal?

262
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
Oh.

263
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
It's good you like the present.

264
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,920
I must go now.

265
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,440
Isn't that too quick? You went to
Khao Kho and came back to work.

266
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,880
I've sent you reports, photos, and my
comments about the project to your phone.

267
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,960
You can check them.

268
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,760
That's it?

269
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,320
I did everything you ordered and hope
you don't do such a thing as today again.

270
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,760
Watch your mouth, Patt.

271
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,960
Fire me, then.

272
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,720
I helped you by dealing with Teeranai.

273
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,520
Stop being an idiot.

274
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,760
You were upset that I
went with Mr. Teeranai.

275
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,280
Don't use me as an excuse.

276
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
I always thought you were smart.

277
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,920
Just knew I was wrong.

278
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,560
You can't distinguish who's good or bad.

279
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,480
I must be an idiot for thinking
you're kind and straightforward,

280
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,520
even though you're
hotheaded and self-centered.

281
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,080
Not only that,

282
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,880
I'm also sly,

283
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,720
vile,

284
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,880
and can be much worse if I want.

285
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,840
Do you think you can go?!

286
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Tell me what you want.

287
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,600
You tell me...

288
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,040
to do what I want.

289
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,960
Tell me what you want.

290
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Wanna know?

291
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,360
Tomorrow, you must...

292
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,480
He told you to serve him?!

293
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,800
Yes, Ms. Aeom.

294
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,880
Isn't that too much?
That's not the secretary's duty.

295
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,960
Who can go against Mr. Elis?

296
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,600
That's true.

297
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,960
Elis pays well and doesn't take advantage,

298
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,240
but he's hard to please and cranky.
Who would dare defy him?

299
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,400
And... he's also handsome.

300
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,200
Isn't he?

301
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,160
Ms. Aeom, I'll be back.

302
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,480
Okay.

303
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,120
Mr. Teeranai, may I sit with you?

304
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,880
Please do.

305
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,280
How are things?

306
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,000
Good. Everything's
settled. I never commit fraud.

307
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm exhausted, though.
I didn't sleep last night.

308
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,960
I'm sorry.

309
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,680
For what?

310
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,000
You didn't do anything.

311
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,040
Don't apologize.

312
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,640
I... must be a jinx. You were harassed
for going to Khao Kho with me.

313
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,760
Don't overthink. I wanted to go with
you to explain what you don't know.

314
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm serious about every project,

315
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,240
but Mr. Elis still doesn't trust me.

316
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,200
I wonder about that for some time.

317
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,960
Can you tell me why?

318
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,520
Originally, this company belonged to my family.

319
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,440
I'll give you a loan.

320
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,560
Really?

321
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,640
In exchange for 70% of the company's share.

322
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,160
Why don't you take over my company?

323
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,120
Can I?

324
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,600
Can it be less?

325
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,880
We're relatives.

326
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:28,760
Your idiotic management caused losses and debts
for company. Should I consider you a relative?!

327
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:42,480
My family helped you once,
but the company is still in the red!

328
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,080
I won't talk about it
again if you don't agree.

329
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,760
Leave.

330
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
Leave!

331
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,680
There was a financial issue when
we were expanding the business.

332
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,040
So, we invited Elis' parents to enter
a partnership as they are our relatives.

333
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,200
But later, they hold more shares.

334
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,240
That's why I am an underdog.

335
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,320
If that's the reason, there's no
point for Mr. Elis to harass you.

336
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,120
He's being paranoid if I
take the company back.

337
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,840
How am I supposed to do it?

338
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,320
Why does he think like that?

339
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
Napkin.

340
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,720
You're well-prepared.

341
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,640
How?

342
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,920
You can keep a premium
restaurant waiter away from here

343
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,440
just to get me back
for what I did yesterday.

344
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,600
I hate people arguing
with me. Like you did.

345
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,280
So, I punish you.

346
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm your secretary, not a slave.
I don't need to tolerate you.

347
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,960
Good evening, Mr. Elis.

348
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,400
Hope I didn't come late.

349
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,440
I've just arrived.

350
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,920
Don't stand still. Do you forget your duty?

351
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,480
Please allow me, Mr. Win.

352
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,600
Does your secretary do the waiter's work?

353
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,840
I need privacy and to keep
strangers from meddling with me

354
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,480
during our private time.

355
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,480
Can you remember what Mr. Win likes?

356
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,120
Of course, I can remember
everyone you invited for dinner.

357
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,480
What are you waiting for? Serve our dishes.

358
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,920
Please give me a moment.

359
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,280
Oh, Mr. Patt.

360
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:29,360
Mr. Elis trusts you so much that he needs
your company while having dinner with me.

361
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,040
It's my duty.

362
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,960
May I ask you about Mr. Kim?

363
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,440
What do wish to know?

364
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,680
I want to know about the
relationship between him and Mr. Elis.

365
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,640
Mr. Elis said...

366
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,560
Mr. Kim is his friend with benefits,

367
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,200
but I must be wary.

368
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,080
I'm serious about Mr. Elis.

369
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,520
I want to know about my competitor.

370
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
I can't answer that.

371
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,320
I don't meddle in Mr. Kim's
and Mr. Elis' affairs.

372
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,960
How much do you want? You can tell me.

373
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,560
No, thank you.

374
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,680
I don't care about anything but work.

375
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,760
You can tell me if you change your mind.

376
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,040
If you have to take a side,

377
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I want you to be with me.

378
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,480
I prepared a room.

379
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,680
Stop here.

380
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,240
I don't need your escort.

381
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,800
Yes.

382
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,200
Prepare a birthday present for Kim.

383
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,080
You know what he wants.

384
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,720
I want to know about the
relationship between him and Mr. Elis.

385
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,040
Mr. Elis said...

386
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,800
Mr. Kim is his friend with benefits.

387
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,880
I'm serious about Mr. Elis.

388
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,360
I want to know about my competitor.

389
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,200
I can't answer that.

390
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,080
I don't meddle in Mr. Kim's
and Mr. Elis' affairs.

391
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,680
Forever.

392
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,320
Mr. Elis, what do you need?

393
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,880
I have an important thing to say.

394
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,360
Can I go inside?

395
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,320
Make up your mind.

396
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,000
Wanna talk out here?

397
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,520
Please do.

398
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,560
Tell me what you need.
It's late, and I want to rest.

399
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,320
I'm sorry.

400
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,640
You heard it right.

401
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
What I did was too much.

402
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,680
You even stayed to serve Win.

403
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,200
So, you've come here to say sorry?

404
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,080
I want to say it...

405
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,160
in front of you.

406
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,040
Apology accepted.

407
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,480
Please don't do it again.

408
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,400
I won't do it again

409
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,440
if you stay away from Teeranai.

410
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,400
When will you stop being
prejudiced against Mr. Teeranai?

411
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,440
He doesn't do anything to you.

412
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,040
Besides, you're above him.

413
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,560
Is harassing weaker people fun for you...

414
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,360
You believe his lie?

415
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,720
Do you Teeranai is weak?

416
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,840
I don't see where this is going.

417
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,040
Please... leave.

418
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,920
You chase me away because of him?!

419
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,560
You fall for him.

420
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,040
It's because... I don't
want to argue with you.

421
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,440
I was glad you said sorry from guilt.

422
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,040
But now... you're being unreasonable again!

423
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Mr. Elis?!

424
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,120
Unreasonable?

425
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,720
What I did was to protect you.
How dare you say I'm unreasonable?

426
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,480
Remember this!

427
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,200
I said sorry...

428
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,040
because I worry about your feelings

429
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,080
but not from guilt
because I am never wrong.

430
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,640
Powermonger! Don't use
my feelings as an excuse!

431
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,080
Because I don't feel a thing!

432
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,680
What do you mean?

433
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,920
I mean what I said.

434
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,800
If you think ordering me to find a present
for Mr. Kim or serving you and Mr. Win

435
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,160
hurt me,

436
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,200
then I'm sorry.

437
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,160
It meant nothing to me.

438
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,880
Meant nothing?

439
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,160
(Next Episode)
Nothing for you to eat here.

440
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,680
There are eggs!

441
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,640
I want an egg.

442
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,440
My boss will drive me crazy.

443
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,400
Congratulations, dude!

444
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,560
You're in the vicious cycle of love!

445
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,880
I'll keep a five-meter
distance from him tomorrow!

446
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,640
Isn't your boss a playboy?

447
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,040
Have you expected
disappointment from loving Elis?

448
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,160
Why do you take his side? Fond of him?

449
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,640
Appoint Kim to have French cuisine with me

450
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,000
and don't let anyone
interrupt my precious time.
