"Bad Guy My Boss"
(Episode 10)

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,520
(Previously)
Want to confess anything to us?

3
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,360
Get lost and never set foot here again!

4
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,120
How do you feel after getting rid of a traitor?

5
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't know Pat observed me.

6
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Then prove it to me you can get rid of Pat!

7
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,200
What am I to you?

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,880
I can't be like this anymore.

9
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll work with you until Mr. JC's project is over.

10
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
What's the matter?

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,640
I can't be like this anymore.

12
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,440
I love you.

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
I love you so much.

14
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,720
But I have my dignity.

15
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,960
(Pat)

16
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,360
It's this late. He may be sleeping.

17
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,320
How long will you employ me?

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,760
Forever.

19
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
Are you that hungry?

20
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,320
Being worried about you is what I do every day.

21
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
Do whatever you want.

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
Who do you love?

23
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,600
Mr. Elyes.

24
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,480
That's great. I can go there alone without delay.

25
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,000
If not eating on time, you'll get gastritis again.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,520
You're sharp-tongued but kindhearted.

27
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
You're mean.

28
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,280
What am I to you?

29
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,600
Thank you.

30
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,560
(Are you sleeping?)

31
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,080
Sleep already. Don't be dramatic.

32
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Gosh.

33
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,160
(Are you sleeping?)

34
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Where's Pat? Tell him to serve me coffee.

35
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,200
Pat's not here. He asked me to take care of you.

36
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,080
Does he take sick leave?

37
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,360
No. He called me this morning about
checking the site, so he can't be here.

38
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,800
Doesn't he go there with me this afternoon?!

39
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
You can leave.

40
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,920
Yes.

41
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,640
Now, the progress is around 60%, Mr. Pat.

42
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,360
Need us to add anything?

43
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,240
The color at the top has a wavy pattern.

44
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes.

45
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,680
Please fix that.

46
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,720
Of course, I'll tell a worker to paint on it.

47
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,240
What about that crack?

48
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,640
I think it's from rain.

49
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,200
I can fix that.

50
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,960
Great. Please speed up the work.

51
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,880
Yes, Mr. Pat.

52
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Alright, guys.

53
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,400
Good afternoon, Mr. Elyes.

54
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
Do you see my secretary?

55
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,680
He checks the site near that building with our chief.

56
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,120
Pat!

57
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Watch out!

58
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
- Mr. Pat!
- Pat!

59
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,280
Help me out!

60
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,240
Let's help him!

61
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,200
Lift it.

62
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Lift.

63
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,440
Pat.

64
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Lift that side too!

65
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Pat.

66
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,720
I did what you ordered, Mr. Thiti.

67
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,160
Can't you do this petty job?

68
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
But… I'll be in jail for this!

69
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't get caught, then!

70
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,040
Make it look like an accident.

71
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
That's easy enough.

72
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,360
I'll pay you well.

73
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,160
Go hide somewhere. Wait for my
call if I have more things to do.

74
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,800
Yes.

75
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
How is he, doctor?

76
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,160
Is it serious?

77
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
Is his brain damaged?

78
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,040
The patient gets a bone fracture.
I put a splint on him, and he can go home.

79
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,960
- Go home?
- Yes, he can.

80
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
But he fainted! How is he okay?!

81
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,600
I diagnosed and found no brain damage.
He might faint because he was shocked.

82
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
His brain has no concussion?

83
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,400
I'm fine, Mr. Elyes. Only my arm and my back hurt.

84
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,480
I want a full brain diagnosis to check again.

85
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,840
Of course, I can send the patient
for a brain x-ray for your relief.

86
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,800
Please no, doctor! I'm really fine, Mr. Elyes.

87
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,840
I'll let you choose between getting
a brain x-ray or four nights admission!

88
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,600
You'd better move to my place.

89
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,920
Move to your house?

90
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,960
Yes, your arm hurts.
I'll take care of you at my house.

91
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,600
Please, no. I don't want to disturb you.

92
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,880
Okay.

93
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Up to you.

94
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm going to the company.

95
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,680
Yes.

96
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,160
Aeom, come to my office.

97
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,200
I want you to find the reason
why the scaffold collapsed.

98
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,840
It may be an accident...

99
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,280
You must find evidence.

100
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,760
My man is fatally wounded!

101
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
Yes, of course.

102
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,840
- Aeom.
- Yes, Mr. Elyes?

103
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
More work in the schedule?

104
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,400
Give me a moment.

105
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:14,760
There's an executive meeting this evening
and a dinner with a material dealer.

106
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,080
Cancel them all.

107
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,160
Yes. Postpone them to tomorrow?

108
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,280
I said cancel, not postpone.

109
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,240
Cancel everything in the next three days.

110
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,360
What?

111
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,920
But…

112
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,280
Everything?

113
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
What's this?!

114
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,600
You said you don't want to move
to my place because you'll disturb me,

115
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,240
so I'll stay here with you.

116
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Don't you think what you're doing is a disturbance?

117
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,000
No,

118
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,160
I'm here to tend your injured arm.

119
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
You'd better thank me.

120
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,720
Mr. Elyes…

121
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,880
Come on. Not a time to be picky.

122
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
I'm worried.

123
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,120
What?

124
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,360
Okay. I'm going.

125
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,120
What is it?

126
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,200
I'll come back and tell you.

127
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,120
Stay here and rest.

128
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,560
Yes.

129
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,800
Oh.

130
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,720
Hey.

131
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll be quick.

132
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,200
How is it? Get anything?

133
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,760
My workers checked every corner.
Someone intended to let the scaffold collapse

134
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,640
because we aren't careless when setting one.

135
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Do you know who did it?

136
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,200
There was one worker who disappeared yesterday.

137
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
I think it's him.

138
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,800
Everyone said he set the scaffold.

139
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,960
Report to the police and tell me his number.

140
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,800
Yes.

141
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,320
Inspector,

142
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,600
I need your help.

143
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,080
From your evidence, we can easily arrest him.

144
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,160
How long will it take?

145
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,880
In a hurry?

146
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,760
My man was injured and could be in a coma.

147
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,080
I don't want this to be delayed.
The same thing can happen to others.

148
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I'll do my best to speed up the case.

149
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,520
- Thank you, inspector.
- You're welcome.

150
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,320
Good afternoon, Mr. Elyes.

151
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,440
You gave me an urgent call.

152
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,760
Know about the site incident?

153
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,960
Yes.

154
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,000
But you let the police deal with it.

155
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,880
Not enough.

156
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,640
Need someone killed, Mr. Elyes?

157
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,560
I won't do that.

158
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm sorry.

159
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,480
I want Fei Long to hear that

160
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,560
Teeranai is being pursued by the police.

161
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,960
Do it quickly before the police know.

162
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,440
No problem.

163
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,360
Why would you do that?

164
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,080
If Fei Long knows he's in trouble,
he definitely throws Teeranai away.

165
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,280
I want this to be quick, so Fei Long
has more time to harass Teeranai.

166
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,720
Yes.

167
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,720
Not an accident?!

168
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,840
It was meant to hurt you.

169
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
It would be more serious

170
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
if I didn't arrive on time.

171
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
You could…

172
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,480
get killed.

173
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,440
I think the culprit wanted to hurt us both

174
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,520
because you were meant to be there too.

175
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't care. That person hurt you.

176
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,360
I won't let that slide.

177
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,400
What will you do next?

178
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

179
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,080
Now,

180
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
I want to give you something.

181
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,160
A bird's nest nourishes the body.
They're all top-graded.

182
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,240
Woah!

183
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,520
They must be expensive!

184
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,680
I paid for them. You only eat.

185
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,880
What's that?

186
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,920
Rock sugar.

187
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,040
You must put rock sugar while boiling
bird's nest to make the taste mellow.

188
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,600
For pandan leaves,

189
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,320
that's up to you.

190
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
But it's aromatic.

191
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,400
Wow! You're awesome!

192
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,520
I didn't think you knew this kind of thing.

193
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,520
The shopkeeper told me the steps.

194
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,960
Thank you.

195
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,160
You're welcome.

196
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,560
I'll feel less guilty…

197
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,680
if I do something for you.

198
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,040
I was the reason for your injury.

199
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,800
Aromatic.

200
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,040
Yep, that's my cheek.

201
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,920
I mean bird nests.

202
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,600
It's your cheek.

203
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
Let me feed you.

204
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,160
Your arm still hurts…

205
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,120
and the bowl is hot.

206
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,800
My other arm is fine.

207
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,120
I boiled and simmered it just for you.

208
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't offend me.

209
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,600
Open your mouth.

210
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,840
Ahhh.

211
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,240
Eat.

212
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,840
Mr. Elyes, I'm not a kid.

213
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,280
Just eat.

214
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
Ahhh.

215
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,160
Who's not a kid? Have another spoon.

216
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,560
Ahhh.

217
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,360
Eat it all to heal yourself.

218
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,160
Good man.

219
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I put my effort into it.

220
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,360
Is it good?

221
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,880
Yes.

222
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,280
Is it sweet?

223
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,040
Yes.

224
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,840
Mmm. It's sweet.

225
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,320
Mr. Elyes!

226
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm not sure if…

227
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,440
the sweetness is from a bird's nest or your lips.

228
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,280
Let me try again.

229
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,200
I still don't know.

230
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,240
Hard to guess.

231
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,960
Did you get the taste?

232
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,080
Still not sure.

233
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,440
One more time.

234
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
How about now?

235
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
What the hell?!

236
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,560
You failed an easy job!
Pat only has one broken arm!

237
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
For Elyes,

238
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,080
he's in one fricking piece!

239
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,040
The plan went wrong, but I won't fail next time.

240
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,960
Will there be next time?!

241
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
They're on their damn guard now!

242
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,320
I'm sorry.

243
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,720
I'm really sorry.

244
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,680
What are you doing?

245
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,480
Breakfast. I cooked some for you.

246
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,840
You cooked all of these with one arm?

247
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,080
Yes.

248
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,240
Easy-peasy. Just one arm is enough.

249
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
What's with the outfit?

250
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,200
What would I put on?

251
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,440
Isn't that for work?

252
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,120
Yes, it's for work. I'll go to work.

253
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,280
Take a bath and get changed. We'll be late.

254
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,400
You don't go anywhere. I order you to rest.

255
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
I won't.

256
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,360
Please, let me work with you.
My arm doesn't hurt much.

257
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,200
I'm bored just staying at home.

258
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,640
Mr. Elyes.

259
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,760
Please.

260
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,440
Pretty please.

261
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,960
Let's eat.

262
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,120
You're good.

263
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,400
Not hard at all.

264
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,280
I can even feed you.

265
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,840
Let me do it.

266
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,720
Stay still.

267
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,200
Give me that.

268
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,960
I'll hold it.

269
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,120
Come.

270
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,000
Let me hold it.

271
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,840
Just walk.

272
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,720
At least I don't make you sit in a wheelchair.

273
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,040
Ms. Aeom. Ms. Nui. Come with us.

274
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,840
No, you don't!

275
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,520
Your arm's still hurt. What if
they accidentally bump into it?

276
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
The elevator is wide.

277
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,240
You can go first. We prefer to use that one.

278
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,640
- Right?
- Yes.

279
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,440
See you up there.

280
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,360
Good morning.

281
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,600
How's your work today?

282
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,920
- It's okay.
- Good to know.

283
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,240
Do you get the ordered stuff?

284
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,400
Not yet.

285
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
What?

286
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,040
Tell them the hurry.

287
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,200
Pat.

288
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,000
Yes, Ms. Aeom?

289
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,480
Why don't you have a few days off?

290
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,080
I'm fine. Don't worry.

291
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,760
If my arm was hurt like yours,
I'd gladly use the chance.

292
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,040
I barely slept recently.

293
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,800
Is that so? You're busy?

294
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,360
Busy as a bee.

295
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
Want more work from me?

296
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, that's alright. It's already...

297
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,640
How may I help you, Mr. Elyes?

298
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,040
I have a document to sign. Do you have it?

299
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,680
Yes. I'm going to bring it to you.

300
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,480
No need.

301
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,160
If there are more, call me and I'll come out.

302
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,120
Pat,

303
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,360
are you the one who was hurt in the accident?

304
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,080
Did the boss get a brain concussion?

305
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,480
No.

306
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,520
Now, I'm wondering who's the boss or secretary.

307
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,960
I think the boss falls in love…

308
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
with someone.

309
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,480
Come on, I'm not that fortunate.

310
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,640
Well…

311
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,160
Who knows when fortune comes?

312
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,560
I don't know and didn't do anything! Let me go!

313
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,520
I can't do that.

314
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,560
The offender testified that you
hired him to commit the crime!

315
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,560
Everyone can say that! Where's the proof?!
You can't accuse me like this!

316
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,960
Here's the evidence…

317
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,560
of you contacting the offender.

318
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,040
Yes.

319
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,040
Thank you.

320
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,760
Thiti confessed because of evidence.

321
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,480
And he testified against Teeranai.

322
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,840
Yes.

323
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
Bastard!

324
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
- You can't get in!
- How dare you accuse me?!

325
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,320
Calm down. Are you Mr. Teeranai?

326
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,400
Yes! I'm here to testify that I have no part in this.

327
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,240
But we have evidence of camera records from
your condo that you and Thiti are together.

328
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,840
Is that enough to be evidence to accuse me?!

329
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:39,160
I have problems and want to break
up with him, so he accuses me!

330
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,960
Please go to the next room.

331
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,520
- Take him.
- Yes.

332
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,840
Right this way.

333
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,320
Please leave.

334
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,280
What's up, Teeranai?!

335
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Will you quit or get sacked?

336
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,160
I won't quit, and you don't have a right to sack me.

337
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,400
I didn't do anything.

338
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,640
Even the police can't detain me.

339
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,880
Now, they can't.
With enough evidence, who knows?

340
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,200
Yes, Mr. Elyes.

341
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,440
We'll see when that time comes.

342
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,680
For now,

343
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,080
I'm innocent.

344
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,880
You don't have the right to fire me.

345
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,800
Mr. Teeranai is wicked.

346
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,760
I heard him pitilessly toss Thiti aside.

347
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,920
Without solid evidence,

348
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,720
Thiti will be charged with murder attempt alone.

349
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
Remember?

350
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,760
You stubbornly protected him.

351
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,280
I helped you by dealing with Teeranai.

352
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,640
Stop being an idiot.

353
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,760
You were upset that I went with Mr. Teeranai.

354
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,240
Don't use me as an excuse.

355
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,280
You shouldn't do that to Mr. Teeranai.

356
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,840
Why?

357
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,920
He's your stakeholder and a relative.

358
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't care about relatives. Only benefits.

359
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,240
But he's one of the executives.

360
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,520
Who would work with you if

361
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,840
you humiliate people like this?

362
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,520
How's your arm? Still hurt?

363
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,960
It doesn't hurt. I'm okay.

364
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,800
Doesn't hurt,

365
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,960
but what's with your face?

366
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,160
You're frowning.

367
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,040
I'm worried.

368
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,320
Though Thiti is in jail, Mr. Teeranai is still at large.

369
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,120
He won't stop.

370
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
What can he do?

371
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,320
He tossed Thiti aside

372
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,880
and has nowhere to go.
His backer won't let him get away.

373
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,520
- Do you mean…
- It's Fei Long.

374
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,240
I know him better than anyone.

375
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,760
He won't keep Teeranai by his side.

376
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,720
Here.

377
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,880
Let me unbutton it for you.

378
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,400
It's okay. I can do it.

379
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,040
It's more convenient.

380
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Hold still.

381
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,600
I'll do it.

382
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
Next is pants.

383
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,400
Wait.

384
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,280
I'll take it off.

385
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,560
How about this?

386
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,520
Hey!

387
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,880
I'll bathe you.

388
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,120
Come on! Please no!

389
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,400
Mr. Elyes! Let me go!

390
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,040
Mr. Elyes!

391
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,960
Mr. Elyes!

392
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,160
Stop!

393
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,680
Time to take your pants off.
Now,

394
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,080
I'll bathe you.

395
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,400
Let go of me!

396
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,240
Damn you, Fei Long! You betray me!

397
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,480
Bastard!

398
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,840
Get lost!

399
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,480
And stay away.

400
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,120
How is it?!

401
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,440
Nowhere to go?

402
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,080
Remember this:

403
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,840
A man like me never loses.

404
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,120
Come right in.

405
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,480
Please sit.

406
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Thank you for coming.

407
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,320
I'll announce the result of my
hotel design directly to you two.

408
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,960
So, I didn't make calls.

409
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,480
After my legal department draft
the contract, I'll send it to you to check.

410
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,640
With pleasure.

411
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,800
Mr. JC, may I have a word?

412
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,240
I'll take my leave.

413
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,400
See you.

414
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,520
If I'm not wrong,

415
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,360
You wonder why I don't choose your company.

416
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,880
I proposed a budget equal to his.
Why don't you choose me?

417
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,880
How do you know it was equal?

418
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,920
I have my reason. Hope you understand.

419
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,800
Do what I told you to do.

420
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,520
(Next Episode)
Fei Long is hot-tempered, but not a fool.

421
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,960
He defeated me many times,
including stealing Run from me.

422
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,040
- Mad at me or worried about Elyes?!
- What if I'm worried about Elyes?

423
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,320
Enough!

424
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,200
Or Mr. Elyes scolds us.

425
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,040
Elyes!

426
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,480
Please no!

427
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,280
Damn you, Elyes!
