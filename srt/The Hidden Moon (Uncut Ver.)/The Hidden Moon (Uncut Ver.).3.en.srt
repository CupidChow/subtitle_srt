1
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,687
Tan!

2
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,856
Why did you come back here?

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,357
Did you forget something?

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,401
I don’t know. It just brought me back here on its own.

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,487
What exactly do they want from us?

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,614
I don’t understand the spirits here either.

7
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,117
Normally, they should be trying to drive us away from their space.

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,327
But here, they’re not letting us leave!

9
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,128
Leave!

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,799
I told you to leave!

11
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,054
Khen.

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,182
Do you see that?

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,443
The moon.

14
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,947
Yes, it's the moon.

15
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,076
My name is Mas.

16
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,537
Matthew "Mas" Coleridge.

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,962
Your name and mine, both mean 'moon.'

18
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,139
Do you know?

19
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,063
That our world...

20
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,483
Has only...

21
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,319
One moon.

22
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:20,849
Khen!

23
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:23,601
Khen!

24
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,436
What happened?

25
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,693
Does it hurt anywhere?

26
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:43,913
In this house, it’s not just the female ghost in that room.

27
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,921
The ghost of the owner's son is also in this house.

28
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,010
Matthew.

29
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,219
Mas.

30
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,429
Coleridge.

31
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,635
I don’t think it’s a dream.

32
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,098
This house really has spirits.

33
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,561
It's different from what Mrs.Kat said,

34
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,481
That there has never been a murder or death here.

35
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,445
I think she is lying.

36
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,823
There’s something being covered up.

37
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,368
And those spirits won’t allow it.

38
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,206
Do you think he might be so stressed.

39
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,834
That he’s imagining things?

40
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,335
I’m serious.

41
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,007
I'm scared.

42
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,843
What do they want from us?

43
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,680
Dammm!!!

44
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,557
Why do I have to be stuck in this damn haunted house?

45
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,057
Toh!!!

46
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,018
Please don’t say that.

47
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,145
What if they hear us?

48
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,479
What should we do?

49
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,484
If they hear us, please understand that we’re not okay.

50
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,030
Mr.owner’s son ghost, you’re still in the house.

51
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,948
But we’re stuck here.

52
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,366
Even though we don’t want to be here.

53
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:25,992
Enough.

54
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:37,712
Wait, didn’t we already split up and leave the house?

55
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,925
Isn’t anyone able to get out?

56
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,346
Me and Nam-Wha.

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,599
We were going to take the train back to Bangkok.

58
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,184
So we took a red pickup truck.

59
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,272
And suddenly, we ended up at Tha Pae Gate somehow.

60
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,199
And then I completely forgot.

61
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,869
It felt like just going out to have fun.

62
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,882
In the end, we ended up back at this house.

63
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,926
And then we completely forgot about going back to Bangkok.

64
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,304
I only remembered it when you mentioned it.

65
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,059
Yeah, same here.

66
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:38,481
When there was no one with me, I forgot why I even went out.

67
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:43,403
I thought that if we intended to go back to Bangkok, the ghosts would figure it out.

68
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,531
And try to interfere.

69
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,866
So I decided to trick them.

70
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,285
Actually, I have relatives in Chiang Rai.

71
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,330
So, I bought two tickets.

72
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,003
To make them think that I’m going back to Bangkok.

73
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,384
But before the bus departs, there’s still some time left.

74
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,053
So I went to find something to eat while waiting.

75
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,222
And.....

76
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,519
I completely forgot until I heard you guys calling.

77
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,065
And me.

78
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,111
I successfully checked in at the hotel.

79
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,533
I tried to force myself to stay awake.

80
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,171
But in the end...

81
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,471
Khen!

82
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,990
I’m really curious.

83
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,454
Why is it only Khen who sees ghosts right now?

84
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,001
Both the female ghost in that room and the owner's son ghost.

85
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,504
Even though I have a sensitivity to this kind of thing.

86
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,756
They’ve never shown themselves to me before.

87
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,717
I haven’t encountered anything like what you’ve experienced.

88
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,017
Did you do something wrong? Think carefully.

89
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,649
Besides writing about the exhibition...

90
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,321
There’s nothing else.

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,951
Khen.

92
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,370
I think you should try looking over what you wrote again.

93
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,873
There might be something in it that they don’t like.

94
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,506
I think you’d better not be alone during this time.

95
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,299
Why?

96
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,888
Do you know this term?

97
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,974
Substitute death?

98
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,939
I once heard it on a ghost story show.

99
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:31,445
Someone moved into a dormitory where someone had previously committed suicide.

100
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,908
And he saw the person jumping out of the window every day.

101
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,326
Every day.

102
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,957
And one day, that person jumped out of the window just like in the visions.

103
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,417
Tan, Stop it!!!

104
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,668
I don’t want to hear any more.

105
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,050
Right now, I think it’s better if everyone stays together.

106
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,094
And avoids going anywhere alone.

107
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,513
This situation has a solution.

108
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,641
But it will probably take some time.

109
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,252
Khen.

110
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,255
Are you overthinking things?

111
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,216
I don’t want to make you lose your mind.

112
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,477
I’m just concerned and want you to be careful.

113
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,731
I don’t want to be the first one.

114
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,442
And I don’t want you to be next either.

115
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,367
I’m not joking, you know.

116
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,202
Me too.

117
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,039
I think tonight.

118
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,333
You should sleep with Toh.

119
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,503
If you sleep with me, you might end up being haunted by the ghosts too.

120
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,421
"I'm not afraid.

121
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,548
I'm used to it.

122
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,467
You don’t have to be scared.

123
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,095
I’ll stay with you tonight.

124
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,555
I’ll stay with you until you fall asleep.

125
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,142
Thank you.

126
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,944
Do you think we’ll be able to get out of here?

127
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,613
I don’t know.

128
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,539
I'm also not sure if everything that’s happened is real.

129
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:25,828
Maybe all of us are in someone’s dream.

130
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,090
We might be playing out roles assigned to us.

131
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,470
To keep the dream going.

132
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,488
Whose dream is it?

133
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,490
I don’t know.

134
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,076
Maybe.

135
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,581
if we find out whose dream this is.

136
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,751
And wake them up.

137
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,214
We might be able to get out of here.

138
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:57,104
Cowards will die time and time again.

139
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,441
Before their true demise.

140
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,653
The valiant will only taste death once.

141
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,700
I mean you, Khen.

142
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,254
Who are we actually praying to right now?

143
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,008
We’re praying to the ancestors of this house.

144
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,304
Since we arrived here, we’ve never shown them any respect.

145
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,723
They might be upset.

146
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,392
And that could be why things have turned out this way.

147
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:21,730
Nam-Wha

148
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,941
Are we not going to pay our respects together?

149
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,861
I’m a Christian.

150
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,242
Do you think.

151
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,162
The ghosts in this house will appreciate what we’re doing?

152
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,917
"I don’t know, I’m not a ghost.

153
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,087
Can you not ask questions like this?

154
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,726
Who’s next?

155
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,481
You don’t have to avoid looking at me.

156
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,482
Just go.

157
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,109
All the bad things you said keep them to yourself.

158
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,653
Okay, boss

159
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,286
Please take care of it then.

160
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,454
Where are you going?

161
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,958
I'm going to ask the ghost of the house if they like what we’re doing.

162
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,253
Just kidding. I’m going to the bathroom.

163
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,381
Hurry up and come back quickly.

164
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,549
Not today.

165
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,897
Why are you doing this?

166
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,650
You started this.

167
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,111
If you had just let us go.

168
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,321
none of this would have happened.

169
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,127
Today is the first day after my father went to war.

170
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,966
My mother, Pin , Dara, and the household staff are all feeling quiet and desolate.

171
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,094
It makes me feel sad.

172
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:09,309
But as the head of the family now, I cannot afford to grieve like everyone else."

173
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,522
What are you doing?

174
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,482
Please don’t leave me alone.

175
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,817
Help me please.

176
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,279
Do you think I’m helping you, The moon?

177
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,409
You might be misunderstanding.

178
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,078
I’m not happy to see you.

179
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,335
But I just hate her more than I dislike you.

180
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:28,133
Don't assume that I have any sympathy for you.

181
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:28,925
Mas.

182
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,762
What happened? Everyone up there is in shock.

183
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,600
Mas.

184
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,894
Be quiet.

185
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:39,895
Mas.

186
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,230
Mas.

187
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,984
what happened?

188
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,488
It was an accidental discharge.

189
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,365
I’m going to go ride the horse now.

190
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,410
Dammm, Mas.

191
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:00,248
At a time like this, who goes outside?

192
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,417
You might get caught by a ghost.

193
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,419
About the gun earlier...

194
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,713
That's enough.

195
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,508
And what will others say about us?

196
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,387
They will know that even though Dad isn't here.

197
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,389
I'm still the one taking care of this place.

198
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,228
No matter who it is, no one dares to come in.

199
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,522
The house is already full of ghosts.

200
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,191
What ghost would dare to come in now?

201
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,860
Not to mention thieves.

202
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,238
Even the old people in the house are terrified

203
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,618
Mom, Grandma Aun, where has everyone gone?

204
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,204
Go find Dara quickly.

205
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:39,704
Okay.

206
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,623
I’m going right now.

207
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,731
You're such a pain.

208
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,735
I didn’t want it to be like this.

209
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,282
What exactly do you want from me?

210
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,950
Me?

211
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,579
Do you know this term?

212
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,622
Substitute death?

213
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,960
Please don’t do anything to me.

214
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,379
I know you’re not a cruel person.

215
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,007
I didn’t intend to disrespect you.

216
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,883
I’m a good person, you know.

217
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,095
I just want to finish my work.

218
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,515
Good person?

219
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,101
Yes.

220
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,563
I know you can't go anywhere because you have some concerns.

221
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,275
If you need any help from me...

222
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,901
Just let me know.

223
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,030
And.......

224
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,367
If you want me to go and make merit or pray, just let me know.

225
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,038
And.......

226
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,182
You’re really strange.

227
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,646
Not like anyone I’ve met before.

228
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,397
You....

229
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,609
You’re not going to do anything to me, right?

230
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,108
My notebook.

231
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,820
Put it back where it was.

232
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:00,780
Khen.

233
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,907
Why have you been in the bathroom for so long.

234
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,909
I'm worried about you.

235
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,466
Why did you hit me?

236
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,430
What going on.

237
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,016
I’m not dreaming, am I?

238
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,688
Don't tell me that you encountered something.

239
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,201
Just a bit of dizziness.

240
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,662
I didn't get much sleep last night.

241
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,082
I’m going to bed now.

242
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,584
I’m coming with you.

243
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,673
It’s okay.

244
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,884
If someone comes along.

245
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,053
It might be even harder to fall asleep.

246
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,390
Just call me if you need anything.

247
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,767
Thank you.

248
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,435
Shout loudly, okay?

249
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,312
Bing!!!

250
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,606
You’re worrying too much about it.

251
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,108
Khen’s grown up now, not a child.

252
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,779
Bye.

253
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,259
What is it?

254
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:48,638
Honey.

255
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,266
This is..the actress's nail

256
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,935
That I used to wear when I dressed up as a actress, isn’t it?

257
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,605
How did it end up here?

258
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,826
Mas.

259
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,997
Can you come see me tonight?

260
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,546
I have something important to tell you.

261
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,907
Boring.

262
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,369
I'm going to my room.

263
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,163
I was startled.

264
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,082
I thought something was wrong.

265
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,003
You’re really easily frightened.

266
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,802
Wait.

267
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,595
Where are you going?

268
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,515
I’m just going to stop by and check on Khen.

269
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,437
He said he’s going to bed.

270
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,064
Why are you going to bother him?

271
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,066
I’m not going to bother him.

272
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,653
Give him some personal time.

273
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,613
You’re almost sticking to him all the time.

274
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,160
Do I really make things that uncomfortable?

275
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,620
Yes.

276
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,831
I feel uncomfortable too.

277
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,506
If you have so much free time.

278
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,174
Come and learn how to edit photos with me.

279
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,385
If you can get out of here...

280
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,928
You'll gain some new skills.

281
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:35,805
Come.

282
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:38,975
Do it.

283
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,061
Okay.

284
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,136
Please don’t make me wait too long.

285
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,195
Do you always follow others around like this?

286
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,574
Can you listen to me first? I have something to discuss with you.

287
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,347
Get out!!!

288
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,683
Listen to me first, and then I’ll leave.

289
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,018
It's up to you.

290
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,563
I've warned you.

291
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,711
Are you messing with me too much?

292
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,728
The last time we met, I felt like you were acting strange.

293
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,481
You've surprised me.

294
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,444
To the point where I thought I didn’t need to eliminate you.

295
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:45,411
But if you keep following me like this, I might have to reconsider.

296
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,372
Are you going to eliminate me?

297
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,878
And when will you stop imprisoning us?

298
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,839
I haven't done anything.

299
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,843
Don’t follow me anymore.

300
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,515
Threatening me is pointless.

301
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,726
You can’t escape from me

302
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,440
Even though this may be your world, the dream belongs to me.

303
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,110
Let me go.

304
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,488
Can you listen to me first?

305
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,345
What do you mean?

306
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,389
You mean this is your dream?

307
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,309
Lucid Dream.

308
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,437
A dream where you’re aware that you’re dreaming.

309
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,149
And I brought myself to meet you in my dream.

310
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,821
And you’re willing to meet me in a dream like this.

311
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,782
I didn’t agree to that.

312
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,702
You’re really talking nonsense.

313
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,831
You’re the one who intruded into my home.

314
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,041
Disturb me.

315
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,002
Even though I didn’t invite you.

316
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,211
But I came with good intentions.

317
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,966
And I have something I want to tell you.

318
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,511
About your father, Mr. Thomas.

319
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,725
I know that he went to fight in the war in England.

320
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,351
And you are very concerned about him.

321
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,894
How do you know my father?

322
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,985
It’s written in history, both about you and your father.

323
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,029
I was born a hundred years after you.

324
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,953
Are you telling me that you come from the future?

325
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,414
It’s impossible.

326
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,875
If you want to hear more.

327
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,960
Please let me go first.

328
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,980
Nam-Wha.

329
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,488
Nam-Wha.

330
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,047
Nam-Wha.

331
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,760
Nam-Wha.

332
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,639
Nam-Wha.

333
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,519
Nam-Wha.

334
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,480
Nam-Wha.

335
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,488
Wonderful.

336
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,327
Even though I’m not yet ready to fully believe it.

337
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,707
But I do hope that it is real.

338
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,127
It is the real.

339
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,504
Your father will be safe.

340
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,673
He will survive this war.

341
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,551
There are historical records about it.

342
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,762
And I’ve also taken photos as evidence.

343
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,890
It's in my notebook.

344
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,810
Is it in the notebook, then?

345
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,940
It's more advanced than a regular book.

346
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,151
It can store much more data.

347
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,360
And.

348
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,488
It looks like a typewriter.

349
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,662
Like the machine you always like to stare at, right?

350
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,665
Have you seen it before?

351
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,919
Sometime.....

352
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:51,091
Your world overlaps into my world.

353
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,682
I've stored a lot of information in there.

354
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,769
Including promotional articles about this house.

355
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:09,276
My promotion involves sharing positive stories with others.

356
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,655
Whenever there’s a chance, I’ll show you.

357
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,411
When I first saw the house in the photos, I thought it was abandoned.

358
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,083
But once I saw it in person, I realized that others would definitely want to visit.

359
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,836
It has an indescribable charm.

360
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,924
Have I said too much?

361
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,178
When I talk about things I like, I tend to be quite talkative.

362
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,555
You must be very bored.

363
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,725
No.

364
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,994
Nam-Wha.

365
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,622
Nam-Wha.

366
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:05,958
Nam-Wha.

367
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,210
Nam-Wha.

368
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,254
Nam-Wha.

369
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,467
Nam-Wha.

370
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:19,680
Nam-Wha.

371
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:22,683
Nam-Wha.

372
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,334
Khen, wake up!!!

373
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:55,966
Khen!!!

374
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,303
What happened?

375
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,388
Go downstairs and check on Nam-Wha.

376
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,431
Go!!!

377
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:07,936
We’re here now.

378
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,480
We’re here now.

379
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,067
We’re here now.

380
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,237
Nam-Wha, Are you okay.

381
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,197
Calm down.

382
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,615
Toh.

383
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,116
What happened?

384
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,326
I don’t know either.

385
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,620
She suddenly screamed and then ran out.

386
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,789
What the hell.

387
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,836
I heard someone calling my names.

388
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,342
And then I found myself in the forest.

389
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,722
What's wrong with you?

390
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,432
What's wrong with you?

391
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:03,909
It gonnabe okay.

392
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,172
Be careful.

393
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,722
Have her sit here.

394
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,988
Why are you sighing?

395
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,868
I feel uneasy.

396
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,288
that Nam-Wha heard someone calling like that.

397
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,171
I’ve been thinking about it.

398
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,299
We’re encountering strange things one by one.

399
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,177
It started with Khen.

400
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,429
Saw something frightening.

401
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,933
Then Nam-Wha.

402
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,145
Heard strange noises.

403
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,106
The next person.....

404
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,611
Might be me.

405
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,571
Or even you.

406
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,449
Or possibly Tan.

407
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,286
I’ll give up my turn for you.

408
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:31,955
Dammmm, Bing!!!

409
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,291
Why are you saying that?

410
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,627
I’m just joking.

411
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,586
You’re really bad mouth.

412
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,338
I’ll go get some water for Nam-Wha first.

413
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,507
Grab one for me too.

414
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,052
Can I go with you?

415
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,555
You don’t need to go anywhere. Stay with us.

416
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,414
What do you mean?

417
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,458
You mean this is your dream?

418
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,544
Lucid Dream.

419
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,588
A dream where you’re aware that you’re dreaming.

420
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,508
And I brought myself to meet you in my dream.

421
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,271
I heard someone calling my names.

422
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,274
And then I found myself in the forest.

423
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,875
You’re really talking nonsense.

424
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,962
You’re the one who intruded into my home.

425
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,755
Disturb me.

426
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,465
Even though I didn’t invite you.

427
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:06,526
Khampuan your hair is really beautiful.

428
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:14,660
Could I ask you to comb my hair for me forever?

429
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,915
Are you serious? Don’t change your mind.

430
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,090
Follow me.

431
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,262
Mas.

432
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,435
Mas.

433
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,728
Help me, please.

434
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:07,898
Mas.

435
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,733
Help me, please.

436
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,405
Mas.

437
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,324
Mas.

438
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:20,952
Mas.

439
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,163
Mas.

440
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,831
Help me, please.

441
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,262
Did you go see him yourself?

442
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,931
The ghost of the owner's son, that is.

443
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,767
We are all the moon....

444
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,854
With a dark side we don't want anyone to see.

445
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,523
Mark Twain said.

446
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,775
You are really knowledgeable.

447
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,694
Every time I meet you, I often find myself losing my composure.

448
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,239
Does this mean I'm.....

449
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,448
Falling in love with you?

450
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,742
Do you trust him?

451
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,119
The ghost of the owner's son.

452
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,705
Might be the one who kidnapped Tan and Nam-Wha.
