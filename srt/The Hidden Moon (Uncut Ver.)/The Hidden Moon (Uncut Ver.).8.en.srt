1
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,440
How about we have a little one to keep us company?

2
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,524
Do you think it's good?

3
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,609
Sang.

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,403
Stop.

5
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:29,988
Sang.

6
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,242
This house is so quiet.

7
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,245
You must be lonely.

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,249
If you’re worried that I’ll be lonely.

9
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,420
Then come sleep here with me.

10
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,280
Khen.

11
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,951
Do you know...

12
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,454
How much I miss you?

13
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,921
Go ahead, I'll catch up later!

14
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,634
Hurry up!

15
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,972
Let’s go.

16
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,141
Khen.

17
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,445
Khen.

18
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,200
Khen.

19
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,061
Khen.

20
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,272
What's wrong?

21
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,197
Nothing.

22
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,409
I just missed you so much.

23
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,706
Did you miss me?

24
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,628
Do you not believe my words?

25
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,424
I just wanted to hear it again.

26
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,221
Then...

27
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,516
I'll show you.

28
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,646
How much I missed you.

29
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,894
Why is there food here?

30
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,648
Maybe it's an offering for someone?

31
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,244
But the menu looks just like what we eat every day?

32
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,540
Seeing it makes you hungry, doesn't it?

33
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,085
Then eat!

34
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,003
Are you crazy?

35
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,588
It's food in the middle of the forest.

36
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,590
Eating carelessly like this will get us into trouble.

37
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:06,968
If you're too scared.

38
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,802
Then I'll eat it myself.

39
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,137
Toh.

40
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,930
Toh, don't!

41
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,515
Are you out of your mind? You can't eat that!

42
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,392
Toh! Don't eat it!

43
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,603
Are you out of your mind? You can't eat that, Toh!

44
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:23,818
Toh!

45
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,236
Toh!

46
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,161
I'm sorry.

47
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,203
I'm really sorry.

48
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,496
My friend didn't mean it!

49
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,664
Please don't do anything to him.

50
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,458
Spare his life.

51
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,251
Please don't do anything to him.

52
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,377
I'm really sorry.

53
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,253
I'm sorry.

54
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,846
Toh!

55
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,473
Is this really the time?!

56
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,057
What are you doing?

57
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,642
You were just too easy to prank!

58
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,895
What? Were you worried about me?

59
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,115
Come on.

60
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,325
Eat.

61
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,284
You'll need the energy to keep walking.

62
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,374
Don't let me get my revenge.

63
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,256
Good?

64
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:37,850
Be careful.

65
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,663
Look, it really looks like what we eat every day.

66
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,331
I think...

67
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,416
The taste is similar too.

68
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,302
Bing!

69
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,221
Toh!

70
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:22,979
Bing!

71
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:23,980
Toh!

72
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:26,566
Bing!

73
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,150
Toh!

74
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,571
Bing!

75
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,241
Do you hear someone calling?

76
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,787
What?

77
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,455
I don't hear anything.

78
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,503
Or...

79
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,839
It could be Khen's voice?

80
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,552
I think we should take a look.

81
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,390
Wait, wait..

82
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,851
In this condition, we can't go anywhere.

83
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,185
Just sit down.

84
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:12,862
Bing!

85
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,697
Toh!

86
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,456
What are you doing?

87
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,792
You just stay put.

88
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,295
Or you might fail the internship.

89
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,102
Be careful.

90
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,822
It doesn’t look like a sprain.

91
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,533
A little massage and it should get better.

92
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,000
I never thought...

93
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,628
..you could have gentle side.

94
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,424
I’m always gentle.

95
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,967
You just don't know.

96
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,220
Because you never cared.

97
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,018
Do I really not care about the people around me that much?

98
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,646
Yes.

99
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,823
If we make it out of here...

100
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,325
Would you want to know more about the other sides of me?

101
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,050
What are you doing?

102
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,262
Be quiet.

103
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,892
Do you hear anything?

104
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,860
Sounds like footsteps.

105
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,657
A lot of footsteps too..

106
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,994
Or...

107
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,247
could it be Khen's...

108
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,000
Tan's...

109
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,002
and Nam-wah's footsteps?

110
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,463
There! Do you see anything?

111
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,797
Nothing over here.

112
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,924
What about over there?

113
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,927
I found something! Over here!

114
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,222
You heard that too right?

115
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,475
Yes.

116
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,810
What’s going on here?

117
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,605
Let's hurry and go see.

118
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:53,773
Let's go.

119
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,322
Walk slowly.

120
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,170
Khen!

121
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:18,756
Mas.

122
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,770
What are you doing in the woods alone?

123
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,357
It’s nothing...

124
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,275
I just...

125
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,819
Don’t do anything like this again, okay?

126
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,363
Do you know how worried I was about you?

127
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:43,906
Yes.

128
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,952
Today I woke up and you weren't there.

129
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,997
I thought I would never see you again...

130
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,209
Don't be afraid, I’m here right now.

131
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,169
I won’t go anywhere.

132
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,421
From now on...

133
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,592
You must never leave my sight.

134
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,761
Understand?

135
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,434
Why are you smiling?

136
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,064
It’s just that you look cute when you’re worried about me.

137
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,824
Thank you.

138
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,704
The Moon..

139
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,458
There is truly no one else like you.

140
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,587
In what way?

141
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,176
You make me feel something...

142
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,306
something so special and precious...

143
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,018
That I don't want to lose.

144
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,501
Don't be stubborn, Mas.

145
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,864
Did you bring more things?

146
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,367
You were just gone for so long.

147
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,162
I had nothing to do..

148
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,080
besides making the bed for you...

149
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,332
Waiting for the day you come back to me.

150
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,300
Ever since you disappeared.

151
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,927
I came here every day.

152
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,013
At first....

153
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,100
I only brought a lantern and some books to read while I waited for you.

154
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,439
I thought it would be wonderful.

155
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,775
If you could be here with me.

156
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,073
And the things slowly began to accumulate.

157
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,325
As my longing for you grew.

158
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,161
In hopes that...

159
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,331
We might live here again someday...

160
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,333
Just like now.

161
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,422
Mas.

162
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,842
I'm infatuated with you.

163
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,387
Is that infatuation?

164
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,557
Infatuation, which means I love you so much.

165
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,267
That I can hardly stand it.

166
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:35,364
Then I must be 'infatuated' with you too.

167
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,573
The Moon.

168
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,009
Squirrels.

169
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,680
There are two squirrels in the tree above.

170
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,432
They like to drop fruit onto the roof.

171
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,560
Sometimes.

172
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,272
I think they enjoy interrupting me.

173
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,776
I think so too.

174
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,760
Mas.

175
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,265
If I were to ask to stay here.

176
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,060
Hiding away somewhere in this house.

177
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,855
Would you allow me?

178
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,736
You can stay.

179
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,613
Wherever you want.

180
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,991
In my house...

181
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,869
In my room...

182
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,458
in my heart...

183
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,544
Anywhere is fine.

184
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,930
Mas.

185
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,351
I love you.

186
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,938
From now on.

187
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,816
I will be the one to protect you.

188
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,777
I promise.

189
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,997
Kampuan.

190
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,957
Is having a husband fun?

191
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,418
Is it more fun than being a actress?

192
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,730
Sang.

193
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,857
Stop.

194
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,608
Sang.

195
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:16,835
Sompoh!

196
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,341
Sompoh, what the hell did you bring me to eat!

197
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,849
What are you talking about?

198
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,731
What is that?

199
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:38,899
Don’t play dumb with me.

200
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,778
How did this end up in your garments?

201
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,697
Tell me right now.

202
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,991
What the hell did you bring me to eat.

203
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,458
Did you poison me?

204
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,418
No!

205
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,586
It’s a health tonic.

206
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,587
I don’t believe you.

207
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,589
If it was an actual health tonic...

208
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,425
Why would it need to be hidden under garments?

209
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,181
Are you trying to kill me, Sompoh?

210
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,684
You know how much I love you.

211
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,602
Sompoh?

212
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,647
I asked your mother to let you stay here with me.

213
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,107
Because I was afraid you would be lonely.

214
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,819
We’ve never been apart since we were kids.

215
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,447
So why are you doing this to me?

216
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,707
I understand now.

217
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,586
I'm not as beautiful as Kampuan.

218
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,171
People are different.

219
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,464
You're good at cooking.

220
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,550
I keep eating it over and over.

221
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,853
You secretly love Sang, don’t you?

222
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,689
So you thought of killing me, right?

223
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,274
It's not like that, Kampuan!

224
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,108
Lies!

225
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,943
When you told me...

226
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,529
You were going to cook and gather vegetables.

227
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,407
I saw you hugging my husband!

228
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,118
You think I'm stupid, Sompoh?!

229
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:13,994
Huh?!

230
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,912
That's not true.

231
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,457
I would never do something like that.

232
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,001
Why would you think of me like that?

233
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,463
Because Sang told me himself.

234
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,883
That you were the one who asked him to help gather the vegetables.

235
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,301
I didn't do that.

236
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,635
Don't you believe me?

237
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,221
Just look at what you've done.

238
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,557
Acting all sneaky and secretive.

239
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,228
If this isn't poison.

240
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,983
Then...

241
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,112
Then go ahead and take it in front of me!

242
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,238
Take it in front of me!

243
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:50,655
Try it!

244
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,323
No.

245
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:51,865
Kampuan.

246
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,324
Sompoh.

247
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,366
Eat it now!

248
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,075
Eat it!

249
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:54,701
Sompoh!

250
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,202
Please.

251
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:55,577
Eat it!

252
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,078
Eat it now!

253
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,749
Sompoh.

254
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,125
I’m sorry.

255
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,210
Get out.

256
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:03,627
I’m sorry.

257
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,545
How dare you do this to me, Sompoh!

258
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:06,963
I’m sorry!

259
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,048
I didn’t mean to!

260
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,176
Let me tell you something.

261
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,016
Nobody wants anyone like you.

262
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,524
What’s wrong with someone like me?

263
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,234
Not pretty enough?

264
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,777
Or not promiscuous enough?

265
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,196
So I can't find a guy like you?

266
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,072
Sompoh!

267
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,659
How dare you say that to me?

268
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,416
Fine.

269
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,502
I’ll tell you.

270
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,963
It’s not a tonic.

271
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,507
It’s a medicine that prevents a woman from getting pregnant.

272
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,677
That’s why you and Sang haven’t had a child.

273
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,805
I never thought...

274
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,517
You would dare do this to me.

275
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,852
Why are you doing this to me?

276
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,272
Why are you doing this to me!

277
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,858
I’m asking how you could do this to me!

278
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,736
How you could do this to me!

279
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,322
How you could do this to me!

280
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,660
I’m asking how you could do this to me!

281
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,787
Stop!

282
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,497
Kampuan!

283
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,874
What kind of ghost possessed you, huh?

284
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,168
It’s Sompoh who’s to blame for this!

285
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,130
Look at what it's doing to me!

286
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,464
What has Sompoh done to you?

287
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,800
Sompoh is ungrateful!

288
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,595
She wants Sang as her husband.

289
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,722
She even planned to poison me!

290
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,268
You’re the one being ungrateful!

291
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,520
I raised you!

292
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,772
How dare you hit my daughter!

293
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,361
Is it really because I was wrong...

294
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,698
Is it because I am ungrateful...

295
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,954
Or is it because I’m not truly your daughter?

296
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,499
You’re crazy!

297
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,918
You've lost your mind over a man!

298
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,801
Sompoh.

299
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,763
Come here!

300
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:23,933
Sompoh!

301
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,560
You tell your mother!

302
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:30,273
You tell your mother, just what the hell you did to me!

303
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,361
Tell your mother!

304
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,655
I told you to tell your mother!

305
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:38,907
Sompoh.

306
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,326
How you could do this to me!

307
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,161
How you could do this to me!

308
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,289
How you could do this to me!

309
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,667
How you could do this to me!

310
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,086
How you could do this to me!

311
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,506
How you could do this to me!

312
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,257
How you could do this to me!

313
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,344
How you could do this to me!

314
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,137
Please, just stop.

315
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,723
Please, just stop.

316
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,726
I'm begging you for mercy.

317
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,937
I give up.

318
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,438
Kampuan!

319
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:23,910
Kampuan!

320
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,958
Kampuan!

321
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,753
Kampuan!

322
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,219
Kampuan!

323
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,179
Kampuan!

324
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,225
Kampuan!

325
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:06,721
Khen.

326
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,016
Why are you here?

327
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,191
I couldn’t sleep.

328
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,194
So I came out here.

329
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,530
so I wouldn't disturb you.

330
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,574
Then...

331
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,993
Why didn’t you wake me?

332
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,537
We could've been together.

333
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,965
Mas.

334
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,886
What's really behind that scar?

335
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,057
Did the ghost in that room really hurt you?

336
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:01,818
Khen.

337
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,738
If you want to stay here.

338
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:07,532
Please...

339
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,742
Don’t ask me about that again.

340
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,414
Just being together like this...

341
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,418
Isn't that enough happiness for us?

342
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,634
I understand.

343
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,221
I won't ask you about this again.

344
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,159
Are you going outside?

345
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,871
Today...

346
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,416
I need to run some errands for my father.

347
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,849
Even ghosts have errands to run, huh?

348
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,818
I’ve ordered everyone not to enter the room.

349
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,611
Wait for me here.

350
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,363
Behave yourself.

351
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,156
And don’t go anywhere.

352
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,993
Do you understand, my Moon?

353
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,876
I promise I’ll return quickly.

354
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,597
I think I won’t go after all.

355
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,268
Hurry up and come back, okay?

356
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,897
I promise I’ll wait here and won’t go anywhere.

357
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,166
You should go now.

358
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,005
Wait here, and I’ll hurry back.

359
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,758
You told me yourself.

360
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,970
That a brave person confronts death only once.

361
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,499
Kampuan!

362
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,921
I understand now that you want me to see your story.

363
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,755
But.

364
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,551
I don't understand what you want to tell me.

365
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,806
Can we talk?

366
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,071
I come in peace.

367
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,243
Please don’t hurt me!

368
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,706
Mas!

369
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,124
Mas!

370
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,175
Spirits in this house.

371
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,802
Please accept these offerings.

372
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,847
And the merits I have made.

373
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,975
May you dwell together in happiness.

374
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,230
If Kham...

375
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,233
Has wronged you in any way.

376
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,819
Please forgive him

377
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,822
And may he find peace in a pleasant realm.

378
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,843
Why couldn't she see me?

379
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,100
Or could it be...

380
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,620
Khen.

381
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,039
I told you, didn't I?

382
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,832
Not to go out alone.

383
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,134
What are you afraid of?

384
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,553
You’re the only one who can see me.

385
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,769
I know the truth already.

386
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,608
So you know the truth now...

387
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,488
That you are...

388
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,700
Yes.

389
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,498
The reason you can see me is that we share the same brainwaves.

390
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,210
My friend once told me that.

391
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,171
But...

392
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,465
But you couldn't know.

393
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,719
Which spirit has a similar wavelength to yours.

394
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,970
Like mine?

395
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,888
It's better for you...

396
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,725
To follow what I say.

397
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,396
Seeing you is enough for me.

398
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,067
Now.

399
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,029
Let’s go back to the bedroom.

400
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,530
Mas.

401
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,493
Who is the pregnant woman in the house?

402
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,455
Nuan.

403
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,832
She is a subordinate of Oon.

404
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,002
What about her husband?

405
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,796
Khum is her husband.

406
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,466
He worked with my father.

407
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,926
Since before we even started building this house.

408
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,387
But shortly after that.

409
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,015
He died.

410
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,226
After Nuan had just became pregnant.

411
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,771
And..what happened to him?

412
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,858
Khum was caught trying to secretly cut down a big tree behind the house.

413
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,526
To sell.

414
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,946
But a large trunk fell on him first, causing him to pass away.

415
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,283
That's so sad.

416
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,619
She must be a widow.

417
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,081
Plus, the father and child will never get to see each other.

418
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,211
Because of tha...

419
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,422
We still have time together.

420
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,051
Let’s make the most of it.

421
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,418
Do you like flowers?

422
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,713
I like pink flowers.

423
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,219
I’ll have someone plant more.

424
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,430
So the whole garden can be filled with pink flowers.

425
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,974
Roses

426
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,559
Peonies.

427
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,518
Geraniums.

428
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,727
Camellias.

429
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,201
What about you?

430
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,912
What color flowers do you like?

431
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,873
What food do you enjoy?

432
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,375
Do you like to keep pets?

433
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,753
You ask so many questions.

434
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,464
How can I answer them all?

435
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,800
Then.

436
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,887
Just answer one that you want me to know the most.

437
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,564
I like the moon.

438
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,943
Because it makes me feel calm at night.

439
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,994
I like it too.

440
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,500
The moon?

441
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,881
The person whose name means moon.

442
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,802
You really are a sweet talker.

443
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:54,762
The Moon.

444
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,990
Aun's special Northern Sausage.

445
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,750
Delicious.

446
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,433
Are you ill, Matt?

447
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,230
You’re right.

448
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,025
Are you ill?

449
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,527
I’m fine.

450
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,945
What’s the matter with you?

451
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,697
You’ve been quite..

452
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,699
Isolated recently.

453
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,826
No parties.

454
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,411
Not going anywhere.

455
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,538
Just staying at home, that’s boring!

456
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,499
Actually...

457
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,960
You can go out with your friends, you know.

458
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,463
I can stay home alone.

459
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,299
William will hold a dance party tonight.

460
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,550
I’m going with Suda.

461
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,345
I’m sure you’ll find pretty girls there.

462
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,264
You know what?

463
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,308
You guy enjoy the party.

464
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,393
I've got plenty of things to do here.

465
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,854
And I don't think I'll get to leave.

466
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,230
That’s insane.

467
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,816
Not going anywhere.

468
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,776
Stuck at home.

469
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,031
Look, Smith.I think it's time for you to go.

470
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,282
Why?

471
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,618
Because I've got alot of things to do here.

472
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,914
Thanks for coming.

473
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,167
I'll see you later.

474
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,503
Are you sure nothing’s wrong with you?

475
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,382
Absolutely fine.

476
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:36,924
Alright?

477
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,300
I'll see you later.

478
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,302
Bye.

479
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,436
This is so frustrating.

480
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,816
Where do you have run your errands?

481
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,282
My business...

482
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,202
Is just to be with you.

483
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,458
You must know that when you act sweet.

484
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,376
It’s really adorable.

485
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,879
I didn’t know that.

486
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,890
Oh no, Khen. I completely forgot!

487
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,184
That my step mother and my sister are coming back from Lamphun today.

488
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,770
You should go wait for me in the bedroom.

489
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,147
And I’ll hurry back.

490
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:34,857
Okay.

491
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,455
Mas.

492
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,457
Are you unwell?

493
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:52,833
No.

494
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,085
I'm fine.

495
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,091
I really missed you, Mas.

496
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,763
That's the thing, I thought you would follow us.

497
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,267
I had to stay and take care of things at home.

498
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,146
Go sit in the garden with me, okay?

499
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,774
I have so many stories to tell you.

500
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,570
I'll prepare some snacks and bring them to you.

501
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,740
For all three of you.

502
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,867
I need to go rest for a bit.

503
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,500
Come to the garden with me.

504
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,378
But...

505
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,596
Uncle’s new house has a seesaw.

506
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,473
Dara and I had so much fun playing on it.

507
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,392
We should have one at our house too.

508
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,312
Sure.

509
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,356
I’ll get someone to set one up for us.

510
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,613
That’s the sound of the piano, isn’t it?

511
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,702
I don’t hear anything.

512
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,746
Are you ears ri?

513
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,123
Why aren't you hearing it?

514
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,625
Even I can hear it.

515
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,254
I can hear it too.

516
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,841
Or is...

517
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,551
Someone playing your piano.

518
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,927
Without permission?

519
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,973
Who would dare to do that?

520
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,684
I’ll go deal with it myself.

521
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,105
I'll be back, okay?

522
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,253
My younger siblings heard the piano playing that I didn't play.

523
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,504
And they were all frightened.

524
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,979
Do you know what happens...

525
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,440
To troublemakers?

526
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,444
How would they be punished?

527
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,453
Did you find anyone playing?

528
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,122
No one at all.

529
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,458
The cat just ran across the keys.

530
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,960
Let's go back to Dara.

531
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:42,753
Yes.

532
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,214
I’ll take care of that cat later.

533
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,375
Tan.

534
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,167
Nam-wah.

535
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:24,711
Tan.

536
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,380
Nam-wah.

537
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,047
Where are you.

538
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,591
Nam-wah.

539
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,015
Nam-wah.

540
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:37,683
Where are you.

541
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,353
Khen.

542
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,070
Are you trying to run away from me?

543
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,782
No, I’m not.

544
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,786
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

545
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,748
Shall we walk that way?

546
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,504
It's obvious.

547
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,008
You’re trying to escape the punishment you deserve.

548
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,677
I'm not running away.

549
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,637
And I don’t want to.

550
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,599
Can we go over there?

551
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:21,935
Please.

552
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,231
Just trust me.

553
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,171
There's a pond here?

554
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,926
It feels so refreshing.

555
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,430
This pond.

556
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,183
Was dug by the workers when they started building the house.

557
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,437
There's fish in the water too.

558
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,898
Do you want to try to catch some?

559
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,276
Mas.

560
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,612
Don't play like this!

561
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,823
Khen.

562
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,200
Is something wrong?

563
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,371
Mas.

564
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,833
How did your father acquire this land?

565
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,421
He bought it from a respected elder.

566
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:19,052
I heard that this piece of land has a scary story.

567
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,388
So he sold it at a low price.

568
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,141
My father didn’t mind, so he bought it.

569
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,267
What is that story?

570
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,187
Originally.

571
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,731
The previous owner went to war.

572
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,109
When he returned.

573
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,694
He found...

574
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,071
That his wife had run off with another man.

575
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,365
He was very sad.

576
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,326
So he decided to sell this piece of land.

577
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,915
Why are you asking that?

578
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,460
It's nothing.

579
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,094
Let's head back.

580
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,096
It looks like it's about to rain.

581
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,184
Kampuan!

582
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:10,687
Khen.

583
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,940
What wrong with you?

584
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:17,652
Khen.

585
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,409
Mas.

586
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,080
I'm scared.

587
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,877
Don't be afraid.

588
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,962
I'm right here with you.

589
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,050
Can you keep walking?

590
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,517
Khen.

591
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,151
Khen.

592
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,447
Mas.

593
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:05,492
I...

594
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,327
I see her.

595
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,945
The picture of my mother really did save her.

596
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,741
Are you Mas's mother?

597
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,660
I want to go back to him.

598
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,245
What do I need to do?

599
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,497
Those who are meant to be together.

600
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,791
Must exist in the same state of being.

601
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:00,588
How dare you throw the truth in my face like this?

602
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:01,965
If you see him...

603
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,883
Give him a hug for me.

604
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,885
And please tell him.

605
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,055
To live his life happily.
