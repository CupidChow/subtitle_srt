1
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,064
Think of the things that make you feel safe.

2
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,818
How did you do that?

3
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,196
That’s my computer.

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,658
If I can go back to Bangkok in my dream.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,453
Then I should be able to do it in reality too.

6
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,620
Khen, you're not coming with us?

7
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,916
Was I in your dream?

8
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,335
No.

9
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,129
See?

10
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,090
I already told you that if I'm in it, you can't leave either.

11
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
What am I even thinking about right now?

12
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:09,754
Limbo is a place after death for those who have not been judged to enter heaven or hell,

13
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,510
awaiting release from this realm of death.

14
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,616
This house must be Mas's limbo.

15
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,995
Every time we meet Mas, it happens there.

16
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,664
But when we're overwhelmed...

17
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,134
Mas!

18
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,051
Help me!

19
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:57,844
Khen!

20
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,190
It often ends up in that room.

21
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,445
Or is it that Mas can't see that tree because it's not Mas's limbo,

22
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,615
But rather the limbo of that woman?

23
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,796
Khampuan your hair is really beautiful.

24
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:41,846
Could I ask you to comb my hair for me forever?

25
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,184
Are you serious? Don’t change your mind.

26
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,644
You should stop appearing whenever you like.

27
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,481
Sorry, I didn’t know you were getting dressed.

28
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,075
Look at me.

29
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,338
Are you heading out?

30
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:09,053
No, but tonight we’re having a party in the main hall,

31
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,682
Just among close friends.

32
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,603
Then...can I wait for you here?

33
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,981
There’s something important I want to ask you.

34
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
I promise I’ll behave,

35
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,320
- sit here and wait quietly

36
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,698
That's not always the case.

37
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,409
You come as you please,

38
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,912
And you’re going to ask me about things that You arecurious about like that?

39
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,165
I think that’s asking for too much.

40
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,960
I thought we were friends.

41
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,840
And another thing, even if you don’t let me wait...

42
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,093
I wouldn't know how to get back.

43
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:55,850
Alright then,

44
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,395
Since you’re here,

45
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,065
If you help me with something,

46
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,444
I might agree to fulfill what you’re asking for.

47
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,146
Can you please go get the biscuits from the kitchen for me?

48
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,523
Have all the guests arrived already?

49
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,899
Are you still going to add more?

50
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,485
Nuan said to bring some just in case.

51
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,404
The ladies really like these small biscuits.

52
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,323
If the guests like them this much.

53
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,992
How will we be able to make them in the kitchen on time?

54
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,202
That's right.

55
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,330
Remember, don’t let anyone see you at all.

56
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,958
because I can’t guarantee what will happen.

57
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,752
How can I do it without anyone seeing me?

58
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:06,754
That's your problem.

59
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,470
Why am I doing this?

60
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,880
The party tonight is actually organized for my close friend.

61
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,007
His name is Smith.

62
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,259
You can easily notice him.

63
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,679
Because he will be the only one in the event wearing black-framed glasses.

64
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,433
Tonight, he is going to propose to his girlfriend.

65
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,605
I need you to go get the ring box that Smith left for me.

66
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,399
In the drawer of my father's desk.

67
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,028
And bring it to me at the party before all the guests leave.

68
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,703
This is the key to the drawer.

69
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,418
And what if I don’t do it?

70
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,213
Then I won’t be able to help you with what you’ve asked for either.

71
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,594
Fine. You go wait in the ballroom.

72
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,473
I will make sure your friend gets his bride tonight.

73
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,392
I’ll be waiting.

74
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,043
For a ghost, he was such a cute kid.

75
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,259
What the hell.

76
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,412
Today, Grandma Oon prepared all the food.

77
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,081
It looks great!

78
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,001
If it was not for her, we would not be able to eat delicious food like this.

79
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,797
What are you laughing at, Mas?

80
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:23,886
Nothing,  I just thought of something funny.

81
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,888
Excuse me for a moment.

82
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,405
So you did it.

83
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,992
This was nothing, easy as pie.

84
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,592
What are you laughing at, Mas?

85
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,890
Here’s your ring.

86
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,268
I’ll go back and wait in the room.

87
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,394
Mas.

88
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,022
Let's go sit on the sofa. Everyone is waiting for you.

89
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,623
How's everyone doing?

90
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,668
I'm doing great, I love the party, and the wine.

91
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,879
I can tell you've had a bit to much to drink.

92
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,631
Have you guys tried the food?

93
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:43,924
Not yet?

94
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,259
I'm too afraid to...

95
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,719
I think you'd like it though.

96
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,804
Looks horrible, no.

97
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,818
Your outfit is really funny.

98
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
You should go change.

99
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,363
Go.

100
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,865
Mas.

101
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,367
Did your father go back to the war in England?

102
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,830
You must be so worried.

103
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,415
I'm not worried.

104
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,667
He's..safe and sound

105
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,675
He said he knew that his dad will be safe.

106
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,385
How do you know?

107
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,223
Because someone told me.

108
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,225
And....

109
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,727
I believe him.

110
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,938
Come on.

111
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,357
Do not be serious.

112
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,775
We're at a party!

113
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,069
Let’s have some fun.

114
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,990
Ladies,

115
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,575
We'll take care of this mess.

116
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,660
And we will be right back.

117
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,138
You didn’t keep your side of our agreement.

118
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,397
Well, you didn’t plan to give that box to your friend, did you?

119
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:20,164
Your friend wouldn’t use cufflinks to propose to a woman, would he?

120
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,590
Was it fun, fooling me like this?

121
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,599
I’m sorry.

122
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,437
How about I give these to you?

123
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,493
Consider it a reward for tonight.

124
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,246
For your impressive performance.

125
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,135
Alright, I’ll keep my promise.

126
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,846
You can ask me anything you want.

127
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,226
I'll ask you straight up then.

128
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,149
Does this house have a dark past?

129
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:31,985
Dark in what way?

130
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,988
Something that might be damaging.

131
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,990
Something you’d want to hide from others.

132
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,789
And why would you think I’d tell you about anything shameful?

133
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,208
Because you trust me.

134
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,795
You know I’d never reveal anything that would harm this place.

135
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,261
You trust me? The same person you called a ghostly foreign child who died in this house?

136
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,096
I'm sorry.

137
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,765
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

138
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:11,567
I'm sorry.

139
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,069
Alright, I understand now.

140
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,031
I’ve never heard of anything disgraceful happening here.

141
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,161
If anyone has tarnished the family’s name,

142
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,495
It’s most likely me.

143
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:24,913
You?

144
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:25,998
And has there been anything?

145
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,751
Do you think I have anything?

146
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
You’re this handsome,

147
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,217
Look at all the women who flock to you.

148
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,928
Maybe there was a case of cheating?

149
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,019
I didn’t think you’d be interested in my love life.

150
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,565
Let’s not talk about that.

151
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,235
What about the woman in the room downstairs?

152
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,572
I feel like there’s something strange being hidden there.

153
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,745
She’s been there since I can remember.

154
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,122
No one interferes with her.

155
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,460
Then why is she in that room?

156
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,920
Is she imprisoned there?

157
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,089
She imprisoned herself.

158
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,800
She only comes out when...

159
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,760
When what?

160
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,725
Khen.

161
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,894
Can you stop asking me questions?

162
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,105
Why is she still in this house?

163
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,775
What was the cause of her death?

164
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,027
Why is her spirit still bound to this place, not moving on?

165
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,111
Enough, Khen.

166
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,284
I’m sorry.

167
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,039
I just thought that knowing about this might help me break free from this loop.

168
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,974
I still owe you something, remember?

169
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,310
What is it about?

170
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,574
Who was it that once asked me to play the piano for them?

171
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,686
This is "Lao Duang Duen."

172
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,272
It's "Lao Dum Naen Kewian."

173
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,819
In my era, we call it "Lao Duang Duen."

174
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,030
It’s probably because of the lyrics.

175
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,535
It's such a beautifully moving song.

176
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,040
Who would've known that beneath it's beauty,

177
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,543
There’s a story of heartbreak?

178
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,546
Prince Phichai Mahintharodom.

179
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,632
Did not end up with Princess Chomchuen.

180
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,887
He wrote this song to express his feelings.

181
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,056
Hoping to send his love to the princess through the music.

182
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,602
What a truly sad story,

183
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,063
That it ended that way.

184
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,443
It’s the lack of love that’s truly sad.

185
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,406
Now,

186
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,951
They must be happily together in the next life.

187
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,669
No...

188
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,548
We shouldn't...

189
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,395
What are you afraid of?

190
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,198
Let me go.

191
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,908
Let me go.

192
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,398
Don’t cry, okay?

193
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,612
Even though your mother has passed,

194
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,489
you still have a father who loves you very much.

195
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,909
And in the future,

196
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,329
You will have two younger sisters who will love you dearly.

197
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,999
You will grow up to be a wonderful young man,

198
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,876
A support for your family.

199
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,672
Stay strong, okay?

200
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,570
Tell him.

201
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,322
Tell him.

202
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,406
Tell him.

203
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,992
Khen!

204
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,743
Wake up!

205
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,119
Khen!

206
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,038
Can you hear me?

207
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,628
Get up slowly.

208
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,633
What happened?

209
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,010
I should be the one asking you that.

210
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,682
I came back to find you lying on the floor.

211
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,600
I tried to wake you, but you wouldn't budge.

212
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,104
Alright, sit up first.

213
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,401
Take your time sitting up.

214
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,742
For a moment, I thought you were dead.

215
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,168
You’re trying to meet him again, aren’t you?

216
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,628
That Mas?

217
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,841
We need to find a way out of here on our own,

218
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,679
not rely on a spirit that might kill us at any time.

219
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,889
He’s not what you think, Bing.

220
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,352
I’m sure he doesn’t intend harm to anyone.

221
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,563
Khen, I have to tell you something.

222
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,858
Ghosts and humans cannot be friends.

223
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,153
You and him are from different worlds.

224
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,322
His world is not real.

225
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,534
He created it to haunt the living.

226
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,411
I already said he’s not haunting me.

227
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:07,954
I want to help him.

228
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,414
And I'm gladly doing so.

229
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,623
Help him from what?

230
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,667
From whatever is holding him back.

231
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,507
Nice, right?

232
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:25,013
Before this, everything we did was to help each other escape from here.

233
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,976
But now it seems you want to help him.

234
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,436
While we’re left behind.

235
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,189
That’s not how it is, Bing.

236
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,941
Do you realize.

237
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,069
That..you’re being possessed by him.

238
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,489
Possessed? You’re exaggerating.

239
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,657
He’s even trying to drive me away.

240
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,744
If he’s driving you away, why would you still want to go back to him?

241
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,455
Because he knows that even if he pushes you away,

242
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,081
You’ll still pursue him.

243
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,876
Isn’t that called possession?

244
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,378
And what about those sleeping pills?

245
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,088
How long are you going to use them?

246
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:00,632
Enough!

247
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,509
I won’t wait for him to take you away.

248
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,843
Bing!

249
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,553
You’ve gone too far!

250
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,347
No, it isn't.

251
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,515
You need to regain your senses.

252
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,224
Enough!

253
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,768
From now on, whatever I do.

254
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,020
Don't ever interfere.

255
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:16,898
Stop it,Khen..

256
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,776
Try to calm down and think carefully.

257
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,530
What Bing said is true.

258
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:29,702
Sit down first.

259
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,205
Calm down.

260
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,590
You too, take it easy.

261
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,297
I’m sorry.

262
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,414
I don’t want to lose you.

263
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,883
I’m sorry.

264
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,808
I’m sorry.

265
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,269
For raising my voice.

266
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,451
You really overdo it.

267
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,873
What as waste, what'll I do if I can't sleep?

268
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,910
Khen.

269
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,833
Khen.

270
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,376
What’s up?

271
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,381
I can’t sleep.

272
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,510
Should I go find the sleeping pills in the trash?

273
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,847
Not like that...

274
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,433
Hey, what are you two talking about at this hour?

275
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,393
You’re making me restless too.

276
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,441
Should I give you a punch instead?

277
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,693
I’ll give you two back.

278
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,156
Just kidding.

279
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,874
I’ll sing you a song.

280
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,086
What song should I sing?

281
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,925
"Lao Dum Naen Kewian."

282
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,559
I mean "Lao Duang Duen."

283
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:04,977
Can you sing it?

284
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,359
You picked a haunting song.

285
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,528
There are so many songs to choose from,

286
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,238
And you pick an old Thai song?

287
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,199
Haunting? This is a love song.

288
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,402
What should we do now?

289
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,072
We’re back in the same loop again.

290
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,868
I miss Tan and Nam-Wah.

291
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,374
How did they manage to get out of here?

292
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,462
Should we try going through the photos we took together?

293
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,963
Maybe we’ll find some clues.

294
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,301
I’ve seen them all, there’s nothing.

295
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,930
That’s because you were the one looking at them.

296
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,473
What?

297
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,725
Just kidding.

298
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,563
We should check them again together.

299
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,782
Where are you going?

300
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,787
I’m going to find something to eat in the kitchen.

301
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,751
Are you going to follow me?

302
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:13,090
I was just asking. No need to snap at me.

303
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,060
Toh.

304
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,688
Should we follow him.

305
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,522
Stop right there!

306
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,596
Som Pho.

307
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,765
You go outside for a while.

308
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,476
I have something to discuss with Kam Puan.

309
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,232
Alright.

310
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,286
Kam Puan, how old are you this year?

311
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,873
Eighteen years old.

312
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:41,256
I’ll arrange for you to marry...

313
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,928
What are you doing here.

314
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,513
What are you looking at?

315
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,558
Nothing.

316
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,814
Then why are you just standing here?

317
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:57,940
Are you okay?

318
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,277
I’m fine, really.

319
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,830
Alright.

320
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:09,511
Let’s go.

321
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,391
Let’s go outside.

322
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,228
Where to?

323
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,036
Khen!

324
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,121
Khen!

325
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:43,921
Khen!

326
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,425
Aren't you going to tell us what’s going on?

327
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,636
Why did you suddenly bring us here?

328
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,517
I found something.

329
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,854
But I can’t tell you the details yet.

330
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,107
Khen.

331
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:09,905
Khen.

332
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,110
I'll be right over there for a moment.

333
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,130
What are you trying to tell me?

334
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,265
Khen.

335
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,689
We should go back.

336
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,858
Something doesn't feel right.

337
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,576
Mas!

338
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,785
Help me!

339
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,712
Mas!

340
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,754
Help me!

341
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,447
Keeping a distance like this.

342
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,324
makes us look like a monk and a woman, doesn’t it?

343
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,704
What monk would sleep in the same bed as a woman?

344
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,207
Is that your hut?

345
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:32,918
Yes.

346
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:39,090
I’ve never brought anyone here, not even my sisters.

347
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,592
Why did you bring me here?

348
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:45,222
Because I feel safe when I'm with you.
