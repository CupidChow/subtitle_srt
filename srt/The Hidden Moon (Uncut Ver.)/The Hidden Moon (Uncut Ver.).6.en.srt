1
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,155
Khen.

2
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,951
Aren't you going to tell us what’s going on?

3
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,703
I found something.

4
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:38,663
Khen.

5
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,960
Tell him!

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,796
What are you trying to tell me?

7
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,399
Mas!

8
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,776
Help me!

9
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,238
Mas!

10
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,490
Help me!

11
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,416
Khen!

12
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,505
Khen!

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,297
Mas!

14
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,091
Help me!

15
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,357
Khen!

16
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,543
It’s okay, Khen.

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,796
I’m here now.

18
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,687
Can I please stay here?

19
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,606
I'm scared.

20
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,610
Please don't make me go out there.

21
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,114
Change first.

22
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,534
You might catch a cold.

23
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:38,111
I’m glad you like the gift I gave you.

24
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,244
I like the gift and the person who gave it.

25
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,589
You should rest.

26
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,052
I’ll go sleep in my father’s office.

27
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,262
Wait.

28
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,309
Why don’t you stay here?

29
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,194
I think...

30
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,740
We shouldn’t get too close.

31
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,536
It’s not because I don’t like you.

32
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,705
In fact,

33
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,585
It’s the opposite.

34
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,716
Can you please stay here with me?

35
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,972
I’ll stay in my corner,

36
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,682
And you stay in yours.

37
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,187
Just seeing you nearby makes me feel safe.

38
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,381
Do I look funny in these clothes?

39
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:23,841
No,

40
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,134
You look cute.

41
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,397
Keeping a distance like this.

42
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,816
Makes us look like a monk and a woman, doesn’t it?

43
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,154
What monk would sleep in the same bed as a woman?

44
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,247
Good night.

45
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,458
Sweet dreams, Mas.

46
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,513
Khen.

47
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,392
You can’t stay here any longer.

48
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,234
What did you say?

49
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,154
It’s not that I want to send you away.

50
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,531
But.

51
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,409
Someone will come to clean this room soon.

52
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,038
I don’t think you want to run into anyone, do you?

53
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,418
And what should I do?

54
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,801
Go change,

55
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,511
and wait for me at the car.

56
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,264
I’ll take you somewhere else.

57
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,416
There's a stream?

58
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,379
Yes.

59
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,507
My father and I came here to fish.

60
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,470
Do you enjoy fishing?

61
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:39,847
Not at all.

62
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,643
I think sitting and waiting around is so boring.

63
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,065
But I liked spending time with my father here.

64
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,612
It felt like it was our special time together.

65
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,936
Is that your hut?

66
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,147
Yes.

67
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,984
My father built this.

68
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,444
As a hideaway for me.

69
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,035
I’ve never brought anyone here.

70
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,996
Not even my sisters.

71
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,039
But.

72
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,000
Why did you bring me here?

73
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,894
Because.

74
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,273
I feel safe when I'm with you.

75
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:50,978
Let's go.

76
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,374
And....

77
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,085
What about your life.

78
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,087
My life?

79
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,298
There’s nothing too exciting.

80
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,134
In my time,

81
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,346
Life is much faster and more convenient than it is now.

82
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:30,726
But...

83
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,394
It’s not easy.

84
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,355
We have to compete all the time.

85
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,233
The weak ones are left behind.

86
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,612
In your time,

87
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,907
There’s still no end to the fighting, is there?

88
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:45,950
No.

89
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,452
I have to fight in my own way, too.

90
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,539
And...

91
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,875
How was your childhood?

92
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,880
I was a very mischievous kid.

93
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,134
I doubt that mischief ended during childhood.

94
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,388
You’re very good.

95
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,515
At teasing people.

96
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,350
Always noticing the smallest details.

97
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,977
Always knowing what’s going on.

98
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,363
What else am I good at?

99
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,939
Mas.

100
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,904
What happened last night?

101
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,366
I’ve never disrespected or done anything wrong in your house.

102
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,202
I was just doing my job.

103
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,884
Maybe it was a warning that you’re allowed to be here.

104
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,555
You have your path,

105
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,266
And I have mine.

106
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,062
We shouldn’t hold each other back.

107
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:42,942
But.

108
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,277
We’re already connected.

109
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,488
Aren’t we?

110
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,453
That’s why I’m here with you.

111
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,581
There has to be a reason we met.

112
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,542
If we weren’t meant to be connected,

113
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,462
You could say, why was I sent to meet you?

114
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,217
I don’t know the answer, Khen.

115
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,804
I’ve been through so much.

116
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,557
And I still don’t understand why it has to be me.

117
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,143
Who has to face all of this.

118
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,791
What are you doing?

119
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,419
Mas.

120
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,587
When you’re with me.

121
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,506
You don’t need to hide it.

122
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,263
If you don’t want to talk about it.

123
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,181
I won’t ask.

124
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,935
I just want you to be...

125
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,813
..comfortable around me.

126
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,360
Like how I feel comfortable

127
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,738
When I’m with you.

128
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,787
Khen.

129
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,124
Do you ever feel confused.

130
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,251
About what’s right...

131
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:25,961
Or wrong?

132
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,717
What’s right for me is...

133
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,428
What my heart wants.

134
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,723
It might not always be correct.

135
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,350
But I never regret it.

136
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,520
We only live once, after all.

137
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,943
Like when I decided to take sleeping pills just to meet you.

138
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,072
I felt like I was in a vampire movie.

139
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,824
In my time, vampires are handsome.

140
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,244
And lure humans into traps.

141
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,127
Then bite their necks and suck their blood to stay alive.

142
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,428
Am I talking nonsense again?

143
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,889
I just really like watching vampire movies.

144
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,644
Not at all.

145
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,398
I was just thinking...

146
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,488
How much your blood...

147
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,491
Must taste so sweet.

148
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,434
Don’t joke like that.

149
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,039
I never knew that ghosts...

150
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,207
I mean, spirits...

151
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,794
Could still be playful, just like when they were alive.

152
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,882
It’s not just playfulness.

153
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,009
There’s also anger,

154
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:38,760
Fear,

155
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,138
Sadness.

156
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,514
Joy.

157
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,266
Loneliness.

158
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,100
Love...

159
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,022
Is that possible?

160
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,736
I’m not sure.

161
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,909
You know, in the days we didn’t see each other,

162
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,118
I missed you.

163
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,581
I...

164
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,916
You should say,

165
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,251
I missed you too.

166
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,796
Don’t tell me that it’s not true.

167
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,549
Because your eyes...

168
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,052
Can’t lie as well as your words can.

169
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,188
You’re both innocent.

170
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,106
And mischievous.

171
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,861
Which one do you like more.

172
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,155
innocent...

173
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,616
Or...

174
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,829
Mischievous?

175
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,922
What am I going to do with you.

176
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,175
Do what your heart desires.

177
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,609
You shouldn’t...

178
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
we shouldn’t.

179
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,255
This kiss...

180
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,175
Will kill us.

181
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,094
Then kill me.

182
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,595
Kill me now.

183
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,307
Does it hurt?

184
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,396
Just a little.

185
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,525
Next time.

186
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,987
I’ll be more careful so your soft skin doesn’t bruise.

187
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,118
Your hands are much naughtier than I thought.

188
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,376
Do you want to do it again?

189
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,299
Please.

190
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,015
Looks like it’s going to rain.

191
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,642
Let’s hurry up and go.

192
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,121
Don’t be afraid, Moon.

193
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,707
I’m right here with you.

194
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,091
Breathe.

195
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,936
Close your eyes.

196
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,502
Khen.

197
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,931
It’s truly amazing.

198
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,313
it’s happening again.

199
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,900
The connection between the two worlds.

200
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,367
In here is your world.

201
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,248
While outside is mine.

202
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,544
So.

203
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,172
That means you have to leave me now, right?

204
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,301
Take care of yourself.

205
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,302
The moon.

206
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,389
Wait.

207
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,814
I’ve seen your world.

208
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,317
Do you want to see my world as well?

209
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,369
How could I refuse such an invitation.

210
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,081
Welcome to my world.

211
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,095
How well do you understand Thai?

212
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,522
You seem to have forgotten who raised me.

213
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,527
Really?

214
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,030
Prove it.

215
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,699
What does it mean?

216
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,167
When I look at the moon,

217
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,005
I realized...

218
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,674
That it doesn't look like your face at all.

219
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,178
Because the surface of the moon is full of blemishes.

220
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,057
Shaped like a rabbit.

221
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,478
It can’t compare to your face.

222
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,189
Because your face...

223
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,067
Is truly beautiful.

224
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,487
Not even the smile of an angel...

225
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,159
Can compare.

226
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,457
I can translate it like this.

227
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,376
Do you like it?

228
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,295
The moon.

229
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,172
Yes.

230
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,069
You're someone who likes to win, aren't you?

231
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,697
Not really,

232
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,577
I just like...

233
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,789
You.

234
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,466
Hey.

235
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,104
That's strange.

236
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,442
Usually, there are a lot of people here.

237
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,529
Why is there no one here today?

238
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,293
Or perhaps...

239
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,465
We’ve come back on the day of the Loy Krathong festival in my era.

240
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,263
But.

241
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,556
It’s strange.

242
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,393
Why does it seem like the moon isn’t quite full?

243
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,483
I have something to tell you.

244
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,109
What?

245
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,403
Do you remember...

246
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,947
When you once asked me...

247
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,866
Whether ghosts can love?

248
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,872
Now I have the answer.

249
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,669
I’m sure they can.

250
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,307
You won’t let me go, will you?

251
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,352
What about you?

252
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,854
Do you want to let me go?

253
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,616
Come on.

254
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,035
I have a place where I want to take you to.

255
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,550
That’s the Nawarat Bridge.

256
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,346
I'm not sure if that bridge existed in your era.

257
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,349
Is that the Nawarat Bridge?

258
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,937
In my time, it was still made of teak.

259
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,275
Then I’ll drive us across the bridge to see.

260
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,906
Your era is truly amazing.

261
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,748
There's nothing more amazing than the fact that we met.

262
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,254
You’re becoming sweeter every day.

263
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,766
I can be even sweeter.

264
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,436
Want a taste?

265
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,277
I’ll definitely taste it.

266
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,439
Today is the Yi Peng festival.

267
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,691
People will be out floating their krathongs.

268
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,036
It must be like floating the 'sapaow' in my era, right?

269
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,707
Let’s find some krathongs to float.

270
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,709
I don’t want to float.

271
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,381
Come on.

272
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,050
You’re already here.

273
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,094
Just float with me once.

274
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,016
I think you should stay here.

275
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,477
I’ll go buy a krathong for you.

276
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,939
So you won’t have to meet anyone either.

277
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,442
Okay?

278
00:37:59,193 --> 00:37:59,986
Khen...

279
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,582
Come float the sapaow with me

280
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,544
So we can float away misfortune and sorrow.

281
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,344
I wish for the sickness...

282
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,471
To float away with this sapaow.

283
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,223
So that my mother gets better soon.

284
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,448
I will get better quickly.

285
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,658
OK.

286
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,173
Is it all gone?

287
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,767
Are you looking for a krathong?

288
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,519
I have one. Do you want it?

289
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,105
How much will you sell it for?

290
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,440
I don’t really want money.

291
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,192
First, tell me your name.

292
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,242
My name is Khen.

293
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,077
I’m Tin.

294
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,370
Tinkorn.

295
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,454
Which means the sun.

296
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,667
I told you my name.

297
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,960
Where is my krathong?

298
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,547
Sure, but you have to float it with me.

299
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,384
I have someone waiting for me.

300
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:29,885
Are you sure?

301
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,011
Where are they?

302
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,271
Then I won’t take it.

303
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,822
Mas.

304
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:51,949
Mas.

305
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,201
Mas.

306
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,454
Mas.

307
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,204
See?

308
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,790
No one’s actually floating with you.

309
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:01,292
There is.

310
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,835
But I don’t know where he went.

311
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,046
People like us wouldn’t have anyone to float with anyway.

312
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,590
Let’s float together.

313
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,259
Who do you think you are?

314
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,012
Mas.

315
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,513
Mas.

316
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,599
Mas.

317
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,383
Mas.

318
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,431
Mas.

319
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:03,938
Mas.

320
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,615
Mas.

321
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,549
Please keep mas safe.

322
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,094
I’ll trade anything for that.

323
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:52,903
Mas.

324
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,533
Where have you been?

325
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,205
I’m sorry.

326
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,165
I went for a walk.

327
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,126
Mas.

328
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,128
Don’t disappear like that again.

329
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,422
I’m very worried about you.

330
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,355
We should thank that young man.

331
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,400
For bringing me back to you.

332
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:36,030
Did he see you?

333
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:46,915
Take this.

334
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,382
Since you do have someone to float with, as you said.

335
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,468
The person I was waiting.

336
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,678
Probably won't come.

337
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,432
Please take care of it for me.

338
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,638
Are you okay?

339
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,184
I...

340
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,978
Miss my mother.

341
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,568
The last time I floated a sapaow.

342
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,571
I did it with her.

343
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,867
Not too long after that,

344
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,913
she left me.

345
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,376
I’m afraid...

346
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,421
If I float with you...

347
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,633
You will...

348
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,985
Don’t worry.

349
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,154
No matter what happens.

350
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,657
I promise I'll find a way to come back to you.

351
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,582
Do you know in my time,

352
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,419
We believe that if a couple floats together.

353
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,380
They will be together forever.

354
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,762
I hope that’s true.

355
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,135
That boat over there.

356
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,557
What did you say?

357
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,852
It’s nothing.

358
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,314
I think we really are meant to be together.

359
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,635
I want to be with you longer.

360
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,181
But you know I can’t.

361
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,893
I will cross over to be with you.

362
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:47,651
Mas!

363
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,278
Mas!

364
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,782
Mas!

365
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,743
Help me please!

366
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,578
Mas!

367
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:01,873
Mas!

368
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,417
Mas!

369
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,668
Help me please!

370
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,254
Mas!

371
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,506
Help me please!

372
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,425
Mas!

373
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,594
Mas!

374
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,992
I think you two should go ahead without me.

375
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,577
I'll catch up with you later.

376
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,538
Khen, I think it’s time to stop.

377
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,129
You smell lovely.

378
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,422
And your hair smell lovely too.

379
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,090
It never fades away.

380
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,384
If we have a daughter.
