1
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,189
Don’t be afraid, Moon.

2
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,775
I’m right here with you.

3
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,445
Close your eyes.

4
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,288
It’s truly amazing.

5
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,500
You're someone who likes to win, aren't you?

6
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,879
I like...

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,882
You.

8
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,633
Mas!

9
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,552
Help me please!

10
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,095
Mas!

11
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,348
Mas!

12
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:58,975
Mas!

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,351
Help me please!

14
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,856
Help me please!

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:06,900
Mas!

16
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,320
Mas!

17
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:12,906
Mas!

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:13,907
Khen!

19
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,452
What happened?

20
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,287
How did you end up here?

21
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:23,958
Toh.

22
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,502
Khen's back!

23
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,044
Hurry!

24
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,088
Stat!

25
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,258
Khen, where the hell have you been?

26
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:38,765
Come in.

27
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,011
Khen.

28
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,472
How could you let yourself get so involved into this?

29
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,564
Didn't I tell you that ghosts and humans can never be friends?

30
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,741
Let’s get out of here. The three of us.

31
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,621
And we'll never come back here again.

32
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,334
If we stay here any longer, we’ll just be consumed.

33
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,922
Let’s get out of here.

34
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,885
Even if it means living on the streets.

35
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
Or hiding underground.

36
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,015
We won’t come back here.

37
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,853
Can I have a little more time?

38
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,647
Khen!

39
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,236
Please.

40
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,364
At least let me say goodbye to him first.

41
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,285
I hope it'll be an actual goodbye.

42
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,475
Khen.

43
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,393
What happened?

44
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,436
Khen.

45
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,021
Let's me go!

46
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,606
Let's me go!

47
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,487
Tell him.

48
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,114
Tell him.

49
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,323
Tell him.

50
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:46,828
Mas!

51
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,621
Help me please!

52
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:49,789
Mas!

53
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,293
By the way, who is that female ghost?

54
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,295
Why does she have to keep trying to harm me?

55
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,046
She harms others indiscriminately.

56
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,257
As long as that person can see her.

57
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,801
She will keep appearing over and over.

58
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,596
So how did you get rid of her?

59
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,309
She’s just afraid of what she knows could harm her.

60
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,487
I have something I want you both to help me with.

61
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,339
If only I had some kind of spell.

62
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,299
I could nail it in with a curse.

63
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,468
And prevent it from coming out to cause trouble again.

64
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,595
We have talismans.

65
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,224
And where did you get that talisman?

66
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,018
I made it.

67
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,690
Ghosts don't just haunt people, you know.

68
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,443
If they believe that something can harm them.

69
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,903
They'll be struck by immense fear.

70
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,031
It’s time...

71
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,034
We trick them back.

72
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,036
Damn, Khen.

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,122
If we get back, I'll open an institute for you.

74
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,061
You guys should get going.

75
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,480
I’ll catch up later.

76
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,149
No, Khen.

77
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,701
If we leave, we’re leaving together.

78
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,246
If you don’t want to go.

79
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,998
We’ll just die together here.

80
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,848
Khen, I think it’s time to stop.

81
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,730
It’s been days.

82
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,358
If he really wanted to show himself.

83
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,944
He would have shown up by now.

84
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,120
Let me wait here for one last night.

85
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,502
If I don’t end up seeing him.

86
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,007
We’ll leave.

87
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,769
Okay.

88
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,451
Khen!

89
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,537
Do you ever feel confused.

90
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,788
About what’s right...

91
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,831
Or wrong?

92
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:29,655
Khen!

93
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,503
Do you remember when you asked me...

94
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,171
Whether ghosts could love?

95
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,632
I’m sure they can.

96
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,723
You won’t let me go, will you?

97
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,600
What about you?

98
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,020
Do you really want to let me go?

99
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,021
Are you okay?

100
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,442
I’m afraid...

101
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,529
If I float with you...

102
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,408
You will...

103
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,671
It's okay, Mas.

104
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,756
No matter what,

105
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,135
I promise I'll find a way to come back to you.

106
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:26,868
Mas.

107
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,621
I’m returning your notebook.

108
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,748
As for..

109
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,006
The love I have for you.

110
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,968
I won’t take it back.

111
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,857
Khen, are you ready to leave?

112
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,694
Okay! I’ll hurry down.

113
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,851
You carry this much stuff, you're not gonna be able to run for anything.

114
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,354
If you'll need anything..

115
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,938
Don’t come asking me.

116
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,814
Fine.

117
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,441
But if you can't take the weight.

118
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,984
Don’t come asking me to help carry it.

119
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,867
We're ready, Khen.

120
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,502
Let's go.

121
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,401
Looks like someone doesn't want us leaving this place.

122
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,286
I can’t take this anymore.

123
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,497
What the hell do you want?

124
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,960
Bing! Be careful!

125
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,044
Stop! Stop right now!

126
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,255
-Calm down!
-Stop, that's enough!

127
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,427
Calm down.

128
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,512
We’re getting out of here.

129
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,402
Let's break out through the window.

130
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,318
What the hell!

131
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,777
Let's go.

132
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,699
Don't look back, Khen!

133
00:24:59,164 --> 00:24:59,706
Khen!

134
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,142
I think...

135
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,353
It just wants me.

136
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,355
The both of you need to get going!

137
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,941
No! I'm not leaving you behind on your own!

138
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,362
Toh!

139
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,780
Please!

140
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,573
No,Khen. I'm not leaving you!

141
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,162
Just go! I'll catch up later!

142
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:43,708
Toh!

143
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,377
Please, Go ahead

144
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,087
Otherwise, none of us are getting out here!

145
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,214
Hurry up!

146
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:57,973
Khen!

147
00:25:59,015 --> 00:25:59,641
Khen!

148
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,858
Wait…

149
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,611
It’s like I started seeing spirits...

150
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,739
Ever since I got this injury.

151
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,370
Did anyone see anything?

152
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,579
I didn't see anything at all.

153
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,667
Did no one actually see anything at all?

154
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,251
I didn’t!

155
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,378
What did <i>you</i> see?!

156
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,755
I’m really curious.

157
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,925
Why is it only Khen who's seeing ghosts right now?

158
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,179
Both the female ghost in that room and the homeowner's son's ghost.

159
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,139
Even though I have a 6th sense to this kind of thing.

160
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,350
They’ve never shown themselves to me before.

161
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,019
I've never encountered anything like what you’ve experienced.

162
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,315
It was Bing who saw Kampuan at first.

163
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,236
But now she’s focused only on me.

164
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,281
Ever since we...

165
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,786
Sensed the presence of Mas's spirit...

166
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,264
Mas.

167
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:47,934
Khen.

168
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,192
Who is that female ghost?

169
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,154
Why does she have to keep trying to harm me?

170
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,072
Is she a member of your family?

171
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,741
She’s not related to me.

172
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,410
And I don’t want to be involved with her either.

173
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,497
-So why is she here?
-The time for asking questions is over, Sherlock.

174
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,958
Forget about her.

175
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,461
And don’t think about getting involved with her again.

176
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,504
If you don’t want to......

177
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,547
What do you mean?

178
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,766
it’s like...

179
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,351
These two are connected somehow.

180
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,206
I’m here now!

181
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,332
What else do you want from me!

182
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,712
just tell me!

183
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,157
How could doing that make you beautiful, Sompoh?

184
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,292
And who else could possibly make themselves as beautiful as you?

185
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,838
But these jasmine flowers.

186
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,798
I planted them myself.

187
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,217
They smell lovely.

188
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,010
Don’t you think? You can try smelling if you want!

189
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,851
Kampuan.

190
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,602
Aren't you bored?

191
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,479
Of having to be a housewife.

192
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,356
And not being able to be a actress anymore?

193
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,817
I'm not bored at all.

194
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,443
If you're not bored.

195
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,737
Then why let me stay here?

196
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,115
You keep inviting me to cook, and make garlands.

197
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,245
If you don’t want to come, you don’t have to.

198
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,663
I didn’t mean it that way.

199
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,207
I just don’t understand Sang.

200
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,335
He caught the thief who stole from that noble family.

201
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,380
And the young master wants to reward him for his good deed.

202
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,716
Instead of asking for riches.

203
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,593
Why did he ask for you to be his wife?

204
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,053
I don't know either.

205
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,181
But he needs me to be there, so I have to be there.

206
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,685
But you're so beautiful.

207
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,770
Anyone would want to make you their wife.

208
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,189
That is quite enough.

209
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,108
Just keep looking for some good flowers.

210
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,237
Kampuan.

211
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,197
Is having a husband pleasant?

212
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,742
Is it more exciting than being a actress?

213
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,452
Sompoh!

214
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,745
Look at you.

215
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,080
What kind of lady talks like that?

216
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:56,873
Come on!

217
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,625
I’ve just never had a husband.

218
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,668
So I wouldn’t know if it’s fun or not.

219
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,794
Sompoh!

220
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,129
If you speak like this,

221
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,964
nobody will take you as their wife!

222
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,257
That’s fine by me.

223
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,343
I’ll be able to stay with you like this forever.

224
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,929
Let’s hope that's true.

225
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,681
If you ever meet a man that you adore.

226
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,351
You’ll soon marry and disappear from my life.

227
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,394
You just wait and see.

228
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,065
You've been talking enough,
just keep making your garlands.

229
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,593
What’s going on, Kampuan? You don't look so well.

230
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,305
Auntie, there is a war in Mok Mai.

231
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,724
The young master has to lead his army to fight the enemies over there.

232
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,768
Sang has to go too.

233
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,480
Would it be possible to ask you and Sompoh...

234
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,525
to stay with me in this house?

235
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,778
Will that be okay?

236
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,406
Don't worry.

237
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,074
Sang hasn’t said anything.

238
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,078
You raised me since I was little.

239
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,955
Even though you’re not my actual mother.

240
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,249
I love you as if you were my real mom.

241
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,085
And I love Sompoh like a little sister.

242
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,842
After your parents died.

243
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,886
I had to raise you along with little Sompoh.

244
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,346
I never thought that one day

245
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,391
you’d be fortunate enough to become a actress in the prince’s court.

246
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,522
All of these blessings are from you raising me.

247
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,900
It’s truly fate.

248
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,486
As for Sompoh.

249
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,449
Who would want to take her?

250
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,744
She might become an old maid, stuck at home.

251
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,414
Don’t worry.

252
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,709
Sompoh is becoming more beautiful every day.

253
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,337
Who would want to marry her?

254
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,258
If no one will be with her,

255
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,011
I will be the one responsible for her.

256
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,596
You don’t have to be worried.

257
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,673
Kampuan.

258
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,384
Your hair is really beautiful.

259
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,178
You smell so good too.

260
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,640
That’s why Sang loves you so much.

261
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,767
Sompoh.

262
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,435
You're just talking nonsense.

263
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,647
Kampuan.

264
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,775
Can I brush your hair forever?

265
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,702
Are you still brushing your hair?

266
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,958
It looks so lovely.

267
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,459
Sang.

268
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,627
Is there something going on?

269
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,712
I wanted to call you for dinner.

270
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,005
so I came to check in.

271
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,353
You smell lovely.

272
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,646
And your hair smells lovely too.

273
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,148
It never leaves.

274
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,775
If we have a daughter.

275
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,527
She will definitely be as beautiful as you.

276
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,075
Come help brush our daughter's hair, okay?

277
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:01,993
Sompoh.

278
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,706
Then, I'll take my leave for now.

279
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,452
What are you cooking today?

280
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,330
I'm collecting vegetables to eat with chili paste.

281
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,540
It is Kampuan's favorite.

282
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,500
I like it too.

283
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,129
Don’t you want to be a actress like Kampuan?

284
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,298
I tried.

285
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,634
but I'm not as beautiful as Kampuan.

286
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,177
With hands like mine,

287
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,678
I cannot be a actress.

288
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,222
I’m better at cooking.

289
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,642
People are different.

290
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,977
You're good at cooking.

291
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,563
And I keep filling my plate.

292
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,106
Okay.

293
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,025
Then I’ll go gather some more vegetables.

294
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,237
Here, let me help.

295
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,040
Sang.

296
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,959
Be patient.

297
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,710
Wait until it gets dark.

298
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,632
Do I have to wait until the sun sets just to hug my wife?

299
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,968
Just close the windows, that's enough.

300
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,012
In just a few days, I have to go to battle.

301
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,431
No matter how much I think of you, I won’t be able to hug you.

302
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,645
Sang, you're not going to go into battle

303
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,230
and come back with a new wife, are you?

304
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:55,982
I would never.

305
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,608
You are my wife.

306
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,193
Given by the king.

307
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,947
Who could ever compete with such beauty and fragrance?

308
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,616
Let that be the case.

309
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,618
If you leave now,

310
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,954
I will not know when you will be back.

311
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:12,999
Are you lonely?

312
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,209
Then I'll have to do something.

313
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,796
How about we have a little one to keep us company?

314
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:19,880
Do you think it's good?

315
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,716
Sang.

316
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,968
Not now!

317
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,469
Sang.

318
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,057
Sang.

319
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
Sang.

320
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,603
Stop.

321
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,730
Sang.

322
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,609
Sang.

323
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,945
Sang.

324
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,548
You're not finished cooking yet?

325
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,092
Just a moment.

326
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,677
Almost done.

327
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,721
Do you need help with anything?

328
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,931
It's okay, go wait outside.

329
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,141
I’ll serve it soon.

330
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,559
Okay.

331
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,852
Thank you.

332
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:15,811
Sure.

333
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:16,729
Go.

334
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,183
Khen.

335
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:00,815
Khen.

336
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,692
Khen.

337
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,405
Khen.

338
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,368
Khen.

339
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,246
Khen.

340
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,540
Khen.

341
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,542
Khen.

342
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:27,550
How is it?

343
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,343
Feeling better?

344
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,056
I told you to leave that bag behind from the start.

345
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:46,902
Khen.

346
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,281
Khen.

347
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,826
Khen.

348
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,163
I think calling is pointless.

349
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,208
Do you think...

350
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,461
Khen will be able to escape?

351
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,550
We saw him getting dragged into the house like that.

352
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,350
So...

353
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,853
Where are we now?

354
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,229
How should I know?

355
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,481
We’ve been here from the start.

356
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,819
I can’t take it anymore.

357
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,571
I give up.

358
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,699
This is making me
think about those zombie movies.

359
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,576
Why should we run away?

360
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,661
We might as well just let it bite us and get it over with.

361
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,039
Hey.

362
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,041
Who are you?

363
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:44,877
What are you talking about?

364
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,046
I’m Bing!

365
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,342
No.

366
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,554
The Bing I know wouldn’t say that.

367
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,642
He would never give up so easily.

368
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,107
But...

369
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,735
This is beyond the ability of an intern like me.

370
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,709
At least we’re not alone.

371
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,130
We have to get out of here together.

372
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,385
To meet Khen, Tan, and Nam Wah.

373
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,069
Trust me.

374
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,913
Which way should we go then?

375
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:06,959
I think we should go left.

376
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,090
Why do you look so confident?

377
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,844
Right is bad, left is good.

378
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,929
Let’s go.

379
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,099
Khen.

380
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,350
Bing.

381
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:24,602
Toh.

382
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,020
Can you hear me?

383
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,063
Bing.

384
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,023
Toh.

385
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,318
Toh.

386
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,819
Can you hear me?

387
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:35,696
Bing.

388
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,698
Khen.

389
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,418
Mas.

390
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,061
My Moon..

391
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,898
I thought I would never see you again.

392
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,071
I thought so too.

393
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,993
You're fine now.

394
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,788
I'm here with you.

395
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,199
Wait for me here, okay?

396
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,493
Okay.

397
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,372
Promise me...

398
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,290
That you won't disappear again.

399
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,294
Even if I disappear.

400
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,506
I will find a way back to you.

401
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,258
I promise.

402
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:23,929
I'll be right back.

403
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,833
Don’t worry.

404
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,544
I will wait for news about my father here.

405
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,505
I wish you a safe journey.

406
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,966
Take care of yourself.

407
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:01,842
Thank you.

408
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,791
Mas.

409
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,210
Where did everyone go?

410
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,800
My mother's relatives have just finished building a house in Lamphun.

411
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,678
And are going to perform a housewarming ceremony in a few days.

412
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,431
My stepmother is going to help take care of the food.

413
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,184
And flower arrangements for the ceremony.

414
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,687
Aren’t you going with them?

415
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,690
At first, I was going to go with them.

416
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,318
But my stepmother was worried about things at home.

417
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,987
She was afraid that if there was news from my father.

418
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,405
No one would be there to receive it.

419
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,950
So I volunteered to stay behind here.

420
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,993
And follow up later.

421
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,125
What are you smiling about?

422
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,003
What about you, why are you smiling?

423
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,803
This house is so quiet.

424
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,806
You must be so lonely.

425
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,023
If you’re worried that I’ll be lonely.

426
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,365
Then come sleep here with me.

427
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,130
Khen.

428
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:08,844
Khen!

429
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,166
How did this package of medicine end up with you?

430
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,834
What did you bring me to eat?

431
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,711
Are you poisoning me?

432
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,714
I understand now that you want me to see your story.

433
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,841
But I don't understand what it means.

434
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,093
I told you, didn't I?

435
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,929
Not to go out alone.

436
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,722
What are you afraid of?

437
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,141
You’re the only one who can see me.

438
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,353
I know the truth already.

439
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,397
So you know the truth now?
