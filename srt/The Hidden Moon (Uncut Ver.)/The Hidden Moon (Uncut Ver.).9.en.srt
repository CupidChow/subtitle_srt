1
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,730
Are you unwell?

2
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,189
No.

3
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,442
I'm fine.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,866
Kampuan!

5
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,411
Khen.

6
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,622
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,003
Mas.

8
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,716
I'm scared.

9
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,685
Close your eyes.

10
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,688
Once you’re in my arms.

11
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,483
there’s nothing to be afraid of.

12
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,400
My Moon.

13
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,946
I’ll sing you a lullaby.

14
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,228
Khen.

15
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,063
Khen.

16
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:46,815
Khen.

17
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:48,775
Khen.

18
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,360
Khen.

19
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,569
Khen.

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,697
Khen.

21
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:56,991
Khen.

22
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:58,618
Khen.

23
00:01:59,577 --> 00:01:59,911
Khen.

24
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,163
Khen.

25
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,208
We can’t go back anymore.

26
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,838
What do you mean, Namwah?

27
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,215
Khen.

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,763
Where are you guys?

29
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,099
Khen.

30
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,393
Come back to us.

31
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,603
That place is not meant for you.

32
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,022
We're waiting for you.

33
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,535
I still can't go back.

34
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,038
Khen.

35
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,747
Khen.

36
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,707
Mas, it's morning already.

37
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,006
Mas.

38
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:40,970
Mas!

39
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,013
Mas!

40
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,389
Mas!

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,724
Mas!

42
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:45,767
Mas!

43
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:46,809
Mas!

44
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,727
Mas.

45
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,312
Let's have breakfast.

46
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,855
Mom sent me to fetch you.

47
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:54,943
Mas.

48
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:00,823
Mom!

49
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,033
Mas is unwell.

50
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,326
His body is ice cold.

51
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,080
Dara.

52
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,790
Let's go get Mom.

53
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,046
Mas!

54
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:15,922
Mas!

55
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,924
No, not now.

56
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,424
Mas.

57
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,598
Mas!

58
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,699
Please.

59
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,953
Let me go back to see Mas.

60
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,317
There must be a way.

61
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,246
Mas, how are you doing now.

62
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,793
How is it?

63
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,806
How is it?

64
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,183
Is Mas feeling any better?

65
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,060
He's not getting any better yet.

66
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,604
What should we do?

67
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,984
I think we should call the doctor.

68
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,194
Okay.

69
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,258
Mas!

70
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,010
Can you hear me?

71
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,344
Mas!

72
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,221
I'm here!

73
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,014
Mas.

74
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:46,974
Mas.

75
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,123
Let me go back to Mas!

76
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,794
Even if it means I'll die!

77
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,766
The picture of my mother really did save you.

78
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,356
I have to thank your mother.

79
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,946
Are you Mas's mother?

80
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,965
I want to go back to Mas.

81
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,260
What do I need to do?

82
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,607
Those who can be together.

83
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,817
Must be in the same state.

84
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,280
What do you mean?

85
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,040
If you meet him.

86
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,918
Please hug him for me.

87
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,879
Tell him...

88
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,924
To live happily.

89
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,597
Miss?

90
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:15,849
Miss?

91
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,062
So...what exactly..

92
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,565
..do I need to do to get back to Mas.

93
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,652
Miss.

94
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,153
Miss!

95
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:29,738
Miss!

96
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,038
Mas.

97
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,792
Wait for me.

98
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,420
I’m coming to you.

99
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:25,979
Let me go.

100
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,023
I’m going back to Mas!

101
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,442
What are you doing?!

102
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,582
Mas! Stay with me, son.

103
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,543
Stay strong.

104
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,546
Your father is bringing the doctor.

105
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,183
Mas.

106
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,353
I'm back.

107
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,399
Khen.

108
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,986
How could you dare do that?

109
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:58,780
I...

110
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,826
Would do anything...

111
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,121
To see you again.

112
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,709
We're..

113
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,545
Now the same, right?

114
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,553
You just rest.

115
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,889
Are you...

116
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,725
Hiding something from me?

117
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,941
There's nothing..

118
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,129
That scar on your neck...

119
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,465
What exactly happened?

120
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,512
Was the ghost in that room trying to hurt...

121
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,348
Or trying to kill you?

122
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,688
It’s not what you think.

123
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,108
Then...

124
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,902
What’s the truth?

125
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,784
I'm too cowardly to tell the truth.

126
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,205
Please tell me the truth.

127
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,458
Because someday I will have to know anyway.

128
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,839
I gave up everything.

129
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,592
Even my life.

130
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,470
To be with you.

131
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,599
Mas.

132
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,311
Are you feeling better now?

133
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,731
That's good.

134
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,984
I’ll go inform Thapthim.

135
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,320
That your condition is now better.

136
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,613
So she can be at ease.

137
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,790
Why...

138
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,459
Can’t she see me?

139
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,045
Even though I’m a spirit?

140
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,550
Khen.

141
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,429
I’m sorry.

142
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,767
What are you apologizing for?

143
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,311
I don’t understand.

144
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,066
I haven't told you the truth from the beginning.

145
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:40,776
So...

146
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,195
What is the truth?

147
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,895
Do you feel that?

148
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,147
Yes.

149
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,833
I was slashed across the neck with a knife

150
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:38,959
But...

151
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,128
Why are there no wounds?

152
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,468
Because a spirit is someone who’s already dead.

153
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,888
You can’t die again.

154
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,609
No, this can’t be.

155
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:06,987
You mean..

156
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,780
I’ve been dead all along?

157
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,335
Wait.

158
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:25,797
Get away from me!

159
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,031
Be careful!

160
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:37,619
Nam-wah!

161
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,038
Nam-wah!

162
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:41,915
Nam-wah!

163
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:43,959
Nam-wah!

164
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,752
We are going home.

165
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,421
Everyone is trying to find a way.

166
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,885
We can't go back anymore.

167
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,304
The voice I'm hearing....

168
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,015
Is my mother calling my name.

169
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,486
We are dead.

170
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,304
An accident has occurred in Chiang Mai.

171
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,224
When a car lost control and fell into a ravine.

172
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,060
Four bodies have been found so far.

173
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,186
No wonder.

174
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,522
We can’t contact anyone.

175
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,993
Do you hear anything?

176
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,580
It sounds like footsteps.

177
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,876
A lot of footsteps too.

178
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,211
What’s going on here?

179
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,922
Let's hurry and go see.

180
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,928
There! Do you see anything?

181
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,347
Nothing over here.

182
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,767
I found something! Over here!

183
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,430
Khen.

184
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,241
Don’t touch me!

185
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,162
Calm down, Khen

186
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,750
How dare you...

187
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,836
Throw the truth in my face like this?

188
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:00,882
Khen.

189
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,854
No matter what you become.

190
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,148
I'll be with you.

191
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,571
I love you, Khen.

192
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,223
Why...

193
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,144
Why does it have to be this way?

194
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,033
Your illness...

195
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,121
Is because of me, isn't it?

196
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,589
You couldn't have known what you were doing.

197
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,596
Don't blame yourself, Khen.

198
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,267
You didnt know anything.

199
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:19,896
Unlike me.

200
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,399
who knew...

201
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,319
But still did it.

202
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,328
Mas.

203
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,540
I don’t want to die.

204
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,711
I want to have a life with you.

205
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,465
I desire the same.

206
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,526
Are you feeling better, Khen?

207
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,742
Does it hurt a lot?

208
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,244
How...are you doing?

209
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,081
It's okay.

210
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,875
It’ll heal soon.

211
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,254
Did you have to face things like this since you were a child?

212
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,174
And..

213
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,718
Every time a spirit expresses it's emotions towards you.

214
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,554
Do you have to go through this every time?

215
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,101
If it was you...

216
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,606
I would willingly accept those emotions whoel-heartedly.

217
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,906
All this time.

218
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,867
I thought you were the ghost.

219
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,036
But.

220
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,039
I never would've thought....

221
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,876
..that I was the ghost here all along.

222
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,925
For me...

223
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,260
You are alive.

224
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,015
Even if it's a life that I don't quite understand.

225
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,852
But you are not like other spirits.

226
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,146
You are lovely.

227
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,357
And mean no harm.

228
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,611
That sounds almost nice.

229
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:15,905
But...

230
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,116
A ghost is a ghost.

231
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,121
That's true.

232
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,499
Since I was a child.

233
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,293
I've tried to escape all of this.

234
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,631
I don't understand.

235
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,218
Why those spirits continue to torment me

236
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,014
Sometimes...

237
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,394
I don't even want to live anymore.

238
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,072
Let me go!

239
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:58,990
Let me go!

240
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,782
I said let me go!

241
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:00,867
Let me go!

242
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,784
Let me go!

243
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,535
Let me go!

244
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:03,953
Let me go!

245
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,121
Let me go!

246
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,515
Mas!

247
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,726
Mas, stay with me, son!

248
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,311
Stay strong.

249
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,522
Your father is bringing the doctor.

250
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,900
Why did you do this?

251
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,319
Mas!

252
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,822
Mas!

253
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,042
She didn't dare approach me anymore.

254
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,920
Until...

255
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,380
You came into my life.

256
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,801
I think...

257
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,763
She wants me to communicate with you.

258
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:16,609
I know that what you've been through is truly severe.

259
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,821
But I don't think she intended to harm you.

260
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:27,870
She probably just wanted to ask for your help.

261
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,086
Try to be open and listen to her this time.

262
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,799
I’ll go with you.

263
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,360
He’s here.

264
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,030
And ready to listen to you.

265
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,731
How you could do this to me!

266
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,191
Come with me!

267
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,986
Tell your mother!

268
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,240
You tell your mother what you did to me!

269
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,574
Tell your mother!

270
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,785
I said tell your mother!

271
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,079
Sompoh.

272
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,665
How you could do this to me!

273
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,792
How you could do this to me!

274
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,546
How you could do this to me!

275
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,339
How you could do this to me!

276
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,509
How you could do this to me!

277
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,970
Please, just stop.

278
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,973
I'm really sorry.

279
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,225
I give up.

280
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:37,768
Kampuan!

281
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,239
Kampuan!

282
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,578
Kampuan!

283
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,915
Kampuan!

284
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,431
I really love...

285
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,974
You.

286
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,435
Why...

287
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,104
did you...

288
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,315
do this...

289
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,150
to me?

290
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,362
Kampuan!

291
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,493
Kampuan!

292
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,163
Don't go, Kampuan!

293
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,415
Kampuan!

294
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,126
Kampuan!

295
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,794
I love you!

296
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:55,930
Sompoh.

297
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,642
Which spirit told you to act like this?

298
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,560
There's men everywhere!

299
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,437
But you want your sister's husband?

300
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,106
I don’t want any man like that!

301
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,817
I love only!

302
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,196
I won’t let any man take Kham Puan away.

303
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,699
Men are dogs by nature.

304
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,329
One day, Kham Puan will get her heart broken.

305
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,084
I want Kham Puan to stay with me and just me.

306
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,463
You ungrateful child!

307
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,173
Why were you even born?

308
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,175
Twisted like this?

309
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,845
There are so many men around you.

310
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,389
Why don't you love them?

311
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,266
Instead, you love another woman.

312
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,101
You disgraceful, vile child!

313
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,420
What are you crying for!

314
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,755
Kham Puan died because of you!

315
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,340
Drag her down here now!

316
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,509
Drag her down right now!

317
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,304
What kind of karma is happening to me?

318
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,639
I have a child, but my child is of the wrong gender.

319
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,974
Drag her down right now!

320
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,393
Let everything be buried here with that Kham Puan.

321
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,353
Once that's done, I'm going to Phrae.

322
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,022
And you're coming with me.

323
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,565
I'll find a husband for you.

324
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,900
So you can stop being this twisted.

325
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,946
And don't think you'll ever come back here again.

326
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:36,614
Sompoh.

327
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,692
And my wife?

328
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:20,741
Where is my wife?

329
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,118
Kham Puan has ran away, sir.

330
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,371
Ran away?

331
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,581
Where did she run off to?

332
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,463
I’m asking where my wife ran away to!

333
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,090
She ran off with another lover.

334
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:37,549
Another lover?

335
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,098
Then why didn't you all stop her?

336
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,683
I didn't know either.

337
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,520
By the time we found out, she was already gone,
Master Sang.

338
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:55,693
Sompoh!

339
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,152
You know, right?

340
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,487
Who she ran of with?

341
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,572
You tell me right now!

342
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,702
We truly do not know.

343
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,579
You can have us swear on anything,

344
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,790
I really don't know.

345
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,255
Both of you.

346
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,173
Go gather the belongings of that Kham Phuan

347
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,508
And throw everything away!

348
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,593
Yes..

349
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:11,995
What are you doing?

350
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,707
Does it really have to be this extreme?

351
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,628
Sompoh!

352
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,712
Wake up right now!

353
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,006
Sompoh, please don't go anywhere!

354
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,342
Sompoh!

355
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,966
Please help my daughter, Doctor

356
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:10,679
Sompoh!

357
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,320
Kham Puan.

358
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,831
Hurry up! The white owner will be back soon.

360
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:02,457
Hurry up!

361
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,085
Put some muscle into it.

362
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,677
Is the new house beautiful?

363
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,970
Very beautiful!

364
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,598
In this new house...

365
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,142
you won't have to be afraid anymore.

366
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,602
That you'll see things you don't want to see.

367
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,106
May I go see the other rooms?

368
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,065
Sure.

369
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,138
Please don't hurt me.

370
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,056
Mom!

371
00:50:59,056 --> 00:50:59,765
Help me!

372
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:00,432
Help me!

373
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,725
Help me!

374
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:02,851
Help me!

375
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:03,935
Help me!

376
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:04,478
Mom!

377
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,687
Mom!

378
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,396
Help me!

379
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,097
You understand her story now, right?

380
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,519
I will have someone dig up your bones.

381
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,688
and conduct a proper religious ceremony for you.

382
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,776
I think...

383
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,821
Everyone should know the truth
about what happened to her.

384
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,577
And...

385
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,288
what should we do?

386
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,085
Do you remember your notebook that I once secretly took?

387
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,753
I want you...

388
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,506
to rewrite the history of this house.

389
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,925
That the wife of the original landowner...

390
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,427
did not run away with a lover.

391
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,264
But lost her life due to a misunderstanding.

392
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:24,975
Of course.

393
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,853
Everyone deserves to know the truth.

394
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,567
And I...

395
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:37,028
will fix the story that will be told in the exhibition of this house in my era.

396
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,413
You have nothing to worry about anymore...

397
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,583
Sompoh.

398
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,752
Sompoh?

399
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,836
No one...

400
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,132
Has called my name in a long time.

401
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,305
There’s nothing to worry about anymore,

402
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,306
Sompoh.

403
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,352
We will handle everything.

404
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:37,065
How did you know that was Sompoh, Khen?

405
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,779
The peacock flower.

406
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,158
I once read in a book that..

407
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,912
the peacock flower means 'Sompoh'

408
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,628
She must have felt guilty towards Kham Puan all this time.

409
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,589
And wanted to clear her sins.

410
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:02,966
For the one she loved.

411
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,136
But she was stuck here.

412
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,347
And was trying to ask for help...

413
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,974
from those who can see her.

414
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,733
It's truly heartbreaking, isn't it?

415
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,322
A love that is not accepted.

416
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,034
A love that is impossible.

417
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,872
Like the sun and the moon

418
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,084
That can never be together.

419
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:41,880
But at least.

420
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,091
She had love, right?

421
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,050
I'm the luckiest ghost in the world.

422
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,510
It's a shame.

423
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,346
That the flower can't bloom forever.

424
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,056
Don't be sad, Mas.

425
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,101
We just need to appreciate it during the time it does bloom.

426
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,812
And accept the time it withers.

427
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,316
I will name you 'Panjan'

428
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,694
Which means 'like the moon.'

429
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,738
If we are destined.

430
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,698
We will meet again.

431
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,825
Panjan.
