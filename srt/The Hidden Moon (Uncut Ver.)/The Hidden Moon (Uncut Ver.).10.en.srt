1
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,362
Be careful!

2
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,364
We're dead, Tan...

3
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,039
No matter what you become.

4
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,625
I'll be with you.

5
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,087
I love you, Khen.

6
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,303
Take a break.

7
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,473
Want to do something else for a while?

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,018
Something that you and I enjoy?

9
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,322
I'd rather not.

10
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,200
I want to finish my work.

11
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,620
So everything can finally be over.

12
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,168
If you finish your work.

13
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,296
You’ll have nothing left to worry about, right?

14
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,884
I guess so.

15
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,557
Then I'll go grab a drink to freshen up a bit.

16
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,478
They’re so beautiful.

17
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,529
They look so lively.

18
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,949
All these flowers...

19
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,117
Belong to you.

20
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:03,952
My Moon.

21
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,043
How could they only belong to me?

22
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,672
It has to be yours too.

23
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,674
Because you still have to take care of it.

24
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,513
Khen.

25
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,015
You have something on your mind.

26
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,560
I feel like you’re avoiding me.

27
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,313
No.

28
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,402
Mas.

29
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,532
How are you?

30
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,285
You look much brighter now.

31
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,787
Yes.

32
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,872
I feel much more refreshed.

33
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,627
When you were so pale and unconscious.

34
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,462
I was terrified.

35
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,424
Thinking something might steal your life away.

36
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,304
So...

37
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,431
Who is that flower for?

38
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,184
For my lover.

39
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,191
I was going to put it in my father's office.

40
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,530
Pailin.

41
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,073
Your mother.

42
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,743
Adored pink flowers above all.

43
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,256
Good.

44
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,301
Which one do you like?

45
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,886
I like strawberry.

46
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,266
Is there a guest tonight?

47
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,352
Since you had Nuon set another place at the table?

48
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,607
Looks like they won’t be coming.

49
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,112
Then let’s go ahead and eat first.

50
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:23,674
Khen.

51
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,302
Khen.

52
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,432
Khen.

53
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,689
Khen.

54
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,487
Khen.

55
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,701
Khen.

56
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,711
Khen.

57
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,302
Who are you calling for?

58
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,145
It’s nothing.

59
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,605
Just go back to sleep.

60
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,402
Who could that be…

61
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,361
Khen?

62
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,144
Mas.

63
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,327
What are you doing?

64
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,044
You know that if that’s gone,

65
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,464
I might be stuck here forever.

66
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,178
Would that be so bad, Khen?

67
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,392
We could be together forever.

68
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,896
You're aware...

69
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,900
that it's impossible.

70
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,860
It is possible.

71
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
I’ll make it happen myself.

72
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,659
Please Mas, don’t do this.

73
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,178
You can see that whenever I’m with you.

74
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,722
You grow weaker.

75
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,850
As if I’m draining your life force.

76
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,728
If you keep doing this.

77
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,063
I might end up killing you.

78
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,278
Do you know...

79
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,991
That the way you act makes me feel like you're disgusted by me...

80
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,829
It kills me slowly.

81
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,090
I want to kiss you so much.

82
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,142
I don’t want to hurt you.

83
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,279
At the very least, please don’t push me away.

84
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,742
Please.

85
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,551
You were really intense back there.

86
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,221
You almost destroyed my notebook.

87
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,477
Did you think I would actually throw that away?

88
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,773
I just wanted you to face me.

89
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,444
I wouldn't dare destroy your things.

90
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,489
Because I love you.

91
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,332
Keeping a distance like this…

92
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,252
It’s like a monk and a woman.

93
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,425
If that’s so,

94
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,844
I’m willing to give up being a monk.

95
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:00,970
Oh.

96
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,556
That makes me sound like a sin.

97
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,392
Not at all, my Moon.

98
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,236
You’ve done so much for me.

99
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,865
Now it’s my turn to do something for you.

100
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,713
This life has been so precious.

101
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,966
Though it hasn’t been a smooth journey.

102
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,512
It’s been filled with memories worth keeping.

103
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,598
Thank you to Mother and Grandmother Oon

104
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,559
For raising me well.

105
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,104
Even though my mother is gone.

106
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,775
And I may not be here to see my father again

107
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,860
I want him to know.

108
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,695
I’ve always been proud.

109
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,572
To be his son.

110
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,117
And I want him to be proud.

111
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,162
That he taught me the courage.

112
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,498
To fight for what I love.

113
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,149
Worrying won’t help you find Mas.

114
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,901
Ma'm.

115
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,361
Mas is in danger.

116
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,910
I know.

117
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,580
And there's only you can help him.

118
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,707
What should I do?

119
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,875
I need to help Khun Mas.

120
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,461
You already know, what you need to do.

121
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,424
You’ve brought yourself back to him many times before.

122
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,218
But I don't always end up where I need to be.

123
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,679
Like right now, I can’t...

124
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,021
Focus.

125
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,689
And steady your mind.

126
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,401
We are all connected by our thoughts.

127
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,404
Just think, and you will meet him.

128
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,533
I must thank you

129
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,452
For coming into Mas's life.

130
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,787
He seems so happy.

131
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,122
When he’s with you.

132
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,374
Yes.

133
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,793
I promise...

134
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,254
I will protect Mas's life.

135
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,334
Where are you?

136
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,448
Khen!

137
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,035
Where are you?

138
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,580
That sounds amazing, Mother.

139
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,748
What’s the name of the song?

140
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,333
It’s called "Lao Damnoen Kwean".

141
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,044
Can you teach me how to play it?

142
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,045
Sure.

143
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,589
Then let’s switch seats.

144
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,925
What is this?

145
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,802
It is a sa-lo

146
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,512
Practice holding it first.

147
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,931
Place it on your lap like this.

148
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,766
And...

149
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,060
Place your fingers like this.

150
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,397
There's potential.

151
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,445
Mom!

152
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,581
Mom.

153
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,292
I’ve missed you so much.

154
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,602
My beloved child.

155
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,276
You’ve grown up beautifully.

156
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,744
Why haven’t you ever come to see me?

157
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,250
I’m always with you, Mas.

158
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,004
I want you...

159
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,465
To live your life with those who are still here.

160
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,095
Rather than dwell on those who have already gone.

161
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,351
Just like the time you spent with your father.

162
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,853
Tubtim.

163
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,688
And your siblings.

164
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,567
Life...

165
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,111
Is most valuable...

166
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,156
When we are together.

167
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,082
From now on.

168
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,878
I’ll be able to be with you.

169
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,506
Not yet.

170
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,384
It’s not your time yet.

171
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,349
Go back and live the rest of your life meaningfully.

172
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,692
I want to be with you.

173
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,697
If I stay here.

174
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,952
I can be with the people I love.

175
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,539
Sometimes.

176
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,793
We're not able to choose.

177
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,712
Whether we continue living or not.

178
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,261
If you still have to live on.

179
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,639
Don’t be afraid.

180
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,894
And live the life that your heart desires.

181
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,069
Once I go back.

182
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,656
Will I get to see you again?

183
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,913
As long as you think of me.

184
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,085
We will meet in those memories.

185
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,597
Mas.

186
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,558
Mas.

187
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,059
Mas.

188
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,858
Go now.

189
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,784
I will always be watching over you.

190
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,687
Mas.

191
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,649
Mas.

192
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,739
Mas.

193
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,324
Mas.

194
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,493
Mas.

195
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,663
Mas.

196
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,463
Why did you do this?

197
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,595
When you didn’t even know you were dead,

198
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,265
You still dared to abandon your life to be with me.

199
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,892
Oh, Mas.

200
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,521
I just wanted our love to prevail

201
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,942
Whatever the means, if it meant we would be able to be together forever.

202
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,488
Don't throw your life away like this.

203
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,032
I don't need this to happen.

204
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,618
If anything happened to you.

205
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,829
Everything could change.

206
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,539
And we might not ever see each other again.

207
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,416
Do you want that?

208
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,627
No.

209
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,673
Meeting you...

210
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,426
Is the best story of my life.

211
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,929
And I want to cherish our story forever.

212
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,057
Even though...

213
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,726
We can't be together.

214
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,488
My dear Mas.

215
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,574
Everyone at home is well, yes?

216
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,036
The war is about to end.

217
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,713
I have been injured.

218
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,341
But luckily I survived.

219
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,344
I had undergone surgery...

220
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,096
and might not be able to return to Thailand.

221
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,349
I want you...

222
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,017
Tubtim.

223
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,102
Pin and Dara,

224
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,438
to move here to live together.

225
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,108
I will prepare everything for you.

226
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,611
See you soon.

227
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,238
With love...

228
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,531
and longing.

229
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,658
Thomas.

230
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,790
You have to go sooner than I thought.

231
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,679
Then...shall we make the most of the time...

232
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,973
that we have left together?

233
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,414
Khen.

234
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,542
Why are you smiling?

235
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,553
The weather is nice today...

236
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,727
Shall we go outside?

237
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,076
So what should we do with the project now?

238
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,474
What's going on?

239
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,565
Khen sent an email.

240
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:16,903
Khen.

241
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:18,905
Look at that.

242
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,242
What kind of flower is that?

243
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,119
It’s beautiful.

244
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,472
It's the cherry blossom.

245
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:48,852
Mas.

246
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,770
Should we stop and look for a bit?

247
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,768
It's so beautiful.

248
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,272
I always wanted to see this at least once before I died.

249
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,693
But I didn’t think I’d get to see it after I had already died.

250
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,913
I must be the luckiest ghost in the world.

251
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,552
It's a pity.

252
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,389
It can't bloom forever.

253
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,189
Don't be sad.

254
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,325
We just need to appreciate it while it blooms,

255
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,538
and accept it when it withers,

256
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,796
While waiting for the day it will bloom again.

257
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,605
Let’s keep going, Mas

258
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,651
I want to know where you’re taking me.

259
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,109
Once you leave...

260
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,780
I want to keep our memories here.

261
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,221
I still remember the first day we met.

262
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,724
Me too.

263
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,272
I thought you were a ghost child who lived here and came to haunt me.

264
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,150
Because I was messing around in your place.

265
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,988
I was really scared back then.

266
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,782
I almost had a heart attack.

267
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,534
Shouldn't I be the one....

268
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,995
who should be asking that?

269
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,999
When I dropped the doll,

270
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,794
and was about to lean down to pick it up..

271
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:43,962
all of a sudden,

272
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,547
I saw you sitting right there...

273
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,926
staring at me...

274
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,470
If you were my age,

275
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,514
you would have screamed as well, right?

276
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,694
You're right.

277
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,737
I must have scared you pretty badly.

278
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,326
Let’s just consider it a memorable first meeting that we won't forget.

279
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,165
As for the second time,

280
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,042
you were playing the piano.

281
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,502
And you...

282
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,045
yelled at me to leave.

283
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,507
It’s not that.

284
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,303
I can’t forget the second time either.

285
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,100
It was the day my family held my mother’s funeral.

286
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,687
I was sitting alone, crying...

287
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,772
and then you appeared.

288
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,704
Don’t cry.

289
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,291
Even though your mother is gone.

290
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,169
You still have your father who loves you very much.

291
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,087
Oh...

292
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,048
You might have met me for the second time then.

293
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,592
But in reality, I've seen you for quite some time.

294
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,137
Once I had started to bond with you,

295
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,348
and I saw you as a child again, in such a sad state.

296
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,602
I really wanted to comfort you.

297
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,273
Even though I was scared.

298
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,486
I could feel your care and concern for me.

299
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,615
Which surprised me greatly.

300
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,911
You didn’t hurt me like the other spirits.

301
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,999
Instead, you appeared to comfort me.

302
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,710
After that..

303
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,754
I never saw you again.

304
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,635
Until I forgot...

305
00:34:56,052 --> 00:35:00,014
what the man I met that day looked like.

306
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,476
I vaguely remember...

307
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,770
that your face...

308
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,563
was perfectly proportioned.

309
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,154
Your nose.

310
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,866
Eyebrows.

311
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,036
Eyes.

312
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,873
Lips.

313
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,920
So charming, just like the dolls that the courtiers used to play with.

314
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,759
You’re praising me too much.

315
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:42,473
You’re not like any other spirit I’ve ever met.

316
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,561
You’re bright like the morning air,

317
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,230
lively,

318
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:50,773
cute,

319
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:51,983
and clever.

320
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,612
Yet naive about the most important things.

321
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,657
You are the truth,

322
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,325
in a world that isn’t real.

323
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,203
This is the most amazing thing...

324
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,788
I’ve ever encountered.

325
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,335
So you fell in love with a ghost.

326
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,212
The ghost fell in love with me first.

327
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:14,881
Not at all.

328
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,508
You kissed me first.

329
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,808
Khen.

330
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,642
Turn around.

331
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:40,239
Meeting you was a very special thing in my life.

332
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,242
You’ve shown me a kind of love..

333
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,536
which is unconditional.

334
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,256
The ring your friend was going to propose with.

335
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,550
That day, you really pulled a fast one on me.

336
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,428
What kind of person can trick a ghost?

337
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,601
I’ll let you punish me however you want, just as you desire.

338
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,939
Then...I'll forgive you, in that case.

339
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,668
I’m really going to miss this place.

340
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,047
How can you be the one to miss this place,

341
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,384
when you’re the one leaving?

342
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,058
It’s me...

343
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,271
who will have to live with all the memories created here.

344
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,210
We should head back now.

345
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,878
It's late.

346
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,714
Your family will be worried.

347
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,517
Mas!

348
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,830
Please don’t.

349
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,673
Why won’t you stop acting distant with me?

350
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,969
I thought we understood each other.

351
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,098
I really can’t accept it.

352
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,684
If I make you ill again.

353
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:14,852
Khen.

354
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,980
We don’t have much time left together.

355
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,027
Do you want to leave me..

356
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,405
behind with all this longing?

357
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,495
That’s so cruel.

358
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,750
I understand now.

359
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,795
It’s going to rain.

360
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,588
Let’s head back inside the cabin first.

361
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,591
You might catch a cold.

362
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,071
Are you sure?

363
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,455
Let me remember you one last time.

364
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,582
My moon.

365
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,254
I love you.

366
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,006
I love you too.

367
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,646
The moon is just as beautiful as always.

368
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,985
But my sky is shrouded in darkness.

369
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,406
But there are stars glowing all over the sky.

370
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,581
The stars you see must be beautiful.

371
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,002
Even though the stars are so,so beautiful

372
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,754
I hope...

373
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,881
one day...

374
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,050
I'll have a moon that looks over me forever.

375
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,723
I mean you.

376
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,349
My moon.

377
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,532
I will always be your moon.

378
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:41,874
Some days, you might see them.

379
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,211
Keep in mind..

380
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,047
that the stars are always there...

381
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,343
Watching over you, wishing you happiness.

382
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,447
I want you to love your life deeply.

383
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,331
Because this life...

384
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,751
is what I love the most.

385
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,648
I promise...

386
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,359
that I will cherish this life.

387
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,685
Ah, you finally made it.

388
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,269
You kept us waiting forever.

389
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,863
I had some unfinished business.

390
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,658
And...

391
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,120
it took me a while to realize I was a ghost.

392
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,081
That’s what happens when you let people trick you.

393
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,961
So you’ve finished everything, right?

394
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,673
Then let’s go.

395
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,863
This house...

396
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,615
was built during the reign of King Rama V.

397
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,872
It's owner was Mr. Thomas H. Coleridge, my father.

398
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,499
But not long after...

399
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,753
my mother passed away,

400
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,632
and my father remarried to Tubthim.

401
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,178
They had two lovely daughters.

402
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,430
Pin and Dara.

403
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,057
Wait for me, Dara.

404
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,738
Keep it down.

405
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,991
You’ll scare the guests.

406
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,163
Originally, this land belonged to Mr. Sang.

407
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:38,420
His wife, Kampuan, was a dancer raised by the La,

408
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,258
where she grew up with Sompoh,

409
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:47,471
a woman burdened by an
unrequited love forced upon by the times.

410
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:54,561
But that love, was a force that could not be stopped.

411
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,155
This piano...represents love.

412
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:12,871
I often played the song "Lao Duen Gwaen"

413
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,005
Or what as everyone knows as "Lao Dao Duen."

414
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,265
I really like it.

415
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,018
It has story, detail,

416
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,103
And emotions that are very impressive.

417
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,315
The presentation is also strange and fresh.

418
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,651
What do you think?

419
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,905
I think we can keep continuing.

420
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,157
I want to open it for people to see.

421
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:32,618
Oh..

422
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,704
and who’s the team finishing up after the old one?

423
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,000
It’s the team that was recommended to me.

424
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,669
Who’s that?

425
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,466
That person...

426
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,896
Let’s go.

427
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,447
Mas.

428
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,952
Are all the belongings for the ship loaded?

429
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,537
Grandma Oon.

430
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,457
That’s the fifth time you’ve asked me today

431
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,501
Are you going for a sixth?

432
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,753
I just worry, that’s all.

433
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,713
You’re going so far away.

434
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,799
The food there won’t be like it is here.

435
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,467
And the air is so cold.

436
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,427
I really do worry about you.

437
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,054
Don’t worry.

438
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,556
I’m twenty years old now.

439
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,308
Not a child.

440
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,604
And if you’re so worried about Tubtim and the girls,

441
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,358
I promise to take good care of everyone the best I can.

442
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,318
Yes.

443
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,407
That's Naun.

444
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,785
She must want to see you off.

445
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,748
Have you seen Naun’s baby yet?

446
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,085
Not yet.

447
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,046
Did she give birth already?

448
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,381
Yes.

449
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,550
A boy.

450
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,261
He has such a sweet face and lovely skin.

451
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,013
Everyone who sees him will fall for him.

452
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,515
So charming.

453
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,059
But...

454
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,395
the poor thing...

455
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,731
was born fatherless.

456
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,746
Is this your son?

457
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:42,622
What’s his name?

458
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,000
Everyone saw the birthmark on his forehead

459
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,002
And called him Pan.

460
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,464
They say it’s a mark from a past life.

461
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,900
I’d like to name him Panjan.

462
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,735
Meaning...

463
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,111
Like the moon.

464
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,949
Panjan.

465
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,536
I wish for you to grow up to be a good boy,

466
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:22,913
to be strong,

467
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,247
clever,

468
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,916
and dilligent.

469
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,126
So you can take good care of Naun.

470
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,595
Let me support this child, Naun.

471
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,432
I’ll see to it he has enough for a proper education.

472
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,978
If you’re ever lacking anything,

473
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,731
write to me,

474
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,067
and I’ll help.

475
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,278
I am truly thankful, Mas.

476
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,073
It’s a real blessing for little Panjan.

477
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,753
If fate allows,

478
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,672
we may meet again,

479
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,757
Panjan.

480
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,912
Chiang Mai looks beautiful.

481
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,788
Looks like a great place to live.

482
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,517
Man, why did I sign up for Literature?

483
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,561
Points are so hard to get.

484
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,938
How would I have known?

485
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,648
My senior told me it was a chill course.

486
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:06,826
Got it.

487
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,163
Excuse me.

488
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,310
We got the approval.

489
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:37,023
Yes! Finally, this project is ours, like we planned.

490
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,194
But this project won’t work with just three people.

491
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,322
Who should we ask for help?

492
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,199
How about asking Jade?

493
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:47,492
No way.

494
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,910
He charges too much.

495
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,662
What about Yuu?

496
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,832
Are you choosing based on personal feelings?

497
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,878
I think it's better not to.

498
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,631
I see trouble ahead even before starting the project.

499
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,344
Wait.

500
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,762
Khen.

501
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,604
What are you doing around here?

502
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,064
Hi.

503
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:18,773
Hi.

504
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,029
I came for a job interview for a creative content position.

505
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,367
You like creating content, right?

506
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,327
Yes.

507
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,498
Do you like traveling?

508
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,792
Yes.

509
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,211
Especially to the North.

510
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,509
Are you interested in history and ancient stories?

511
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,596
If it's history and ancient stories...

512
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,391
it'll probably be the era of Kings Rama IV and V.

513
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,191
Khen.

514
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,318
Welcome to the team.

515
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,570
What team?

516
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,823
Just be ready.

517
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,075
Okay.

518
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,496
See you soon.

519
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,545
And then the whole story began.

520
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,486
You're here?

521
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,415
I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

522
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,877
I'm sorry.

523
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,299
I know the truth now.

524
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,680
Why suffer for so long?

525
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,724
You know that....

526
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,270
I've forgiven you for everything.

527
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,777
I love you.

528
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,324
I love you too.
