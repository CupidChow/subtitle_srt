1
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,905
Khen!

2
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,074
Toh! What the hell are you doing?

3
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,202
This is giving me a heart attack!

4
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:32,337
I think this place seems weird, it creeps me out.

5
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,676
It totally looks like a horror movie set.

6
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,141
-Can you snap me a picture?
-Sure.

7
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,897
Oh, stunning new renovation.

8
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,901
It looked great in the photos,

9
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,654
but it’s even greater than I expected.

10
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,368
I can't even imagine what it would have felt like

11
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,995
if we had come here before the renovation.

12
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,914
A haunted house?

13
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,000
Toh, don’t joking something like this.

14
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,835
What’s got you scared?

15
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,920
Huh?

16
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,297
-Huh?
-Don’t do this.
-Are you really scared?

17
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,051
You know what? Being our trainee here means scaring is no-go!

18
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,803
Right, Khen?

19
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,180
Ugh!

20
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,141
This guy is trying to act cool again.

21
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,279
If this house really has a ghost,

22
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,115
I guess it should help us carry our stuffs!

23
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,325
They’re useless,

24
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,202
the guests have arrived now!

25
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,705
No one’s greet us!

26
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,134
Damn it!

27
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,478
Hello, are you Auntie Jiam?

28
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,027
I’m Nam-Wha.

29
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:23,656
We’re looking to promote this house as one of the tourist attractions...

30
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:28,453
Follow me this way, I’ll take you guys to residence.

31
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,110
The master room is downstairs.

32
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,988
The other rooms are upstairs.

33
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,992
Just go up and turn left, I’ve set them for all of you.

34
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,620
You can pick whatever you want.

35
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,206
Thank you auntie.

36
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,793
So, I’ll get the master bedroom downstairs

37
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,128
Nam-Wha won’t have to keep going up and down all the time.

38
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,299
Well, so you’re using her to make yourself look gentlemanly.

39
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,899
No interference, ever!

40
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,115
I wouldn’t be surprised if I heard piano sounds late at night.

41
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,160
Let’s go, I’m curious to see what the room feels like.

42
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,164
Khen

43
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,792
What’s up, Bing?

44
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:28,633
Well, I just stopped by to see what your room looks like.

45
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,429
It’s nice.

46
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,890
The weather’s been really great lately.

47
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,977
If we didn’t have to work, this would be awesome.

48
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,856
I guess so.

49
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,235
If I could stay here for long I guess I’d happy to stay.

50
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,403
Staying here?

51
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,906
An ancient house in the middle of the woods?

52
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,200
Sounds terrifying.

53
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,746
With its history,

54
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,332
I can tell…it's not that impressive.

55
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,085
What’s impressive?

56
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,341
I’m not exaggerating,

57
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,927
but I have a six sense…

58
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,347
I’m just really sensitive to things like…

59
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,477
You’re starting to freak me out.

60
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,075
To be honest

61
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,829
Can I stay here with you?

62
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,581
I really don’t want to sleep alone.

63
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,917
I’d rather not sleep with Toh.

64
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,253
He’s always running his mouth.

65
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,504
I promise you.

66
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,589
I won’t snore.

67
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,590
I won’t toss and turn.

68
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,966
I won’t disturb you at all.

69
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,468
I’ll fold the bedding.

70
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,554
I’ll clean up and sweep the floor for you.

71
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,180
I beg you, Khen.

72
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,099
Please let me stay here.

73
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:00,641
Fine

74
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,769
After all this, I will let you stay.

75
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,895
Really?

76
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,105
Thank you!

77
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,110
What’s up, how’s everything?

78
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,195
Has anyone found anything yet?

79
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,491
I told you…

80
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,993
What are you talking about?

81
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,786
Gossiping me? You intern.

82
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,334
Have you finished unpacking? We’ll off soon.

83
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,210
Where will we go?

84
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,778
Bing?

85
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,655
You’re drinking too sweetened beverage.

86
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,032
What’s the matter? I like it.

87
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,537
Not sweeter than that couples.

88
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,459
What a delicious cake!

89
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,752
Fine

90
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,380
Well, well, well.

91
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,758
You guys are taking photos for pre-wedding use?

92
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,134
Stop running your mouth!

93
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,927
If you want to join just come and join.

94
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,596
Come here!

95
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,680
Come here quickly!

96
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,182
Bing, your duty.

97
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,266
Me, snap photos?

98
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:47,892
Ofcourse.

99
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,563
So Swag.

100
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:53,939
Good enough?

101
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,982
The outfit doesn’t suite.

102
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,865
Hello, feel free to take a look.

103
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,247
I'll take this one.

104
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,062
Been a century!

105
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,575
This posture?

106
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,785
Yes, I don’t have much ideas.

107
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,162
Let me check.

108
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,664
Say cheese!

109
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,093
It’s good enough?

110
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,679
Oh, Nam-Wha you’re so gorgeous.

111
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,602
You’re exaggerating.

112
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,607
Khen, come to join us taking a photo.

113
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,983
You were awaited.

114
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,194
Join us real quick!

115
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,280
Tan, it's your turn taking a photo.

116
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,031
Fine.

117
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,035
Ready?

118
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,455
Everyone has to tip your palms
And bend your arms like this.

119
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,873
Everyone bend your arms.

120
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,875
Say cheese!

121
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,307
Wow!

122
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:34,975
Awesome!

123
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,352
Shall we eat?

124
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,230
This is delicious.

125
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,735
Hey, Ms.Kat calls me.

126
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,237
Khem, you answers her call.

127
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,494
You answer the call and put it on speaker.

128
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,416
Hello, how was the western house?

129
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,335
Is it worthy of being a haunted house?

130
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,169
Well...

131
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,046
Everything is fine.

132
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,256
It wasn’t so scary as we expected.

133
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,676
The brand new renovation turned out much better.

134
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,219
Mr.Khen?

135
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,639
I guess I called Mr.Tan but never mind.

136
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:18,060
So…have you found any cool stuff to create content yet?

137
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,943
Not yet,

138
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,362
but I guess there might be some updates in a few days.

139
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,907
Do not forget the client’s brief.

140
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,494
They don’t want any supernatural occurrences in this house concealed

141
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,206
But they want to nail it and present in a compelling way.

142
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,129
We’ll do our best.

143
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,596
By the way, do you need any specific guests for the interview?

144
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,933
The woman spirit that everyone’s been buzzing about.

145
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:03,522
Let’s think about how exclusive our information will be?

146
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,405
Just kidding.

147
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,534
Let’s say…if there are any updates just email me anytime.

148
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,828
Alright, got it.

149
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,621
Thank you very much.

150
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,125
Have a nice trip everyone, bye!

151
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:24,960
Bye.

152
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,006
Alright, everyone!

153
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,175
We’re already enjoyed for today’s trip

154
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,553
but afterward, we need to get more serious.

155
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,264
Yes sir!

156
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,849
Got it!

157
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,560
Once this project is done,

158
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,563
I’ll take you all out for one last farewell trip.

159
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,981
Sounds good?

160
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,526
That’s why I want to work with you!

161
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,198
Working with me, work hard but play harder!

162
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,201
Cheers!

163
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,133
Khem, what are you doing here all by yourself?

164
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,510
Let’s go waiting for the fireworks over there.

165
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,095
Let’s go.

166
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,667
I’m tired!

167
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,210
What’s wrong?

168
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,546
Too much walked for today.

169
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,923
My legs are sore right now.

170
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,091
Sore legs?

171
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,261
So, tonight let me massage your legs.

172
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,514
Umm…Toh is very strong.

173
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,017
He spent the whole day with us and he still had energy to hang out his friends.

174
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,684
Agreed.

175
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,810
That’s just how he is.

176
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,686
So...

177
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,980
Tomorrow we start work at 9 AM.

178
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,566
Now, let’s get some rest tonight.

179
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,611
-Where is your pain?
-Legs.

180
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,405
We’re leaving right now, bye!

181
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,411
Where are you going Khen?

182
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,455
Umm...

183
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,167
I bought some sweets for Auntie Jiam, I’ll drop them off.

184
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,877
Do you want me to go along?

185
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,170
Don’t worry.

186
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,301
You should go take a shower.

187
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,723
You’re exaggerated!

188
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,018
So, I’ll go to take a shower first.

189
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,645
Please come back quickly.

190
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,105
I don’t want to be alone.

191
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,899
Got it.

192
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
Excuse me for startling you, Auntie.

193
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,373
No, I’m not.

194
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,499
I’m used to it.

195
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,044
I bought you some sweets.

196
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,344
Umm…do you mind if I bother you a second.

197
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,389
I’d like to ask you about this house.

198
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,641
I’m not actually be here.

199
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,935
I’m just here to take care of it.

200
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,562
And I have no idea about this house.

201
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,814
Well…

202
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,859
Do you know about the woman spirit living in the house?

203
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,236
Even if she does exist,

204
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,946
I don’t want to know anyway.

205
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,324
My today job has done, I’ll leaving now.

206
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,412
One thing, what would you like for breakfast tomorrow?

207
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,163
I’ll buy for you.

208
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,624
Anything.

209
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,001
I mean, whatever you select.

210
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,980
I can tell you because I used to hear about it.

211
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,232
Huh?

212
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,610
Where is the camera?

213
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,905
Will I be on TV?

214
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,201
I think I’ll research by myself tomorrow.

215
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,163
Take the camera.

216
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,289
I can tell you!

217
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,248
The ghost...

218
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,249
The ghost...

219
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:20,339
The ghost sways and stares intently at us like this.

220
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,694
Do you chant every single night?

221
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,280
Not every night.

222
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,325
My mom taught me that if I have to stay overnight in another place,

223
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:52,120
I should chant It’s for peace of mind

224
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,166
and to ensure there's nothing bothering me at night.

225
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,296
What do you mean by that?

226
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,007
I’m not talking anymore. I’m going to bed now.

227
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,047
Are you awake?

228
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,023
How was last night? Did you sleep well?

229
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,405
Let’s go change and have breakfast downstairs.

230
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,836
Breakfast is coming!

231
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,171
This from the most famous rice porridge place

232
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,339
and fermented pork sausage

233
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,342
This restaurant has been about over 50 years.

234
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,761
Thank you auntie!

235
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,970
Thank you!

236
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,348
Whoever is slow will miss out on gourmet!

237
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,015
Wait!

238
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,184
Let my camera eat first!

239
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,855
Honey, let's snap me some photos!

240
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,482
Say cheese!

241
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:38,870
This house was built during the era of King Rama 5 by Mr.Thomas.

242
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:43,458
The English missionary who came to Siam for Christianity evangelism.

243
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:48,588
He then started importing goods to sell and married with Ms.Pailin.

244
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:54,177
He built this house for starting a family filled with love and warmth.

245
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,011
By then…

246
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,769
I think it’s still unattractive and doesn’t meet the client’s needs.

247
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,189
By the way, overall context is good but the storytelling still boring the audiences

248
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,065
And...

249
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,110
The gentleman seems old fashioned.

250
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:21,580
Or we’ll try to find the haunted stories which can thrill the audiences?

251
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,832
As Ms.Kat said, nowadays,

252
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,210
Thai people usually like the haunted stories.

253
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,795
I think it’s going to be viral!

254
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,505
Viewer numbers will soar for sure!

255
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,633
Agreed, it’s interesting!

256
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,803
Khen, any ideas?

257
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,764
I’m not sure,

258
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,851
I’m just thinking are we deceiving consumers or not.

259
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,686
What's deceive?

260
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,564
The story is told by real human.

261
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,608
We didn’t make it up.

262
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,483
Right.

263
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,821
I think we put the haunted woman’s voice

264
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:59,701
and tell the story of her being the owner’s mistress who was mistreated by the legal wife.

265
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,996
I trust this plot will resonate ninety percent of Thai people.

266
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,456
But I think...

267
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,667
she will be unhappy about the story if we fake it.

268
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,088
Who are you referring to?

269
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,887
So…

270
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,767
did no one hear any noises last night?

271
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,072
At around 3 AM

272
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,531
I woke up to walk to the restroom

273
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,866
When I was walking back,

274
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,951
I saw Tan bedroom’s door ajar.

275
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,787
The light was still turn on,

276
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,580
I thought I’d go over and tease you.

277
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,164
Huh?

278
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,583
My room?

279
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,712
Me and Nam-Wha has been asleep since 11 PM.

280
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,006
It was so dark,

281
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,676
so when I walked to the end of the hall.

282
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,427
I thought it was your room.

283
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,727
Isn’t that the room Auntie Jiam told us not to enter?

284
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,649
I don’t know.

285
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,249
You’re seeing things!

286
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,126
No, I’m not. I’m telling the truth.

287
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,044
I’ve seen by my eyesights.

288
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,838
Do you ask for lotto numbers?

289
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,672
Toh!

290
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,966
Toh, do you think this is the time for that?

291
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,760
I don’t want to lose opportunities.

292
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,264
Can I move to the hotel?

293
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,599
Bing, you’re still in trainee period.

294
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,727
You have to be patient while working.

295
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,021
This is just the beginning you will face many challenges along the way.

296
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,606
Just go easy on him.

297
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,734
He’s still freaking out.

298
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,819
Whether he’s dreaming or not...

299
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,029
he needs to succeed his tasks anyway.

300
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,655
Right?

301
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,350
Let’s take a selfie!

302
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,393
The sun will set so soon.

303
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,606
You’re seeing things!

304
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,733
No, I’m not. I’m telling the truth.

305
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,359
I’ve seen by my eyesights.

306
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,697
Bing!

307
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,657
Khem...

308
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,202
What are you doing, you’re acting like a kid.

309
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,871
I’m coming to check if you’re feeling better now?

310
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,001
My anger cooled down right now.

311
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,670
How easy is that?

312
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:04,511
Can you sense the spirits surrounding us here, Bing, the spiritual channeler?

313
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,389
Are you serious?

314
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,358
Recently, have you been sensing anything strange?

315
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,777
Nothing.

316
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,033
I’ve been sensing a spirit ever since...

317
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,828
you arrived in Chiang Mai.

318
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,791
It seems to follow you wherever you go.

319
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,505
I’m not sure what it wants

320
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:46,177
but it won't stop until it get what it needs.

321
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,972
So...

322
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,183
Where is it?

323
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,208
What are you doing, Toh?

324
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,255
Bing, you’re non-stop laughter!

325
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,550
I’m coming to get you all for dinner, I’m hungry right now.

326
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,718
Me too.

327
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,305
I get many famous restaurant lists from my friends.

328
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,307
I’ll go afterwards.

329
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,517
I need to stop by the library first.

330
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,477
You're, wayward guy aren't you?

331
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,645
Just a sec…

332
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,148
Catch up quickly, okay?

333
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,482
Let’s go!

334
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,841
What are you looking for?

335
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,260
Umm...

336
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,639
This one is really impressive.

337
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,230
I’m not a big fan of novel.

338
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,777
I’m looking for information about the western house of Mr.Tho…

339
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,862
That haunted western house?

340
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:14,993
Follow me.

341
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,257
This block can’t be borrowed.

342
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,010
Be careful while handling it...

343
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,347
because some of the books are older than you.

344
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:39,809
I get it.

345
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,089
Khen, how's it going?

346
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,258
Have you found any spiritual topic?

347
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,430
It has nothing spiritually, just a generic topic.

348
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:23,061
In the past, no one would have recorded that there were ghosts in their own home.

349
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,034
What should we do next?

350
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,622
Hey!

351
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,541
Why don’t we write it ourselves?

352
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,045
Are you insane? What if she gets angry?

353
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,174
We’ll do it with good intentions.

354
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,551
We want people know about this place.

355
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,763
I think it will be fine.

356
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,099
How do you think?

357
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,226
How about you, Tan?

358
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,394
Then, you write something up first,

359
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,938
and we’ll see how the story turns out.

360
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,899
I’ll propose it to Ms.Kat to see if she’s interested in this idea or not.

361
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:12,610
Okay.

362
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,531
Got it, Ms.Kat.

363
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,365
Good afternoon!

364
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,076
I’ve consulted internally,

365
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:27,416
and everyone thinks it would be better to shift from the story of Mr.Thomas to horror ghost theme.

366
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,876
What do you think?

367
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,963
No, I don’t like

368
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,256
I don’t agree with you.

369
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,854
Damn, none of the ideas she agreed to.

370
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,482
I know you’re all exhausted,

371
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,528
But I want you to keep fighting.

372
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,115
So…the dinner is on me!

373
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,491
You won’t keep complaining anymore.

374
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,410
Even if you bring entire pot of 'Hang Lay Curry'

375
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,329
It still won’t heal my soul.

376
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,125
Then...

377
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,922
What if we take a break and spend a night at 'Doi Ang Khang'?

378
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,007
Let’s relax, are you in?

379
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,178
Hey, would it be okay? Our work isn’t finished yet.

380
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,056
So, you keep working here and wait for us.

381
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,682
We’re just going for one night and will be back soon.

382
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,476
How can this be possible?

383
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,019
We're teammates!

384
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,270
Then, why do you say that?

385
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,563
Don’t leave me.

386
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,524
Okay we’re all in, let’s eat first.

387
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,860
Bing, sip it, just a sip you won’t get drunk.

388
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,406
Just feel for it.

389
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,243
Come here, come cheers.

390
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,122
Come cheers.

391
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,541
Cheers!

392
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,459
Damn, why didn’t you guys wait for me?

393
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,335
Hurry up.

394
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,881
Here’s Bing, sing a little.

395
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,426
No, I won't.

396
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:24,885
Just a bit.

397
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,638
Come on, give it a try.

398
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,515
Sing what you always sing.

399
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,225
Come on.

400
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,493
At least there's a phone signal here.

401
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,038
How is it related?

402
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,667
I’ve noticed that wherever there’s a strong signal,

403
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,086
I can sense things too.

404
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,423
The spirits also have their own signals.

405
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,384
For example,

406
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,887
the western house has a strongful signal.

407
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,555
Means that the telecommunication employees...

408
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,640
don’t get haunted all the time?

409
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,684
No, not everyone can sense things.

410
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,770
Our brainwave might not be in sync with each other,

411
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,939
but in case we do sync it, we’ll sense it.

412
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,524
If not, we won’t.

413
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,611
I’m totally sure that you will sense tonight.

414
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,446
Sense what?

415
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,864
Under the blanket!

416
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,157
Please! Don't!

417
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,358
It’s beautiful.

418
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,152
Agreed.

419
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,446
If we were in the city,

420
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,198
we’d never get to see this stunning view.

421
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,037
Shaming that Toh didn’t wake up.

422
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,373
We can’t do anything,

423
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,166
he already missed out the greatest moment.

424
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,422
Being here with beloved one would be so amazing,

425
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,966
right?

426
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,927
I couldn’t agree more.

427
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,066
Damn!

428
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,193
This spot is very beautiful.

429
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,570
How about me?

430
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,154
More beautiful than the scenery.

431
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,950
Women never get tired of taking photos.

432
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,208
Aren’t you going to join too?

433
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,502
I saw you lead us to be here.

434
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,670
Well,

435
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,923
actually, when we are voting I had to take Nam-Wha’s side.

436
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,426
She’s the money holder,

437
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,930
if she doesn’t pay us, we’re all doomed.

438
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,308
You are tactful!

439
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,769
Of course!

440
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,068
Let’s hurry back.

441
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,361
It’s about to rain,

442
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,614
and it could be dangerous if drive down the mountain.

443
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,198
See, I told you.

444
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,326
If we hadn’t stopped we’d already be back to the city by now.

445
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,744
Then, hurry up!

446
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,454
Why do you keep complaining?

447
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,271
Why do we park under the tree?

448
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,856
Didn’t you see the rain?

449
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,149
How am I supposed to drive?

450
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,526
Let’s wait for the rain to ease before we continue driving.

451
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,778
Is that a good idea?

452
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,946
There's a curve ahead.

453
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,324
What should we do?

454
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,825
What if the cars behind us can’t even see?

455
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,036
Here goes nothing…

456
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,377
Okay, fine.

457
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,592
See?

458
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,260
If we hadn’t stopped earlier…

459
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,014
Why does it matter?

460
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,432
We’ve already stopped!

461
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,727
Who knew it was going to rain?

462
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,057
Khen, I'll go to sleep with Toh tonight.

463
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,394
You'll be able to sleep comfortably.

464
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,564
If you need anything, just call me anytime.

465
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,274
Thank you.

466
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,819
Make sure to get plenty of rest

467
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,863
so that the wound heals quickly

468
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,244
Be careful with the wound while showering too

469
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,246
And don't forget...

470
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,082
if you need anything, you can call me anytime

471
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,459
Okay?

472
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,046
Are you okay?

473
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,721
It's raining and thundering really loudly.

474
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,807
Are you dreaming or something?

475
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,060
I don’t see any rain at all.

476
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,857
And when I woke up with a start,

477
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,694
I saw a foreign child sitting on the bed.

478
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:13,033
I think it might be because your head was jostled or bumped.

479
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,829
No, it felt so real.

480
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,336
Try doing it this way.

481
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,464
Try holding your breath.

482
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,257
People say that

483
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,386
If you hold your breath, ghosts won’t be able to see you.

484
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,764
Who is 'people' that you’re talking about?

485
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,398
How about this, You sleep with me instead.

486
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:47,818
And what about me?

487
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,779
Well, Khen is hurt...

488
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,114
so you should sleep on the floor for now.

489
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,282
Are you going to make him sleep on the floor?

490
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,496
That's enough. No more talking. Just go!

491
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,084
Okay.

492
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,713
Not fair.

493
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,840
Let's go to sleep.

494
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,508
Why always me?

495
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,261
Or would you rather go sleep in Khen's room alone?

496
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,848
Choose whichever you prefer.

497
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,725
Fine, I’ll sleep here then

498
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:13,487
Could you please play the song 'Lao Duang Deuan' for me?

499
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,283
Pin wants to listen to it.

500
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,702
Please?

501
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,269
Why did you stop playing Mas?

502
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,704
Mas, are you looking for something?

503
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,001
Nothing.

504
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,540
People say that...

505
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,126
If you hold your breath, ghosts won’t be able to see you.

506
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,791
What are you doing here?

507
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:23,236
Are you still thinking about that foreign kid from that night?

508
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:29,492
A ghost is a spirit that has died unrestfully

509
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,369
so the spirit doesn’t move on.

510
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:40,003
Why do we keep going to the same places over and over

511
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,422
and never go anywhere else?

512
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,302
Or is it that we actually can't go anywhere else?
