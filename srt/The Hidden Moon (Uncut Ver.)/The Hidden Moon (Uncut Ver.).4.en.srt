1
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,220
I don’t think it’s a dream.

2
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,980
This house really has spirits.

3
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,980
It's different from what Mrs.Kat said,

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,400
That there has never been a murder or death here.

5
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,280
Please don’t leave me alone.

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,660
Do you think I’m helping you, Moon?

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,040
My notebook.

8
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,710
Put it back where it was.

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,950
Mas!

10
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,620
Help me please!

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,870
Mas!

12
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,540
Help me please!

13
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,170
Mas!

14
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,840
Mas!

15
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,090
Mas!

16
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,550
Help me please!

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,760
Mas!

18
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,430
Mas!

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,230
Help me!

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,440
Help me please!

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,610
Mas!

22
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,150
Help me please!

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,740
Mas!

24
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,910
Help me!

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,990
Khen.

26
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,060
You helped me.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,980
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,040
Are you looking for something?

29
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,960
I heard a loud noise. Is something happening?

30
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,840
I didn't hear anything at all.

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,970
Are you imagining it?

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,760
But I thought I heard someone fall for sure.

33
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,650
Since you're already here, could you help prepare some food for me?

34
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,190
Wash your face first.

35
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,510
Thank you for helping me.

36
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,180
I really don’t understand.

37
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,140
Why you keep coming back here over and over.

38
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,110
I didn’t mean to come here.

39
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,570
She was the one who brought me here.

40
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,540
Did you kill her?

41
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,960
She is a ghost.

42
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,330
A ghost is someone who has died.

43
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,630
How could I have killed them again?

44
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,920
Ghosts chase each other around?

45
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,390
You really say the funniest things.

46
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,560
Alright, think whatever you want.

47
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,850
So how did you get rid of her?

48
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,860
Or does that axe have magic?

49
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,400
There’s no magic at all.

50
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,410
She’s just afraid of what she knows could harm her.

51
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,700
Does that mean we can use anything to make charms or holy water?

52
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,000
As long as that ghost believes it?

53
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,040
How well do you think you know ghosts?

54
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,010
So.....

55
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,930
Who is that female ghost?

56
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
Why does she have to keep trying to harm me?

57
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,440
She harms others indiscriminately.

58
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,690
As long as that person can see her.

59
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,530
She will keep appearing over and over.

60
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,150
Is she a member of your family?

61
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,990
She’s not related to me.

62
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,490
And I don’t want to be involved with her either.

63
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,500
-So why is she here?
-The time for asking questions is over.

64
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,960
Forget about her.

65
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,500
And don’t think about getting involved with her again.

66
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,500
If you don’t want to......

67
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,710
What do you mean?

68
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,180
Don’t you understand what I’m saying?

69
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,350
I said the time for questions is over.

70
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,400
Is this your office?

71
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,530
You really can’t stop asking questions, can you?

72
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,990
This is my father’s office.

73
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,500
Mr.Thomas Coleridge

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,050
Can I walk around and take a look?

75
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,650
Give it a try.

76
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,280
I can see the moon very clearly.

77
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,380
We are all the moon....

78
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,550
With a dark side we don't want anyone to see.

79
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,140
Mark Twain said.

80
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,890
You are really knowledgeable.

81
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,730
Cowards die many times before their deaths.

82
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,770
The valiant never taste of death but once.

83
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,150
The sentence you told me before.

84
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,950
Julius Caesar is quoted in the book by William Shakespeare.

85
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,620
What else do you know?

86
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,040
My favorite poem.

87
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,000
Hell is empty and all the devils are here

88
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,710
Some rise with sins that they embrace.

89
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,970
While others fall, their virtues trace.

90
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,220
Measure of Measure.

91
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,810
Nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

92
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,600
Hamlet said.

93
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,900
Let me add another sentence for you.

94
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,700
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

95
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,490
From Romeo and Juliet.

96
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,330
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

97
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,210
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

98
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,580
Sonnet 18.

99
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,170
Is it so? That is the question

100
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,880
Hamlet said.

101
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,600
It’s clear that you are knowledgeable.

102
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,100
It’s clear that you are infatuated with William Shakespeare.

103
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,560
Infatuated?

104
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,980
I mean......

105
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,190
You like it a lot.

106
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,740
I mean......

107
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,320
He is your favorite.

108
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,620
You shouldn’t use that word.

109
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,670
I just admire the poetry in his works.

110
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,790
The word ‘infatuated’

111
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,050
Sounds like being blindly obsessed.

112
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,930
So.

113
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,140
Every time I meet you, I often find myself losing my composure.

114
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,230
Does this mean I'm.....

115
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,190
Infatuated with you?

116
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,290
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it that way.

117
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,380
I just wanted to express that you admire Shakespeare’s work to the point of being infatuated.

118
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,970
How curious you are,The moon.

119
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,860
Is that a Thai kitchen?

120
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,200
There are both, In the evening, my mother will cook Thai food.

121
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,830
There are curries, stir-fries, and thai salads, all prepared without any flaws.

122
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,450
Does your mother worry that you might forget you are half Thai?

123
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,420
How could I forget? I was born here and grew up here.

124
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,000
And what about Western cuisine?

125
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,130
In the morning, my mother prepares Western food.

126
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,180
Because my father is used to that.

127
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,720
In the afternoon, there will be tea and cookies.

128
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,850
Cookies?

129
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Do you know it too?

130
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,310
That’s my favorite.

131
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,690
I like it a lot.

132
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,400
But.

133
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,230
But..I have it with green tea.

134
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,860
It might seem a bit strange.

135
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,610
It’s not strange.

136
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,240
I’m used to it already.

137
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,240
Here, Thai and Western customs are all mixed together.

138
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:37,250
Is it like when your sister asked to play the song 'Lao Damnoen Kewian' on the piano?

139
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,340
Can you play it for me next time?

140
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,010
Next time?

141
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,050
If you can’t, it’s okay.

142
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,060
Why not now?

143
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,400
Why don’t you stay?

144
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,900
Can you stay?

145
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,570
Go hide in my room for now.

146
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,410
And you can come out once it is dark out.

147
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,290
And I will play the song 'Lao Damnoen Kewian' for you.

148
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,040
Just like you wanted.

149
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,840
Look at your face!

150
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,800
Do you really think I’m serious?

151
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,680
Do you think I invited you because we’re friends?

152
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,150
Well, I’ll go now.

153
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,190
Where are you going?

154
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,440
I’m going back to my world.

155
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,530
How?

156
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,950
I’ll figure it out my own way soon.

157
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,080
Doubt thou the stars are fire.

158
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,580
Doubt that the sun doth move.

159
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,550
Doubt truth to be a liar.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,220
But never doubt that I love.

161
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,720
I know that you like William Shakespeare.

162
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,680
Don’t go out just yet.

163
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,520
There are a lot of people right now.

164
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,030
Mas, can you open the door for me?

165
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,510
Come on in.

166
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,720
Who were you talking to just now?

167
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,470
I was just reciting some poetry.

168
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,730
Be quiet. I’m playing hide and seek with Pin.

169
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,650
Can I hide here?

170
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,080
Mas, can I go into the room?

171
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,960
Come on in.

172
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,750
Is Dara here?

173
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,800
I can’t tell you.

174
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,720
You have to go find her yourself.

175
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,550
Replying like this means she’s here.

176
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,430
I feel like someone is here.

177
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,850
Got you! Stop!

178
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,770
My mother’s picture really helped you.

179
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,450
I have to thank your mother. She’s both beautiful and kind.

180
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,410
Yes, she’s very kind.

181
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,130
She bought me toys when I asked for them.

182
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,760
That wind-up rabbit you’ve seen is my favorite.

183
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:49,480
But her health wasn’t strong, so she couldn’t stay with me for long.

184
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,990
Why are you looking at me like that?

185
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,620
What kind of look?

186
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,330
Really very gentle.

187
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,390
Don’t cry. Even though your mother has passed away.

188
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,430
You still have a father who loves you very much.

189
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,350
In the future.

190
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,770
You will have two younger sisters who will love you dearly.

191
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,610
You will grow up to be a well-rounded man and become a pillar for your family.

192
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,620
Was it you at that time?

193
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,880
When was it?

194
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,920
The moon.

195
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,920
What do you want from me?

196
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,410
Do you have any ideas?

197
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,960
Me and Bing wonder...

198
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,090
Could this have anything to do with this?

199
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,730
Where did it come from?

200
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,480
We.....

201
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,440
Found it when Khen came back from the bathroom.

202
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,280
Before going to the bedroom.

203
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Speaking of which, Khen has been acting a bit strange lately.

204
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,250
Yes.

205
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,930
Are you thinking that Khen is being controlled by a ghost?

206
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,970
I didn't mean it that way.

207
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,390
But isn’t it possible for anything to happen right now?

208
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,140
Then......

209
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,980
I'll go check on Khen first, okay?

210
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,360
I'll be right back.

211
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,530
Toh.

212
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,450
I need you to go check around the house

213
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,540
if you can find a way for us to get out of here.

214
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,790
I don’t want to leave Nam-Wha alone.

215
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,920
So you want me to go alone, huh?

216
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,380
Please take care of it for me.

217
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Nam-Wha.

218
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,130
Nam-Wha.

219
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,590
Nam-Wha.

220
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:30,970
Nam-Wha.

221
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,390
What do you want from me?

222
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,810
What I want from you right now?

223
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,650
Maybe........

224
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,400
friendship?

225
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,900
Can you give me that?

226
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,240
Nam-Wha.

227
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,000
Don’t say anything, go check on Nam-Wha first.

228
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,210
Bing.

229
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:01,880
Toh.

230
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,420
Nam-wha.

231
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:04,880
Tan.

232
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,220
Tan.

233
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,970
Nam-wha.

234
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,140
Khen.

235
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,560
What happened?

236
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,480
Nam-Wha ran out all of a sudden.

237
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,650
And Tan ran after her.

238
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,900
Now both of them have disappeared into the forest.

239
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,200
What do we do next?

240
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,280
We have to go look for her.

241
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,950
We won’t get lost in the forest too, right?

242
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,670
Eitherway, we have to go look for Nam-Wha and Tan.

243
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,880
If you can't, you can wait here.

244
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,340
No way!

245
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,460
I want to help look for them too.

246
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,090
Then.

247
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,720
Let’s shout so we know where everyone is.

248
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,350
Let’s go.

249
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,060
Nam-wha.

250
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,810
Tan.

251
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,690
Tan.

252
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,070
Nam-wha.

253
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,900
Nam-wha.

254
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,900
Nam-wha.

255
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:10,990
Tan.

256
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,360
Tan.

257
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,780
Nam-wha.

258
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,450
Nam-wha.

259
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,530
Tan.

260
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,580
Nam-wha.

261
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,790
Nam-wha.

262
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,250
Tan.

263
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,430
Tan.

264
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:37,970
Nam-wha.

265
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,850
Can anyone hear me?

266
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,310
Tan.

267
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,150
Nam-wha.

268
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,400
Where are you guys?

269
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,480
Tan.

270
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,570
Where are you guys?

271
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,240
Nam-wha.

272
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,370
Tan.

273
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,160
Nam-wha.

274
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:04,870
Tan.

275
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,710
Tan.

276
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,180
Tan.

277
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,840
Nam-wha.

278
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,060
Nam-wha.

279
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,930
Where are you.

280
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:24,810
Khen.

281
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,850
I was so startled!

282
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,070
I still can’t find Nam-Wha.

283
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,400
I think you should take it easy for a moment.

284
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
Nam-Wha is probably scared right now.

285
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,450
If we keep shouting, she should respond.

286
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,410
Alright, I’ll go that way.

287
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,290
I’ll go that way.

288
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,340
Nam-wha.

289
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,170
Nam-wha.

290
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,470
Nam-wha.

291
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,300
Nam-wha.

292
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,760
Where are you.

293
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,850
Nam-wha.

294
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,390
Nam-wha.

295
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,440
Nam-wha.

296
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,170
Nam-wha.

297
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,800
Nam-wha.

298
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,180
Nam-wha.

299
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,680
Nam-wha.

300
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,810
Nam-wha.

301
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,320
Nam-wha.

302
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,200
Nam-wha.

303
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,990
Nam-wha.

304
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,830
Nam-wha.

305
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,420
It’s okay, I’m here now.

306
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,130
Why does it have to be like this?

307
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,560
Calm down.

308
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,230
We are going home.

309
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,850
Everyone is trying to find a way.

310
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,580
We can't go back anymore.

311
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,800
The voice I'm hearing....

312
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,190
Is my mother calling my name.

313
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,400
Khen.

314
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,990
Khen.

315
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,110
Are you okay?

316
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,320
Okay.

317
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,420
Are you okay?

318
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,460
Toh.

319
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,260
How about Tan and Nam-Wha?

320
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,310
They could be hiding somewhere.

321
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,480
Do you really think that?

322
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,820
It's getting close to nightfall.

323
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,530
I think we should go look for them again.

324
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,570
No.

325
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,370
Somehow, Tan has to help get Nam-Wha out.

326
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,500
But now it's about to rain.

327
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,330
I think we should go back now.

328
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,790
Let's go.

329
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,590
A rainbow!

330
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,600
Someone once told me that if you see a rainbow, you'll be lucky.

331
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,690
Let's hope that's true.

332
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,280
Something just feels strange, I don’t know why.

333
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,040
Let's go.

334
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,330
Let’s go home.

335
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,580
Tan.

336
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,870
Nam-wha.

337
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,290
Tan.

338
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:23,960
Nam-wha.

339
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,210
Tan.

340
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,010
Nam-wha.

341
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,760
Tan.

342
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,930
Nam-wha.

343
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,850
Where's Bing?

344
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:35,720
There!

345
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,520
Did you find anything?

346
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,180
No.

347
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,980
Me too.

348
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,760
Did you go see him yourself?

349
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,300
The ghost of the owner's son, that is.

350
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,640
Why did you have to put yourself at risk?

351
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,980
Calm down,

352
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,270
It's true.

353
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,480
He used to hurt me.

354
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,280
But when I told him about his father.

355
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,870
He stopped hurting me.

356
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,580
And.....

357
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,790
He even helped me from that woman ghost in that room.

358
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,130
Do you trust him?

359
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,510
If he wanted to hurt me.

360
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,810
Why would he help me from that female ghost?

361
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,930
No. He's no different from that woman ghost.

362
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,900
The souls of both will neither ascend nor reincarnate.

363
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,700
The story of his father might not be the root cause.

364
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,700
But it could be linked to that woman’s spirit.

365
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,870
What you know....

366
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,500
....might only be part of the truth.

367
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,290
Who knows...

368
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,210
That gun and axe.

369
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,220
Could have been the weapon....

370
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,390
....used to kill him.

371
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,060
No.

372
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,520
He could be the one who can give us the answers.

373
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,200
The ghost of the owner's son.

374
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,780
He could have been
the one who kidnapped Tan and Nam-Wha.

375
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,240
Mas isn't the culprit.

376
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,660
We won't know until....

377
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,830
....we can see it with our own eyes.

378
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,090
What do you mean?

379
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,930
Let's go investigate, if he is the culprit or not.

380
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,790
Why are you making that face?

381
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,670
If something happens to you guys, what will I do?

382
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,470
If anything strange happens, wake me quickly.

383
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,100
What are you doing here again?

384
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,230
Where have you taken my friends?

385
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,400
How dare you accuse me like that?

386
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,740
If you didn't do it,

387
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Then you have to find a way to help my friends come back.

388
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,240
Just like how you helped me from that tree.

389
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,450
Which tree are you talking about?

390
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,050
I'm talking about the time I got tangled in the tree, and you came in with an axe to help me.

391
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,760
Mas.

392
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,090
Mas.

393
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,430
Mas.

394
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,050
Help me!

395
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,380
I don’t know what you’re going on about.

396
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,590
My friends are missing, and I can’t just leave them like that.

397
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,930
What a fool..

398
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,350
You are both a fool and delusional

399
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,070
You've repeatedly told me that you're trapped here and are trying to find a way out,

400
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,530
But once it happens,

401
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,900
You're still not satisfied.

402
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,240
What exactly do you need?

403
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,330
You're telling me that they've left this place?

404
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,380
I only know that they are not here.

405
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,300
I can trust you, right?

406
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,270
Just trust your own heart, Khen.

407
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,610
Don't leave me like this.

408
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,410
You've asked too much for me!

409
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,920
Get out of here right now and don’t ever come back!

410
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,880
I'm sorry.

411
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,560
Close your eyes.

412
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,170
Think of the things that make you feel safe.

413
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,180
Think of the things that make you feel safe.

414
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,690
Think of the things that make you feel safe.

415
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,010
How did you do that?

416
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,810
It’s you.

417
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,100
How did you do that?

418
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,860
Is it because of us or because of my dreams?

419
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,190
I cannot know for sure.

420
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,830
Your bedroom...

421
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,840
Is the room I stay in.

422
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,430
That’s my computer.

423
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,480
That I told you about before

424
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,790
Is this really true?

425
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,420
Just trust your own heart, Mas.

426
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,260
Then...

427
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,350
I...

428
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,560
I want to apologize for the things I said to you before.

429
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,940
Can you forgive me?

430
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,280
So we can be friends, right?

431
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,500
You and I, are we friends then?

432
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,880
It’s impossible.

433
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,380
Why.

434
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,720
No matter the gender or nationality.

435
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,390
We can be friends, right?

436
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,640
You really are a fool that speaks nonsense.

437
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,650
So, can we be.....

438
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,490
Friends?

439
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,790
Maybe we can.

440
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,050
What is this?

441
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,890
That's the file where I keep all the information about this house.

442
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,430
Can I take a look at it?

443
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:30,850
Sure.

444
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,950
The ghost of the foreign child who died in this house, right?

445
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,920
It's old information....

446
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,290
That I wrote down since the first day I came here.

447
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,250
And back then, I didn't even know you.

448
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,880
Don’t pay any attention to it.

449
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,380
Why are you closing it?

450
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,470
There's nothing at all.

451
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,430
But I want to see the one from earlier.

452
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,140
But there really is nothing there.

453
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,980
What are you hiding that you don’t want me to see?

454
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,730
There’s nothing, really.

455
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,270
Prove it.

456
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,860
Show that you're sincere.

457
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,780
Open it.

458
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,660
Are you sure?

459
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,700
Do you think I would judge you for this?

460
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,920
Humans are complex.

461
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,130
Whether alive or dead.

462
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,730
Khen.

463
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,480
Khen.

464
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,360
What’s wrong?

465
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,860
Khen.

466
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:10,910
Khen.

467
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:43,940
Khen!!!

468
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,000
What’s wrong with you?

469
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,290
Are you okay?

470
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,340
How about Toh.

471
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:16,850
Toh.

472
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:18,190
Toh.

473
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,060
Toh.

474
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,860
Toh!!!

475
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,000
Why am I back here?

476
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,420
I thought I had left this place.

477
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,760
Went back to Bangkok.

478
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,840
Lived a happy life.

479
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,770
Was that just a dream?

480
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,520
Why did you wake me up?

481
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,860
What do you mean?

482
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,610
I asked you to help Tan and Nam-Wha

483
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,280
So you dreamed that you were the only one who survived?

484
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,990
Don’t accuse me like that.

485
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,280
I’m not a selfish person.

486
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,870
But your dream was like that.

487
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,750
That's enough.

488
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,340
Did you see anything related to Tan and Nam-Wha?

489
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,010
Sometimes...

490
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,560
The story might not be as we think it is.

491
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:40,890
Then what is it?

492
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,610
Tan and Nam-Wha have already left this place.

493
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:59,960
Now, it's just the three of us who need to find a way out of here.

494
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,550
I think I’ll try doing what I did last night.

495
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,340
If I can go back to Bangkok in my dream.

496
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,100
Then I should be able to do it in reality too.

497
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,020
How do we do it?

498
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,060
I can’t tell you, the owner's son’s ghost might find out.

499
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,190
Let me go with you.

500
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,450
Please, just tell me.

501
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,290
Khen, you're not coming with us?

502
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,380
Was I in your dream?

503
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,300
No.

504
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,630
See?

505
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,140
I already told you that if I'm in it, you can't leave either.

506
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,100
And send me an email to let me know what method to use.

507
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,610
You think we’re going to have to come back again, right?

508
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,730
No, I didn't mean it like that.

509
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,740
Alright! Just wait for an email from me.

510
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,530
I'm getting out of here for sure.

511
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:05,620
The song "Lao Damnoen Khwaen" was composed by His Royal Highness Prince Bhanubhandhu Vachira,

512
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:11,880
The 41st son of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn (Rama V),

513
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,720
The King of Siam, and his royal consort.

514
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,260
At that time, when he was still Prince Phayun Pattanapong,

515
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,640
And had just returned from studying in England,

516
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:30,190
He traveled to Chiang Mai, the center of Lanna culture.

517
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,360
He received a warm welcome from the local nobility,

518
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:40,320
And met Princess Chomchuen, the eldest daughter of the ruling prince,

519
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,950
And Princess Khamyon.

520
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:46,830
When he saw Princess Chomchuen, he was struck by her astonishing beauty,

521
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,370
Leading to a feeling of enchantment in his heart......

522
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,080
Akin to love at first sight.

523
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,210
Help me please!

524
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,340
Mas!

525
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,630
Khen!

526
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,260
The word ‘infatuated’

527
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,560
Sounds like being blindly obsessed.

528
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,060
So.

529
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,270
Every time I meet you, I often find myself losing my composure.

530
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,360
Does this mean I'm.....

531
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,320
Infatuated with you?

532
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,590
Can you play it for me next time?

533
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,380
"Lao Damnoen Khwaen"

534
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,760
Why not now?

535
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,140
Why don’t you stay?

536
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:29,890
Can you stay?

537
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,780
Today, my friend is going to propose to his girlfriend.

538
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,370
I need you to pick up the engagement ring that Smith left for me.

539
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,290
And bring it to me at the party.

540
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,750
Before all the guests leave.

541
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,670
He’s a pretty cute little ghost, isn’t he?
