1
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,754
Don't even think about it!

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,551
You guys wanna take a break from work and spend a night at 'Doi Ang Khang'?

3
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,722
Hey, would it be okay? Our work isn’t even finished yet!

4
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,907
What are you doing here?

5
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:17,906
Morning!

6
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,159
Hurry down and have breakfast!

7
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,410
The crispy pork is really delicious.

8
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,120
I’ll come down in a moment.

9
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,364
Hey, why is khen taking so long in the shower?

10
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,867
Look, he’s coming!

11
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,663
Wow, you're a mess.

12
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,789
Hey, Khen.

13
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,127
How’s it going?

14
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,088
I'm still a little sore.

15
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,299
It should get better in about 2-3 days.

16
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,137
Khen.

17
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,347
I kept the crispy pork for you.

18
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,808
Otherwise, Toh would've definitely ate it all.

19
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:10,852
Thank you.

20
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,645
Come on, you're being so possessive over this.

21
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,355
That's 'cause everything here is good!

22
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,107
That.

23
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,525
That Jin Som hits the spot.

24
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,152
10 out 10, period.

25
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,412
Didn't we just have this the other day?

26
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,581
Oh,yeah...

27
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,925
I heard you had a nightmare last night?

28
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,930
News travel fast, huh?

29
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,060
A dream?

30
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,439
Yeah, you could call it that.

31
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,277
Because if it was a ghost, it would probably scare Bing.

32
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,238
Why are you saying that?

33
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,699
Why are you saying that?

34
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,828
In that case, let's take a break today.

35
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:11,871
What?

36
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,373
Break from what?

37
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,832
We just went on a trip together.

38
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,167
Now we’re taking another break?

39
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,336
So when will we get to finish our work?

40
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,170
Hey, Honey.

41
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,506
We just went through a fatal situation!

42
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,841
Khen is still in pain.

43
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,094
Look at Bing.

44
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,720
Bing's still scared out of his mind!

45
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,097
And Toh.

46
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,397
See, I still have a sore neck.

47
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,024
Feeling kinda fatigued too..

48
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,694
What a performance...

49
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:46,906
Honey.

50
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,908
Don’t act like a crazy dictator.

51
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,952
Wasn’t it you who said to me?

52
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,036
That we would work in a way that.

53
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,955
"Work hard play harder"

54
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,629
Alright, alright, alright...

55
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,380
I get it.

56
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,715
To all our esteemed subordinates,

57
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,634
Where would you like to go for a vacation?

58
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,138
'Cause this boss is gonna take care of everything.

59
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,606
Let's go to.....

60
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,131
Hey, Honey.

61
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,632
Here again?

62
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,552
What are you talking about?

63
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,471
We were only here for a while that day.

64
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,431
We don’t even have a signature photo yet.

65
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,349
What signature photo?

66
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,687
She has a secret.

67
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,898
Again and again....

68
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,277
Toh, you need to come over here.

69
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,946
I can't communicate with these things.

70
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:09,822
Quickly!

71
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,163
Do you usually see ghosts often?

72
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,459
Kind of, I guess...

73
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,961
It depends on the place.

74
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,172
Sometimes, it’s just a feeling.

75
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,674
But sometimes I see it head-on.

76
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,931
Are you still thinking about that foreign kid from that night?

77
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,982
I think your brain is just having a hard time dealing with it.

78
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,109
It’s probably due to the accident.

79
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,404
Normally, you’re not someone who sees ghosts, aren't you?

80
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,657
Yeah, that’s true.

81
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,911
What do ghosts want so bad that they need to let people see them?

82
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,915
I don’t know either, actually.

83
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:02,875
How can you not know?

84
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,045
I thought you were an expert on ghosts.

85
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,798
Ghosts aren’t friends, you know?

86
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,133
If I see one, I'll just run away.

87
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,928
Do you want me to ask for a phone number or exchange LINE IDs or something?

88
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,932
If possible, I’d recommend not getting involved.

89
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,726
So that means you’ve never talked to one, right?

90
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,436
And you don’t know what they want either?

91
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,855
I really want you to experience it for yourself.

92
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,898
You’d finally understand me.

93
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,984
Hey, you can’t say that.

94
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,947
I'm asking because I really want to know, not to annoy you.

95
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,912
A ghost is a spirit that has died unpeacefully.

96
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,455
so the spirit doesn’t move on.

97
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,418
Thing is, it's not good that it's not leaving.

98
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,254
If you get haunted by a ghost, try talking to it.

99
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,380
That way, you might get to understand it better.

100
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,382
Bing!!!

101
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,258
Do you understand?

102
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,801
The first photo is the best.

103
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,468
I’m annoyed.

104
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,970
I'm annoyed too.

105
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,847
Hey, let's go!

106
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm really hungry.

107
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,977
You guys go ahead. I’ll join you later.

108
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,937
Lemme go get some information at the library first.

109
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,897
You’re too hardworking.

110
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,649
Can I come with you?

111
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,942
It's fine.

112
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,989
Let's just meet back at home then.

113
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,536
Okay, that works.

114
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,204
Let's go!

115
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,100
This house belongs to Mr. Thomas.

116
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,561
An Englishman who is a missionary teaching religion in Thailand.

117
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:32,483
Later, he became a forest manager for a company that held the logging concession in the North.

118
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,487
Until the period of World War I in 1914 AD.

119
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,906
Mr. Thomas traveled back to England.

120
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,450
To serve as a soldier for his homeland.

121
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,412
Mr. Thomas has three children.

122
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,206
The first is a man who was born to Phairin.

123
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,835
his first wife, who passed away when the son was still young.

124
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,546
The second child, a daughter, was born to Thapthim.

125
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,922
His second wife.

126
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,924
The eldest son is named Mas.

127
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,885
The two daughters are named Pin and Dara.

128
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,012
After the war ended.

129
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,849
His wife and children traveled to England to join him

130
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,767
And established a family there.

131
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,859
Or is it possible that

132
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,113
Was it the dream we had last night in the piano hall

133
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:26,287
Was it about Pin, Mas, and Dara?

134
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,960
But where is Thapthim?

135
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:35,963
Khen!

136
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,383
Is something wrong?

137
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:40,760
Nothing.

138
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,517
I'm just thinking about how to present the story of the exhibition room.

139
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,770
from the owner's point of view.

140
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,022
What do you guys think about it?

141
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,733
You mean like the homeowner giving a tour of the house?

142
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:57,902
Yes.

143
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,863
I think it’s quite interesting.

144
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,327
Then tonight, I'll go back and sleep in the same room as before.

145
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,411
You sure about that?

146
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,290
I think that I work better in a quiet environment.

147
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,167
And I’ll quickly go back to work as well.

148
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,420
And we'll see tomorrow whether the results are good or not.

149
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,051
Actually, you don’t have to sleep alone, you know.

150
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,845
It's okay, don’t worry about it.

151
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,182
And don’t come knocking on the door again.

152
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,475
I won’t open it for you this time.

153
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,356
Don’t work too hard, okay?

154
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,756
Congee again?

155
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,843
Should we get Auntie Jiam to change the menu tomorrow?

156
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,053
But I think congee is quite tasty.

157
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,305
Yes.

158
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,473
But I’m getting bored of it.

159
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,352
Alright, I’ll let her know when I see her.

160
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:56,645
But...

161
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,523
To be honest, I haven’t seen Auntie Jiam in a while.

162
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,901
That's true. I haven’t seen her either.

163
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,699
Bing.

164
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,411
Where did you go last night?

165
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,247
Did you go out?

166
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,000
I thought you went to sleep with Khen last night.

167
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,794
Where'd you go? No invite for me either.

168
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,886
Seriously, where did you go?

169
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,441
Looking good, looking good, looking good.

170
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,277
So sweet.

171
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,153
Lemme see it!

172
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:51,784
What?

173
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,243
Oh, Toh!!!!

174
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,330
You're not good at taking photos!

175
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,041
Seriously?

176
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,167
Honey, look!

177
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,585
Where are we going?

178
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,342
I'll take this one.

179
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,311
It's a whole century, bro!

180
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,084
Bing!

181
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,169
Bing!

182
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,088
I'll be right back.

183
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,978
It's going to rain, let's head back.

184
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,480
Let’s go.

185
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:45,606
Let’s go, Khen

186
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,357
Let’s go.

187
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,109
Hold on, let me call Bing for a moment.

188
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,235
I don't know where he went.

189
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,320
Okay.

190
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,406
Are you getting wet in the rain?

191
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,328
Did he pick up?

192
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,829
No, he isn't..

193
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,835
How about we get in the car first?

194
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,920
He’s probably around here somewhere.

195
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,505
He probably can’t hear us.

196
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,048
Let’s drive around and look for him.

197
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:11,548
Okay.

198
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,716
I'll try calling him again as well.

199
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,885
Be quick, it’s going to rain!

200
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,738
Bing.

201
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,158
Damn it, Bing.

202
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,952
Why'd you go around without telling us?

203
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,079
We’ve been searching for you around the whole city!

204
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,169
Toh, please talk to him nicely.

205
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,506
Bing, if you have any problems, you can just tell us.

206
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,759
Especially if we’re doing anything that makes you uncomfortable.

207
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,138
Or if you don’t want to keep taking pictures at the same place.

208
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,639
Just let Nam-Wha know.

209
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:06,979
Why....

210
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,523
..do we keep going to the same places,

211
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,401
Over and over again...

212
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,945
and never go anywhere else?

213
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,031
I knew it! See?

214
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,160
So you're all gonna gang up on me, right?

215
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:28,375
Or is it because we literally can't go anywhere else?

216
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,296
Why don’t we leave this place?

217
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,298
I don’t want to stay here anymore.

218
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,465
Bing!

219
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:36,967
How about this?

220
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,344
You wanna go go back to Bangkok first?

221
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,848
You've been working for several days without a break and haven't even went back home.

222
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,601
You probably haven't gotten used to it yet. I understand.

223
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,271
I want to go back.

224
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,315
But I can’t.

225
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,114
Last night...

226
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,660
when Khen saw me walking outside.

227
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:08,207
I tried to book a hotel.

228
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,084
And I called a car to pick me up in front of the house.

229
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,670
But in the end...

230
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,469
I ended up back where I started.

231
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,806
How could that even happen?

232
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,685
I can’t believe it either.

233
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,857
I kept trying to walk farther and farther away from here.

234
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,367
But in the end, I just kept circling back to where I started.

235
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,618
Are you messing with us?

236
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,081
If you don’t believe me, try it yourself.

237
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,460
For everyone's peace of mind.

238
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,546
Tomorrow, we’ll head back to Bangkok.

239
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,632
Let’s head back right now.

240
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,926
I really can’t handle it anymore.

241
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,511
Alright!

242
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,179
Then let’s split up and pack up.

243
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,931
We’re heading back to Bangkok now.

244
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,949
If we make it back to Bangkok, you're gonna in trouble.

245
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,093
Tan!

246
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,262
Why did you come back here?

247
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,097
Did you forget something?

248
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,558
I don’t know. It just brought me back here on its own.

249
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,854
That’s nonsense. Get out of the car. I’ll drive myself.

250
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,440
Trying is pointless.

251
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,946
So, what should we do next?

252
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,869
Do we have any other options?

253
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,043
Supernatural expert.

254
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,795
You got any opinions?

255
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,506
I don’t understand the spirits here either.

256
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,176
Normally, they should be trying to drive us away from their space.

257
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,887
But here, they’re not letting us leave!

258
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,893
What exactly do they want from us?

259
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,478
I don’t know either!

260
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,731
We need to know, in order to solve this problem.

261
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,317
And how are we going to find out?

262
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,362
If you don’t know, you need to ask.

263
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,237
Bing.

264
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,740
You’re the only one who can communicate with the spirits.

265
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,700
You need to be the one to ask them.

266
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,866
I should've driven around looking for another exit instead of dealing with this mess.

267
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,910
I shouldn’t have come back with you guys.

268
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,495
And you, you have any sacred objects?

269
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,122
I'm not very religious.

270
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,415
What!!!

271
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,959
How can you be a Buddhist and not wear any amulets?

272
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,795
You don’t wear any either.

273
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,298
I'm not religious at all.

274
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,686
If we can get out of this place,

275
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,315
I promise that I’ll go back and buy an amulet to worship

276
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,775
But right now.

277
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,610
Please help us get out of here.

278
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,238
Amen.

279
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,492
And now, you lead the way.

280
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,247
Go ahead. Go..

281
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,143
What the hell is this?

282
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,277
Oh damn!

283
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,059
Toh, go and open it!

284
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,147
Hey, open the door for me too!

285
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,358
You lead.

286
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,234
Khen.

287
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,443
Go.

288
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,945
Khen.

289
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,871
Did anyone see anything?

290
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,665
I didn't see anything at all.

291
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,752
Then, why'd you run away?

292
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,589
Well,the door just opened by itself, so I had to run away, didn’t I?

293
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,428
Did no one actually see anything at all?

294
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,847
I didn’t! What did you see?!

295
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,982
...a woman's hand by the door.

296
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,276
Was it a woman with long hair?

297
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,860
I don’t know!

298
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,446
She was hiding behind the door, right?

299
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,991
I didn’t see her fully.

300
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,827
The hand was....

301
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,037
clinging to the door!!!

302
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,292
Has anyone done anything disrespectful or messed with anything here?

303
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,585
It wasn’t me!

304
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,836
I’m scared to death!

305
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,504
I wouldn’t dare be disrespectful.

306
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:30,797
Toh!!!

307
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,550
Do you remember anything you said?!

308
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,469
Even though I have a foul mouth.

309
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,721
I wouldn’t dare be disrespectful.

310
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,764
But if it was me...

311
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,516
I'm really sorry.

312
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,560
I didn’t mean to cause any trouble.

313
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,312
I’m begging for forgiveness.

314
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,938
Please, forgive me.

315
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,815
If I can get out of here..

316
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,359
I will make merit on your behalf.

317
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,281
Or maybe...

318
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:02,287
it's because we’re about to tell others that this place is haunted?

319
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,789
But we are trying to fix it, right?

320
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,125
But we still haven’t finished it yet.

321
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,721
I'll go back to my room for now.

322
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,973
and get it done quickly.

323
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,685
Hopefully, it will help us get out of here.

324
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,982
No, I think it's better if we should stay together as a group.

325
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,279
It's okay.

326
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,406
I can handle it.

327
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,617
What are you doing this for?

328
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,576
Khen!!!

329
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:34,379
The homeowner said that he is married to a wife named Phairin.

330
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,883
They have one son named Mas.

331
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:45,014
Later, his wife passed away.

332
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,519
Amidst the sorrow.

333
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,981
Life.

334
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,025
Must go on.

335
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,685
Leave!

336
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,859
I told you to leave!

337
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,722
Khen, are you asleep yet?

338
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,690
Can I sleep with you?

339
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,571
Are you okay?

340
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,326
It's nothing, I just accidentally fell asleep.

341
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,537
And...had some strange dreams.

342
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:55,705
Let's go.

343
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,882
What did you dream about?

344
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:14,515
I dreamed about that foreign boy ghost I told you about before,the one on the bed

345
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,311
But now he's grown up.

346
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,814
And he's very handsome too.

347
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,072
He was playing the piano in the hall.

348
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,533
But suddenly....

349
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,162
He chased me out.

350
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,417
Khen.

351
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,711
You haven't been in a relationship for a while, right?

352
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,880
What does that mean?

353
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,051
Well you said you dreamed about him from when he was a child until he grew up.

354
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,304
And you said that he’s very handsome too.

355
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,974
You’re really a love-struck person, aren’t you?

356
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:56,766
Bing.

357
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,601
This isn’t the time for jokes.

358
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,019
I’m serious.

359
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,108
Who do you think the woman in that room is?

360
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,153
I don't know.

361
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,116
I’ve been wondering why she would want to lock us up here.

362
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,124
Or could it be that someone took something of hers?

363
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,543
And she's trying to get it back.

364
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,503
It's definitely not me.

365
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,130
Me too.

366
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,425
That's enough.

367
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,345
Thinking about it won’t change anything.

368
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,264
It’s better to get some rest.

369
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,408
You use sleeping pills?

370
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,785
Yes.

371
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,329
The doctor prescribed them.

372
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,585
I normally have trouble sleeping and get tired easily.

373
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,214
Goodnight.

374
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,556
Sweet dreams... to that foreigner?

375
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,147
If you dream about that foreigner again.

376
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,274
Don’t forget to take me with you.

377
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,446
I want to know how handsome your type is.

378
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,532
I promise I’ll stay quiet.

379
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,494
And won’t interrupt at all.

380
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,039
Bing.

381
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,375
You wanna go to sleep and never wake up again?

382
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,963
I’m feeling sleepy. I'm signing out.

383
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:08,898
Hey, guys!

384
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,650
I’ve been thinking about it all night.

385
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,486
I don’t know what’s keeping us in this loop.

386
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,030
But if we split up.

387
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,408
Maybe one of us might manage to get out.

388
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,286
Yeah, thats a good tactic.

389
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,832
I think if we split up, one of us might be able to survive.

390
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,463
Do you think it will figure us out?

391
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,339
Bing.

392
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,133
I heard you.

393
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,426
This is his house, you know.

394
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,098
He might be keeping an eye on us.

395
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,934
It seems like I'm not the biggest loudmouth in this group.

396
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:45,977
Toh!!!

397
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,603
Stop arguing already.

398
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,653
Listen to me.

399
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,988
Remember this.

400
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,157
If anyone of us can get out of here.

401
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,199
Just go.

402
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,534
Don’t hesitate.

403
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,710
In that case, I'll take the car, okay?

404
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,921
And then we’ll split up after that.

405
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,787
Why do we keep going to the same places over and over and never go anywhere else?

406
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,917
Or is it that we literally can't go anywhere else?

407
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,137
I told you to leave!

408
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:27,865
You!

409
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,626
Why are you doing this?

410
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,712
Tell me what you want.

411
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,798
Or is there anything I can help you with?

412
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,133
So you can finally move on.

413
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,871
I like it here.

414
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,708
You're the one who’s disturbing me!

415
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,379
Tell me what you want from me.

416
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,967
Don’t be emotional.

417
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,011
I’m trying to help you, you know?

418
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,556
Tell me.

419
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,308
Who you are..

420
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,412
I'm Khen.

421
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,748
Khen.

422
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,877
Do you see that?

423
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,138
The moon.

424
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,642
Yes, it's the moon.

425
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,729
My name is Mas.

426
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,232
Matthew "Mas" Coleridge.

427
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,654
Your name and mine, both mean 'moon.'

428
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,539
Do you know?

429
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,505
That our world...

430
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,008
Has only...

431
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,886
One moon.

432
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,289
I’m really curious.

433
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,751
Why is it only Khen who sees ghosts right now?

434
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:32,675
Cowards will die time and time again before their true demise.

435
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,012
The valiant will only taste death once.

436
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,390
This is..the actress's nail.

437
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,184
That I used to wear when I dressed up as a actress, isn’t it?

438
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,020
Please don’t make me wait too long.

439
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,608
I mean you, Khen.
