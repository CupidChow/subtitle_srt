1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,760
Pinocchio

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,770
At one o'clock this afternoon,

3
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:45,040
Ahn Chan-soo, one of our students
in 12th grade

4
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,410
will attempt to bring home
the long-awaited second victory

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,470
-on the quiz challenge on YGN Channel.
-Make myself comfortable first.

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,481
I hope everyone cheer him on so that
he can bring another victory this week.

7
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,240
Let me see.

8
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,380
-Is everyone here?
-Yes.

9
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,261
Who does that empty chair belong to?

10
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,291
That's Ahn Chan-soo's chair.

11
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,071
Not that one, but the one over there.

12
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,564
-That's Choi Dal-Po's chair.
-Dal-Po?

13
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:17,530
He's skipping class again?

14
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,035
Oh? It's starting.

15
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,185
Everyone quiet down.

16
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:26,694
The Quiz Show Challenge

17
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:33,199
How have you been for the past week?
My name is Im Seong-hoon.

18
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,369
Let’s start The Quiz Show Challenge

19
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,446
on this second week of October in 2005.

20
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:42,669
Today, Ahn Chan-soo
from Cheong-Po High School will attempt

21
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:44,540
to win for the second week.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,490
Let's give him a round of applause.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,853
Who would you like to see
as your opponent this week?

24
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,490
To be frank

25
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,557
I'd like to compete with someone
who could give me a real challenge.

26
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,027
Yes, I understand.

27
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:05,986
Is his new opponent someone
who can give him a real challenge?

28
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:07,776
Let's meet him on the screen.

29
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:15,766
I'm here to stop Ahn Chan-soo

30
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:17,596
from taking home his second victory.

31
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,206
What?

32
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,636
He came from the same school
as Ahn Chan-soo

33
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,270
a brilliance ranked
34th of the entire school.

34
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:28,386
Choi-Dal-Po.

35
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,966
A tight match between
the 1st and 34th ranked student

36
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:34,736
from the same school.

37
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,186
The thrilling match

38
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:38,896
starts now!

39
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:43,286
Please wait and see.

40
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,436
What is Dal-Po doing on TV
instead of sitting at his desk?

41
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:50,886
Geez.

42
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,106
He's so surprisingly tacky.

43
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,626
But he seems proud of it.

44
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,256
Let's welcome our challenger,

45
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,156
Choi Dal-Po.

46
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:10,956
That was a really
impressive introduction.

47
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:13,426
How was it?
Did you like your introduction?

48
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:14,379
Yes.

49
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,219
But there's something
I'd like to clear up.

50
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:17,499
I'm not a brilliance.

51
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:19,247
But you ranked 34th
of entire school, right?

52
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,310
That is brilliant.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,030
-But there are 34 students in my school.
-Pardon?

54
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,510
If there are only 34 students
in entire school, you're...

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,759
I have the worst grades
in my entire school.

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,090
That’s why they call me All-zero.

57
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,705
I'm a zero in every category.

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,050
So, it's All-zero.

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,900
Yes, I think I understand.

60
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,820
Worst grades in entire school?

61
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,030
How did this happen?

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,690
I thought there would have
been at least 300 people.

63
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,480
Isn't this actually more entertaining?

64
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,750
A battle between the smartest
and the dumbest student.

65
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,410
Is it just me?

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,100
Okay, Mr. Choi Dal-Po.

67
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,160
You must correctly answer five questions

68
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,130
in order to bring out the current
champion up onto the stage.

69
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,710
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

70
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,374
Here's your first question.

71
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,660
It is said that

72
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,400
about one out of 43 people
in our country has this syndrome.

73
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,170
It is referring to hiccuping when lying

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,936
due to autonomic nervous system disorder.

75
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,465
Because of the noticeable
reaction to lying

76
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,269
it is named after
a popular fairytale character.

77
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,072
What is the name of this syndrome?

78
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,429
Mr. Choi Dal-Po.

79
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,219
It's the first level question,
so just relax and answer

80
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,887
I'd like to use my chance card.

81
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,439
Do you really want to use

82
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,449
your chance card already
for the first question?

83
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,609
-Okay, I understand.
-Is he out of his mind?

84
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,767
He’s not out of his mind,
but he's just trying to be entertaining.

85
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,404
I guess it's just me too this time.

86
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,639
Okay, this is a Friend Chance.

87
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,999
Do you have anyone who came
with you to cheer you on?

88
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,385
I don't have anyone cheering me on.

89
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,750
But I do have someone who can help me.

90
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,167
-Who is it?
-It’s Ahn Chan-soo.

91
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,359
Me?

92
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,305
You and Ahn Chan-soo
are in the same class, aren't you?

93
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,824
But he's your rival today.

94
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:19,605
Do you think he'll help you get
the correct answer?

95
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:23,275
-I'll help him get it.
-Yes, I see.

96
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,425
He seems to be a very generous friend.

97
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,484
Okay, 30 seconds on the clock starts now.

98
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:30,045
Ahn Chan-soo.

99
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:32,315
If I beat you here today

100
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,219
then you should let me smack you
in the 10 ten times.

101
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,395
What?

102
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,595
Let's get together as one!!

103
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,375
But if you beat me instead,
then I'll let you smack me 10 times.

104
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,643
So, give me your word. Okay?

105
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,313
You...

106
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:56,777
Okay, dude!

107
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,846
But I am afraid everyone knows
who's going to win.

108
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm not sure.
We'll just have to wait and see.

109
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:06,253
And Choi In-ha.

110
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:10,266
You...

111
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,116
If I become the champion here...

112
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:21,856
Unfortunately...

113
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:24,188
your 30 seconds are over.

114
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:26,470
Will you be okay for wasting
your chance like this?

115
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,679
It's okay. I already know the answer.

116
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,959
So you used your chance card
when you already knew the answer?

117
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,830
-You surprised me several
-I don't find it entertaining at all.

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
There's no showmanship or style either.

119
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,585
He's just a crazy.
A big crazy little brat!

120
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:41,625
Get the correct bumper ready.

121
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:42,785
Okay then.

122
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,305
The answer is?

123
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,615
The answer is

124
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:48,705
Pinocchio.

125
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:50,815
You said it's Pinocchio.

126
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:52,555
You are correct!

127
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,325
Episode 1 - Pinocchio

128
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:14,905
Okay, we're off to a good start.

129
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:18,662
Have you ever met anyone
with Pinocchio Syndrome?

130
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,415
Yes, I have.

131
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,495
Oh, really?

132
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,269
Most people with Pinocchio Syndrome

133
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,635
avoid speaking to conceal
the revealing signs of lying

134
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:27,972
and they also develop some
sort of social phobia, as well.

135
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:28,907
Is that true?

136
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,802
The person I know is different
from most other Pinocchio's.

137
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,132
She is completely the opposite.

138
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,832
She talks quite a bit.

139
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,563
She's very blunt in everything she says,
so her nickname is Blunt Witch.

140
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,742
Wow!

141
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:43,032
Hey, Choi In-ha.

142
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:45,306
I think All-Zero is talking
about you on TV right now.

143
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,402
He's not talking about me.

144
00:07:48,662 --> 00:07:50,565
Guys, she's starting up again.

145
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:53,593
See? She hiccups whenever she lies.

146
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,885
Even you admit that
you're a Blunt Witch, right?

147
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,295
-Right?
-No, not at all.

148
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:05,207
Dal-Po, you're dead!

149
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,955
Blunt Witch?

150
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:11,845
That's an interesting nickname.

151
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,385
Okay, here's your second question.

152
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,948
You can classify year with 10 Heavenly
Stems and 12 Earthly Branches,

153
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,138
which is called sexagenary cycle.

154
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:21,310
As you know, the current year is 2005.

155
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,300
Here is the question.

156
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,594
According to the sexagenary cycle,
what year would 2005 be?

157
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:32,570
Year of Rooster.

158
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:35,998
You can calculate it that fast?

159
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:37,544
Wow.

160
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,894
Let's see since this
year is the year of dragon,

161
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:42,520
then 2005 is...

162
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:45,114
You're right! The Year of Rooster!

163
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:47,944
Ki Ha-myung, you may be a genius!

164
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,974
-Is this difficult for you, Dad?
-Yes.

165
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,644
It's very difficult for me.

166
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:54,034
Jae-myung.

167
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:55,244
Do you find this easy too?

168
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,474
Can you calculate that fast?

169
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:58,134
That's a piece of cake!

170
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,734
Wow.

171
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,034
Jae-myung and Ha-myung,

172
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,894
you guys should join
the MENSA, shouldn’t you?

173
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,242
Oh, my. There he goes again.

174
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:10,494
Stop exaggerating, and help me unpack.

175
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,644
I'll pass these rice cakes out
to the neighbors.

176
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,924
Rice cakes? Give them to us.

177
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:16,734
-We'll go pass them out.
-What?

178
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:19,264
I'll take it.

179
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,584
-We?
-We?

180
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,924
What year was 1935?

181
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:25,954
-The Year of Pig.
-That's right!

182
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:27,374
I was born in the Year of Pig.

183
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,444
Isn't this unbelievable?

184
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,607
I can do that, too.

185
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:33,084
Oh, my!

186
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,904
Don’t lie to me!

187
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:36,194
He's a Pinocchio.

188
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,121
Pinocchio that hiccups whenever they lies?

189
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:40,584
I wasn't lying.

190
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:42,446
Everyone can calculate that.

191
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:46,681
I guess you can't do
what everyone can calculate?

192
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,924
Seeing how you hiccups like that.

193
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:52,284
Jae-myung.

194
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,893
He's not going to make us
do this all day, right?

195
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:57,688
-Enjoy the rice cakes.
-We'd be so lucky to have this end today.

196
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,983
Year 35273?

197
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:03,707
-Year of Ox.
-Year 43000?

198
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:08,153
Ha-myung, if you can answer this,
I'll take you to the fireworks festival.

199
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:10,243
Fireworks festival?

200
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:12,961
Dad, what year did you say again?

201
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,101
Year 43000.

202
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,665
-Year of Rat!
-Year of Rat!

203
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,167
You all heard that, right?

204
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:23,165
-Great job!
-You'll take us, right?

205
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:25,325
-Is it true that you’ll take us, right?
-Okay.

206
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,785
-I told you I'll take you.
-Dad, you promised, okay?

207
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,765
Okay!

208
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,785
Pinky promise, seal and copy.

209
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:32,875
I stuck the copy to my forehead.

210
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,885
Satisfied?

211
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:35,405
Okay!

212
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,735
Who knows?
My sons will win the Nobel Prize.

213
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,429
I wonder who they take after.

214
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,767
They seem to take after your wife.

215
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:45,749
Really?

216
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,056
I've been told that
they seem to take after me.

217
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:49,226
Come on.

218
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,016
I saw them myself.

219
00:10:51,256 --> 00:10:52,426
They take after their mom.

220
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:53,511
100 percent after the mom.

221
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:59,886
Seong-joon, did you memorize
all our fire equipment data?

222
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:01,527
-Sorry?
-Shall we do a little test?

223
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:03,926
Why all of a sudden...

224
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:05,293
When it comes to fire,

225
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:10,381
it could happen at any time without
any signs or a warning just like now.

226
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:14,507
Let me smack you 10 times in the face
if you can't answer correctly, okay?

227
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:16,277
Chief...

228
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,407
Fire! Fire!

229
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,497
We have fire at a waste disposal facility.

230
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,567
Let's go!

231
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,697
Everyone take the safety
wear and gas mask

232
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,457
then quickly go in a team of two.

233
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:39,488
Your top priority is to search
for any remaining survivors!

234
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:06,293
Is there anyone else in the building?
Did everyone manage to get out?

235
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,223
No.

236
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:12,553
There are still two employees stuck up
in the night duty room on third floor.

237
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,220
Oh, my God. What should I do?

238
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,238
-Two people?
-Yes.

239
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,580
What if there's another explosion?

240
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,390
I think it'd be better to make sure

241
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,840
that there are no more
explosives before we go in.

242
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,603
You guys go through the back,
and we'll go through the front.

243
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,383
-Make sure to search for any survivors.
-Yes, sir!

244
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,778
Check for safety before moving in!

245
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:34,979
Yes, sir!

246
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:00,587
I'll check the explosives

247
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:03,137
you guys check the night duty room.

248
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:23,644
Get some backup!

249
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:24,664
-Yes, sir!
-Hurry.

250
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:44,834
I'm going nuts.

251
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:47,854
What should I do?

252
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:50,504
There he is!

253
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,654
Mr. Manager.

254
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,564
You two?

255
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,050
You're not in the night duty room?

256
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:08,854
Office Room, Accounting Room

257
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:17,584
The truth is

258
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:20,290
we were roasting some dried squid
in the night duty room.

259
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:22,924
We tried to put the fire out

260
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:25,140
but we can't, then we get out of there.

261
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:26,724
What?

262
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,204
So you're saying
that you two started the fire?

263
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,514
What am I going to do now?

264
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:38,438
I sent a bunch of firemen there,
thinking that you two were still in there.

265
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:45,764
This is breaking news from NTS.

266
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:49,524
A total of nine firemen lost their lives
due to explosion trying to put...

267
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:54,314
An explosion of fire has resulted
in the death of nine firemen

268
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:55,474
with one still missing.

269
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:58,284
A fire started at a waste
disposal facility

270
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:00,526
in the province of Gyunggi-do
around 1:10 AM.

271
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:04,867
A sudden explosion of fire erupted
while fire rescuers trying to put out...

272
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,732
A total of nine firemen,
including Im Moon-gwan

273
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:11,077
lost their lives while attempting
to put out fire.

274
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:14,552
-Chief Ki Ho-sang is still missing.
-Dad!

275
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:15,832
Dad!

276
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:19,462
The local police are now
questioning factory manager

277
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:23,182
-if there's a problem regarding
-I told them not to go into the building.

278
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:24,832
I told them no one in there

279
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,382
and it's dangerous.

280
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:31,433
But the Chief kept arguing
that they still needed to go in.

281
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,482
The air is currently

282
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:37,462
still full of gas from the explosion,
making us tough to breathe.

283
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:39,722
The brave group of firemen
lost their lives

284
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:42,722
last night while trying
to put out the fire.

285
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,592
It is now the morning after.

286
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,522
It is time to decide

287
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:51,242
who will take the blame
for these fallen heroes' tragic deaths.

288
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:54,338
This is Song Cha-ok from MSC News.

289
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:56,552
Okay.

290
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,962
Did you get the good shot?
With those fire truck as background?

291
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:00,832
Sure.

292
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:03,042
But why did you use that mask?
The air is quite fine.

293
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:04,892
To make it look more realistic.

294
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,402
-Hello?
-It's me.

295
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:11,762
-Yeah, what?
-I've signed the divorce paper

296
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,865
and put it in the top drawer
of your desk.

297
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:15,812
What?

298
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,002
There's someone who takes
video of the fire?

299
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,602
Describe the witness appearance.

300
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:23,432
-Grey hoodie sweatshirt and jeans...
-You really are unbelievable!

301
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:25,572
I'm telling you that it's over between us.

302
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:27,130
Looks like a part-timer
in convenience store?

303
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,882
-Let’s check nearby convenience store.
-I got it.

304
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,432
Let’s go to the convenience store.

305
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:36,033
Not to the store. Go to the hospital.

306
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:38,726
We don't go to the store?
We have to take a shot.

307
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:39,796
It's a lie.

308
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,786
It's obvious where they're going to go.

309
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:44,371
They're all going to start swarming
around the victims’ families.

310
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:46,677
I need to throw them off the trail first.

311
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,166
Wow, you really are...

312
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,046
She's totally coldblooded.-

313
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:00,266
Mr. Manager!

314
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,519
-How did it go?
-Did you tell them the truth?

315
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:09,677
Lower your voice.

316
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:13,246
Don't tell anyone that
you two are responsible for the fire.

317
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:16,860
You two escaped
right before the explosion.

318
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:19,076
-Got it?
-By the way...

319
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,466
you said the Chief went in
because you told him we were

320
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:23,096
in the night duty room, right?

321
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:26,177
-Because you said that, all the firemen...
-Be quiet!

322
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,843
I heard that the Chief of Fire
is still missing?

323
00:19:30,594 --> 00:19:34,133
-The truth will come out if he's alive.
-I'm sure he's dead.

324
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:36,285
No.

325
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:40,215
-He is dead.
-But his body hasn't been found yet.

326
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,215
It's not because he's alive.

327
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:44,065
His body was decimated.

328
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:46,195
With an explosion of that scale...

329
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,485
there's no way they'll find the body.

330
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,105
Grandma, did you see the news?

331
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:04,175
Remember that fireman
who gave us the rice cake?

332
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:06,565
He disappeared
while trying to put out a fire.

333
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:08,542
Oh, my!

334
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:21,825
Grandma.

335
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:23,765
I just saw that man.

336
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,865
Yeah, that man with sexagenary questions.

337
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:35,795
Funeral Hall

338
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:13,825
This is a lie!

339
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:16,905
My son can't be dead!

340
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:18,845
This is all just a lie!

341
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:20,845
This is a lie!

342
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:24,054
Why did the Chief
drag my husband in there?

343
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:27,596
They said that there wasn't
even anyone to rescue.

344
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:32,935
I'm speaking.

345
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,015
What?

346
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:36,715
Really? He's positive?

347
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:38,794
Yes, I understand.

348
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:42,661
Mrs. Ki, your husband is still alive!

349
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:47,255
-Pardon?
-What?

350
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:49,595
-He's still alive?
-He's alive?

351
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,479
-Take the shot.
-There's a witness just saw the Chief.

352
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:55,219
Seriously?

353
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,219
My husband

354
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:58,699
is still alive?

355
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:01,321
Yes, the eyewitness has
a Pinocchio Syndrome.

356
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,174
So this can't be a lie.

357
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,889
What a relief! Right...

358
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:15,989
What? What a relief?

359
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,149
How can you even say such a thing?

360
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,694
Your father dragged my son into death!

361
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:24,849
My goodness!

362
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:29,739
It must be so nice for you
that your husband is still alive!

363
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,259
When you find him...

364
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,129
When you find him,
bring him here immediately.

365
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,879
I have a lot that I need to ask him.

366
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:38,969
How could he have survived by himself?

367
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,539
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,129
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,269
I'm so very sorry.

370
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:50,469
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

371
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,279
I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry.

372
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,399
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

373
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:58,069
I'm very sorry. I'm sorry.

374
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:00,959
I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry.

375
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,519
The house that you see behind me...

376
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:11,689
-Here they come!
-They're coming!

377
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:22,749
-Have you heard from your father?
-Why is he stay hiding?

378
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,279
Is it because he feels guilty?

379
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,809
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

380
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,219
We really haven't heard from him.

381
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:31,449
Where could he be hiding?
Do you have any ideas?

382
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:32,959
We really haven't heard from him.

383
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,519
I heard he forced the men

384
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:36,679
to go in even though no one was in there.

385
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:38,129
Then, he ran to save his own life.

386
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,669
I'm sure they're hiding him somewhere.

387
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,679
They're probably just lying.

388
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,229
Why do you think he made
such a reckless decision?

389
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,479
-Was he up for a promotion?
-My father would never do that!

390
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:49,859
So, you mean your father
is not responsible for this?

391
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:52,379
We're not saying that,
we're just saying that it's uncertain.

392
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:54,719
You're happy that your father
is still alive, aren't you?

393
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:08,469
Firefighter Im Moon-kwang.
Born on July 1st, 1966.

394
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:11,799
Allergic to shrimp,
and his favorite dish is japchae rice.

395
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:13,469
A huge fan of the Giants.

396
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,529
What the heck is he talking about?

397
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:21,279
Firefighter Jo Seong-joon.
Born on February 16th, 1975.

398
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:24,279
A fan of Seong Yuri, FIN.K.L,
and takes care of his aging mother.

399
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:26,439
Has chronic gastritis,
so he doesn't drink.

400
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,029
Firefighter Kang Hee-jae.

401
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:31,249
Born on July 23th, 1973.

402
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:33,889
The baby's due date is December 15th.

403
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,469
Two sugars and two creams in his coffee.

404
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,556
Those are the personal profiles of his
crew that my father attached in our house.

405
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:47,769
In the bathroom

406
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,409
by the front door, and by his desk.

407
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:51,979
They're all over the house!

408
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,459
Shall I tell you some more?

409
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,449
I can tell you the profiles
of every single member to you.

410
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,479
Just like my father.

411
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:09,979
He's even bought a baby gift for
Mr. Kang Hee-jae's unborn baby already.

412
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:13,869
And you're saying that someone like that
abandoned his crew to save himself?

413
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,949
He would never ever do that!

414
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,469
-That little boy is right.
-I think he's right.

415
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,909
If he's not that kind of person,
why won't he show himself?

416
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:31,409
If he has nothing to hide,
then why is he still in hiding?

417
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:34,359
That's true. If he has nothing to hide,
why he hasn't shown himself?

418
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,011
-That's true.
-There must be a reason!

419
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,258
Why are you insulting him
with no investigation?

420
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:41,601
-Those are just false rumors!
-Can you prove that?

421
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:44,938
Why are we the ones
to have to prove that?

422
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:52,378
What are you guys doing!

423
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:56,358
Stop shooting. Stop shooting!

424
00:25:57,778 --> 00:25:59,848
What wrong have we ever done!

425
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:05,868
Hold it right there!

426
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,848
Put this together with
the factory manager interview.

427
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:12,018
When he tried to stop him,
the Chief still forced his men to go in.

428
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:13,748
Let's take out the pictures of his sons.

429
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,382
Don't you think this is too harsh?

430
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:18,162
That's why I want these aired.
Because he does look harsh.

431
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:19,502
But he's still just a kid.

432
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:22,314
That's going to reveal
that kid's personal identity.

433
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:23,474
We can just blur it out.

434
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,844
The Chief just forced his men
to go into the building.

435
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:29,656
-We can just blur him out.
-No way.

436
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:30,886
I still can't allow it.

437
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:36,038
-MSC even aired this kid attacking others.
-That's why they're called 'MSG'.

438
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:41,008
-It's aggressive and bad for your health.
-This is why we're called 'Organic News'.

439
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:42,308
Organic is good for health.

440
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:44,148
-That's a compliment.
-No, it's not.

441
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:45,088
It's an insult.

442
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:48,158
No matter how good it is for you,
no one will eat if it's no good.

443
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:51,478
Which means, if no one watches,
then it's not real news!

444
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:55,658
It is, right?

445
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,478
That’s true, though!

446
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:01,988
Then...

447
00:27:02,678 --> 00:27:04,018
should I put it in?

448
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:06,338
Take it out.

449
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,108
If I tell you to put it, just put it in!

450
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:14,222
Ki Ho-sang is a shameless criminal who
escaped after putting his men to death.

451
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:17,232
His family members are accomplices
for helping that shameless criminal.

452
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:19,522
Yes, you're right.

453
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:22,202
But...

454
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,490
what if Ki Ho-sang is really dead?

455
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:27,097
It's possible that his body hasn't
been found because of the explosion.

456
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:30,922
A witness saw him alive.

457
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:33,867
The witness is a Pinocchio.
He couldn't have been lying.

458
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:36,107
Not only that. All the other
bodies have been found

459
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,664
with only Ki Ho-sang's missing.

460
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,077
This means...

461
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:42,559
There's 99 percent
chance that he's alive.

462
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,730
That's why the police put out
an arrest warrant for Ki Ho-sang.

463
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,109
99 percent chance?

464
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,749
So you're admitting yourself that it's lacking
one percent for it to be a real fact?

465
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:53,959
Pardon me?

466
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:57,439
Don't be sure that Ki
Ho-sang is still alive.

467
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,089
And don't frame him by calling
shameless criminal either.

468
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,740
Before Ki Ho-sang found
by the police and proven guilty

469
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,202
don't presume anything
and just find real facts!

470
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:09,290
If you don't,
you'll brew trouble elsewhere.

471
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,899
Impact is what grabs the
viewers' attention, not facts.

472
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,467
Nine firemen are dead.

473
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:16,537
We need someone to blame for their deaths.

474
00:28:16,657 --> 00:28:17,667
That someone is...

475
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:20,507
Ki Ho-sang who ordered the search.

476
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:27,867
The police have an eyewitness who claims
that he saw Ki Ho-sang near his house.

477
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:30,517
Even though Mr. Ki was able
to escape from the fire

478
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:33,407
his fear for legal punishment
and hatred from victims’ families

479
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:36,237
is believed to be the reason
why he hasn't shown himself yet.

480
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:38,937
I saw him with my two very own eyes.

481
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,497
I'm positive that it was him.

482
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,297
I have Pinocchio Syndrome,
so I can't ever lie!

483
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:49,527
The police believe that Mr. Ki's family
can help convince him to turn himself in,

484
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:52,077
and are demanding that they do.

485
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:55,587
I haven't heard anything from him
since the day of the accident.

486
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:57,447
-I'm telling the truth.
-Does he own

487
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:58,762
a Grey jacket and brown pants?

488
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:00,864
Yes.

489
00:29:02,134 --> 00:29:04,194
He ever worn those clothes before, but...

490
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:07,834
But Mr. Ki's family is decisively denying
having any contact with him,

491
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:10,744
and have stated that
the accident was not Mr. Ki's fault.

492
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,164
Are you stating that your
father did nothing wrong?

493
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:16,014
Those are just false rumors!
What are you guys doing!

494
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:21,314
The police plan to arrest Ki Ho-sang
for negligent homicide upon his arrest.

495
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:22,554
But the public is wondering

496
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:28,034
if that would be enough punishment for
the crime of dragging nine firefighters

497
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:29,436
to death.

498
00:29:31,424 --> 00:29:33,460
Don't turn the TV on for a while.

499
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:36,184
Mom...

500
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:40,544
went to the market again today,
and she couldn't buy anything.

501
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:43,157
They said they won't sell her anything.

502
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:52,054
Did mom cry a lot?

503
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,034
Yeah.

504
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:56,024
She cried a lot.

505
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,524
Jae-myung.

506
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:03,414
What if...

507
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,314
by some chance...

508
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:09,314
If by the smallest chance...

509
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:12,029
What if father...

510
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:14,981
really is a bad man like
they're saying on the news?

511
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:21,364
Hey, the news also lies once in a while.

512
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:23,304
And this is one of those moments.

513
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:26,504
When dad comes back

514
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,664
we'll resolve all of
these misunderstandings,

515
00:30:28,754 --> 00:30:30,744
and everything will go
back to how it used to be.

516
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:32,307
We can go see the fireworks together, too.

517
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,594
-Really?
-Of course.

518
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:37,334
I guarantee it.

519
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:39,324
Shall we make a pinky promise?

520
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:42,654
-Pinky promise.
-Pinky promise.

521
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:44,544
-Seal it.
-Seal it.

522
00:30:45,904 --> 00:30:46,754
Copy.

523
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,104
Copy.

524
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:50,654
I stuck the copy to my forehead.

525
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:51,794
Satisfied?

526
00:30:57,084 --> 00:30:58,521
I stuck the copy to my forehead.

527
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:01,354
You're not lying, right?

528
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,747
I am not lying.

529
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:14,094
Mom, I think Jae-myung lied to me.

530
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:17,654
Jae-myung wouldn't lie.

531
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:20,074
Then why hasn't he come home in days?

532
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,764
He ran because he doesn't
have the confidence

533
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:23,917
to keep his promise.

534
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,804
He'll be back soon.

535
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,084
He's just staying with
a friend for a few days.

536
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:34,184
I hope...

537
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:36,764
dad comes home soon.

538
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,857
I want him to come home
and smack everyone

539
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:43,544
who gave you a hard time
across the face 10 times.

540
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:46,314
Mom...

541
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:48,226
are you crying again?

542
00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:51,214
No, I'm not.

543
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,001
You're not lying to me, right?

544
00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:57,774
No.

545
00:31:58,754 --> 00:32:00,294
I'm not lying.

546
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:08,854
Ha-myung.

547
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:12,874
Do you want to go see fireworks with me?

548
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:14,164
Right now?

549
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:15,824
Yeah.

550
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:17,704
Right now.

551
00:32:29,254 --> 00:32:31,574
Hey, just go home. Okay?

552
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:33,234
It's been days.

553
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:35,294
Please call Reporter Sung Cha-ok out here.

554
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:36,951
I'll leave once I get to speak to her.

555
00:32:37,804 --> 00:32:38,584
Hey, kid.

556
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,794
You think reporters are Batman?

557
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:42,574
To come running whenever I call them?

558
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:07,774
Ki Ho-sang

559
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:10,344
Fireman of the year

560
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:28,164
Why do you want to see me?

561
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:31,674
I want...

562
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:33,734
to do an interview.

563
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:28,454
Ha-myung.

564
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,814
Let's go see your dad.

565
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:06,644
Let him through.

566
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:48,874
Stop him. Stop him.

567
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:57,704
Get a shot of the shoe
with the ocean in the background.

568
00:36:08,964 --> 00:36:11,564
Five months later, March, 2001

569
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:16,314
No.

570
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:17,664
I don't want to tell you.

571
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:18,624
It's okay.

572
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:20,624
I'm not that narrow-minded.

573
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:23,984
Tell me everything.
I want you to be honest with me.

574
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:28,624
To be honest, I regret it.

575
00:36:28,714 --> 00:36:30,374
When you and mom divorced,

576
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:31,824
I should've just gone with mom.

577
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:34,364
Then I wouldn't have to go
and live on that lousy island.

578
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:36,184
But I understand.

579
00:36:36,554 --> 00:36:39,044
-It's because grandpa has dementia...
-She's just like her mom.

580
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:40,464
I'm so sick of it!

581
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:43,184
I wish I could pay lip service
to that it's okay...

582
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:45,084
but I can't.

583
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:46,163
You know how I am.

584
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:50,664
See?

585
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:52,544
I told you I didn't want to tell you.

586
00:37:02,484 --> 00:37:03,734
Don't worry, In-ha.

587
00:37:03,864 --> 00:37:06,044
You can make it.

588
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,564
You won't use dialect,
nor look unsophisticated.

589
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:11,514
You'll stay chic.

590
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,216
I can do this!

591
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,114
No.

592
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:22,194
I probably going to turn primitive.

593
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:42,334
Father.

594
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:43,874
We're here.

595
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:45,564
Father.

596
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:49,204
Father.

597
00:37:52,194 --> 00:37:54,204
Just look at you!

598
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:56,274
You've grown into such a pretty girl.

599
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,614
How have you been?

600
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:00,494
-Good.
-What are all those books for?

601
00:38:00,684 --> 00:38:02,604
Are you going back to school?

602
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:05,554
It's to make my brain doesn't get rusty.

603
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:06,934
You solve math problems, too?

604
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:08,034
Oh, my!

605
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:10,804
I even took a test.

606
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:12,929
I scored 80!

607
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:17,634
Are you sure he has dementia?
He seems perfectly fine.

608
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,094
That’s what I’m saying.

609
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:20,864
Oh, my goodness!

610
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:23,124
Look at the time already!

611
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:24,824
It's almost time for him to be back.

612
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:29,034
-Who's coming?
-You two come out and say hi too.

613
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,944
-Who?
-Who?

614
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:38,604
Who's coming?

615
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:39,884
Your brother.

616
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:41,624
My brother? What brother?

617
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:44,035
You only have one brother.

618
00:38:44,126 --> 00:38:46,316
Are you talking about Dal-Po?

619
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,155
Here he comes! He comes!

620
00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:00,525
-Father!
-Dal-Po!

621
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:03,705
My son! Come here.

622
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:05,975
Come over here. Come here.

623
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,135
-Father!
-Come here.

624
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:10,105
-Father?
-Father?

625
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,235
You two say hello.

626
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:14,315
He is your little brother,

627
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:15,395
Choi Dal-pyung.

628
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:16,635
Little brother?

629
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:20,345
And she is your niece,

630
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:21,585
Choi In-ha.

631
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:23,965
Niece?

632
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:29,015
-Welcome home.
-Why are you speaking with honorifics?

633
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:31,775
He's much younger than you.

634
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:33,315
Just say, 'Dal-pyung, you're here.'

635
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,935
That's how you should greet him.

636
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,202
Dal-pyung, you're here!

637
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:42,965
You look cute.

638
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:43,995
Let's go inside.

639
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,145
That’s right.

640
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:50,765
-It's not cold yet, is it?
-Yes, it is.

641
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,325
It was last September or October,

642
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:56,635
the day we got the storm alert.

643
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:59,485
I was trying to fix
what the waves washed up

644
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:02,125
so I went out on the boat by myself.

645
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:05,805
That's when I saw something holding
onto the buoy out in the water.

646
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:11,595
I wanted to see what it was,
so I went out there with all my might.

647
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:13,745
Oh, my goodness.

648
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:16,705
And you know what that was?

649
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:20,195
-None other than your brother!
-Seriously, Father.

650
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,025
My brother died 30 years ago.

651
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,135
Yes, I know, too!

652
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:29,722
When I first saw him, I didn't know
whether I was dreaming or awake.

653
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:33,312
So I had to pinch myself everywhere
just to make sure I wasn't seeing things!

654
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:36,201
But after thinking long
and hard about it,

655
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,441
the main character of classical
novel 'The Life of Sim-Cheong'

656
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:44,200
she was saved and brought back
to her father by the Poseidon too.

657
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:47,101
Father, there are no such things
as Poseidon!

658
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:48,241
You're not a kid.

659
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:49,781
-Please, that's enough.
-Hey!

660
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:52,615
You should've corrected grandfather
when he talked nonsense.

661
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,925
How could you have agreed
with him instead?

662
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:57,585
Father...

663
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:58,955
Dal-Po is dead.

664
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:00,635
Don't you remember?

665
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:05,245
Dal-Po went out to pick the oyster
on that boat alone.

666
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,085
That's right.

667
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:10,915
You're right.

668
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:12,785
That's what happened.

669
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:14,555
Yes, that's what happened.

670
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,115
That's what happened.

671
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:21,655
-Because he's caught in bad waters...
-Father!

672
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:23,745
Father! Father!

673
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:25,235
Stop calling him 'Father'.

674
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:27,579
Who are you? Who are you to come here?

675
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,285
What was that sound?

676
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:32,675
Father!

677
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:35,480
-Father!
-Grandfather!

678
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:37,761
Get me a pillow and a blanket.

679
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:39,505
Hurry!

680
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,465
Father doesn't have dementia.

681
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:45,248
If it's not dementia,
then what's wrong with him?

682
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:47,595
His doctor told me,

683
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:49,817
that his memories are distorted.

684
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,775
He's thinking that his son
has come back alive.

685
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:52,885
But...

686
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:57,007
Every time he tries to correct memories,
then he faints from impediment.

687
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,035
So, you've decided
to pretend to be his son?

688
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:01,845
I'm not pretending to be his son.

689
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:03,225
I have become his son.

690
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,215
You've become his son?

691
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,755
Are you telling me that he adopted you?

692
00:42:06,865 --> 00:42:08,980
Who would allow an old man living alone
to adopt a young child?

693
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,420
The head of the village
and the police chief pulled some strings.

694
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,005
Where are your parents?

695
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,030
What about your relatives?

696
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,100
I don't have any.

697
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,877
I have nowhere to go.

698
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:26,567
But you still can't be here!
You're a complete stranger to us.

699
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,037
And how do we know
who you are for us to take you in?

700
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:37,337
I need father.

701
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:40,137
And he needs a son, as well.

702
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,777
-Without me, he'll keep faint...
-So you want to keep deceiving him?

703
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:45,847
That doesn’t make any sense!

704
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:47,339
Why does it makes no sense?

705
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:48,888
It's not a bad deal for anyone!

706
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,849
Who cares about a little lie like that?

707
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:02,439
I'll pretend to be his son
only until he gets better.

708
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:03,979
Only until then...

709
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,379
Just let me stay here until then.

710
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,549
I am begging you, please.

711
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:22,129
Dal-Po.

712
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,599
-Number four, please.
-Number four?

713
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,149
-Over here?
-Yeah, right there!

714
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:28,869
-Father.
-Yeah?

715
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,159
Isn't this a great idea?

716
00:43:30,379 --> 00:43:31,289
It's really great.

717
00:43:31,379 --> 00:43:34,159
After number four, number seven.

718
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,119
-That's it.
-You think you can call that kid uncle?

719
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:41,349
No.

720
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:44,429
How can I call that tiny kid uncle?

721
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:47,680
And I have to call that tiny kid as hyung.

722
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:52,274
You can do it without hiccuping?

723
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:54,779
Yeah, I tried it earlier and it worked.

724
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:56,524
He's legally my uncle, isn't he?

725
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,119
Grandfather is going to get better soon.

726
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:01,559
-Let's just endure it until then, okay?
-Okay.

727
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:04,029
I'm sure he took shortcuts
with all the adoption papers.

728
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,399
We can give up his adoption
when grandfather gets better

729
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:08,119
and send him to the orphanage.

730
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,569
-That doesn't work.
-Huh?

731
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:15,579
There's no reception here,
so there's no TV.

732
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,666
So don't even think about
watching your mom on TV.

733
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:22,607
Answer me right now.

734
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:24,849
Okay, fine.

735
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,259
What about dinner?

736
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,349
I'm not hungry!

737
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,349
Ha-myung.

738
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:07,359
Let's go see dad.

739
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,289
Really?

740
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:10,879
Dad's still alive?

741
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:12,379
You know where he is?

742
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:19,469
Yeah.

743
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:20,899
I know.

744
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:24,395
You're not lying, right?

745
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:29,959
It's the truth.

746
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:00,879
Liar.

747
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:07,625
But I'm no different.

748
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,319
Hey, kid!

749
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:18,999
First, I'll call you as uncle
when we're around my grandfather.

750
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:24,139
But when my grandfather isn't around,
you're just a 'Hey, you' to me.

751
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:25,089
Got it?

752
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,062
And I think of you as a sucker shark.

753
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,677
You know what that is, right?

754
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:32,972
I don't know.

755
00:46:33,672 --> 00:46:34,952
You know,

756
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,742
those sharks sucker that stick right
onto a whale's back...

757
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:41,065
Are you hungry?

758
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:42,862
No.

759
00:46:45,922 --> 00:46:49,952
It sticks onto a host and shamelessly
leeches food and everything else off.

760
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:51,582
You still don't know?

761
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:53,611
You are hungry.

762
00:46:54,852 --> 00:46:56,352
I said, I'm not hungry!

763
00:46:59,072 --> 00:47:00,867
You're making all sorts
of noises from your body.

764
00:47:04,062 --> 00:47:05,672
That little brat.

765
00:47:20,332 --> 00:47:21,882
Ouch, it's hot!

766
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:24,673
Fine, I won't eat!

767
00:47:29,832 --> 00:47:31,862
Ouch, so hot!

768
00:47:32,342 --> 00:47:33,752
I'm really not eating!

769
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:34,972
I'm not hungry!

770
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:39,766
I'm having low blood sugar
because I'm hungry.

771
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:54,746
That's pretty good.

772
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,512
I don't know what a shark sucker is,

773
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:01,082
but I think I know what you mean.

774
00:48:01,482 --> 00:48:02,917
It's referring to kids like you, right?

775
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,092
What?

776
00:48:07,502 --> 00:48:08,962
-I admit it.
-What?

777
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:11,272
I'm a Pinocchio, so I can't lie.

778
00:48:11,362 --> 00:48:12,962
I hiccup whenever I lie.

779
00:48:13,052 --> 00:48:15,677
Even though what you just said
upsets me...

780
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:17,742
I admit that.

781
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:21,572
My current situation was
just like a shark sucker.

782
00:48:21,662 --> 00:48:22,932
This what a shark sucker is.

783
00:48:23,022 --> 00:48:25,282
So I'm saying that you're just
as shameless as I am now.

784
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:26,442
Satisfied?

785
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:35,972
Why are you staring at me like that?

786
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:37,652
Because I'm pretty?

787
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:39,642
That's right.

788
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:40,866
I'm staring because you're pretty.

789
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:45,762
I often hear people tell me how pretty
I am because I take after my mom.

790
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:47,414
My mom is really pretty.

791
00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:49,612
I'm not being cocky about it.

792
00:48:49,702 --> 00:48:51,872
It's just all about genetics,
so I can't help it.

793
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:55,272
You don't believe me?
Should I show you my mom?

794
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:56,952
Do you have a picture of her?

795
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:00,382
No.

796
00:49:00,472 --> 00:49:02,512
It's because my dad threw
away all her pictures.

797
00:49:02,602 --> 00:49:04,812
I can see her if I could just fix the TV.

798
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,152
The TV?

799
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:09,302
Yeah. My mom's often on TV.

800
00:49:09,392 --> 00:49:12,824
So I just need to turn it on
whenever I miss her.

801
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:17,324
But I can't do that right now.

802
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,442
Do you miss her?

803
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:23,992
Yeah. A lot.

804
00:50:02,092 --> 00:50:03,102
Mom.

805
00:50:03,262 --> 00:50:04,782
Has it been half a year already?

806
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:07,882
I secretly take dad's phone
to send you this text.

807
00:50:08,062 --> 00:50:09,082
Are you doing well?

808
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:13,212
We decided to live in Hyangri Island
because grandfather is ill.

809
00:50:13,352 --> 00:50:16,985
I used to think there's nothing here
and there's nothing but lousy countryside.

810
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:19,772
But there is one thing
that I'm growing to like.

811
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:21,681
I have an uncle now.

812
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:24,242
He's my uncle, but he's shorter than me.

813
00:50:24,502 --> 00:50:25,522
Isn't that funny?

814
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:28,062
I didn't really like him at first.

815
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:30,381
But the more I get to know him,
I think he's not bad.

816
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:32,266
So I'm trying to open my heart.

817
00:50:32,356 --> 00:50:33,276
Choi In-ha!

818
00:50:33,766 --> 00:50:35,207
Hey, niece!

819
00:50:35,776 --> 00:50:37,116
Yeah? What is it?

820
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:38,732
I fixed the TV!

821
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:40,626
Really?

822
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:43,086
-How did you fix it?
-I don't know.

823
00:50:43,286 --> 00:50:44,686
I just hit it and it worked.

824
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:45,856
Really? Really?

825
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,760
-Let's go right now!
-Get on.

826
00:50:50,486 --> 00:50:52,686
It's an uphill.
That might be kind of hard.

827
00:50:56,396 --> 00:50:57,886
It's not hard, so just get on.

828
00:51:11,746 --> 00:51:12,746
See?

829
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:13,956
I told you it won't work.

830
00:51:14,046 --> 00:51:16,486
-I'm just going to walk.
-I can do...

831
00:51:17,386 --> 00:51:18,276
It!

832
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,386
I said, I can do...

833
00:51:25,006 --> 00:51:26,996
The ocean breeze is

834
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:28,926
so nice.

835
00:51:30,516 --> 00:51:31,886
So, how about we both walk?

836
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:45,916
Are you that happy?

837
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:47,026
Yeah.

838
00:51:47,116 --> 00:51:48,816
Kid, who do you resemble?

839
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:50,626
Dad? Mom?

840
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:51,686
Really?

841
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:54,936
Really? I wish I could see him.

842
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:57,812
What kind of a person do you think he is?

843
00:51:58,676 --> 00:52:00,756
He wouldn't have been extremely handsome.

844
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:02,186
I can tell that by your face.

845
00:52:02,326 --> 00:52:03,166
What?

846
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:05,506
He liked helping other people, right?

847
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:06,446
And then...

848
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:08,497
he liked to be recognized for it, too.

849
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:11,451
I'm sure that he was a kind-hearted man.

850
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:19,552
You're not hiccuping.

851
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:22,617
Did you think that I was lying?

852
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:24,766
Yeah.

853
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:26,252
It wasn't a lie.

854
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:28,373
I really do think that
he must be a good man

855
00:52:28,463 --> 00:52:30,025
and I wish I could meet him.

856
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:32,882
Why are you staring at me like that?

857
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:44,213
-What is wrong with you?
-For the past six months...

858
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:46,353
I live by telling lies everyday.

859
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:50,615
Because it was better to lie for
both mine and grandfather's sake.

860
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:52,723
But...

861
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:54,673
But?

862
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:57,488
Truth is 10 times more comforting
than a lie.

863
00:52:58,373 --> 00:53:00,083
That's what you just did for me.

864
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:01,733
Really?

865
00:53:02,253 --> 00:53:03,523
That's great to hear.

866
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,273
Currently, just at 12 o'clock...

867
00:53:11,363 --> 00:53:13,193
Oh, it's working! It's working!

868
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:15,803
Thank you so much!

869
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,343
No need to thank me.

870
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,962
You have to keep this a secret
from my dad, okay?

871
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:23,562
If he found out,
he'd shatter this TV to pieces.

872
00:53:24,382 --> 00:53:25,805
Does he hate your mom that much?

873
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:27,645
Yeah, a lot.

874
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:29,750
He's normally really gentle

875
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,870
but he turns fierce
every time I mention my mom.

876
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,170
-He doesn't even let me call her.
-It's breaking news...

877
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,640
It's my mom! There's my mom!

878
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:41,450
A reward is given out to those
who call in reports of where he is.

879
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:47,310
Why do you think he made such a decision?
Was he up for a promotion?

880
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,690
If that would be enough punishment for
the crime of dragging nine firefighters

881
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,420
to death.

882
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,760
She looks so pretty!

883
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,398
That's my mom.

884
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,320
Even though it's to ensure better safety

885
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,020
it is viewed as just a money-making scheme

886
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,170
and is receiving wild criticism
from the open general public.

887
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,430
It's been so long!

888
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,774
There are many times when we realized
just how small this world truly is.

889
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,130
I'm sure there’s been a time
when you meet

890
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,490
a perfect stranger and come to realize
their fate is tangled with yours.

891
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,040
Hey, kid.

892
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,430
Dal-Po hyung.

893
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,535
Have you seen In-ha?

894
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,700
-She's watching the news in the room.
-What?

895
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,240
-The news?
-And...

896
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,830
she also snuck your cellphone
to get in touch with her mom.

897
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,980
That little brat!

898
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,330
-You brat! Why don't you ever listen?
-Look at his temper.

899
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,820
-Why is he getting mad?
-Dad!

900
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:01,580
-Let this go!
-Dad, please don't do this!

901
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,870
What is he doing in there?

902
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,200
-Dal-pyung!
-Grandfather.

903
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,640
-Please stop dad.
-Please destroy them all.

904
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,040
Dal-Po! I mean, Uncle!

905
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,290
Uncle, please stop my dad.

906
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,940
Please!

907
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,970
Why would I?

908
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,330
Uncle...

909
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,070
Whether the fate be good or evil

910
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,310
it's strange how it intertwines.

911
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,570
We usually call this a fate

912
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,600
but there's a mathematical
explanation for it.

913
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,640
It's a rule that states

914
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,790
everyone is related to each other
in six steps.

915
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,850
According to this rule,

916
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,670
you and I are somehow related
to each other within six connections.

917
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,740
Isn't it mesmerizing?

918
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,540
This phenomenon was named
after a famous American actor

919
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,210
and is given a specific name.

920
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,934
Just what is the name of this actor?

921
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:11,400
Since it's the last preliminary question,
it might be a bit difficult.

922
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,920
If you answer this correctly,

923
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,683
you can call champion,
Ahn Chan-soo, up onto this stage.

924
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,387
You have five seconds.

925
00:56:19,453 --> 00:56:21,463
Oh, my! I don't think he knows!

926
00:56:21,853 --> 00:56:24,514
That's the limit of All-Zero's knowledge!

927
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:33,468
The correct answer is, Kevin Bacon.

928
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:36,190
Kevin Bacon.

929
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:39,603
That's correct!

930
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:43,973
Okay.

931
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:45,873
That's right. That's the answer.

932
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:53,683
Geez, he really gave the right answer.

933
00:56:53,773 --> 00:56:54,613
What the heck?

934
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:57,183
-Hey, has he always been that smart?
-Wow.

935
00:56:57,273 --> 00:56:58,513
He's looks a totally different.

936
00:56:58,603 --> 00:57:01,773
What if he actually beats Chan-soo
and wins this thing?

937
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:02,875
What?

938
00:57:03,543 --> 00:57:05,466
Everyone stop being so ridiculous.

939
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:06,596
Can't you see that?

940
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:08,886
He's just been riding on pure luck!

941
00:57:09,086 --> 00:57:10,511
Your eyes must be rotting out.

942
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,671
-You think that's just luck?
-Yeah.

943
00:57:12,771 --> 00:57:14,201
It looks like luck to me.

944
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:17,115
Why are you smiling? Why?

945
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:19,472
You like Chan-soo, don't you?

946
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:22,774
No, I don't.

947
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:26,711
It's a little suspicious to me
how you're sticking up for Chan-soo.

948
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:28,974
You like Chan-soo, don't you? Don't you?

949
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:30,651
Seriously...

950
00:57:30,741 --> 00:57:31,681
Then what about you?

951
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:34,181
Why do you keep siding with All-Zero?

952
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,641
Isn't it because you like All-Zero?

953
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:38,641
Who me?

954
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:40,701
That tacky little kid?

955
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:43,641
Stop avoiding the question
and just answer me.

956
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:46,204
You like All-Zero, don't you?

957
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:47,631
He's my uncle.

958
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:50,411
But you two don't share any blood.

959
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:53,321
Forget that he's your uncle,
but what do you think of him as a man?

960
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:55,191
You like him, don't you?

961
00:57:58,301 --> 00:57:59,151
Not at all.

962
00:58:01,951 --> 00:58:02,971
She's not hiccuping.

963
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,721
That’s true, then!

964
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:07,101
She must not like him.

965
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,101
But...

966
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,711
Dal-po's going to win that thing.

967
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:14,851
Hello.

968
00:58:14,941 --> 00:58:16,601
-Hey, Jae-myung.
-Yes.

969
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:18,391
Are two jugs enough?

970
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:40,861
Then, we will now start

971
00:58:41,191 --> 00:58:47,141
Round Two between the top
student and the worst student.

972
00:59:03,891 --> 00:59:05,511
Dal-po's going to win this.

973
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:07,091
I'm sure of it.

974
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:09,001
He's going to win.

975
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:21,391
Dal-Po won.

976
00:59:21,481 --> 00:59:23,441
Wasn't that so incredible?

977
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:24,811
Don't get the wrong idea.

978
00:59:24,901 --> 00:59:26,731
I didn't take your side
because I like you.

979
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,611
Where does your disgrace end?

980
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:29,581
Grandfather!

981
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:31,521
Grandpa, Grandpa!

982
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:32,651
I have no money.

983
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:34,651
Stop being like that,
and buy me a bicycle.

984
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:35,581
Dal-Po!

985
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:36,511
Hey!

986
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:37,981
Do you hate me that much?

987
00:59:38,071 --> 00:59:40,081
My determination was so firm and clear

988
00:59:40,171 --> 00:59:41,881
that I believed
I could never be persuaded.

989
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:45,608
The reason for my being here
after changing my mind

990
00:59:45,975 --> 00:59:47,348
is a secret.
