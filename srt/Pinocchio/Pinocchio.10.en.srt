1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,980
Pinocchio

2
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,260
In-ha...

3
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,310
Are you perhaps...

4
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,050
Ki Ha-myung?

5
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,470
Are you?

6
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,330
Is your real name...

7
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,590
Ki Ha-myung?

8
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,860
How did you...?

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
How did you find...?

10
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,530
What do I do...?

11
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,110
What do I do...?

12
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,260
I'm sorry, Dal-Po.

14
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,700
I'm really sorry.

15
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,510
What do I do?

16
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,210
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm really sorry. What do I...?

18
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,900
I'm really sorry.

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,250
That is how In-ha started
to shed her tears...

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,540
and it didn't stop for over an hour.

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,150
Throughout that long time

22
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,590
all In-ha said that she was sorry.

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,790
I'm really sorry. What do I...?

25
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,390
And I kept saying...

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,570
It's okay.

27
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,190
I'm really fine.

28
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,130
Dal-Po.

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,510
...that it's fine to the words.

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,630
It's okay. I'm fine.

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
And then...

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,490
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Dal-Po.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,870
Please tell me...

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,500
Tell me all your story.

36
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,190
It's a really long story...

37
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,370
Tell me.

38
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,170
I'll listen to it all.

39
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,230
In-ha sometime cried,

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,930
sometime became outraged

41
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,490
listening to my story.

42
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,550
Episode 10 -The Boy Who Cried Wolf

43
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,850
You must have...

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,810
hated me a lot all this time.

45
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,220
Right?

46
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,310
Yeah.

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Sometimes.

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,920
You can hate me.

49
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,000
If I were you...

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,460
I must hate the very sight of me,
myself now.

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
That's right.

52
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,000
I hate the very sight of you.

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Yeah.

54
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,590
Absolutely.

55
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,390
I deserve it.

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,180
I'll leave if you hate
the very sight of me.

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,520
If you tell me to quit being
a reporter, I'll quit.

58
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,060
Stop crying.

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,034
Do you know that I hate you
the most when you cry?

60
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
What?

61
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,570
It's been two hours. Two hours...

62
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm going to freeze
to death comforting you.

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,620
Now stop whining and
let's go inside. Okay?

64
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,910
And...

65
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,180
when I was Ki Ha-myung...

66
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,640
I hated you and your mom.

67
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,284
I was going to leave as soon as
my father was well-balanced.

68
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,990
But not now.

69
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,900
I'm Choi Dal-Po now.

70
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,245
And I don't intend
to throw that name away.

71
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Yeah.

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
But why are you...

73
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,000
Never mind. Let's go inside.

74
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,610
Why did you stop asking?

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,980
No. I have nothing to ask.

76
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,490
What is it? Now I'm curious.

77
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,470
Why aren't you revealing yourself
to your older brother?

78
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,990
Why do you keep saying
that your brother is dangerous?

79
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,530
I'm curious.

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
That's...

81
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,500
Can you keep it a secret?

82
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,350
Secret?

83
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,970
No.

84
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,330
Don't tell me if it's a secret.
You know...

85
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,830
I can't keep a secret
since I'm a Pinocchio.

86
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,490
So, don't tell me any.

87
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,990
No. No...

89
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm the one who is sorry.

90
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,750
I'll just go back to the TV station.

91
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,093
If I go home like this,

92
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:47,616
my dad and grandfather
will ask what's going on.

93
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,346
Since I can't lie,

94
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,006
I'll have to tell everything.

95
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:53,106
About you...

96
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,896
and about my mom...

97
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,996
Come out. Let's eat before we go.

98
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:03,106
No, I can't.

99
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:06,236
I don't want dad and grandfather
to know about this.

100
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:12,636
Come in after 5 minutes.

101
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:15,576
I'll talk to them so that you don't have
to answer anything.

102
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,146
Okay?

103
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:18,906
Dal-Po.

104
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:26,716
Are you home, In-ha?

105
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:29,126
Come in. Come in and sit down.

106
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:35,586
-It's cold, right?
-Yes.

107
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,886
Eat. I won't ask anything.

108
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,466
Huh?

109
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:42,716
Okay...

110
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,486
-Bon appetit.
-Yeah.

111
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,746
By the way, father... Did you buy a TV?

112
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,386
Yes. Of course I bought it.

113
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:58,916
After you guys finish
your training period,

114
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:01,046
you'll be on the news, won't you?

115
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:04,306
I should buy a TV if I want to see that.

116
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,166
Dal-Po.

117
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,976
Do you know what kind of TV that is?

118
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,546
Let me see. It's a...

119
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:17,716
TV that features full HD...

120
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:22,006
and enhanced details with 50 inch screen.

121
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,736
With the MHL function,

122
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:29,376
you can enjoy variety of content.

123
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,756
Isn't that great?

124
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,746
You really bought something amazing.

125
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:36,446
But where did you get
the money to buy that big...

126
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:42,476
No way.

127
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,916
My first...

128
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,156
Oh no! My sixth...

129
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:53,776
My sixth!

130
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,206
Hey...

131
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,486
Didn't we earn money to spend it?

132
00:08:58,576 --> 00:08:59,936
Of course. Of course...

133
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,756
What did you tell my dad and grandfather?

134
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,816
What did you tell
that they didn't ask a word?

135
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,796
Why do you want to know? Just go.

136
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,836
I need know it though.
They might bring it up later.

137
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:15,426
I didn't tell them much.

138
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,386
I said that you're very sensitive lately
since you're on your period.

139
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,376
They would be in trouble
if they you to talk.

140
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:22,846
Hey!

141
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:24,956
What's wrong? You ate well.

142
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,656
You didn't lie.

143
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:28,446
It went smoothly
on father and grandfather.

144
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:30,256
Is there a better way than this?

145
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:32,686
Not any.

146
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,126
Follow me, then.

147
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:35,746
Okay.

148
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:51,136
Why is that brat put that hand
in his pocket?

149
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:04,466
Choi Dal-Po.

150
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,076
Did you return the necktie pin recorder?

151
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:09,246
Not yet.

152
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:12,556
Give it to me. I'll return it.

153
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,886
I'll return it myself.

154
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,466
What are you doing?

155
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:21,556
I said...

156
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:23,616
I'll return it myself.

157
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,796
Captain!

158
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,876
MSC News Times Reaches Number
One Rating in Its Time Slot

159
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,956
Don't you think your mother
is really amazing?

160
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,446
That Ki Jae-myung case...

161
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,166
I thought it wasn't something newsworthy,

162
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,886
but seeing how she develop the story
and overturn the ratings,

163
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:45,266
she really is an amazing competitor.

164
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,766
-Isn't she?
-I'm not sure.

165
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,016
You're not getting on?

166
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,636
Yes, I'm not getting on.

167
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:03,136
Hey, why aren't you getting on?

168
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:04,756
Because I don't want to.

169
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,516
What are you guys doing?
Getting off or on?

170
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,076
Please go ahead first.

171
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:36,966
Hey! Choi In-ha!

172
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:40,426
Ju-ho...

173
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:43,586
What were you talking with Choi In-ha
at the editing room earlier?

174
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:46,646
That's...

175
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:50,646
Since you didn't listen to me
no matter how I stopped you,

176
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,116
I thought you might listen
to your daughter,

177
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,126
so I told her that story.

178
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,506
That story?

179
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:57,696
Yes.

180
00:11:57,786 --> 00:11:58,906
I told her everything.

181
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:01,136
Ki Jae-myung incident 13 years ago,

182
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,106
how dangerous Ki Jae-myung could be now,

183
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:06,036
and why you must apologize
to Ki Jae-myung.

184
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,386
I told her everything.

185
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:11,436
-What?
-I did it because I was worried about you.

186
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,776
I have a bad feeling about Ki Jae-myung.

187
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,240
You should meet him
and apologize properly to reconcile or...

188
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:18,331
Shut up.

189
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,450
Don't overreact and stay out of it.

190
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:30,766
If I have to choose between the two,
it must be revenge.

191
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:37,026
This may not enough to prove Ki Jae-myung
is the suspect of Moon Duk-soo's murder,

192
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,866
but it could be a strong suspicion.

193
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:41,366
If the police hear this,
they'll start the investigation as well.

194
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,036
Captain.

195
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:44,976
-That's...
-I guess you've made your choice.

196
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:46,806
To cover this up.

197
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:52,026
Am I not allowed to?

198
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,626
You told me to choose
when I found out the truth.

199
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:57,466
This is my choice. I'll just cover it up.

200
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,996
-Choi Dal-Po...
-The world likes my brother now.

201
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,336
People enjoyed and touched
by my brother's story.

202
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:04,636
Can't we just leave it?

203
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:06,196
There's nothing bad about it.

204
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,386
Then what about this?

205
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,556
It's just a suspicion.

206
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,696
It could just disappear if we leave it.

207
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:25,576
Captain.

208
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,376
I'm not giving this because you're right.

209
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,466
I'm waiting.

210
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:31,166
Truth does not disappear just
because you cover it up.

211
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:34,396
It will come out in some sort of
shape to the world, no matter what.

212
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:36,186
Whether it's beautiful or hideous

213
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,376
you have to keep your eyes open
and watch it.

214
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:40,386
That's what a reporter is.

215
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:52,296
I have a friend working at a TV station.

216
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:54,647
When I told him about you,
he told me to bring you over.

217
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:58,226
I don't want to.

218
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,656
I don't want to do it.

219
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:02,696
Dal-Po.

220
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,436
Your real family...

221
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,386
You still can't tell me about them?

222
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:12,206
The reason I'm uneasy about you

223
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,066
is not because you're not educated

224
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:15,646
or because you don't have money.

225
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:19,186
It's just because I don't know
what kind of people you...

226
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:20,996
and your family are.

227
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:22,506
If I know that...

228
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:24,056
I'm sorry, Sir.

229
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,316
You don't want to talk about it?

230
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:29,216
Yes.

231
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,366
Okay.

232
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:31,776
I won't ask you any further.

233
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:37,746
What is it?

234
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,986
You seem to have worries.

235
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:40,676
Father.

236
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,366
What do I have to do if a family member
is keeping a secret

237
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,006
and not speaking about it?

238
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:49,886
Do I have to stop to look
into it and close my eyes?

239
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:51,436
How did you...?

240
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:53,836
I took a little from your emergency fund.

241
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:55,626
You're a ghost.

242
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:57,646
You're a ghost.

243
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,806
Father!

244
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,526
Moon Duk-soo's Call...

245
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:08,516
Come here.

246
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,136
What are you trying to do
that you're starting this big?

247
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,396
I was able to solve an amazing puzzle.

248
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,376
Please take a look at this, Sir.

249
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,586
Ki Jae-myung...

250
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:24,446
lost his father 13 years ago
in a factory fire accident.

251
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:26,486
But Moon Duk-soo...

252
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,796
is the person who framed his father.

253
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:31,286
But 13 years later,

254
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,356
Moon Duk-soo became a murderer
and hid his whereabouts.

255
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,686
Ki Jae-myung
is on Moon Duk-soo's call log.

256
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:39,436
Don't you think it's suspicious?

257
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,376
What are you trying to say?

258
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,866
Are you saying that Ki Jae-myung
kidnapped Moon Duk-soo?

259
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,386
He could've done more than that.

260
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:47,126
What's more than that?

261
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,206
Does it mean
that Ki Jae-myung killed him?

262
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,756
Team Leader,
I will investigate Ki Jae-myung.

263
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:55,846
Brat!

264
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,876
Ki Jae-myung is a national hero.

265
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:00,686
Our Chief gave him an award
for bravery recently.

266
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:03,396
I heard he's even going to ring
the Watch-Night bell this year.

267
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:07,066
We'll get a backlash for sure
if you mess up with that kind of person.

268
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:08,156
Team Leader.

269
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:10,446
It's just a waste of time
with just that evidence.

270
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,296
Investigate properly
when you have corroborating evidence.

271
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,846
It's a scarier story than I thought.

272
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:23,356
-Isn't it?
-I'm not sure.

273
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,486
Do you also think Ahn Chan-soo
is wasting time?

274
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:28,846
Yeah.

275
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:30,986
Choi Dal-Po.

276
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:34,246
I know Captain gave you
Ki Jae-myung's phone number.

277
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,696
How did you related with him?

278
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:37,386
I'm not related with him.

279
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:40,566
So, you don't want to tell me...

280
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,386
Okay.

281
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,856
If you tell me, I'll go out
to eat with you once.

282
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:48,076
Okay, then?

283
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:50,056
No.

284
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,146
-And I...
-Fine.

285
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:55,206
Should I take a selfie with you?
Okay, then?

286
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:00,746
I said no.

287
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,616
Is he trying to play hard to get now?

288
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,396
Are you saying that Ki Jae-myung
kidnapped Moon Duk-soo?

289
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,826
-He could've done more than that.
-How did you related with him?

290
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,286
I guess you've made your choice.

291
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:24,976
To cover this up.

292
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:29,656
Yes, Sir.

293
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:32,226
It's a scoop?

294
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,386
You're saying
that you're an invisible man?

295
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:42,276
Yes. If you can take a picture
and send it to us.

296
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,596
Ah, your pictures cannot be taken?

297
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,586
No. I'm not doubting you.

298
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:49,766
Yes, Sir. Okay.

299
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:56,316
For me, I think doing mawari is better.

300
00:17:56,406 --> 00:18:00,066
I don't think I fit working in a desk,
answering these ridiculous phone calls.

301
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,416
Is there anything newsworthy
from those call?

302
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:05,056
They're either prank calls

303
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:07,366
or calls demanding for apology
because they don't like the report.

304
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:08,916
There isn't much then.

305
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,330
Do you always ignore
when people ask you to apologize?

306
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,386
You ignored Ki Jae-myung's complaint
13 years ago just like this, right?

307
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:24,656
In-ha.

308
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,086
I did apologize.

309
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,126
As a media that shares responsibility,
MSC would like to extend...

310
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:32,266
our most sincere apology
to Mr Ki Jae-myung.

311
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:34,516
Don't you remember?

312
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,036
Of course I remember.

313
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,896
How you were apologizing
so insincerely...

314
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:42,866
Honestly, I was so shocked.

315
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,376
It's reasonable
that Ki Jae-myung resents you.

316
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:57,206
What...

317
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,586
did I do so wrong?

318
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:01,736
Do you really not know...

319
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:05,136
Do you think that I reported Ki Ho-Sang's
case with personal resentment?

320
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:09,226
-That's not it, but...
-I didn't question because I was curious.

321
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,106
It's because the whole nation
were curious.

322
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,556
That's why I questioned,
in behalf of them.

323
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:20,236
What do I have to apologize for that?

324
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:42,166
Hey, why are you doing
this all of a sudden?

325
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:43,706
I just can't win.

326
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:46,166
I just can't win in words.

327
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,386
I think this is everything.

328
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,026
Thank you, mother.

329
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:04,716
Does this help in having
those two to reconcile?

330
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,666
I think there's still a long way to go.

331
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,906
Why are you so concerned
about Choi In-ha and her mom?

332
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,706
I stole those texts for the past 13 years.

333
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,716
If those texts delivered properly,

334
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,726
they probably won't be like this now.

335
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:21,746
I feel like...

336
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,066
I owe In-ha a very bad debt.

337
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:26,156
That's why...

338
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:29,596
you look for In-ha to pay back that debt?

339
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:31,656
Yes.

340
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:32,876
That's fine then.

341
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:34,616
I thought...

342
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,776
you had some kind of feeling
towards In-ha.

343
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:38,896
You said In-ha likes someone else, right?

344
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:41,966
I was worried that you've been
going through some heartache.

345
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:45,416
What if I'm going through some heartache?

346
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:46,656
What?

347
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:49,876
At first, it was just curiosity.

348
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,276
So I was fine when she said
she liked someone else.

349
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,886
After I paid the debt back, I thought
I'd have a chance if I went after her.

350
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:01,336
But I can't.

351
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:04,596
Why you can't? What do you lack of?

352
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,226
Rather than me lacking,

353
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:07,686
my opponent is strong.

354
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:09,016
What do you mean he's strong?

355
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:10,756
That guy named Choi Dal-Po, right?

356
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,596
His name is countrified and he looks
like a half cooked anchovy.

357
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:16,656
You said he's an orphan? He has no
money and only a high school graduate.

358
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,456
He can make In-ha cry or laugh.

359
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:20,826
That's strong.

360
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:22,576
My son...

361
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:23,946
That's why...

362
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:27,256
I've been going through
some heartache these days.

363
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:34,336
Central Licensed Real Estate Agent

364
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:43,816
It's the badger from before.

365
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:45,656
What is she doing here?

366
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,266
The badger is smiling at me.

367
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:54,896
Oh, my.

368
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:56,766
The badger is coming towards me.

369
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:58,046
Hello.

370
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,886
You're Choi In-ha's father, right?

371
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:01,356
Pardon me?

372
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:02,496
Yes.

373
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:12,386
What brings you here?

374
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,536
I came here as a meddlesome parent
of a son.

375
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:20,306
You do know that my son and your daughter
are working at the same TV station, right?

376
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,886
Yes. I saw him a moment
at the police station that time.

377
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:26,996
-But brings you...
-I'll get right to the point.

378
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:29,786
My son likes your daughter.

379
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:30,966
What?

380
00:22:31,926 --> 00:22:33,956
-Our In-ha?
-Yes.

381
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:35,746
Yes. You didn't know?

382
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:38,416
Yes, I didn't know.

383
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,136
You don't know?

384
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:43,096
You didn't even know
when the situation is this bad?

385
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:45,776
It's hot. Hot.

386
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:50,956
Your daughter seduces a man

387
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,658
and her father is pretending not to know.
Is that your modus operandi?

388
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:56,516
It looks like you order your daughter

389
00:22:56,606 --> 00:23:00,086
to be a con artist to make
this small real estate office successful.

390
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:01,526
But it won't work.

391
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,386
My son might be naive,

392
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,726
but I've run business for 30 years.
What do you think you're doing?

393
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:08,546
Madam. I mean, Ms Chairwoman...

394
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:11,726
-I'm sorry but that's...
-If you're sorry, stop immediately!

395
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,916
Take this and get away.

396
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,086
Don't ever come around my son again.

397
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,166
Sir...

398
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:21,426
Yes?

399
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:22,516
What did you say?

400
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,746
I asked you if you didn't know.

401
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:30,866
Yes, I didn't know.

402
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:33,426
But I will control In-ha better.

403
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,866
I'll make sure that she doesn't
come around your son...

404
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,186
You can't do that.

405
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:41,866
-Excuse me?
-I came here to ask you...

406
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,956
to be good to my son.

407
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:45,966
What did you say?

408
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:48,026
Please help my son.

409
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:50,286
Please support my son.

410
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:51,646
Please?

411
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,166
What in the world...

412
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,886
Son of the Department Store
Chairwoman as my son-in-law...

413
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,576
Is my fate finally going to get better
in my later years?

414
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:11,636
Really.

415
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:21,246
In-ha Just a Daughter

416
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:26,796
Yeah, Dad. What is it?

417
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,796
You don't like Dal-Po, do you?

418
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:38,986
You're right.

419
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,096
I like Dal-Po.

420
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:44,336
No. I mean, as a man...

421
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:48,426
Yeah.

422
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:49,756
As a man.

423
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:54,306
Dad.

424
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:55,696
Dad?

425
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:57,746
He hung up.

426
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:59,166
Did your dad find out?

427
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:01,736
Yeah.

428
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:02,996
How did he find out?

429
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:09,896
I want to see you to tomorrow.

430
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,776
It's a text from my dad, right?
What did he say?

431
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:14,506
He wants to see me tomorrow.

432
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:16,596
I'll meet him.

433
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:18,246
I'll meet him and explain to him.

434
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:19,946
You don't have to worry and...

435
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:29,886
I will meet him
and I will explain to him.

436
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,366
So you don't need to worry.

437
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:37,546
Okay.

438
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:51,356
Are you hot?

439
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:53,596
Yeah, I'm hot to death.

440
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:55,286
Because I'm burning up inside.

441
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:57,966
I'll get straight to the point.

442
00:25:58,326 --> 00:26:00,566
You still can't tell me
about your real family?

443
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,016
I told you before, right?

444
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,046
There is only one reason that I'm uneasy
about you as In-ha's partner.

445
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:10,016
If you tell me about your real family,
I will think it over.

446
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:13,666
Of course it's not that
I'm giving you permission.

447
00:26:13,756 --> 00:26:16,526
I'm just saying that I'll think it over.
Just think.

448
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:19,896
It was just an ordinary family.

449
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:24,096
My father was a civil servant,
and my mother was a housewife.

450
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:26,276
Do you have siblings?

451
00:26:28,406 --> 00:26:29,406
I don't have any.

452
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:30,886
I was an only son.

453
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,166
Both of them passed away
due to an accident.

454
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:35,186
And none of my relatives wanted
to take me in.

455
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,386
That's why I couldn't tell you.

456
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:39,876
I was afraid you'd send me
to my relatives if I told you.

457
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:43,416
Is that all?

458
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,396
Yes, that's all.

459
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:49,926
Alright.

460
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,126
Dal-Po, you know too right?

461
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:54,716
In-ha is...

462
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:55,956
Yes, I know.

463
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:58,646
Since she is your only precious daughter,

464
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,696
she's the prettiest than
anyone in the world.

465
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:03,086
So, you don't want her to get hurt.

466
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:06,136
I also know very well
that you want her to live...

467
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:09,196
unscathed, happily
and be treated preciously.

468
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:10,656
That's right.

469
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,896
As long as you know it.

470
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:14,196
Dal-Po.

471
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:15,826
You have to know that.

472
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:17,726
I really...

473
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:20,756
Really...

474
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:23,066
I should've not compared you but...

475
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:24,666
I really am...

476
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,796
giving up something amazing.

477
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:32,656
You know?

478
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:34,916
Thank you, Sir.

479
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:37,156
Don't smile.

480
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,166
Don't thank me either.

481
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:41,576
I'm not giving you guys permission.

482
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:44,646
I'm still thinking about it.

483
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:47,216
Yes.

484
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:54,506
National Hero, Ki Jae-myung's Video
at U.S. CNN

485
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:58,596
The price of being silent
about my brother was sweet.

486
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,616
My brother was still a hero...

487
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:07,886
and I was still happy.

488
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:10,446
But that happiness...

489
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:14,176
was disappearing so slowly...

490
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:16,536
without me even knowing it.

491
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:18,946
Participants: all trainee reporters
Monday 12/18/1302:00PM

492
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,386
Good night.

493
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:25,226
Ma'am, there's empty room inside, right?

494
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:26,956
The room is all full.

495
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:29,306
Why? I reserved a room.

496
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,446
I'm sorry.

497
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:32,746
We have double booked.

498
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,206
I'll give you free soju instead.

499
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:36,408
I'm not sure.

500
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:39,286
I don't think this is a problem
that can be solved by free soju.

501
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,926
No. It's fine.

502
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:42,516
Let's just eat in the hall.

503
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:44,966
You're here.

504
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:49,576
Okay.

505
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:50,756
Let's have a seat.

506
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:54,936
Viewer rating!

507
00:28:55,136 --> 00:28:56,166
Go go!

508
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:58,126
-Number one!
-No doubt!

509
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:00,876
-MSC!
-Fighting!

510
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,366
Mr Director.

511
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:06,646
We should have a toast first.

512
00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:08,026
Man...

513
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:10,266
That's so tacky. Who toasts these days?

514
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,946
Let's just drink freely.

515
00:29:12,036 --> 00:29:13,166
Have a drink, everyone.

516
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:16,066
My goodness, Director...

517
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:17,896
Okay! Drink all you want.

518
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:19,236
Thanks to Ms Song,

519
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:21,186
I got a very big bonus...

520
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:22,376
-so drink up.
-Drink up.

521
00:29:23,656 --> 00:29:26,046
You know, the viewers
rating jumped as you came.

522
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:29,186
Everyone is asking what your secret is.

523
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:33,616
I'm not sure. Perhaps...

524
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,376
it's good looks?

525
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:36,596
Cheers!

526
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:38,616
I think so too.

527
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:40,016
I agree!

528
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,146
Indeed...

529
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:47,306
The anchor on that side
does have a good visual.

530
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:48,396
Doesn't she?

531
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:50,046
I'm not sure.

532
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,466
I don't see it that way.

533
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,866
I think if the anchor is too good looking

534
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,416
they will lose the credibility and
the focus of the news itself.

535
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:57,556
Of course.

536
00:29:57,786 --> 00:30:01,736
In that regard, I think you are
the most credible anchor in Korea.

537
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:03,676
Let's cheers!

538
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:06,426
Cheers!

539
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:07,846
Everyone, sit down.

540
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:11,376
You guys are killing me twice right now.

541
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:17,196
I heard the subject of
your special lecture

542
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:21,376
is the secret of MSC News viewer ratings.

543
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,866
-Yes.
-Chief.

544
00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:25,886
Shouldn't you leave
the secret as a secret?

545
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:29,766
What do we do if the reporters
from other competitors listen and learn?

546
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:32,806
Isn't it better for us
to learn and grow together?

547
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:35,696
I plan to tell them everything honestly.

548
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,386
It's tomorrow, right?

549
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,496
I'll be there for sure.

550
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:42,286
Mr Director.

551
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:45,126
You did that special lecture
every year, didn't you?

552
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:47,556
He refused since he was busy.

553
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:50,016
That's why they said
the special lecture this time

554
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:52,606
was our director's backup.

555
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:54,376
No wonder...

556
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:57,166
-I knew it. That's case, right?
-Of course.

557
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:59,596
They didn't even contact me this year.

558
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:08,626
Shall we listen to Chief Song's
special lecture tomorrow?

559
00:31:09,446 --> 00:31:12,396
Aren't you curious about that secret?

560
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:13,836
It's fine.

561
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:15,116
Not at all.

562
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:17,706
I don't want to.

563
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:21,366
If the secret is to put unconfirmed affair
of a National Assemblyman

564
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:26,936
as top news and ignoring society issues
to be a sensationalist by making

565
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:28,796
a hero news all week long,

566
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:32,226
I think there's no need to learn that.

567
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:38,046
You're right.

568
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:39,876
I was thoughtless.

569
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:41,752
Okay, then.

570
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:45,161
Let's not be shaken
and just walk our own path.

571
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:48,056
Okay.

572
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,256
Let's cheers.

573
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:51,186
Cheers!

574
00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:54,156
Ma'am...

575
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,496
Give us Beef Brisket please.

576
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,146
-Rib eye, too.
-Cheers!

577
00:31:57,246 --> 00:32:00,576
We'll just keep going with pork belly.

578
00:32:01,176 --> 00:32:02,506
Give us some pork belly!

579
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:10,156
Dal-Po, are you going to come to
my mom's special lecture today?

580
00:32:10,246 --> 00:32:11,246
Yeah.

581
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:13,686
Captain told all trainees
to attend the lecture.

582
00:32:13,776 --> 00:32:16,886
This is your first time seeing my mom
after you became a reporter, right?

583
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:18,586
Yeah.

584
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:23,626
I saw that there's a time
for question and answer.

585
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:25,576
Don't you have anything to say to my mom?

586
00:32:26,786 --> 00:32:28,656
You must have a lot of things
to say to her.

587
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:30,836
I don't have any.

588
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:33,226
That's a lie.

589
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,176
I have a lot of things to say, myself.
How could you not have any?

590
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:38,796
Don't worry about me
and say everything you want.

591
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:40,236
I'm okay with that.

592
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:44,516
Actually, I said everything
I want to you before.

593
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:47,106
To me? When?

594
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:49,136
Don't you remember?

595
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:50,756
At the YGN debate evaluation.

596
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:54,816
That's right.

597
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,386
You think about my mom a lot
whenever you look at me, right?

598
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:03,076
You hate it and get irritated, don't you?

599
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,790
Rather than hating you or get irritated
whenever I look at you...

600
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,056
it's just funny.

601
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:14,446
Hey...

602
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,276
You said it was cute before.

603
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:35,376
Please raise it for me.

604
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,016
Why all of a sudden?

605
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:39,426
Are you moving?

606
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:47,576
Somewhere...

607
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:49,256
afar.

608
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:52,746
Wait a minute.

609
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:54,786
Hello, Seonbae.

610
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,066
Thanks.

611
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:06,366
Let's hurry up.

612
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:17,476
What do you think about Chief Song?

613
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,916
I think she's competent
and a good person.

614
00:34:21,456 --> 00:34:23,706
You want to cherish
and protect her, right?

615
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,396
Excuse me?

616
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:31,706
What are you doing?

617
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:33,916
You're pretty strong.

618
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,386
You must've exercised quite a bit?

619
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:37,436
Can you fight pretty well?

620
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,886
I'm not bad.

621
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:43,886
You know that Ki Jae-myung is resenting
Chief Song quite a bit, don't you?

622
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,066
Yes. Roughly...

623
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:47,616
I think Ki Jae-myung...

624
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,466
might come to the special lecture today.

625
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:51,896
I saw him taking the lecture flyer
a few days ago.

626
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:54,326
I have a bad feeling about it.

627
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:57,586
Honestly, I was so shocked.

628
00:34:57,706 --> 00:34:59,566
It's reasonable that Ki Jae-myung
resents you.

629
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:02,396
No way...

630
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:03,736
So...

631
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:07,486
I plan to follow Ki Jae-myung
around today, but...

632
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:10,856
But?

633
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:14,976
I can't drive.

634
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:32,086
It's amazing.

635
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:34,026
You're pretty well off.

636
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:36,806
Are these your family's cars?

637
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,756
No, these are mine.

638
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:41,386
My mother's cars
are at a different garage.

639
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:46,466
Please get in.

640
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:47,876
Hey.

641
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:51,396
We're going to tail someone. We shouldn't
drive something bright like this.

642
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:53,876
Really?

643
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:55,356
Let's go with this one.

644
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:58,096
I think this one would
be quiet and bland.

645
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:10,216
Fact and Impact,
The secret of MSC News Ratings

646
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:13,766
Ki Jae-myung, protect me

647
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:14,893
Your father's wrongful death...

648
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,643
He's really more popular than an idol.

649
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,656
Did those kids are waiting to
get his autograph on this cold day?

650
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:22,206
I think so.

651
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:24,046
He came out.

652
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:26,916
Oppa! Oppa!

653
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:28,866
Please take a picture with me.

654
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,486
Are you sure he's a dangerous person?

655
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:37,826
He's not impressing a person
who can harm people.

656
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,546
You're not impressing...

657
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:41,486
a son of conglomerate either.

658
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:46,426
You saw it together with me that day.

659
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:49,496
That man risked his life to save someone.

660
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:52,376
If you think about it,
you and I are the ones...

661
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:54,696
who made him a hero.

662
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,426
This is a dangerous suspicion.

663
00:36:57,986 --> 00:36:59,386
What you and I saw that day...

664
00:36:59,476 --> 00:37:01,696
wasn't even one tenth
of that person's life.

665
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:06,736
I think it's more dangerous to judge
that man with that 10 minutes.

666
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,146
He's leaving.

667
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:12,696
-Hurry up and follow him.
-Yes.

668
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,886
Yes, Sir. It's me.

669
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:40,966
I have one more thing...

670
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:44,206
to ask of you.

671
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,111
I'll come see you again

672
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:03,544
after I find out properly
what a reporter is.

673
00:38:09,576 --> 00:38:10,626
It's been a long time.

674
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,216
Did you say you were Choi Dal-Po?

675
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,586
I was wondering how a taxi driver
can become a reporter.

676
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:21,876
You really did it.

677
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:24,386
That's surprising.

678
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:27,596
If my memory is right,

679
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:31,646
you asked me why a Pinocchio
can't become a reporter, right?

680
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:35,346
And when you became a reporter,
you'll come looking for me.

681
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:37,886
You said you'll become a wolf
and growl at me.

682
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:40,606
Is that day today?

683
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:52,526
There's still time
before the lecture starts.

684
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:54,706
Try and growl at me.

685
00:38:54,956 --> 00:38:55,956
I'll hear you out.

686
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:11,386
I didn't come here to growl at you.

687
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:13,026
I came to learn.

688
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,836
Please teach me a lot.

689
00:39:30,026 --> 00:39:31,516
Fact and Impact

690
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,416
Hi.

691
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:36,916
Hey, what's that?

692
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:39,026
Why are you wearing company jacket here?

693
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:43,186
Yeah. When I listen to the lecture and
feel that she's showing off too much,

694
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,176
I plan to attack her
as a representative of YGN.

695
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:50,506
Hey, did you become a sworn enemy
of Anchor Song Cha-ok something?

696
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:53,786
Yeah. She's the one who failed me
at MSC final interview.

697
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:55,996
I'll attack her like a washcloth today.

698
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:58,096
Rough and refreshingly.

699
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:03,036
Ah, right.

700
00:40:04,306 --> 00:40:05,726
She is your mom but I'm sorry.

701
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,626
Do it to your heart's content.

702
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:09,986
I'll be looking forward to it.

703
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:13,216
Yeah.

704
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:20,266
I thought he would've forgotten
since the incident happened 13 years ago.

705
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:21,586
But that day...

706
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:24,266
the way he looked
at Choi In-ha was suspicious.

707
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,726
It was eerie that he even confirmed
that she was...

708
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:29,076
Song Cha-ok's daughter.

709
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:32,136
Then, if what you say is true...

710
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:34,976
he might target not just Chief Song...

711
00:40:36,106 --> 00:40:37,876
but Choi In-ha as well.

712
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:39,496
Maybe...

713
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:01,526
Chief.

714
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:05,316
Nitpicker. Why are you...

715
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:10,486
Mr Director.

716
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:13,456
You guys...

717
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:17,686
Hey.

718
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:19,186
Even you, Hwang Gyo-dong?

719
00:41:24,116 --> 00:41:25,116
I just came by...

720
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:27,216
when I was passing the street.

721
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:28,306
Just came by.

722
00:41:49,906 --> 00:41:50,956
Hello, everyone.

723
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:54,746
I'm the Head of MSC Local News
Department and MSC News Times anchor,

724
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:56,226
Song Cha-ok.

725
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:57,476
I'm a fan of you!

726
00:42:04,616 --> 00:42:05,616
Thank you.

727
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:10,506
The topic of my lecture today
is "Fact and Impact".

728
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,106
It's also the secret of how MSC news took
number one spot in viewer ratings

729
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:15,466
at its current air time.

730
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:17,636
Since we have a lot
of reporters attending,

731
00:42:17,726 --> 00:42:22,276
let's put aside words like
“coverage ethics” or “sense of duty”

732
00:42:22,646 --> 00:42:25,156
and talk honestly and frankly.

733
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:26,246
So arrogant.

734
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:32,246
A reporter asked me
what kind of man I like.

735
00:42:32,406 --> 00:42:34,196
So I answered.

736
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:36,596
I said, "I like a tall man."

737
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:42,240
Next day that reporter
titled his news like this,

738
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:45,376
"Reporter Song Cha-ok Likes A Tall Man."

739
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:47,736
This is a news made with facts.

740
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,126
It's not that interesting, right?

741
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:50,216
Then...

742
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:52,936
what if I changed it like this?

743
00:42:53,186 --> 00:42:55,626
"Reporter Song Cha-ok
Doesn't Like Short Men."

744
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:03,086
If you look at these two headline, which
news would you be more attracted in?

745
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:04,486
The second one.

746
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,516
Yes.

747
00:43:06,946 --> 00:43:08,596
That's most people's characteristics.

748
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:11,866
They're more attracted to stories that
attack someone rather than praising.

749
00:43:14,996 --> 00:43:17,636
But that doesn't mean
that the second one isn't fact.

750
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:19,666
Because liking tall men means...

751
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:23,416
that I don't like short men
compared to tall men.

752
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:25,528
To grab the attention of the public,

753
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,012
in news as well,
you have to add the impact

754
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:29,346
to the fact, like this.

755
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:34,046
An impact...

756
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:37,386
She has a point.

757
00:43:38,006 --> 00:43:39,286
-Mr Director.
-Mr Director...

758
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:41,176
Do you want to do that too?

759
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:43,306
No.

760
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:44,656
Okay.

761
00:43:44,746 --> 00:43:46,606
Now should we have another example?

762
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,518
Some time ago,

763
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:51,383
the police spread PR material saying
that the hit and run prosecution rate

764
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:52,956
has broke through 93 percent.

765
00:43:53,186 --> 00:43:57,326
Each TV stations made news
with this PR material like this.

766
00:43:58,546 --> 00:43:59,656
Hit and Run Rate Almost 100%

767
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:00,976
Hit and Run Rate Achieve 93%

768
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:02,816
Hit and Run Rate Reach 93%

769
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:08,536
These news were made exactly
the same as PR material.

770
00:44:09,086 --> 00:44:11,086
Those news have neither taste,
nor attraction.

771
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,266
What the...

772
00:44:13,196 --> 00:44:14,386
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

773
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:16,326
Let's just listen.

774
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:18,826
She captured him with eyes closed
on purpose.

775
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,976
-She's a completely annoying.
-Okay.

776
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:26,176
Then, how would you make the title
if you want to make an impact?

777
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:29,816
Unprosecuted hit and run cases
are over seven percent?

778
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:34,876
Yes. That's a good start.

779
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:39,976
By changing the idea a little like this,
it can become news with more impact.

780
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,316
It set you apart from other stations and
it also has an effect of an exclusive.

781
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:44,796
This news actually

782
00:44:44,886 --> 00:44:49,426
had higher viewers rating than other
hit and run prosecution rate news.

783
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:03,506
I think he's going to take the highway.

784
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:05,666
What do we do if he goes
all the way to Busan?

785
00:45:06,116 --> 00:45:08,886
We have to follow him
even if he goes to Busan.

786
00:45:14,676 --> 00:45:16,326
When we make news these days,

787
00:45:16,436 --> 00:45:19,266
there isn't any chance of success
with just truth as ingredients.

788
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:21,376
It needs more seasoning.

789
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:24,256
But you can't take away the taste
of the ingredient, since...

790
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,696
that wouldn't be a news.

791
00:45:26,576 --> 00:45:28,176
It's the age of sympathy these days.

792
00:45:28,596 --> 00:45:31,636
The news also has to bring sympathy
to have a chance of success.

793
00:45:32,156 --> 00:45:36,276
You can make a news that wins
more sympathy from viewers...

794
00:45:36,676 --> 00:45:39,516
if you add the seasoning called
impact to the ingredient...

795
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:40,876
called truth.

796
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,006
You're kidding me.

797
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:43,866
Hey, don't be so coward.

798
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:45,386
Ask her a proper question.

799
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:48,036
Let's stop the lecture here

800
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:49,846
and have some time
for question and answer.

801
00:45:49,936 --> 00:45:50,936
Hey, this is it.

802
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:52,196
Try it.

803
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,496
A question like a washcloth.

804
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:55,926
Yeah.

805
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:02,546
Yes. You're a reporter from YGN.

806
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:08,636
I'm YGN trainee reporter, Yoon Yoo-Rae.

807
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:12,046
Yes. I hope you have a question
that has an impact.

808
00:46:13,926 --> 00:46:17,236
I heard that an anchor
who delivers facts has deceit in her face.

809
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:21,606
I heard that you have no expression like
an ice witch because of Botox side effect.

810
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,696
Is that true?

811
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:28,826
What's wrong with her?

812
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:30,866
It's embarrassing.

813
00:46:30,976 --> 00:46:33,016
She should've at least taken off
her jacket before asking.

814
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:34,176
Why?

815
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:36,186
It feels quite gratifying.

816
00:46:38,026 --> 00:46:39,126
Okay, everyone.

817
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:41,866
Please applaud Reporter Yoon Yoo-Rae.

818
00:46:48,796 --> 00:46:51,136
I'll first show you the answer.

819
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:04,136
That's exactly an example of question
that has no fact or impact.

820
00:47:04,226 --> 00:47:05,766
It was a perfect example.

821
00:47:05,936 --> 00:47:06,936
Thank you.

822
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:09,386
-As expected.
-She is indeed our Chief.

823
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:11,206
She's so relaxed.

824
00:47:15,556 --> 00:47:16,556
It's so embarrassing.

825
00:47:16,816 --> 00:47:17,856
That cold witch.

826
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:20,456
Okay. Another question?

827
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:23,836
Okay.

828
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:26,036
Are there any more questions?

829
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:32,366
There are even less questions than the
students attending my lecture before. Why?

830
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:36,766
Indeed.

831
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:40,226
If you don't know what a reporter is,
it might be easy to criticize.

832
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,696
But if you know what a reporter is,

833
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:44,476
it's not easy to recklessly
criticize or growl.

834
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:45,896
Is it?

835
00:48:02,126 --> 00:48:03,126
I have a question.

836
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:14,086
I'm MSC trainee reporter, Choi In-ha.

837
00:48:14,906 --> 00:48:16,946
Did you ever have
any experience of ignoring

838
00:48:17,036 --> 00:48:19,079
the facts because you were so blinded
by making an impact?

839
00:48:28,236 --> 00:48:29,236
No, I haven't.

840
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:32,806
Yes. I understand.

841
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:39,856
She's hiccuping.

842
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,646
I'm sorry but I'm hiccuping.

843
00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:51,266
I must not be able to understand
Reporter Song's answer.

844
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,766
Hey, Choi In-ha.

845
00:48:57,046 --> 00:48:58,476
What are you doing? That's childish.

846
00:49:04,536 --> 00:49:07,716
The Reporter Song I know clearly
has that kind of experience.

847
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:11,886
You remember the case of Ki Ho-sang
from 13 years ago, don't you?

848
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,376
What did she do?
Did she just diss her mom?

849
00:49:20,876 --> 00:49:23,776
At that time, you ignored the probability
of Ki Ho-sang died with his boots on

850
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:25,910
and the first to report
that he's a shameless guy

851
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,104
who abandoned his co-workers.

852
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,546
To have the whole nation point their anger
toward Ki Ho-Sang's family,

853
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,916
you edited the family interview
provocatively.

854
00:49:34,316 --> 00:49:35,316
As a result,

855
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:38,706
his wife was so isolated
that she couldn't even go to the market.

856
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,086
On the day that the whole family
supposed to go see the fireworks,

857
00:49:42,926 --> 00:49:45,606
they had to make a drastic decision
to end their own lives.

858
00:49:46,646 --> 00:49:50,886
It was an example of how dangerous news
with just impact but no fact can be.

859
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:02,316
That case...

860
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:05,376
isn't something
that I've done wrong personally.

861
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:07,406
If you must argue,

862
00:50:07,576 --> 00:50:11,566
the problem was the Pinocchio witness
mistakenly saw a person and testified.

863
00:50:12,496 --> 00:50:14,386
All I did was to believe that testimony.

864
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:19,376
I think the fact that what the Pinocchio
witness saw was a delusion,

865
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,386
is this tragedy's biggest cause.

866
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:24,246
And that the police, prosecution

867
00:50:24,446 --> 00:50:27,046
and reporters, believed that
eyewitness account was the problem.

868
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:37,136
Some one told me...

869
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:41,376
that the people think
that Pinocchio only tell the truth.

870
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:45,376
People think that Pinocchio
only tell the truth.

871
00:50:48,996 --> 00:50:50,016
And the people think...

872
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,876
that reporters only deliver
the truth, as well.

873
00:50:53,696 --> 00:50:57,296
And people think that reporters
only deliver the truth like the Pinocchio.

874
00:50:57,926 --> 00:50:59,426
Pinocchio and reporters...

875
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:01,186
...should've known that.

876
00:51:01,876 --> 00:51:04,616
That people believe what they say
unconditionally. That's why...

877
00:51:05,216 --> 00:51:08,246
they should've known that their words
are scarier than the words of others.

878
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:11,536
They should've known that their words
are scarier than the words of others.

879
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:15,086
It's your fault for not knowing that.

880
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:16,386
That negligence...

881
00:51:17,216 --> 00:51:18,776
has destroyed a family.

882
00:51:20,726 --> 00:51:23,886
So of course, you also have
a responsibility in this tragedy.

883
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:38,376
Seeing you still talk about impact after
experiencing that tragedy 13 years ago...

884
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:43,126
you're still the same person
from 13 years ago.

885
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:45,266
A trash reporter.

886
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,716
Choi In-ha.

887
00:52:00,886 --> 00:52:02,386
She's such a hero.

888
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,186
I admit you.

889
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:05,416
She's embarrassing.

890
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,886
I might get disciplinary
before I finish trainee period, right?

891
00:52:31,976 --> 00:52:32,976
Will I get fired?

892
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:35,016
I'm not sure.

893
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:38,776
If I get fired,
do you think YGN will take me?

894
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:41,106
I don't think so.

895
00:52:42,116 --> 00:52:43,376
What a hard-nosed man.

896
00:52:46,346 --> 00:52:47,346
Why did you do it?

897
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:48,996
I was enduring well.

898
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:53,756
It's because you seem to endure it.

899
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:56,896
It felt like I was going to start
hiccuping if I let it go.

900
00:53:00,256 --> 00:53:01,256
Are you alright?

901
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,406
Aren't you worried about your mother?

902
00:53:17,076 --> 00:53:18,076
Answer me.

903
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:19,696
Are you alright?

904
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:26,706
Honestly, I want to say
that I'm alright but I can't.

905
00:53:27,626 --> 00:53:30,826
She's so bad and I hate her to the point
that I can't even believe she's my mom.

906
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:34,556
But I still worried since she's my mom.

907
00:53:36,486 --> 00:53:38,596
But if I say that you're going to worry
about me.

908
00:53:38,906 --> 00:53:40,126
I don't like that even more.

909
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:41,666
Don't worry about me.

910
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:43,566
I want you to say what you want to mom,

911
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,556
and ask her what you need to ask.

912
00:53:58,066 --> 00:53:59,066
Chief.

913
00:53:59,456 --> 00:54:00,666
You're alright, aren't you?

914
00:54:03,686 --> 00:54:04,686
Are you asking me...

915
00:54:06,186 --> 00:54:07,876
that question right now?

916
00:54:08,476 --> 00:54:09,476
No.

917
00:54:09,886 --> 00:54:10,886
It's not.

918
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:11,976
Of course not.

919
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:13,936
I'm sorry.

920
00:54:35,586 --> 00:54:37,696
The words that Choi In-ha said earlier...

921
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,506
Don't you think we heard
that many times somewhere?

922
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:43,576
I'm not sure.
I think I've never heard of that.

923
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:45,386
Yes. I heard it somewhere.

924
00:54:45,686 --> 00:54:47,656
You know, at the debate interview

925
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,876
that was what Choi Dal-Po
says to Choi In-ha.

926
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:52,736
-Yeah, right.
-It was that time.

927
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:54,636
-While we see that case...
-Yes.

928
00:54:55,256 --> 00:54:56,256
What case?

929
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:57,536
By the way...

930
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,776
Why did she say that to Chief Song
when it refers to her?

931
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:00,866
I know.

932
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:03,036
The person who need to hear
finally heard it.

933
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:06,676
Those words went around
and finally found their owner.

934
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:08,266
Who's the owner?

935
00:55:08,476 --> 00:55:09,876
Is that so?

936
00:55:10,366 --> 00:55:11,376
Excuse me...

937
00:55:12,796 --> 00:55:15,926
Sir... don't you guys hear me?

938
00:55:16,626 --> 00:55:17,626
Do you...?

939
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:20,896
It's me. Nitpicker Jang!

940
00:55:21,436 --> 00:55:23,386
How could you do that to me...?

941
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:33,556
I thought my bladder was going to explode.

942
00:55:33,646 --> 00:55:34,646
He finally stopped.

943
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:36,046
I know.

944
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:41,966
Seonbae...

945
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:44,606
-What?
-That man is not Ki Jae-myung.

946
00:55:44,856 --> 00:55:45,856
What?

947
00:55:49,736 --> 00:55:50,736
Excuse me.

948
00:55:53,056 --> 00:55:54,056
Yes?

949
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:56,516
Wasn't Ki Jae-myung driving
this truck a while ago?

950
00:55:58,446 --> 00:55:59,446
Yes.

951
00:55:59,616 --> 00:56:00,616
He is but...

952
00:56:00,756 --> 00:56:01,966
-What is this about?
-Sir...

953
00:56:02,686 --> 00:56:03,886
Where did Ki Jae-myung go?

954
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:05,906
I didn't know.

955
00:56:06,386 --> 00:56:07,586
He said that...

956
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,176
he had somewhere to go
urgently a while ago.

957
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,576
He asked me to do this instead.

958
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:14,806
Where is it?

959
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:19,556
Yeah, what?

960
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:21,626
-Where are you now?
-In front of your TV station.

961
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:24,176
Find out where In-ha and
Reporter Song Cha-ok is immediately.

962
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:26,196
Ki Jae-myung is there now.

963
00:56:26,736 --> 00:56:28,596
What? What do you mean?

964
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:31,096
There was a rumor that Ki Jae-myung
will go to the lecture today.

965
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:32,626
So I've been tailing him until now.

966
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:34,906
But we lost him somehow and disappeared.

967
00:56:35,356 --> 00:56:37,666
He definitely went there.

968
00:56:38,986 --> 00:56:39,986
What the...?

969
00:57:16,196 --> 00:57:17,196
No way...

970
00:57:17,576 --> 00:57:18,576
Hyung.

971
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:39,496
Yeah, Dal-Po. What is it?

972
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:43,906
In-ha.

973
00:57:43,996 --> 00:57:44,996
Choi In-ha!

974
00:57:46,626 --> 00:57:47,626
Choi In-ha!

975
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:51,376
-How did you know that?
-Pardon me?

976
00:57:51,716 --> 00:57:53,436
The fireworks promise I made
with my father.

977
00:57:53,526 --> 00:57:55,676
My mother who couldn't buy anything
from the market.

978
00:57:55,968 --> 00:57:56,971
How did you know that?

979
00:57:57,062 --> 00:57:58,662
No one but my family knows that.

980
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:00,736
That's...

981
00:58:02,196 --> 00:58:03,196
I can't tell you.

982
00:58:04,926 --> 00:58:05,926
Tell me.

983
00:58:06,036 --> 00:58:07,426
Just who did you hear that from?

984
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:14,726
Are you okay?

985
00:58:15,006 --> 00:58:16,006
Yeah.

986
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:20,626
Get out of my way!

987
00:58:25,696 --> 00:58:26,696
Hyung.

988
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:27,796
Hyung, please.

989
00:58:28,236 --> 00:58:29,766
I told you not to call me that.

990
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:34,566
It's me, Hyung.

991
00:58:35,976 --> 00:58:36,976
It's me, Ha-myung.

992
00:58:38,206 --> 00:58:39,206
What?

993
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:41,726
Dal-Po...

994
00:58:45,336 --> 00:58:46,386
I'm your brother...

995
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:48,956
Ki Ha-myung.

996
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:09,606
Ha-myung died.

997
00:59:09,816 --> 00:59:11,806
He died because of reporters like you!

998
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:12,936
You said when father back...

999
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:15,876
we'd go see the fireworks
and it will all be like before.

1000
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:17,116
You said you'd guarantee it.

1001
00:59:17,306 --> 00:59:19,046
Who is the culprit?

1002
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:20,936
Ki Jae-myung.

1003
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:22,106
Ki Jae-myung is my brother.

1004
00:59:22,196 --> 00:59:25,156
Ki Jae-myung thought that
the image portrayed by the media

1005
00:59:25,246 --> 00:59:26,496
wasn't his true self.

1006
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,266
-Dal-Po.
-YGN News...

1007
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:33,406
Ki Ha-myung reported.
